   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to commend the chairman of the Finance Committee for his bipartisan efforts which resulted in the passage of section 1425 of H.R. 4868, the Miscellaneous Tariff Act. This section is intended to address an unfortunate situation involving the imposition of antidumping duties on a number of entries of conveyor chain from Japan. At the time of these entries, the applicable antidumping duty cash deposit rate was 0 percent. As a result, no cash deposits were made on these entries by the U.S. importer. Through no fault of the U.S. Customs Service, the antidumping duties and interest subsequently imposed when these entries were liquidated as a result of the Department of Commerce administrative review process now represents a severe and unanticipated hardship on the U.S. importer, Drives, Inc., based in Fulton, Illinois. This legislation is intended to address this situation by having the Customs Service reliquidate the entries at the antidumping duty cash deposit rate in effect at the time of entry.

   Mr. DURBIN. That is correct. In accordance with this legislation, the identified entries will be re-liquidated with no antidumping duties assessed. Moreover, no interest charges which relate in any way to antidumping duties will be assessed. Since the deposit rate at the time of entry of all of the identified entries was 0 percent, this will have the effect of liquidating the entries at the cash deposit rate in effect at the time of entry.

   Mr. DURBIN. The senior Senator from Delaware is correct. There was a mistake made in drafting the language. Regardless, the intent of the original legislation, and the intent that can still be interpreted from the law as enacted, is to have the Customs Service re-liquidate the entries at the antidumping duty cash deposit rate in effect at the time of entry. I thank the Senator from Delaware for his guidance and appreciate working with him on a bipartisan basis.

    Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize John Rednour, who has recently been named the millennium ``Outstanding Citizen of the Year'' by the Du Quoin Chamber of Commerce. 
   John Rednour has been a friend of mine for over thirty years. His life story is a fascinating tale of humble origins, a great family, hard work, and success. When others might have relaxed or retired, John and his life's partner Wanda continue to give to others every day. John's record as Mayor of Du Quoin is proof positive of his commitment to public service. 
   John Rednour has served as the Mayor of the City of Du Quoin, Illinois, for the past 11 1/2 years, and his contributions to the city during his tenure have been outstanding. His hard work and dedication have had a tremendous impact on the city and its people, and it is only fitting that he be singled out for the City of Du Quoin Chamber of Commerce's highest honor. 
   During his time as Mayor, John Rednour has been instrumental in building new public facilities, including a city hall, library, and police department. These are just the beginning of the list of accomplishments in which Mayor Rednour has played the leading role. The strengthening of the infrastructure through water and sewer improvements may be among the less glamorous projects he has undertaken, but they are very important to Du Quoin. Over the years Mayor Rednour assured the safety of the community by fully staffing the Du Quoin police and fire departments. Also, during his administration, for the first time in the history of the 150-year-old city, Du Quoin has secured city wide fire protection. 
   John Rednour has also greatly increased the economic vitality of a city that is proud of its mayor. One of the ways in which he was able to boost its economic status was through the construction of the Du Quoin Industrial Park, completed with the aid of the Chamber of Commerce. Over the years, he has also helped to attract numerous businesses to the city, resulting in new jobs to the area. His actions have contributed to a fully staffed tourism commission that has helped to give Du Quoin a firm footing in the tourism industry in Southern Illinois. Mayor Rednour has helped Du Quoin through his ability to gain access to state and federal funding, which has helped the city to complete many of these important projects during his administration. His vision is transforming Du Quoin into a 21st century city. 
   In closing, Mr. President, all of these achievements, and many more, are the fruits of the labor of John Rednour. His dedication to his job as Mayor and to his city have made his administration a great success. I applaud John Rednour for his achievements and his many successful efforts to improve the quality of life for the citizens of Du Quoin.

    Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the extraordinary contributions of Allan W. ``Buck'' Witte to the people of Adams County, Illinois, and to congratulate him on his recent retirement. 
   One week ago, Al Witte quietly retired as Adams County Treasurer, a post he had held since 1992. But his public service contributions extend far beyond the treasurer's office. Al spent three years on the Adams County Board, winning a district in 1990 that, quite frankly, he wasn't supposed to win. 
   During his tenure on the County Board and in the treasurer's office, he became one of the most popular public servants in Adams County, drawing the largest vote totals of any county official. He followed in the footsteps of his late father, Art Witte, a hard working Adams County Clerk, who dedicated himself to a lifetime of public service. 
   Prior to his tenure on the Adams County Board and his service as Treasurer, Al worked for 30 years at Gardner-Denver in industrial engineering, retiring from that post in 1989. 
   Anyone who knows Al is aware of his strong support for the Democratic Party, an unyielding loyalty that ensured he was the first phone call made by any Democratic politician arranging a visit to Adams County. Although at times a fierce partisan, he kept winning elections by appealing to Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. He was a true bridge builder and an effective county and party official. 
   Mr. President, I have had the honor of working with Al Witte for most of this past decade, including when I represented Adams County and Quincy in the U.S. House of Representatives. I have always been taken by his dedication, loyalty, and commitment to public service. His will be incredibly big shoes to fill. 
   In closing, Mr. President, I applaud Al for his commitment and his efforts to improve the quality of life in Adams County, Illinois. I send my best wishes to Al for a happy and healthy retirement that allows him to spend a great deal of time with his wife, Mary, his children, and his grandchildren. We'll miss Buck, but will take comfort in the fact that he is only a phone call away.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to make available to all of our constituents the same range of private health insurance plans available to Members of Congress and other federal employees through the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, FEHBP. 
   The OPTION Act--Offering People True Insurance Options Nationwide--would expand insurance options by allowing individuals to enroll in private health insurance plans nearly identical to the plans federal employees currently choose from. Though the OPTION program would be separate from the federal employees program, it would be modeled after FEHBP and would draw from FEHBP's strengths: plan choice, group purchasing savings, comprehensive benefits, and open enrollment periods. 
   Too many Americans do not have real insurance options. Many individuals lack insurance because no insurer is willing to cover them at a reasonable price. Others work for employers who do not provide health insurance or offer only one insurance provider. The OPTION Act addresses these issues by giving individuals and businesses access to the group purchasing power that undergirds FEHBP and the wide range of health plans in that program. 
   Under this legislation, all FEHBP health plans would be required to offer an OPTION health plan to non-federal employees with the same benefits they offer federal employees through FEHBP. 
   OPTION enrollees would be placed in a separate risk pool, to prevent any effect on current FEHBP employees, and the OPTION Act would not result in any changes in the premiums or benefits of today's FEHBP health plans. 
   One of the few differences from FEHBP is that OPTION plans would be allowed to vary premiums by age, so that younger enrollees would be more likely to enroll. OPTION plans also would be required to offer rebates or lower premiums for longevity of health coverage. These provisions would act as an incentive for people to sign up when they are young and to maintain continuous coverage. 
   OPTION health plans would not be allowed to impose any preexisting condition exclusions on new OPTION enrollees who have at least one year of health insurance coverage immediately prior to enrollment in an OPTION plan. To prevent people from waiting until they get sick to enroll, health plans would be allowed to exclude coverage for preexisting conditions for up to one year for people without coverage immediately preceding enrollment. 
   All employers would have the option of voluntarily participating in the OPTION program and providing OPTION health plans to their employees. To be eligible, a business would have to be willing to pay at least a minimum percentage of the premiums, varying from 30 percent to 50 percent depending on the size of the business. This innovative employer option would encourage employer health coverage rather than shifting coverage away from the private sector. I want to emphasize that employer participation would be entirely voluntary. 
   Opening up these health plans to employers would give small businesses a new opportunity to provide health coverage to their employees. Premiums in today's market can be especially high for small businesses buying insurance on their own. The OPTION program will allow businesses to tap into the type of group buying power in the federal employees program. 
   Premiums would not be government-subsidized and would instead be the responsibility of the participating enrollees and those employers who choose to participate. 
   Mr. President, I support efforts to provide financial assistance to those who cannot afford health insurance and I have offered other pieces of legislation to provide that assistance. We need to address the fact that 42.6 million Americans, including 1.7 million Illinoisans, currently lack health insurance--up nearly 25 percent from the 34.4 million in 1990. However, I am offering this measure on its own to focus specifically on expanding health coverage options and encouraging businesses to provide coverage. No one should be living just a serious accident or major illness away from financial ruin. Making more insurance options available to a greater number of people in this country is a good first step toward universal coverage. 
   The OPTION program would be administered by the Office of Personnel Management, OPM, which administers the FEHBP program, and would generally follow the rules for FEHBP. OPM has developed considerable expertise in negotiating and working with health plans and has shown that it can run a health program well at a minimum of cost. We can build on OPM's expertise to extend the same health insurance options to all Americans. 
   Finally, once it is up and running, the program would pay for itself. Administrative costs would be covered from a portion of the OPTION premiums. Those who benefit from the program would pay for its overhead costs. 
   Mr. President, this legislation could open the door for many Americans to obtain good health insurance coverage. I am introducing it at this late point in the session so that it can stimulate discussion over the next few months. I will reintroduce the measure next year. I welcome the input and support of my colleagues and hope the Senate will work next year to reduce the number of uninsured Americans and expand insurance options.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to exclude tobacco from the Extraterritorial Income Exclusion tax benefit, which has replaced the Foreign Sales Corporation tax benefit. 
   This tax provision provides tax benefits to a variety of companies, including many in Illinois, and I understand how important it is to them. But one product should be clearly, in law, excluded from this benefit, and it is the one product which kills its user when used according to the manufacturer's directions--tobacco. 
   The FSC replacement law already contains several exclusions from its benefits. Oil, gas, and other primary products are excluded to help ensure that natural resources in the United States are not depleted. 
   Unprocessed timber is excluded in order to ensure no displacement of U.S. jobs. 
   The law also excludes certain products in order to promote congruence with other federal government policies. For example, there are exclusions relating to items subject to the Export Administration Act, which prohibits or severely restricts export of certain civilian goods and technology that have military applications. Similarly, we should not be subsidizing tobacco products that are sold overseas while at the same time trying to cut smoking rates in the U.S. Our trade and health priorities should be on the same page. 
   The biggest tobacco companies in America currently benefit handsomely from the Foreign Sales Corporation tax break and will benefit from the Extraterritorial Income Exclusion tax break. The latest available data from the Statistics of Income Division at the Internal Revenue Service show tobacco products sold through 10 Foreign Sales Corporations for domestic tobacco manufacturers accounted for about $100 million in lost tax revenue in 1996. There is no justification for compelling American taxpayers to support a $100 million tax subsidy annually for the benefit of U.S. tobacco companies. 
   Since 1990, while Philip Morris's sales have grown minimally in the U.S., they have grown by 80 percent abroad. Smoking currently causes more than 3.5 million deaths each year throughout the world. Within 20 years, that number is expected to rise to 10 million, with 70 percent of all deaths from smoking occurring in developing countries. Tobacco will soon be the leading cause of disease and premature death worldwide--surpassing communicable diseases such as AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. 
   American taxpayers should not be partners in this export of disease and death where the result is more children around the globe smoking and more people getting sick and dying. 
   While it is true that tobacco companies are not receiving any special treatment that other corporations don't get under the old FSC law or its recent replacement, we must remember that tobacco companies are not like any other company. Internal tobacco industry documents have established that, starting as early as the 1950s, cigarette companies intentionally withheld information about smoking, including scientific research about its risks; made false and misleading statements about the harm of tobacco products; attacked research findings despite knowing that the research was valid; failed to take steps to make their products safer; and marketed their products to children and youth. 
   As a matter of fact, Philip Morris recently posted a statement on its website agreeing that smoking is harmful to your health and that there is no such thing as a safe or safer cigarette. The statement says, ``We agree with the overwhelming medical and scientific consensus that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema and other serious diseases in smokers. Smokers are far more likely to develop serious diseases, like lung cancer, than non-smokers. There is no `safe' cigarette. These are and have been the messages of public health authorities worldwide. Smokers and potential smokers should rely on these messages in making all smoking-related decisions.'' 
   It is about time that the tobacco companies faced up to the fact that their products are harmful and highly addictive. In the U.S. alone, smoking causes more than 400,000 deaths and costs more than $72 billion in health care costs every year. 
   We should not be subsidizing such an inherently dangerous product that is being promoted and marketed so irresponsibly here and around the world. With its devastating health effects, tobacco should not enjoy the same taxpayer-subsidized federal assistance as other products. 
   It's time to take another step toward bringing our nation's tax and trade priorities in line with our clear understanding of the health dangers of tobacco. My legislation simply adds one additional category to the list of products excluded from the special tax treatment in the FSC Repeal and Extraterritorial Income Exclusion Act of 2000, which was recently signed into law by the President. It shifts tobacco from being promoted by this tax benefit to being excluded from this tax benefit. 
   In my legislation, tobacco is defined as it is defined in Section 5702(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, so it includes cigars, cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, and pipe tobacco. It does not apply to raw tobacco, so this legislation will not affect tobacco farmers' ability to sell their product abroad. 
   Is it fair to exclude a legal product from this tax benefit? Absolutely! Tobacco companies spend over $5 billion each year--that's nearly $14 million every day--in the U.S. alone to promote their products in order to replace the thousands of customers who either die or quit using tobacco products each day. In other countries, U.S. tobacco companies advertise their products near schools and in video-game arcades. They also use children in other countries to peddle their products. Street lights with the Camel logo have been installed in Bucharest, Romania. Toy cars with the Camel insignia are sold to children in Buenos Aires. Children's tatoos sporting the Salem logo are distributed in Hong Kong. Arcade games in the Philippines are plastered with the Marlboro label. 
   I urge my colleagues to send a message to U.S. tobacco companies as well as the next Administration to take the logical next step and make changes in the way tobacco products are sold and regulated to reflect the magnitude of the danger. 
   The tobacco prevention agenda has been stalled in this Congress for far too  long. Let's work together, in a bipartisan fashion, to stop marketing tobacco products to children, to regulate tobacco products in a sensible way, and to adopt larger and clearer warning labels commensurate with the risks of tobacco products. Let's take a close look at all the forms of tobacco, including the new fad of bidis and the resurgent use of cigars. They all have addictive levels of nicotine and deadly levels of carcinogens. It's time to put people's health ahead of tobacco company profits. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this important legislation, to end the contradiction of using the tax code to continue to enrich U.S. tobacco companies, which export products that addict children abroad to nicotine and push them down a path to disease and death. 
   I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation be printed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to associate myself with the remarks of the Senator from New Jersey, paying tribute to colleagues on both sides of the aisle who for a variety of reasons are leaving this institution. 
   I think it goes without saying that those of us who have been involved in putting ourselves in battles for elections understand that it takes some courage and maybe some foolhardiness to put your name on a ballot and submit your fate to the neighbors and friends with whom you live. Those leaving this institution have done that time and again. I respect them. Although we disagree on issues and on philosophy, we respect them so much for the courage they have shown and for their dedication to public service. 
   One of the most important lessons I ever learned in politics was my first one. I was a college intern on Capitol Hill working in the office of the U.S. Senator, Paul Douglas. I had no sooner met the man in February than I fell in love with this life and decided to work in Government. A few short months later, he lost his election in an effort to be reelected to the State of Illinois. 
   It really came crashing down on me--that a man who served for 18 years, because of the decision of the electorate, could see his political career come to an end that bluntly. 
   A constant reminder in my public life is the fact that this is a fickle business, and no one can ever take for granted the next election. But I believe that the men and women who have served have done so honorably, and I salute those on both sides who will not be with us in the next Congress. 
   I say on a positive note that we had our organizational caucus of the Democratic Senators a few days ago in the Old Senate Chamber. We had a chance for each of the 10 new Democratic Senators to stand and speak for a moment about their feelings concerning their elections and service in the Senate. One word that was used most frequently by these new Senators was ``humility''--how humbled they were to be part of this institution. 
   I have always felt that. I think it is such an exceptional responsibility but also an exceptional privilege to serve in this great body. 
   I have believed that representing a State as diverse and interesting as Illinois gives a special meaning. 
   The new Senators coming on both sides of the aisle will add something to this Chamber, as each new class of Senators does. I hope before we begin anticipating the next Congress and what it might mean, we take care of the business of this Congress.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, 5 weeks ago, on November 1, I held a news conference with my colleague from Illinois, Congressman RAY LAHOOD, on the subject of the electoral college. I always preface my remarks on this issue by reminding people that that was before the November 7 election. 
   In 1993, I had introduced legislation with Congressman GERALD KLECZKA, of Wisconsin, as a Member of the House, to abolish the electoral college. Congressman LAHOOD and I came forward on November 1 of this year and made the same recommendation before the election on November 7. So what I am about to say and what I am about to propose, really, although it is going to take into account what happened in our last election, is motivated by a belief that the underlying mechanism in America for choosing the President of the United States is flawed and should be changed. 
   On that day, November 1, I came to the floor of the Senate to explain why I thought the Constitution should be amended to replace the electoral college with a system to directly elect our President. One week after the press conference, the American people went to the polls to express their will. It is worth pausing to realize that we are living through an extraordinary election, the closest by far in more than a century. As we await the outcome, it is important to remember that soon our country will have a new President. I am confident that our great Nation  will successfully navigate the difficulties of this historic election. I am concerned, however, at the loss of confidence of the American voters in the system we know as the electoral college. 
   If we do nothing else over the next year, let's commit to improve and reform the way we elect leaders in America. There are three critical areas of election system reform that I think we should address. The first is campaign financing. I certainly support the McCain-Feingold bipartisan approach to cleaning up the way we pay for campaigns. The second is the mechanisms of the voting process. My colleagues, Senator SCHUMER of New York and Senator BROWNBACK of Kansas, have suggested we put some money on the table for States and localities that want to put in more efficient and more accurate voting machinery. I think that is a good idea. And, of course, the third is changing the electoral college. Today I will discuss replacing that system with a direct popular vote for President. 
   For those who want to defend the current electoral college system, I want to ask, What are the philosophical underpinnings that lie at its foundation? I submit there are none. Instead, the electoral college was a contrived institution, created to appeal to a majority of the delegates to the Constitutional Convention in 1787, who were divided by the issue of Federal versus State powers, big State versus small State rivalries, the balance of power between branches of Government, and slavery. 
   James Madison was opposed to any system of electing the President that did not maintain the South's representational formula gained in an earlier compromise that counted three-fifths of the African American population toward their State totals. A direct popular election of the Chief Executive would have diluted the influence of the South and diluted the votes based on the slave population. 
   Many delegates opposed a direct popular election on the grounds that voters would not have sufficient knowledge of the candidates to make an informed choice. Roger Sherman, delegate from Connecticut, said during the Convention: I stand opposed to the election by the people. The people want for information and are constantly liable to be misled. 
   Given the slowness of travel and communication of that day, coupled with the low level of literacy, the delegates feared that national candidates would be rare and that favorite sons would 
   dominate the political landscape. James Madison predicted that the House of Representatives would end up choosing the President 19 times out of 20. 
   Also, this system was created before the era of national political parties. The delegates intended the electoral college to consist of a group of wise men--and they were all men at that time--appointed by the States, who would gather to select a President based primarily on their individual judgments. It was a compromise between election of the President by Congress and election by popular vote. Certainly, it is understandable that a young nation, forged in revolution and experimenting with a new form of government, would choose a less risky method for selecting a President. 
   Clearly, most of the original reasons for creating the electoral college have long since disappeared, and after 200 years of experience with democracy, the rationale for replacing it with a direct popular vote is clear and compelling. 
   First, the electoral college is undemocratic and unfair. It distorts the election process, with some votes by design having more weight than others. Imagine for a moment if you were told as follows: We want you to vote for President. We are going to give you one vote in selection of the President, but a neighbor of yours is going to have three votes in selecting the President. 
   You would say that is not American, that is fundamentally unfair. We live in a nation that is one person--one citizen, one vote. 
   But that is exactly what the electoral college does. When you look at the States, Wyoming has a population of roughly 480,000 people. In the State of Wyoming, they have three electoral votes. So that means that roughly they have 1 vote for President for every 160,000 people who live in the State of Wyoming--1 vote for President, 160,000 people. My home State of Illinois: 12 million people and specifically 22 electoral votes. That means it takes 550,000 voters in Illinois to vote and cast 1 electoral vote for President. Comparing the voters in Wyoming] to the voters in Illinois, there are three times as many people voting in Illinois to have 1 vote for President as in the State of Wyoming. 
   On the other hand, the philosophical underpinning of a direct popular election system is so clear and compelling it hardly needs mentioning. We use direct elections to choose Senators, Governors, Congressmen, and mayors, but we do not use it to elect a President. One-person, one-vote, and majority rule are supposedly basic tenets of a democracy. 
   I am reminded of the debate that surrounded the 17th amendment which provides for the direct election of Senators. It is interesting. When our Founding Fathers wrote the Constitution, they said the people of the United States could choose and fill basically three Federal offices: The U.S. House of Representatives, the U.S. Senate, and the President and Vice President. But only in the case of the U.S. House of Representatives did they allow the American people to directly elect that Federal officer with an election every 24 months. 
   I suppose their theory at the time was those running for Congress lived closer to the voters, and if the voters made a mistake, in 24 months they could correct it. But when it came to the election of Senators in the original Constitution, those Founding Fathers committed to democracy did not trust democracy. They said: We will let State legislatures choose those who will serve in the Senate. That was the case in America until 1913. With the 17th amendment, we provided for the direct election of Senators. So now we directly elect Senators and Congressmen, but we still cling to this age-old electoral college as an indirect way of electing Presidents of the United States. The single greatest benefit of adopting the 17th amendment and providing for the direct election of Senators was that voters felt more invested in the Senate as an institution and therefore able to have more faith in it. 
   In my State, in that early debate about the 17th amendment, there was a Senator who was accused of bribing members of the State legislature to be elected to the Senate. There were two different hearings on Capitol Hill. The first exonerated him. The second found evidence that bribery did take place. That was part of the impetus behind this reform movement in the direct election of Senators. 
   Second, while it appears smaller and more rural States have an advantage in the electoral college, the reality of modern Presidential campaigns is that these States are generally ignored. 
   One of my colleagues on the floor said: I will fight you, DURBIN, on this idea of abolishing the electoral college. I come from a little State, and if you go to a popular vote to elect a President, Presidential candidates will pay no attention to my little State. 
   I have news for my colleagues. You did not see Governor Bush or Vice President GORE spending much time campaigning in Rhode Island or Idaho. In fact, 14 States were never visited by either candidate during the campaign, while 38 States received 10 or fewer visits. The more populous contested States with their large electoral prizes, such as Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Wisconsin, really have the true advantage whether we have a direct election or whether we have it by the electoral college. 
   Third, the electoral college system totally discounts the votes of those supporting the losing candidate in their State. In the 2000 Presidential race, 36 States were never really in doubt. The average percentage difference of the popular vote between the candidates in those States was more than 20 percent. The current system not only discounts losing votes; it essentially adds the 
   full weight and value of those votes to the candidate those voters oppose. 
   If you were on the losing side in a State such as Illinois, which went for AL GORE, if you cast your vote for George Bush, your vote is not counted. It is a winner-take-all situation. All 22  electoral votes in the State of Illinois went to AL GORE, as the votes in other States, such as Texas, went exclusively to George Bush. 
   Fourth, the winner-take-all rules greatly increase the risk that minor third party candidates will determine who is elected President. In the electoral college system, the importance of a small number of votes in a few key States is greatly magnified. In a number of U.S. Presidential elections, third party candidates have affected a few key State races and determined the overall winner. 
   We can remember that Ross Perot may have cost President Bush his reelection in 1992, and Ralph Nader may have cost AL GORE the 2000 election. In fact, in 1 out of every 4 Presidential elections since 1824, the winner was one State away from becoming the loser based on the electoral college vote count. 
   This is a chart which basically goes through the U.S. Presidential elections since 1824 and talks about those situations where we had a minority President, which we did with John Adams in 1824, with Rutherford B. Hayes in 1876, and Benjamin Harrison in 1888. These Presidential candidates lost the popular vote but won the election, which is rare in American history. It may happen this time. We do not know the outcome yet as I speak on the floor today. 
   In so many other times, though, we had very close elections where, in fact, the electoral vote was not close at all. Take the extremely close race in 1960 to which many of us point: John Kennedy, 49.7 percent of the vote; Richard Nixon, 49.5 percent. Look at the electoral college breakdown: 56 percent going to John Kennedy; 40 percent to Richard Nixon. The electoral college did not reflect the feelings of America when it came to that race. 
   The same thing can be said when we look at the race in 1976. Jimmy Carter won with 50.1 percent of the vote over Gerald Ford with 48 percent of the vote. Jimmy Carter ended up with 55 percent of the electoral college and Gerald Ford with 44 percent. Again, the electoral college did not reflect that reality. 
   In comparison, under a direct popular vote system where over 100 million votes are cast, third party candidates generally would have a much more difficult time playing the spoiler. For instance, there have only been two elections since 1824 where the popular vote has been close enough to even consider a recount. Those were 1880 and 1960. In today's Presidential elections, a difference of even one-tenth of 1 percent represents 100,000 votes. 
   Fifth, the electoral college is clearly a more risky system than a direct popular vote, providing ample opportunity for manipulation, mischief, and litigation. 
   The electoral college provides that the House of Representatives choose the President when no candidate receives a majority of electoral votes. That happened in 1801 and 1825. 
   The electoral system allows Congress to dispute the legitimacy of electors. This occurred several times just after the Civil War and once in 1969. 
   In 1836, the Whig Party ran different Presidential candidates in different regions of the country. Their plan was to capitalize on the local popularity of the various candidates and then to pool the Whig electors to vote for a single Whig candidate or to throw the election to Congress. 
   In this century, electors in seven elections have cast ballots for candidates contrary to their State vote. Presidents have received fewer popular votes than their main opponent in 3 of the 44 elections since 1824. 
   In the 2000 election, I ask why the intense spotlight on Florida? The answer is simple: That is where the deciding electoral votes are. More disturbing is the fact that anyone following the election knew that Florida was the tightest race of those States with large electoral prizes. Those wishing to manipulate the election had a very clear target. 
   In contrast, under a direct popular vote system, there is no equivalent pressure point. Any scheme attempting to change several hundred thousand votes necessary to turn even the closest Presidential election is difficult to imagine in a country as vast and populous as the United States. Similarly, as I previously mentioned, recounts will be much more rare under a direct popular vote system given the size of the electorate. 
   Some people have said to me: DURBIN, if you have a direct popular vote--here we had GORE winning the vote this time by 250,000 votes--wouldn't you have contests all across the Nation to try to make up that difference? Look what happened in Florida. The original Bush margin was about 1,700 votes. It is now down to 500 votes after 4 weeks of recount efforts and efforts in court, not a very substantial change in a State with 6 million votes. So to change 250,000 votes nationwide if we go to a popular vote would, of course, be a daunting challenge. 
   Throughout American history, there has been an inexorable march toward one citizen, one vote. As the Thirteen Colonies were debating if and how to join a more perfect Union, only a privileged few--those with the right skin color, the right gender, and the right financial status--enjoyed the right to cast votes to select their leaders. The people even gained the right to choose their Senators by popular vote with the ratification of the 17th amendment in 1913. 
   As one barrier after another has fallen, we are one step away from a system that treats all Americans equally, where a ballot cast for President in Illinois or Utah or Rhode Island has the same weight as one cast in Oregon or Florida. The electoral college is the last barrier preventing us from achieving that goal. As the world's first and greatest democracy, it is time to fully trust the people of America and allow them the right to choose a President. 
   We would like to say, when this is all over, that the American people have spoken and chosen their President. The fact is that is not the case. With the electoral college, the American people do not make the choice. The choice is made indirectly, by electing electors in each State, on a winner-take-all basis. 
   I leave you with a quote from Representative George Norris of Nebraska, who said the following during the debate in 1911 in support of the direct election of U.S. Senators. I quote:  
   It is upon the citizens that we depend for stability as a government. It is upon the patriotic, common, industrious people of our country that our Government must always lean in time of danger and distress. To this class of people then, we should give the right to control by direct election the selection of our public officials and to permit each citizen who is part of the sinew and backbone of our Government in time of danger to exercise his influence by direct vote in time of peace.  
   Mr. President, I will be introducing this proposal to abolish the electoral college and to establish the direct election of a President as part of our agenda in the next Congress. I sincerely hope it will be debated and considered. This time is the right time for us to take the time and look at the way we choose the President of the United States. It will not change the outcome of what happened on November 7 in the year 2000. But if history is our guide, I hope we will learn from this past experience and make our election machinery more democratic and more responsive. 
   Part of my proposal will also include the requirement that anyone to be elected President has to win 40 percent of the popular vote. Failing that, the top two candidates would face a runoff election. I think it is reasonable to suggest that leading this country requires at least the approval of 40 percent of the popular vote. That is why it would be included. 
   I hope my colleagues in the Senate, even those from the smaller States, will pause and take a look at this proposal. 
   I hope, before I yield the floor to my colleague from Minnesota, to make one other comment. There is a lot of talk about how this contest is going to end when it comes to this last election and the impact it will have on the Presidency. 
   I continue to believe that the American people want a strong President. They want a strong leader in the White House. They want our President to succeed. Whoever is finally declared the winner in the November 7, 2000, election, that person, I believe, deserves the support not only of the American people but clearly of Congress, too. We have to rally behind our next President in support of those decisions which really do chart the course for America. I think that force, coupled with the  Senate equally divided 50-50, is going to be a positive force in bringing this Nation back together after this session of Congress comes to a close. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor to my colleague from Minnesota, Senator WELLSTONE.

   Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   I come to the floor today, as I did on the last day of October, to state my opposition to this bankruptcy conference report. This is an issue that I have worked on for the last 4 years. For 2 of those years, I served on a subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee with Senator GRASSLEY. I worked very closely with many in drafting what I consider to be very balanced and very positive bankruptcy reform. That bill was called for a vote on the floor of the Senate. Ninety-seven Senators voted in favor of that bill. It was the most overwhelming vote on this subject to my knowledge that we have seen on the Senate floor in modern times. It was a balanced bill. I thought it was a good bill. 
   For these last 2 years, I have not served on the Judiciary Committee, and it has been Senator GRASSLEY's responsibility to continue this effort. He came forward with a bill which I supported on the Senate floor. 
   Sadly, when this bill left the Senate floor to go to conference committee, it got in trouble again. Some of the special interests that are interested in this particular bill can't wait for this conference committee to literally rip apart the best efforts of the Senate. 
   They did it 4 years ago; they have done it this year. They have taken what was a generally good bill on bankruptcy and made some rather disastrous changes in it. I think that is unfortunate. 
   I accept the premise that bankruptcy reform is overdue. I think it is unfair to consumers across America to try to absorb all the costs of those who go to bankruptcy court, particularly those who have no business in bankruptcy court. But I also believe the credit industry has a responsibility as well. This bill does not serve the needs of balance. This bill, the conference report that is before the Senate today, is a conference report that was written entirely by the Republican Party. They didn't even invite the Democratic conferees into the discussion. It was a slam dunk--take it or leave it. 
   As far as I am concerned, I want to leave it. I think we can do a better job. If we have to wait for a new Congress to accomplish that, so be it. 
   Let me say from the outset, I support and am committed to bankruptcy reform. There are some things we can and should do to make it a better system. What we have today is not balanced. Make no mistake, this bankruptcy bill is lopsided in favor of the credit card industry. 
   When I came to the floor on November 1 and voted against cloture on this particular bill, some of my colleagues asked me why. Why did I, a Member who previously voted for bankruptcy reform, now oppose this conference report? I oppose it because the bill I voted for was decimated in conference. As a result, we have before the Senate a very poor work product. 
   In 1985, Felix G. Rohatyn, chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation of New York City, said:  
   [Bankruptcy would be] like stepping into a tepid bath and slashing your wrists. You might not feel yourself dying, but that's what would happen.  
   I oppose this one-sided bankruptcy conference report on behalf of debtors who lack the lobbying dollars of the credit card industry and are unable to make their voices heard. We must keep in mind, the vast majority of people who go to the bankruptcy court don't want to be there. They are people in a very low-income status who have found themselves, because of circumstances beyond their control, unable to pay off their debts. They go many times with embarrassment to a bankruptcy court because they have nowhere else to turn. I oppose the bankruptcy conference report on behalf of the hundreds of thousands of people in this predicament. I am talking about older Americans, women raising families, and unemployed workers. 
   When you do a survey of the reasons people end up in bankruptcy court, many of the same reasons keep coming forward: Unanticipated health care bills can happen to anybody; a divorce which results in one of the spouses ending up with custody and very few assets to take care of the children; the loss of a job. These sorts of things are totally unanticipated, and people find themselves needing to turn to bankruptcy to get a fresh start in life. 
   Older Americans are less likely to end up in bankruptcy than their younger counterparts, but when they do file, a large fraction of them, nearly 40 percent, give medical debts as the reason for filing. Another reason is jobs. The economic consequences for someone who has worked for 30 years and loses his job at age 54 can be catastrophic. 
   Both men and women are more likely to declare bankruptcy following divorce. Families already laden with consumer debt can't divide their income to support two households and survive economically. Divorced women file for bankruptcy in greater proportion than divorced men. According to the credit industry's own data, women heads of household are not only the largest demographic group in bankruptcy; they are also the poorest. I 
   remind Members of that fact when we consider the debate on this bill. 
   Yesterday, my friend, the Senator who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, ORRIN HATCH, came to the floor and made note of the fact that there are provisions made in this bankruptcy conference report that benefit and improve the status of women and children in the throes of bankruptcy. What Senator HATCH failed to add was that there are also provisions in this bill which enhance and improve the status of credit card companies so that debts that otherwise would have been wiped away or discharged linger and continue to plague the limited assets left over after a bankruptcy. 
   So while it is true you may put the women and children at the head of the line, the line is a very short one with very few dollars because the credit card industry receives benefits under this bill to allow them to continue to pursue the debts of someone who has filed for bankruptcy, whereas today they could not. 
   More than half the debtors who file for bankruptcy report a significant period of unemployment preceding their filings. For single-parent households, a period of unemployment can be absolutely devastating. It is on behalf of these debtors that I opposed this unbalanced bankruptcy conference report that gives them little or nothing. 
   Some of my colleagues may be saying, what is the Senator talking about? Doesn't the bankruptcy bill put women and children first, as Senator HATCH said yesterday? Indeed, that was the rhetoric we heard. Senators came to the floor with large posters claiming how wonderful the bankruptcy bill was for women and children. 
   Mr. President, the bankruptcy bill does grant first priority to alimony and support claims. Unfortunately, the bill places women and children first in line to receive little or nothing. Priority is only relevant for distributions made to creditors in the bankruptcy case itself. However, such distributions are made in only a negligible percentage of cases. 
   More than 95 percent of bankruptcy cases make no distribution to creditors because there are no assets to distribute. So to say to women and children, when it is all over we will give you a greater share of the assets, in 95 percent of the cases there are no assets to give them; the assets have been dissipated and used up already by the credit card creditors. 
   The real battle for women and children is reaching an ex-husband's income after bankruptcy. Right now under current law, child support and alimony share a protected postbankruptcy position with only two other recurrent collectors of debt--taxes and student loans. The credit card industry wants to muscle in and get a large piece of a very small pie. They want credit card debt and other consumer credit to share in this protected postbankruptcy position. They want to shove women and children aside to try to collect on their own behalf. 
   The simple fact is this: When pitted against the high-powered credit card  industry, women and children do not have the resources to compete. If the credit card industry is permitted to elevate its status to the protected postbankruptcy status position already shared by taxes and student loans, women and children will lose every single time. 
   Later on, I will make reference to a press release recently put out by the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers. They say in their press release: A child is more important than a credit card. Those who vote for this conference report believe just the opposite: The credit card industry has a greater claim to some sort of support from the Senate that the children who are involved in a divorce proceeding. 
   My colleagues must ask themselves, if this bill truly puts women and children first, why is every major women's group and children's group opposing this legislation? We have advocates for 
   women and children who are opposed to the bill. I will not go through the long list, but if you believe the statements made yesterday by some of my colleagues on the floor, you have to ask yourself, are all of these groups wrong? Are all of these advocates for women and children opposed to the bill for the wrong reason? I don't think so. These are not partisan organizations; they are organizations that fight for women and children when they know that they are struggling to survive. They read this bill as I have, too, and came to the same conclusion. When all is said and done, the credit card industry will do just fine. It is the women, the mothers, the kids who won't. 
   Mr. President, 116 nonpartisan law professors from all over the country have written expressing their concerns over the grave effects the bill will have on women and children. In addition, to the concerns I have already raised, the law professors write:  
   Women and children as creditors will have to compete with powerful creditors to collect their claims after bankruptcy. This increased competition for women and children will come from many quarters: from powerful credit card issuers, whose credit card claims increasingly will be accepted from discharge and remain legal obligations of the debtor after bankruptcy; from large retailers, who will have an easier time obtaining reaffirmations of debt that legally could be discharged; and from creditors claiming they hold security, even when the alleged collateral is virtually worthless. None of the changes made to S. 625 and none being proposed in H.R. 2415 addresses these problems. 
   The truth remains: if H.R. 2415 is enacted in its current form, women and children will face increased competition in collecting their alimony and support claims after the bankruptcy claim is over. We pointed out this difficulty repeatedly, but no change has been made in the bill to address it.  
   They go on to say:  
   In addition to the concerns raised on behalf of the thousands of women who are struggling now to collect alimony and child support after their ex-husband's bankruptcies, we also express our concerns on behalf of the more than half a million women heads of household who will file for bankruptcy this year alone. As the heads of the economically most vulnerable families, they have a special stake in the pending legislation. Women heads of households are now the largest demographic group in bankruptcy, and according to the credit card industry's own data, they are the poorest. The provisions in this bill, particularly the many provisions that apply without regard to income, will fall hardest on them. Under this bill, a single mother with dependent children who is hopelessly insolvent and whose income is far below the national median income would have her bankruptcy case dismissed if she does not present copies of income tax returns for the past three years--even if those returns are in the possession of her ex-husband. A single mother who hoped to work through a chapter 13 payment plan would be forced to repay every penny of the entire debt owed on almost worthless items of collateral, such as used furniture or children's clothing, even if it meant that successful completion of a repayment plan was impossible.  
   I can't get over the fact that we have just finished an election season when so many candidates in both political parties spoke of their sympathies and their commitments to America's families. They talked about the vulnerable in our society, about the need for compassion whether you are liberal or conservative, and they spoke to groups about their love for children. Yet we turn around here, 4 weeks and a day after that last election, and start debating a bill which clearly is not designed to help women and children in the most vulnerable circumstances. All of these groups, every single one of them that stand for the interests of these women and children, have told us this is a bad bill. 
   If you look at this group, you will not see too many political action committees. I don't believe Churchwomen United have a PAC, or many of the others. But certainly the credit card industry does. The financial institutions do. They have come to get involved in this election campaign, as is their constitutional right. Their voice, unfortunately, is a lot louder on the floor of the Senate than the voices of those who represent the women and children across America. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the full text of this letter by the 116 law professors be printed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD at this point.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, some of my colleagues have also asked why did I vote for this bill in the first place. When I voted for it, I did so in the hopes that the bill would be strengthened in conference. Instead, exactly the opposite occurred. The bankruptcy code is a delicate balance. When you push one thing, almost invariably something else will give. In this bill, the credit card industry pushed, and what gave were the debtors. Is that fair? Is that balanced? In a word: No. 
   The constant theme that has guided me throughout the consideration of bankruptcy legislation is balanced reform. I do not believe you can have meaningful bankruptcy reform without addressing both sides of the problem, irresponsible debtors and irresponsible creditors. 
   The bill that passed the Senate in the 105th Congress was a balanced and bipartisan approach. Senator GRASSLEY and I, along with several other Senators, worked hard to develop it, and 97 Senators supported our efforts and agreed that it was a good, balanced way to deal with the problem. 
   That bill was killed in conference 2 years ago. Unfortunately, our efforts of many, many months did not result in the bankruptcy reform legislation that we needed. 
   I had hoped this year would be different. This year when I voted for it, I did so with the hope that some key provisions of the legislation would be strengthened. It didn't happen in conference. Rather, the bill we have before us today falls far short of the Senate effort. Perhaps if the Democrats hadn't been shut out of conference, we would have a more balanced conference bill. Sadly, like so many instances in this Congress, Democrats were kept from the table. Rather than negotiate with Democrats directly and bring forth a bill the President could support, that both creditors and debtors could support, our Republican colleagues are trying to force us to take a bad bill. I say don't take it, leave it. This bill is not balanced. 
   I said in the beginning of my statement and I will say it again, I support reform. I for one am willing to reach across the aisle and work in a bipartisan fashion in the next Congress to develop a bill. I know some of my colleagues on this side of the aisle are anxious to do the same. In this Congress, we have, rarely but at some times, worked in a bipartisan manner and obtained meaningful results for the American people: the reauthorization of the Older American Act, the H-1B visa legislation, and the Senior Citizens Freedom to Work Act. 
   Despite these accomplishments, Congress has missed opportunities to pass a lot of other meaningful legislation such as a Patients' Bill of Rights, expanding the current hate crimes law, and passing commonsense gun safety legislation. Let's not add bankruptcy to the list. Let's pledge to work together in the new, 50-50 split in the Senate, in the 107th Congress to come up with a balanced bill. 
   Although our Republican colleagues may be able to disguise the bankruptcy bill by putting it in a State Department authorization bill, they cannot hide the simple truth--this bill is not a balanced approach. Many of the Members of this Chamber know I am a strong proponent of credit card disclosure. I am not in favor of rationing credit. I believe Americans should be allowed to make that choice. But it should be an informed choice. You should know what you are getting into when you sign up for that credit card. The number of people who end up overextending on credit cards and finding they cannot meet 
   their obligations include quite a few who never understood the terms and conditions of their credit card arrangement. 
   I am a lawyer. I have been around legislatures and Congress for a long time. When I turn over my monthly statement for my credit card and look at that fine print, I struggle to figure out what they are trying to say to me. There are some basic things people ought to know when they sign up for a credit card. What is the interest rate? How much am I going to pay and for how long? Is the interest rate going to change? If I receive a monthly statement and this is the minimum monthly payment, how many months do I have to pay off that minimum payment before it is finally gone? During that period of time, how much will I pay in principal, how much will I pay in interest? 
   These are not outrageous ideas. It is kind of the basic information you would expect to know so consumers can know whether or not they have overestimated, whether they are going too far in debt. You would think most people in the credit card industry would not fight that. The fact is, they did. They don't want to make that disclosure to the American people. They are afraid if the American consumers have the facts, the American consumers will make some different choices. They might not sign up for that extra credit card. They might think twice before just sending in a couple of bucks a month if it means they are going to be paying for years and pay more in interest than they are on the principal. 
   During the course of my involvement in the industry, I have tried to stress to the credit industry that they have some responsibility in this debate as well. There is ample evidence to suggest they are hawking credit to children, to college students, and people already deeply in financial trouble. 
   In 1999 alone, there were 3.5 billion credit card solicitations mailed to American households. If you follow  this debate, you know exactly what I am talking about. You go home every night, open the mailbox, take a look at what is there, and throw away all the new credit card applications because each of us, particularly in the households that are considered creditworthy, received an armload of these invitations to sign up for a new credit card on a regular basis. 
   Credit cards have been addressed to 4-year-old preschool children and, yes, every once in a while the family dog gets an application, too. These 3.5 billion credit card solicitations don't take into account phone calls at dinnertime, the ads stuck in the middle of magazines, or the booths set up on every college campus offering free tee-shirts if you just sign up for a credit card. In fact, on many college campuses, each time a student buys something at a bookstore they often get a credit card solicitation at the bottom of their bag. The bags are premade with credit card applications and ads at the bottom of the bag. These ads are directly aimed at college students, ads such as those for Visa, which say: ``Accepted at more colleges than you were.'' 
   Never mind that these students, many of them young men and women away from home for the first time, don't have the skills to navigate what could be some choppy waters. Some of these students end up ruining their credit before they even get their first real job. Are we supposed to believe the credit card industry is not responsible? Regrettably, the already minimalist approach to credit card disclosure in the Senate bill was weakened further in the conference. 
   I continue to believe, as I did in 1998 when we passed strong disclosure provisions, that consumers benefit from knowing, for example, that paying the 2 percent monthly minimum on a $1,295 balance would take 93 months, or more than 7 years to pay off the balance. An estimate of the total cost to pay off this $1,295 balance if only the minimum payments are made is $2,418--almost twice the original balance. If all this information were available, I don't think many consumers would consider the monthly minimum payment a very good idea. 
   Oh, certainly there could be a month when that is all you can pay. But you have to know down the line, if you go along with the credit card industry and just make the minimum monthly payment, at the end of this you are going to pay a lot more in interest. Maybe that is your choice. But shouldn't you know, going in? Shouldn't that information be given to you? 
   College students might think twice before using their credit cards to charge another pizza. The bankruptcy bill in the 105th Congress included debtor-specific information that enabled cardholders to examine their current credit card in tangible terms, driving home the seriousness of their financial commitments. 
   Sounds simple, doesn't it? Today's technology is such that it probably would not take much to make this happen. So why isn't this reasonable provision part of the bankruptcy bill? The credit card industry said: No, we don't want to make any additional disclosures, we don't want to give consumers more information, we don't want to give them a reason to say no. We want to create reasons for them to say yes. 
   Frankly, if you take a person who is in a precarious credit situation and they sign up for a new credit card and end up in bankruptcy court, doesn't the credit card industry bear some responsibility? It was the consumer's choice to take the credit card, but how diligent was the credit card industry in finding out whether a person really knew the terms and conditions of the agreement and whether or not they were creditworthy? 
   Unfortunately, this industry, not the majority of the American people, have the money and resources to make their wishes known, and thus the bill we have on the floor. The credit card industry decided it was in their best interest not to let the American people know exactly what paying only the minimum balance on their 19-percent credit card would actually cost them. 
   This year, the debtor-specific information was reduced to providing cardholders with generic examples, and I accepted this reduced operation with some reservations. It is my understanding that it was even further weakened in the conference committee. 
   It amazes me. The credit card industry, with all of their computers and all of their information, when you say to them: When you put down the minimum monthly payment on a card, can you put right next to it how many months it will take to pay it off? 
   They say: That is just totally beyond us; we don't know that our computers could ever figure that out. 
   I do not get it. I do not understand how they can say that with a straight face. They know that information is readily accessible. They know also it may discourage people from putting too much debt on their credit cards. That will cost them business, it will cost them interest payments, and they will not let it be included in this bill. 
   The Republican leadership agreement permits banks with less than $250 million in assets--incidentally, that is over 80 percent of all banks--to have the Federal Reserve provide its customers with a toll-free number to review their credit card balances for the next 2 years. It is unclear whether the banks would be required to provide the service themselves after 2 years. The exemption would cover 4,000 banks holding about $3 billion in consumer credit card debt. 
   The American people are not going to be calling this toll-free number to find out what their credit card balances are. You know it, I know it, the credit card industry certainly knows it, too. That is why they agreed to it. They agreed to a provision that does little to help debtors take responsibility for their financial situation. 
   This is a departure from a balanced approach. This is a sham. This is about as worthless as the warnings on cigarette packages. They do not want to give consumers specific information about their credit card balances. The credit card industry won that battle in the conference report. 
   In addition, the current bankruptcy bill provides for a homestead exemption that is weaker than the version included in the Senate-passed bill. The Senate, in a 76-22 bipartisan vote, agreed to an amendment by Senator KOHL of Wisconsin to create a $100,000 nationwide cap on any homestead exception. 
   You go before a bankruptcy court and say: Here are my assets. In many cases, it is the home. Many States decided what the value of that home to be exempted by creditors can be. Every State has a different standard. Some States have no standard. We have had outrageous situations in the past where well-known actors and public figures, knowing they were going to file for bankruptcy, bought an expensive estate or ranch and put every asset they had in it, walked into the bankruptcy court and said: I have nothing but my home. The home happens to be palatial, and the home is exempt. 
   If we are talking about holding people accountable for their conduct, why would we let this kind of thing happen? If the average mother, fresh from a divorce and trying to raise kids, has to scrape together the pennies and dollars she has in savings and declare them as assets and put them on the table to be taken by creditors, why shouldn't the wealthiest among us be held to the same standards and not able to exempt estates and ranches and mansions? It seems to make sense, doesn't it? It certainly does not for those who are arguing for passage of this bill. 
   This amendment we proposed would have closed a major loophole in the bankruptcy law: a homestead exemption where a person gets to hide from a bankruptcy court the value of their home. It is different in every State. In Illinois, it is $7,500. You cannot buy much of a home in my State for that amount. In other States, it is a lot more. Florida and Texas have no caps whatsoever. In a State such as Texas, wealthy debtors are able to file for bankruptcy and keep their mansions. 
   Is it fair? Absolutely not. If we are looking for real reform in bankruptcy, why haven't we addressed this? Keeping a home worth several hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not millions, out of bankruptcy is a ruse; it is a fraud. 
   I voted in support of Senator KOHL's amendment to close this loophole. He placed a hard cap on unlimited State homestead exemptions. 
   Unfortunately, the conference report guts this reform to permit debtors to avoid any Federal homestead cap. Thus, in States such as Florida and Texas, a homeowner who has equity in  her home that existed prior to the 2-year cut-off can keep all the equity, even if the home is valued in the millions of dollars. This provision only benefits the wealthiest people in America, and this loophole is unacceptable. 
   When we consider that the average income of people who file for bankruptcy in America is under $30,000 a year, why in the world would we pass a bill which allows folks who are millionaires to literally protect their assets and not provide protection for the women and children who are most vulnerable going into bankruptcy court because of a lost job, a divorce, or medical bills? 
   That just tells us what this bill is about. It tells us why so many people are so anxious to see it pass. They want to protect the wealthiest in our society, and they do not care much about those who are on the other end. 
   Also, the bill we have before us today fails to include an amendment by my colleague, Senator SCHUMER, known as the clinic violence amendment. This Chamber is well aware that the Schumer amendment prevented documented abuse of the bankruptcy system by those who violated the FACE Act or an equivalent State law. The Senate overwhelmingly passed the Schumer amendment 80-17. There is no reason not to include it in this bill. 
   By failing to include the Schumer amendment, the bill allows many perpetrators of health clinic violence to seek shelter in the Nation's bankruptcy courts. 
   By failing to include the Schumer clinic violence amendment, this bill says if someone injures or even kills someone outside an abortion clinic or other health care clinic, they can hide under the bankruptcy code and have their debts discharged under chapter 13 bankruptcy. Student loans are not even dischargeable under chapter 13. 
   Why would we allow perpetrators of this violence to usurp our clinic protection laws by feigning bankruptcy? The amendment says, no, we will not. 
   This Senate voted in favor of it. No matter what your position on the issue of abortion, I am sure my colleagues will again agree, as they did on a vote of 80-17, that perpetrators of clinic violence should not be permitted to circumvent our clinic protection laws. Failing to include the Schumer amendment that has strong bipartisan support does not make sense. It is not balanced. 
   So there is no mistake and the record is clear, I support and I am committed to bankruptcy reform. I have heard from many groups and my constituencies in Illinois urging opposition to this bill. 
   Labor organizations, representing a lot of working men and women across this country, middle-income workers from virtually every type of trade and background, have come out in opposition to the bill. NARAL, the National Partnership for Women and Children, the leadership Conference on Civil Rights, the 
   Religious Action Center, the Consumers Union, the Bankruptcy Center in Illinois, and the 116 nonpartisan law professors I mentioned earlier have all urged Members of the Senate to vote against it. They are right. We should leave it and work together in the 107th Congress for a much more balanced approach. 
   Yesterday, I received a letter from the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers urging Congress to oppose the bill. Its press release out of Chicago as of yesterday says:  
   The Nation's top divorce and matrimonial attorneys called today for Congress not to approve a little-debated, but heavily lobbied bankruptcy provision currently pending final approval in the lame duck session of Congress, that would take monies away from child support payments for credit card debts when individuals declare bankruptcy. 
   ``Children should come before credit card companies,'' said Charles C. Shainberg of Philadelphia, the Academy's new president. 
   The provision, part of H.R. 2415, and which has quietly passed both the House and Senate, affects Federal bankruptcy filings. Under Chapter 13 filings, a common form of individual bankruptcy, the individual works out a court-approved payment program to pay down debt. However, currently child support and alimony have priority status, meaning that all child support and alimony need to be paid before credit card companies can collect their debts. 
   Under this new bill--  
   Which we are currently debating--  
   the deferral or relief from credit card payments, technically known as their dischargeability, would be limited, so that children and credit card payments would have the same priority and payments would be split between [a child and a MasterCard.]
   There currently are some 1.4 million bankruptcy filings in the United States each year, and more are expected if an anticipated cooling of the economy occurs. 
   The bill is backed primarily by Republicans and some Democrats [as the vote showed yesterday]. President Clinton has said he will veto the bill, but it is unclear from the election results what will happen under a new administration.  
   Continuing to quote:  
   ``The way for the credit card companies to improve their receivables is to limit the millions of cards they offer to poor credit risks, not take money from women and children,'' said Linda Lea Viken of Rapid City, S.D., who chairs the Academy's Federalization of Family Law Committee. 
   Another problem presented by the bill, Academy attorneys say, is that past due child support payments and alimony are not dischargeable, so the person who has to make credit card payments in addition to alimony and child support will keep falling farther and farther behind in his or her total payments, eventually resulting in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing, or total insolvency. 
   The American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers is comprised of the nation's top 1,500 matrimonial attorneys who are recognized experts in the specialized field of matrimonial law, including divorce, prenuptial agreements, legal separation, annulment, custody, property valuation and division, support and the rights of unmarried cohabitors. 
   The purpose of the Academy is to encourage the study, improve the practice, elevate the standards and advance the cause of matrimonial law.  
   Yesterday, this letter arrived and made it clear to me that this bill has problems that will be felt not by credit card companies but by a lot of people in very tragic circumstances for a long time to come. 
   Before I yield the floor, I want to mention something curious that has happened. 
   The Administrative Office of the United States Courts recently released its statistics regarding bankruptcy filings for the fiscal year 2000 that ended September 30 of this year. They report that bankruptcy filings continue to decline. Personal bankruptcy filings were down 6.8 percent from the 1,354,376 bankruptcy filings for fiscal year 1999. For businesses, filings were down 6.6 percent. 
   This is great news for the American people--creditors and debtors alike. As the University of Maryland's Department of Economics notes in their recent study:  
   Not only have personal bankruptcies stopped their explosive growth, but the trend has reversed, and the U.S. per capita bankruptcy rate is actually lower than it was at the time that the bankruptcy bill was introduced.  
   I said it before, and I will say it again: I support balanced bankruptcy reform. But the momentum and impetus behind this reform was the complaints of the credit industry that so many people were filing for bankruptcy. It was a curiosity, when they came with this complaint, we were in the midst of the largest economic expansion in the history of this country. You would wonder, if we are doing better as a nation, why are more people filing for bankruptcy? 
   I am not sure it is the right answer, but it is the one that may be right. People tend to believe, in good times, there 
   will never be bad times. They overextend themselves. They see their neighbors doing well and buying things, and they may want to join them, when they should think twice, and then they find themselves in bankruptcy court. 
   When the national mood starts to change, people worry a little about the economy. They take care in terms of their credit responsibilities and their credit obligations. That may account for this decline in the filing of bankruptcies. It certainly should give pause to those who think this is an emergency measure which should be considered by a lame duck Congress. 
   I believe any serious reform must be balanced and take into consideration the people behind all the statistics. 
   Unfortunately, the bankruptcy bill before us today--the one masquerading as a so-called State Department authorization conference report--falls short of the Senate effort. The bankruptcy bill before us today, like its predecessor in the 105th Congress, has been decimated in a partisan conference. This bill should meet the same fate as that earlier bill. 
   I will oppose this report and urge my colleagues to do the same.  
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to clarify some issues related to the Chimpanzee Health Improvement, Maintenance and Protection Act by entering into a colloquy with my colleague from New Hampshire, Senator Bob Smith. Senator Smith, as my fellow prime sponsor of the Senate version of this legislation, S. 2725, I would first like to address the House amendment to the bill, which would allow for the possibility of temporarily removing certain chimpanzees from a sanctuary for medical research? Is it your understanding that the purpose of the CHIMP Act is still to provide a permanent lifetime sanctuary for chimpanzees who have been designated as no longer useful or needed in scientific research? 
</TEXT>

<DOCNO>106-durbin-il-2-20001206</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DURBIN. The amended version also requires that the research can only be sought by an applicant who has not previously violated the Animal Welfare Act, does it not? And it requires that if a chimpanzee is ever to be removed from a sanctuary for research, the chimpanzee must be returned to the sanctuary immediately afterward and all expenses associated with the departure, such as travel and ongoing care, must be borne by the research applicant. The chimpanzee should spend as little time away from the sanctuary as possible. 
   Additionally, before any proposed research use can be approved, the Secretary of Health and Human Services must publish in the Federal Register the Secretary's findings on each of these criteria, including the board's evaluation regarding pain and distress, and seek public comment for at least 60 days.

   Mr. DURBIN. I agree with my colleague from New Hampshire that the research exception is intended only to be exercised, if at all, under truly extraordinary and rare circumstances. 
   There have also been concerns expressed by some that the CHIMP Act is too expensive. I think it would be helpful for us to address those concerns for the record.

   Mr. DURBIN. In addition, the CHIMP Act caps overall multi-year federal expenditures related to building and operating the sanctuary system at $30 million, compared to the $7 million spent now each year by the federal government for the care of chimpanzees in laboratories, as estimated by the CBO. 
   And this legislation creates a public-private partnership, to generate non-federal dollars that will help pay for the care of these chimpanzees. Right now, their care is financed strictly through taxpayer dollars. Under the bill, the private sector will cover 10 percent of the start-up costs and 25 percent of the operating costs of the sanctuary system.

   Mr. DURBIN. Therefore, if the Federal government is to keep using chimpanzees to advance human health research goals, long-term care of the animals is a pre-requisite. This legislation will help ensure that the Federal government fulfills that responsibility in a more cost-effective and humane way than is currently done. I thank Senator SMITH for the opportunity to work together to enact this fiscally sound legislation that will better serve the taxpayers as well as the animals.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from West Virginia for his kind remarks in behalf of the birthday of our colleague from South Carolina, Senator THURMOND. Those were excellent remarks and tribute to a man with whom we have been proud to serve. 
   I would like to note, because the Senator is such a historian, that someone handed me a little piece of history which might be instructive to us in the days ahead. 
   The year was 1881, when a special session of the Senate convened on March 4, 1881. The session was called for the exclusive purpose of handling Cabinet and agency nominations for the new administration of President James Garfield. Republicans and Democrats were split evenly 37-37, with 2 independent Senators. Under normal circumstances, this short session should have lasted about 11 days. Due to intense partisanship, it resulted in deadlock. It ran for 11 weeks. 
   I hope that is a lesson to those of us who are trying to find a reasonable way to resolve our new challenge in the new Congress; that there are ways to do it so we can avoid that kind of deadlock and that kind of delay. 
   I see the Senator from Iowa present.

   Mr. DURBIN. This bankruptcy bill has been a mangy stray dog that won't get off the back porch. 
   Let me tell you what is wrong with the bill. Does it improve the position of women and children? Sure, but it also improves the position of credit card companies, competing with the women and children for limited funds. 
   Does it close the homestead loophole? A little bit, but it allows those who are wealthy to find their way around their legal obligation in bankrupcy. 
   I have coauthored, cosponsored, and voted for bankruptcy reform when it was bipartisan and balanced. This bill is not. This bill was written by a conference committee dominated by one party. It is being shoved down our throats. It is time to shove that old dog off the back porch.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it has been more than a year since the Columbine tragedy, but still this Republican Congress refuses to act on sensible gun legislation. 
   Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. Until we act, Democrats in the Senate will read the names of some of those who have lost their lives to gun violence in the past year, and we will continue to do so every day that the Senate is in session. 
   In the name of those who died, we will continue this fight. Following are the names of some of the people who were killed by gunfire one year ago today, December 5, 1999: 
   Trennell Alston, 26, Baltimore, MD; Georges Ronnell Barnes, 29, Baltimore, MD; Mary Collien, 51, Baltimore, MD; Gilbert Gallegos, 76, Salt Lake City, UT; Donta Henson, 18, Chicago, IL; Nathan Hornes, 36, Oakland, CA; Makisha Jenkins, 18, Baltimore, MD; Christopher Jones, 17, Washington, DC; Greg Karavites, 38, Denver, CO; Jill  Lundstrom, 25, Miami-Dade County, FL; Johnny Manning, 29, Minneapolis, MN; Mary Matthews, 39, Baltimore, MD; Bertess Montgomery, 87, Memphis, TN; Ramiro Peredez, 34, Atlanta, GA; Lionel Robinson, 23, Baltimore, MD; Patrick Michael Smith, 21, Washington, DC; Levanna Spearman, 23, Baltimore, MD; Alan Villarreal, 23, Houston, TX; Unidentified Male, Newark, NJ; and Unidentified Male, Newark, NJ. 
   Five of the people I mentioned were the victims of what has been described as one of the worst mass killings in Baltimore history. Mary McNeil Matthews; her mother, Mary Helen Collien; her daughter, Makisha Jenkins; and two family friends, Trennell Alston and Lavanna Spearman; were killed one year ago today by four men who burst into Mary McNeil Matthews' home and shot all five women. 
   We cannot sit back and allow such senseless gun violence to continue. The deaths of these people are a reminder to all of us that we need to enact sensible gun legislation now.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from the State of Texas. We disagree on substance but we have a cordial relationship on the Senate floor. I thank him for his courtesy. 
   I also congratulate Senator MOYNIHAN for his leadership in the closing months of this session. Senator MOYNIHAN, as he is facing retirement, has really been a leader on issues that will have a lasting impact on this world. It has been the hallmark of his congressional and public career. I note in personal conversations with him that he takes great pride in these accomplishments. I believe they will inure to the benefit of this country for generations to come. I thank him for his great service to the State of New York and to our Nation throughout his public life. 
   This morning I had an opportunity to object and could have been one, I guess, to stop this effort to enact at the last minute this Foreign Sales Corporation provision. I did not. The decision not to object was made after a lot of deliberation and consideration. 
   I would like to describe the reason why I was prepared to object and offer an amendment, and to assure my colleague that they have not heard the end of this debate. 
   This Foreign Sales Corporation provision is a $4 billion annual subsidy to over 7,000 companies in America which export overseas. Between 15 and 30 percent of their income from sales overseas will not be subject to taxes in the United States. 
   That is a windfall to these companies. It is a windfall which gives them an opportunity for more profits and, I argue as well, to create more jobs. 
   In many instances, in my State this Foreign Sales Corporation provision means that some of the major exporters from Illinois and across the United States have a chance to thrive and grow. 
   I am one who is a Democrat and proud of it and proud of my labor support. But I also believe very passionately that globalization and free trade are the future. 
   If they in fact are the future, we should do everything legally possible to encourage export that creates good paying jobs in the United States. 
   And for that reason, I don't stand in general objection to the Foreign Sales Corporation. I believe that what we are talking about in this provision can be good for our economy and our workers, and in that respect I can support it. But I do have an objection to one element of it. When you look at the over 7,000 corporations that are going to benefit from this tax subsidy, you will find on that list names of three corporations which I would like to call to your attention: Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds, and Brown & Williamson. 
   To make it clear, we are saying that the companies that make tobacco products can now continue to sell them overseas with a subsidy from the Federal Treasury to the tune of over $100 million a year. We are saying to these purveyors of these deadly tobacco products that we, in fact, are going to help you in selling your product overseas. 
   Allow me to put this in perspective. The tobacco companies I have named will have domestic profits in the U.S. of $7.2 billion, and we are giving them $100 million to subsidize the sale of tobacco products overseas. Some would stand up and say, well, Senator, why would you pick out the tobacco companies? If you are going to go after companies and the products they make, why wouldn't you go after a lot of other companies, too? 
   Perhaps some arguments can be made along those lines. But let me tell you why I think we should deal with tobacco exports in a different manner than other products being exported. I will use for my evidence on this the statements of Philip Morris, self-published on their website as of 10 days ago. You see all these soft, little gauzy commercials about Philip Morris feeding poor people, helping the elderly, providing scholarships. My friends and those who are witnessing this debate, this is just eyewash. This is an effort by the tobacco companies to tell you they are warm and loving people. 
   Well, these warm and loving people sell a product that kills 400,000 Americans a year. The No. 1 preventable cause of death in America today continues to be tobacco. We have just enacted legislation giving a Federal tax  subsidy to these same tobacco companies to sell this deadly product overseas. Is there any doubt that it is deadly? Well, for decades, the tobacco companies said: You can't prove it; there is no science behind it. We can prove that tobacco may not be harmful. 
   Well, they finally gave up on that sad and disgraceful claim. This is what their web site started publishing 10 days ago. This is Philip Morris. I will read it into the RECORD:   
   Cigarette smoking and disease in smokers: We agree with the overwhelming medical and scientific consensus that cigarette smoke causes lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema, and other serious diseases in smokers. Smokers are far more likely to develop serious diseases like lung cancer than nonsmokers. There is no safe cigarette. These are and have been the messages of public health authorities world-wide. Smokers and potential smokers should rely on these messages in making all smoking-related decisions.  
   Having said that, we have just awarded to the companies that make this deadly product, and want to sell it overseas, a $100 million-a-year tax subsidy. Do you know what that means? It means that the United States of America, which for over a century has been a leader in public health causes around the world, is now going to be a leader in purveying this deadly cigarette and tobacco product in Third World countries. 
   Visit any country that you choose overseas and look at what you see. With the exception of countries such as Poland which, surprisingly, has enacted good legislation to stop tobacco advertising that appeals to children, in country after country, you find the most outrageous, disgraceful activity by American tobacco companies subsidized by American taxpayers selling their deadly product overseas. 
   In the Philippines, a very Catholic country, they give away these calendars showing religious images with American tobacco products. These are the things which American tobacco companies will now be doing with the help of this tax subsidy from Federal taxpayers. 
   Allow me to tell you what we face here. Since 1990, Philip Morris sales have grown by 80 percent overseas. Smoking currently causes more than 3 1/2 million deaths each year throughout the world. Within 20 years, the number is expected to rise to 10 million, with 70 percent of all deaths from smoking in developing countries. Listen to this statistic. This ought to tell you how important this issue is to the world. Tobacco will soon be the leading cause of disease and premature death worldwide, surpassing AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. 
   Do you take any pride as an American citizen that it is our tobacco companies selling these products to children and to unsuspecting people around the world, which will soon be the public health scourge of our globe? Do you take any comfort or satisfaction in the decision we have just made within a few minutes to give a $100 million subsidy each year to these tobacco companies so they can peddle this deadly product to kids and unsuspecting people in countries around the world? Can you hold your head up high as an American, proud that we are now subsidizing this deadly product? Can you visit these countries and see the Marlboro Man and all of the logos we have seen disappearing in America re-emerging in these Third World countries as more and more people are lured into tobacco addiction? Can you be proud as an American of that fact? 
   I am not. I am saddened by it. I am saddened that this leadership refused to allow this bill to even be considered on the floor for an amendment. But that has been the story of the Senate for month after month. We have been afraid to face the reality of debate, afraid to face the tough votes. And for some members from those States that produce tobacco or happen to be friendly to tobacco companies, it would have been a tough vote. But these Senators have been protected from even facing this issue. It is a tax subsidy to tobacco companies that will literally kill people around the world. 
   This country, of which I am so proud to be part, and the State I represent--I am so proud to be their Senator here--will become known to people around the world as the source of death and disease. People now are worried about death from malaria and tuberculosis and AIDS. Sit tight because in a few years you will see other deadly diseases coming across your land--emphysema, lung cancer, heart disease--from America's tobacco products. Marlboros, Camels, all of these products will be overseas. 
   After they put on these sweet little commercials about how much they just love these children and they love these elderly people--they put on these sweet little commercials and spend a lot of money to tell you how lovable Philip Morris is--go to the Philip Morris web site and see what this lovable company sells to make the profits to take Meals on Wheels to an elderly lady. 
   They sell a product which they now readily concede causes death and disease. After 40 years of denial, they finally admitted it. We have decided that we want to subsidize their efforts. It is a sad day in the Senate. I can certainly support this tax effort for the many corporations that will use it responsibly to sell good products overseas, but to think that this Senate will be party to this decision, it is a sad day. 
   It is no surprise. A few years ago when we wanted to hold the tobacco companies accountable for their solicitation of children, it was stopped by the Republican leadership in the Senate. When the Clinton-Gore administration said these tobacco companies owe Federal taxpayers for what they have done to them over the years as they settled, and pay the States for what they had done to their citizens as well, the Republican leadership said, no, stop the lawsuit; don't sue the tobacco companies; leave them alone. These poor tobacco companies, leave them alone. They only have $7.2 billion annually in profits. 
   Well, I believe the Clinton-Gore administration is right. I believe the American people deserve this lawsuit. They deserve the tobacco companies being held accountable and they deserve that these companies finally stop soliciting our children, addicting our children, aggressively stop selling their products to our children. I have been in Congress for 18 years. For the last 12 years, I guess I have fought on this issue more than any other. I can assure my friends in the Senate it is not the end of the debate. To those who want to give this gift to the tobacco companies, they can expect this fight to continue. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Marlene Carls, a very special person who worked in my Springfield office for nearly 20 years. Marlene passed away on October 24. 
   My wife Loretta first introduced me to Marlene almost 20 years ago when I was running for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. Loretta told me Marlene was an excellent worker and she hoped that she would join my campaign. So I sat down with Marlene and offered her a deal she could not refuse. I offered her a beat-up old desk, a run-down office, and not much pay, if she was willing to work for a candidate who had lost three straight elections. In a moment of weakness, she accepted. Marlene was part of our family from that day forward. 
   Marlene was born to be a caseworker and she was the best. She had a heart of gold. She cared so much for the people she was helping. She would take on immigration cases, foreign adoptions, and so many difficult and complicated matters. She would help constituents get the answers they needed. It wasn't just professional assistance to people in time of need; it was much more. Marlene Carls treated people asking for help as members of the family. She did her job so well that I used to get fan mail from constituents who could not thank me enough for the wonderful work that Marlene did. 
   With the immigration cases, we would continue to see the fruit of her work for many years. Marlene and I would go to naturalization ceremonies in Springfield twice a year. 
   And as they would call out the name of a new citizen she would nudge me and say, ``Boss''--she always called me ``Boss''--``Boss, that's one of ours.'' It was the same kind of pride a mother has when her son or daughter crosses the stage at a graduation ceremony. She knew the people she had helped; she cared about them; she rejoiced in their success and happiness. 
   She showed the same caring for our military cases: mothers and fathers desperate to reach their sons and daughters in uniform--to bring them home for an emergency--to get them out of a scrape--or just to learn if they were alive in a crisis. 
   Marlene learned the military lingo and reached the point where she could charm the stripes off a sergeant or the stars off a general. Many families in Illinois found peace of mind because of Marlene Carls' hard work. 
   And she took such delight in knowing that someone's life had been made a little better off because of her efforts. 
   Marlene, or ``Mo'' as we came to call her, was proud of her family. Her son Kelly Carls, her daughter Cathleen Stock, and her two grandchildren, Kayla Lynn and Julia Anne Stock, were the apples of her eye. I was pleased to watch their progress through her eyes. 
   Marlene also had so many friends. At her memorial service last Friday in Springfield, the chapel was packed with family, fellow staffers, and friends from other governmental offices. The group from the National Park Service where we have our senatorial office came out in uniform to be there for Marlene--clergy from many different religions and many ordinary people who had the good luck of asking Marlene for a helping hand. 
   Mo was active as a volunteer for the Alzheimer's Association and the American Cancer Society. In everything she did, people and a concern for people took first place. In our office, her care for others and wise advice led people to call her ``Mama Mo.'' 
   A lesser known fact is that Marlene was an amazing writer. I remember she had written a piece in a contest and won a free trip to Hollywood. She was just so proud of that. 
   She had a long-time dream to visit Ireland. Over her desk was a picture of herself and ``Tip'' O'Neill. She really valued that photograph as a reminder of her Irish heritage. She and Kathy Anderson of my staff had the trip to Ireland planned. But they weren't able to make the journey because of Marlene's illness. At her wake, I closed with an Irish blessing from all of us to a wonderful person and great public servant. 
 May the road rise up to meet you. May the wind be always at your back. May the sun shine warm upon your face, The rain fall soft upon your fields. And until we meet again, May God hold you in the hollow of His hand.  
   We will dearly miss Marlene Carls.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, earlier this morning I held a press conference with a colleague of mine from the State of Illinois, RAY LAHOOD. RAY LAHOOD is a Congressman from the city of Peoria, and a Republican. It was interesting to see a bipartisan press conference at this point in the congressional session. 
   Congressman LAHOOD and I agree on an issue which could become supremely important in just a few days. Given the tight Presidential race this year, we have the possibility that the winning candidate for President might not win the popular vote in our country. This  potential outcome highlights a serious and persistent flaw in our current system of electing a Chief Executive of the United States. 
   I am introducing a joint resolution to amend the Constitution to replace the electoral college with the direct election of the President and Vice President. 
   I introduced a similar measure in 1993 with Congressman GERALD KLECZKA of Wisconsin in the House. I will be doing the same in the Senate. But I hope to attract the support of colleagues on both sides of the aisle regardless of the outcome on November 7. 
   The electoral college is an antiquated institution that has outlived its purpose. It was the product of contentious debate and a great deal of controversy. Most of the delegates to the Constitutional Convention in 1787 felt that the process of selecting a President should not be left up to a direct vote of the people. And most agreed with the sentiments of George Mason of Virginia, who said, ``it were as unnatural to refer the choice of a proper character for Chief Magistrate to the people, as it would be to refer a trial of colors to a blind man.'' 
   After a prolonged debate, an indirect method of electing the President was adopted. This compromise plan, known as the Electoral College Method, provided for the election of the President and Vice President by State appointed electors. Under Article II, Section 1, Clause 2 of the Constitution as amended by the 12th Amendment in 1804, each state is required to appoint in a manner determined by the state legislature a number of electors equal in number to its congressional representation. If no candidate receives a simple majority of electoral votes, then the House of Representatives chooses the President from the three candidates with the greatest number of votes and the Senate similarly chooses a Vice President from the top two contenders for that office. 
   The commonly held opinion among the delegates in 1787 was that matters of such gravity should not be left up to the average citizen. Moreover, the discussions of the convention reveal that the delegates questioned whether voters in one State could have enough relevant knowledge regarding the character of public men living hundreds of miles away. In addition, the delegates from the less populous States were concerned that a direct election of the 
   President would enhance the power and prestige of the more populous states. 
   But today, these concerns are no longer compelling--if they ever were. 
   The 17th amendment to the Constitution was ratified in 1913 and provided for the direct popular election of U.S. Senators. Before that, Senators were chosen by State legislatures. But come 1913, we decided to trust the people to choose the Senators. I don't believe our Nation suffered by that decision. I think the Senate as an institution has been enhanced by that decision. It is no longer a back-room deal in a State capitol that sends a Senator to Washington, it is a decision made by the people of each State in an open and free election. 
   The incredible advances in communication technologies since the 18th Century render moot the concerns that citizens do not have enough information to make an informed decision about a President. Clearly potential voters today have more information about presidential candidates than their counterparts had 200 years ago regarding their directly elected Representatives to Congress. 
   It has been argued that smaller States have a slight advantage in the current system, because states receive a minimum of three electoral votes, regardless of their population. However, any serious study of presidential campaigns would demonstrate that the more populous states, with their large electoral prizes, as well as medium sized swing states, have the true advantage. The winner-take-all aspect in each State motivates presidential candidates to focus on States with a moderate or large number of electoral votes, assuming the candidates believe they have a chance to win the popular vote there. Less populous States with only a few electoral votes are largely ignored. Also States that are heavily leaning toward one of the presidential candidates are similarly ignored. 
   You do not see AL GORE and JOE LIEBERMAN spend that much time in the State of Texas, nor do you find George W. Bush visiting the State of New York very often. Most campaigns have written off certain States. So the people in that State do not see much of the Presidential campaign except for national coverage. 
   Clearly, there is a reason why there have been more congressionally proposed constitutional amendments on this subject than any other. The electoral college system, as it stands today, has several major defects. The most significant of these are the result of voting schemes other than a direct popular vote. The most prevalent example is the unit vote or so-called winner-take-all formula. The unit vote is the practice of awarding all of a State's electoral votes to the candidate with a popular vote plurality in the State, regardless of whether the plurality is one vote or one million votes. All States and the District of Columbia with the exception of the States of Maine and Nebraska have adopted this method. 
   In doing my research on this isue, I learned that Maine and Nebraska vote by congressional district and allocate their Presidential electors accordingly. 
   The first problem with the electoral college system is that it is inherently unfair and may disenfranchise voters. Senator Birch Bayh--father of our colleague, Senator EVAN BAYH--discussed this problem on the floor of the Senate when he introduced a resolution to abolish the electoral college on January 15, 1969. During his floor statement he said:  
   As a result, the popular vote totals of the losing candidate at the State level are completely discounted in the final electoral tabulation. In effect, millions of voters are disenfranchised if they happen to vote for the losing candidate in their State.  
   The famous Missouri Senator Thomas Hart Benton, who was the first Senator to serve in the Senate for 30 years, further pointed out the injustice of this system when he said:  
   To lose votes is the fate of all minorities, and it is their duty to submit; but this is not the case of votes lost, but of votes taken away, added to those of the majority and given to a person to whom the minority is opposed.  
   Another problem with the electoral college system is that it often leads to wide disparities between the popular vote and the electoral vote. For example, since 1824, when the popular vote first began to be recorded along with the electoral vote, winners of presidential elections have averaged 51 percent of the popular vote as compared to an average of 71 percent of the electoral vote. In comparison, the losing main opponents have averaged 42 percent of the popular vote, but just 27 percent of the electoral vote. Year to year statistics vary greatly. 
   A more serious problem is that the electoral college system can lead to Presidents who received fewer popular votes than their main opponent. In fact, this has happened 3 times out of the 42 presidential elections since 1824. 
   Another indication as to the likelihood of a non-majority President can be seen in the elections of 1844, 1880, 1884, 1960, and 1968, in which the main opponent lost the popular vote by an average of only 0.3 percent. This is in stark contrast to the winning margin in electoral votes for these elections, which averaged 17 percent. Other close presidential elections occurred in 1916, 1948, and 1976. In those years, if a mere few thousand votes had been switched in a few key states where the vote was close, a different candidate would have won the White House. In 1916, for example, a shift of only 2,000 votes in California would have made Charles Evans Hughes President, despite Woodrow Wilson's half-million popular vote advantage. And in 1976, a 6,000 vote shift in Ohio and a 4,000 vote shift in Hawaii would have elected Gerald Ford, even though Jimmy Carter won the popular vote by 1.6 million ballots. 
   One can conclude that approximately one in fourteen presidential elections have resulted in a non-majority President, while one in five have nearly resulted in one. 
   Senator Birch Bayh eloquently pointed out the risk of this system in his floor statement on January 15, 1969:  
   The present electoral vote system has in the past, and may in the future, produce a President who has received fewer popular votes than his opponent. I cannot see how such a system can be beneficial to the American people. I see, instead, only grave dangers that could divide this Nation at a critical hour if the President-elect lacked a popular mandate.   
   The third pernicious flaw in the electoral college system is that it produces artificial distortions in the political process. The fact that presidential candidates cater to the larger and swing states often gives undue influence to a limited number of contested States. So-called safe States are given scant or no attention by candidates--who have limited time, energy, and resources. Senator Thomas J. Dodd, the distinguished Senator from Connecticut who was known as an ardent crusader and civil rights advocate, argued convincingly on this subject soon after President Kennedy's narrow victory in 1960. He said:  
   The shift of a few thousand votes in these States would have elected Dewey in 1948. The shift of a few thousand votes in Illinois and New Jersey could have changed the result of an election as close as this past one. There is something wrong with an election system which hinges, not on the vote of 70 million, but on the vote of several thousand in a few key States.  
   The issue isn't simply that every vote matters in a close election. The issue is the injustice of a few thousand votes in just a few states having a disproportional impact on a National election. Why should a vote in Missouri or Florida be worth more to a presidential candidate than one in Wyoming, Mississippi, or Rhode Island? 
   The fourth and last major flaw in the electoral college system is that electors, in general, are not bound to cast their vote in accordance with the popular vote results from their State. While some States require a binding oath or pledge under penalty of law, the majority of States have no or an insignificant penalty. This leads to the disturbing possibility that a President, in an election with a close electoral vote, could win through subterfuge. Instances of rogue electors casting votes contrary to the results in their State have occurred in the following years: 1948, 1956, 1960, 1968, 1972, 1976, and 1988. 
   Since 1797, when Representative William L. Smith of South Carolina offered the first Constitutional amendment proposing to reform our procedure for electing the President, hardly a session of Congress has passed without the introduction of one or more similar proposals. According to the Congressional Research Service, approximately 109 constitutional amendments on electoral college reform were introduced in Congress between 1889 and 1946. Another 265 were introduced between 1947 and 1968. The distinguished Senator from South Carolina Olin Johnston summed up the sentiments of many of the critics of the electoral college system when he said on the floor of the Senate on January 5, 1961:  
   All of these proposals recognized ..... that the so-called electoral college system has never functioned as contemplated by the framers of the Constitution.  
   While all of these attempts failed, the most successful effort took place after the 1968 presidential election when third party candidate George Wallace received 46 electoral votes. In that election, there was considerable concern that no candidate would receive a majority of electoral votes and that the new President would be selected by the House of Representatives. As a result, H.J. Res. 681 was introduced by Representative Emanuel Celler in the 91st Congress, proposing to abolish the electoral college and replace it with the direct popular election of the President and Vice President. Included in H.J. Res. 681 was a provision for a runoff election if no candidate received at least 40 percent of the 
   popular vote. While this joint resolution passed the House on September 18, 1969, by a vote of 338-70, it died in the Senate because of a filibuster by Senators from small States and southern States. 
   The joint resolution I am introducing today is similar to H.J. Res. 681, in that it calls for the direct election of the President and Vice President and includes a provision for a runoff election. More specifically, in the event that no candidate receives at least 40 percent of the popular vote, a runoff would be held 21 days after the general election between the two candidates with the greatest number of popular votes. This resolution builds upon a proposal I offered with Representative GERALD KLECZKA in 1993 and other resolutions introduced in the current Congress by Representatives RAY LAHOOD and JAMES LEACH. 
   Every public opinion poll indicates that an overwhelming majority of Americans want to elect their President directly by popular vote. Direct popular election has been endorsed in the past by a large number of civic-minded groups including the American Bar Association, the AFL-CIO, the UAW, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Federation of Independent Business, and the NAACP. 
   If we believe that the President represents and speaks for the people of this great country, then we have an obligation to allow the people to have their voices heard. Abraham Lincoln once said, ``Public opinion is everything. With it, nothing can fail. Without it, nothing can succeed.'' 
   Mr. President, to reiterate, as Congressman LAHOOD and I said in our bipartisan press conference, although this is an issue which apparently seems so rational and so easy to argue, it is one that has run into a lot of debate on the floor of the Senate. I spoke to one of my colleagues from a smaller State and told him what I was doing. He said: I'll oppose you all the way because my tiny State has three electoral votes, and the Presidental candidate has been spending a lot of time in my State and would spend no time there if we had to rely on a popular vote. 
   But it seems strange to me we rely on a popular vote for virtually every other election in America but not the Presidential election. If we have a disparity between the popular vote for President and the electoral vote for President, if we have someone elected President who does not receive a majority of the votes of the American people, it will create a problem for that administration. It is tough enough to lead in this great Nation, tough enough for a President to muster popular support for difficult decisions to be made. But if that President does not bring a mandate from the people to the office, his power will be diminished. 
   I sincerely hope that does not occur. But whether or not, I hope my colleagues will join me supporting this effort to abolish the electoral college and say we trust the people in this country. The arguments made over 200 years ago do not apply today. The people of this country should choose the President as they choose Members of Congress as well as U.S. Senators. 
   I ask unanimous consent a copy of the legislation be printed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, you can expect the Halloween thing to be part of most of our speeches on the floor today regardless of the issue at stake. It is Halloween, and children of all ages will be dressing up in their favorite costume and ringing doorbells yelling: Trick or treat. 
   Our Halloween tradition that we enjoyed as kids, and even as adults, dates back to Celtic practices, when on this day witches and other evil spirits were believed to roam the Earth, playing tricks to mark the season of diminishing sunlight. 
   The 106th Congress is waning. Our legislative days will soon be coming to an end, and we will be ending the legislative term with a cruel legislative trick: a bankruptcy conference report masquerading as a State Department authorization bill. You know Congress is close to adjournment when slick procedural maneuvers are used to bring a one-sided work product to the Senate floor. 
   The majority found a shell conference report, they basically held a meeting without an official conference committee, struck the contents of the original bill, and plugged in the bankruptcy bill that we have before us today. Rather than negotiate with Democrats directly or work to produce a bipartisan bill that the President might support, they went back to their old tactic: Take it or leave it; this is the Republican version; this is the version supported by business. Take it or leave it. 
   When I hear all the claims in the Presidential campaign about bipartisanship, I shake my head when I look at the Republican leadership in the Senate and the House which continuously stops the Democrats from participating. If we are 
   going to have bipartisanship, shouldn't we have it on a bill as important as bankruptcy reform? 
   Let me say from the outset, I support bankruptcy reform. Two years ago, I was on the Judiciary Committee and the subcommittee with jurisdiction over this issue. Senator GRASSLEY and I spent countless hours with our staffs trying to come up with meaningful and fair bankruptcy reform. 
   We had a good bill. Ninety-seven Members of the Senate voted for it. I thought that was a pretty good endorsement of a bipartisan effort, but it has gone downhill consistently ever since. 
   That bill was then trapped in a conference committee that was totally Republican, no Democrats allowed. They brought back a work product that was the byproduct, I guess, of the best wishes of the credit industry. It had no balance to it whatsoever. Frankly, it was defeated. Then we turned around--I guess it wasn't called; it would have been defeated by Presidential veto. 
   Then over the next 2 years, others worked on this issue, and I hoped we would return to a bipartisan approach. It did not happen. So for all of the calls for bipartisanship by the Republican side of the aisle, when it comes to conference committees, no Democrats are allowed. Republicans said: Take it or leave it. In this case, we should definitely leave it. 
   The bankruptcy code is a complex piece of law. When I was debating this in earlier years, I marveled at the fact that I was considered to be one of the spokesmen on the issue of bankruptcy. 
   What is my experience in bankruptcy? Thirty years ago I took a  bankruptcy course in law school, and 20 years ago I was a trustee in a bankruptcy in Springfield, IL. That is the sum and substance of my experience in bankruptcy, and I turned out to be one of the more experienced people at the table on the issue, one I had to relearn the complexities of in a short period of time. 
   A constant theme has guided me through this debate, and that is: Yes, there are people who go to bankruptcy court and file, abusing the system, gaming the system, trying to avoid their responsibility to pay their just debts. I believe that is the case, and if this law is directed at those people, I am for it. 
   Secondly, I believe there are abuses on the other side as well. I do not need to tell the others who are gathered and those following this debate how many credit card solicitations you receive at home. Quite a few, I bet. I will go through some statistics in a few minutes about the volume of credit card solicitations. 
   I have a godson in Springfield, IL, Neil Houlihan. He is now 7 or 8 years old. He got his first credit card solicitation at the age of 6. This is a bright young man, but I do not believe that at the age of 6, when you are learning to ride a bicycle, you should have a credit card in your back pocket. Obviously, MasterCard did and sent Neil his solicitation. 
   They have sent solicitations to children, people in prison, and family pets. Everyone gets one. Every time you go home at night, you sort through all the offers to give you a new credit card. In a way, it is flattering; you feel empowered: You get to make that decision. In another way, the credit card industry would have us carry as many pieces of plastic in our pocket as possible, with little or no concern as to whether we can handle 
   the debt. 
   What I believe--and I hope others agree with me--is we should not ration credit in America nor should we ration information about credit in America. We ought to know, as individuals, what the terms of these credit card agreements are, what the traps are that you can hardly read with a magnifying glass on the back of your statement. We have a right to know what we are getting into. If it is a caveat-emptor situation, it is not fair. Consumers have a right to know. 
   The democratization of credit in America has made this a better place to live. I understand the fact that not too many years ago, if a woman was a waitress in a restaurant, the likelihood that she could get a credit card was next to zero. Today she could qualify for one. That is a good development. 
   We have to look at the abuse of solicitation of credit cards and what it leads to. The credit card industry wants us to close down the loopholes in the bankruptcy code, but they do not want us to look at the loopholes in their own system. When I explain the details, my colleagues will understand. 
   They say this is a reflection on the moral decadence of America; that so many people are filing for bankruptcy. I assume those who abuse the system may be morally decadent. Let someone else be the judge of it. At least it raises that issue. 
   I asked the credit card industry: Do you have a moral responsibility? Are you meeting your moral responsibility? When you flood people who are not creditworthy with solicitations for more credit cards, are you meeting your responsibility? When you put ATMs at casinos, are you meeting your responsibility? When you go to football games and basketball games at the college level on up and say, We can give you a beautiful sweatshirt that shows the University of Illinois symbol if you, as a student, will sign up for a credit card, are you meeting your moral responsibility? 
   When the dean at Indiana University says the No. 1 reason kids drop out of school is credit card debt--they have so much debt accumulated, they have to go to work and try to pay some of it off--are you meeting your moral responsibility? 
   This field of morality can be a little tricky, but this credit card industry does not believe they have a special responsibility in this debate. I think they are wrong. 
   In 1999, there were 3.5 billion credit card solicitations mailed to American households. Let me tell you why that is interesting. There are 78 million creditworthy households in America and 3.5 billion credit card solicitations. Do you ever wonder why your mailbox is full of these solicitations? They are, frankly, coming at you in every direction, and it is not just through the mails; it is in magazines; it is on television; it is everywhere you turn. They try to lure you into signing up for another credit card with very few questions asked. 
   These 3.5 billion credit card solicitations, frankly, do not tell you all you need to know about the obligations you are incurring. 
   I continue to believe, as I did when this debate got started, when we passed a strong disclosure provision, that consumers were entitled to know some very basic things. 
   This is one of the things I suggested but which the credit card industry rejected. It is just this simple. I think they ought to say, in every credit card statement: If you make the minimum monthly payment required, it will take you X number of months to pay off the balance. When you have paid it off, this is how much you will have paid in interest and how much you will have paid in principal. 
   That is not a tough thing to calculate; it is not a radical suggestion; it is disclosure, so that someone who looks at a credit card debt--let's say they want to pay the 2 percent monthly minimum on $1,295.28--is told, as part of routine disclosure, it will take them 93 months--that is more than 7 years--to pay off the balance. And when it is all over, their payments will have come to $2,418, almost twice the original balance. 
   The credit card industry said that is an outrageous disclosure that they would disclose this to people to whom they send monthly statements. At first they said it was not technologically possible. That is laughable, in this world of computers, that they could not tell you that basic information. They do not want to tell you that because they understand, as long as people are paying that minimum monthly payment, they are going to be trapped forever in paying more and more interest. 
   There are times when people cannot pay more than the minimum monthly balance. That is a decision--a conscious decision--consumers should make. But I think the credit card industry owes it to people across America to tell them the terms of what they are getting into. Frankly, they have resisted that all along. 
   It is my understanding that a lot of the language we have put in here about credit card disclosure, and even saw in the Senate bill, has basically been eliminated. It is my understanding that it has been weakened in many respects. 
   The Republican leadership brings this bill to the floor and permits banks with less than $250 million in assets--and that, incidentally, is over 80 percent of the banks in America--to have the Federal Reserve provide its customers with a toll free number to review their credit card balances for the next 2 years. So instead of telling you on a monthly statement, with all the information they pile in--all the circulars, all the advertising--they are going to give you an 800 number and say: You can call here, and maybe they will answer your question as to how much you are ultimately going to have to pay. You know that isn't going to happen. The credit card industry knows it is not going to happen. That is as far as they want to go. 
   Let me tell you about another thing that is amazing. It is called the homestead exemption. Did you know, in most States now, if you file for bankruptcy, you are allowed to claim as an exemption--in other words, protected from the bankruptcy court and your creditors--your homestead, your home? But every State has a different standard about how much you are allowed to exempt. 
   My colleague, Senator KOHL of Wisconsin, basically said we ought to get right of this because fat cats go out and buy magnificent homes and mansions and ranches and farms and call them their homes, plow everything they have into them, and then 
   say to their creditors they have nothing to put on the table. 
   We had instances where the Commissioner of Baseball many years ago--one of the former Commissioners of Baseball--managed to protect a mansion in  Florida because he bought it in time before he filed for bankruptcy. We had a lot of well-known actors and actresses who turned around and did the same thing in southern California. 
   The average person does not have that benefit. Many States do not allow much more than a modest exemption for the homestead. We said, under Senator KOHL's amendment, that we would create a $100,000 nationwide cap on homestead exemptions. I think it makes sense. But, frankly, it did not survive. Now, under this bill that is before us, if you have owned property for more than 2 years, then there is virtually no limitation. It is up to the States to decide again. I think that is a mistake. This is a departure. 
   The other area is clinic violence. This gets to a point that is worth speaking to. Senator SCHUMER of New York brought this point forward. If someone is engaged in violence at an abortion clinic--and it has happened; we have seen it happen--and they are found to be responsible in a court of law for their wrongdoing, and they are held responsible for damages to be paid, in many cases all they need to do is file for bankruptcy, and they are virtually discharged of all responsibility on that debt. 
   I think that is wrong. By a vote of 80-17 the Senate agreed with me. But Senator SCHUMER's amendment did not survive this conference, and it is not going to be considered. As a result, we find a situation where those who are guilty of clinic violence, people such as Randal Terry and Flip Benham, have usurped our clinic protection laws by feigning bankruptcy. 
   Did you know, even student loans are not dischargeable under bankruptcy under chapter 13? Yet these folks have been engaged in violent activity, found guilty by a jury of their peers, and use this bankruptcy code as a shield. 
   I tried to add some provisions in the Senate bill that gave the bankruptcy judges more flexibility in applying a means test for moderate-income debtors. It was stricken from the bill. 
   Who actually files for bankruptcy? It is interesting to see. You might think that it is the high rollers, but it turns out to be some of the poorest people in America. The average income of people filing for bankruptcy over the last 20 years continues to go down. That income, at this point, is below $25,000 a year for the people who are filing for bankruptcy. 
   Why do people file for bankruptcy? Some of them may have calculated how they can come out ahead by doing it. But look at what happens in most cases. Older Americans are less likely to end up in bankruptcy than younger Americans, but when they do file, 40 percent of them give medical debt as the reason for filing. Elizabeth Warren of Harvard tells us, overall, 46 percent of the people filing for bankruptcy do so because of medical debt. 
   We spent a lot of time on the Senate floor talking about hospital bills and prescription drug bills. When people become so overwhelmed by a catastrophic illness, they end up in bankruptcy court. 
   Both men and women are more likely to declare bankruptcy 
   following divorce. That is the second instance in people's lives, divorces. They, of course, end up with a situation where people have to file because they can't make ends meet. The spouse who has the responsibility of raising the children may find herself in bankruptcy court. 
   The way this bill is written, there is not adequate protection for those women. That is why most women's groups, as well as consumer groups, oppose this bill as written. 
   Of course, unemployed workers who lose their jobs; that is the third instance that drives people into bankruptcy court. 
   So you find over and over again that the catastrophic events of a lifetime force people into bankruptcy court. Most of them do not go there because they want to. They are forced into that situation. This bill does not help them, does not protect them. Basically, it provides more power for the creditors and less power for the debtors who find themselves in these awful circumstances. 
   An interesting thing has occurred since this debate started 3 or 4 years ago. There was a lot of complaints about the number of bankruptcy filings going up in America in a time of prosperity. That was true. It is a strange thing, but people get overconfident and they get too far in debt, and they can't get out or they run into one of the three catastrophes that I mentioned. But something has happened. 
   In the first 37 weeks of this year, 861,846 people filed for bankruptcy. That is a lot of people. But basically the number of bankruptcy filings is on a decline. According to a study by the University of Maryland's Department of Economics, ``Remarkably, there have been 138,000 fewer personal bankruptcies in the current year to date than during the corresponding period of 1998, a cumulative decline of greater than 15 percent in the per capita bankruptcy rate.'' So that says to us, the explosive growth of bankruptcies has turned around. I cannot tell you exactly why, but that was one of the reasons why we even started discussing this bill. 
   It was told to us by the White House and the chief of staff of the President, John Podesta, the President will veto this bill as written. I hope he does. I hope those who support meaningful bankruptcy reform, balanced bankruptcy reform, will realize we cannot go through this process on a slam dunk, take it or leave it; Republicans will meet and decide--and Democrats will be left out--and pass a bill of this significance. 
   The groups that oppose this include not only the AFL-CIO, representing working men and women across America, but also NARAL, the National Partnership for Women and Children, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, the Religious Action Center, the Consumers Union--virtually every one of them--75 law professors from across the country who have tried to take an objective look at this bill, even groups from my own home State of Illinois. The Bankruptcy Center, which over the past 3 years has filed over 6,000 bankruptcies on behalf of their clients, has written me with their concerns about the bankruptcy bill. 
   So it comes down to this. We have a lopsided bill, perpetrated as part of a political process around here that is becoming too common, where they take a bill that has nothing to do with bankruptcy and shove the contents into it. And the Republicans dictate what will be in it and do not even invite the Democrats to participate in the discussion, bring it to the floor and say: Take it or leave it. 
   The credit industry that wants this bill refuses to concede the most basic concessions to us when it comes to the disclosures they would make on credit card solicitations and the monthly statements on the bill so that consumers can make a rational choice about how much credit they can handle. They basically have told us: This is it; take it or leave it. 
   I think we should leave it. It is time for us as a Nation to say, yes, we can reform bankruptcy but do it in a balanced fashion. 
   I salute my colleague, the Senator from Minnesota, for his leadership. I hope colleagues on both sides of the aisle will think twice and join me in voting against cloture. This bill needs further debate, the debate it did not have in conference committee. I hope we can come up with a better work product. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me follow up on a statement made by the Senator from Nevada about the choice the American people are facing in just a very few days. 
   I think if you believe that governing America is easy business, then the choice is easy, too. 
   I happen to think that the set of circumstances the next President will face is pretty challenging. 
   I can recall only a few years ago on the floor of the Senate when we spent most of our time debating deficits and talking about constitutional amendments to end deficits. But now we are debating surpluses. What are we going to do with the extra money? 
   We believe on the Democratic side that the first obligation has to be to reduce the national debt so that our kids don't carry that burden, and strengthening Social Security and Medicare. We believe that after we have met those obligations, we should target tax cuts to help the middle-income and working families deal with problems that are meaningful, 
   problems such as paying for college education for their kids. 
   We believe on the Democratic side we should be able to deduct up to $12,000 a year of tuition fees paid for your children in college. I have taken that across the State of Illinois, a pretty diverse State, and it is widely accepted. People believe that is an excellent change in the Tax Code. 
   We also want to give families--working families, single mothers, too, for that matter, who need to have good quality day care--an additional tax credit so they can afford to leave their kids in safe day care. We say to the mother who wants to make the sacrifice to stay home with the kids, you deserve a tax break too; you are making a sacrifice. Our Tax Code should recognize that. That is targeted tax cuts the Democrats support. 
   So many people have aging parent and grandparents. We want to increase the deductibility of expenses incurred in caring for their parents. Baby boomers have noted their parents need extra help as they live a longer life. They need extra assistance. We want to be there. The Tax Code should support families who do their best to help relatives, to help their parents. 
   We believe, bringing this together, we can keep America moving forward because we won't be embarking on a risky tax scheme, one that has been proposed by Governor Bush. The idea of $1.6 trillion in tax cuts, 40 percent of which go to the wealthiest people in America, is a bitter pill to swallow. Who are the top 1 percent wage earners in America? People who make over $25,000 a month, over $300,000 a year. Governor Bush says these poor struggling people making only $300,000 a year need a tax break, $2,000 a month worth of a tax break. 
   I am sorry, but, frankly, I prefer to target that tax break to the people who really need it. A fellow such as Bill Gates at Microsoft has been very successful, God bless him for his creativity, but this man's net worth is greater as an individual than the combined net worth of 106 million Americans. Does he need Governor Bush's tax break? I don't think so. I know a lot of families across Illinois want to have a tax break to send one of their kids to college so that kid might have a chance to have a successful career and business or whatever they choose. 
   That is the difference. That is the choice. I think a lot of people in this election want to overlook a little history. Let me share some of that history.

   Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from Nevada is right. If we pay down our debt, we stop borrowing to service the debt. As we stop borrowing, the demand for capital goes down. That is, the cost of capital goes down, which is the interest rate. As interest rates go down, every family in America can feel it on their mortgage payment, on their loan for school payment, or their auto payment. That is as good as, if not better than, a tax cut, if we reduce that burden on our kids and bring down the interest rates in the process.

   Mr. DURBIN. That is exactly right. If you really believe in family values, is there a stronger family value than a son or daughter willing to sacrifice for an aging and ailing parent? If we are going to support family values with the Tax Code, shouldn't we include in that Tax Code some assistance for your friend and her situation? They would give $2,000 in tax breaks to Bill Gates, and he wouldn't even notice it. I am telling you, your friend will, as will a lot of other baby boomers across American who are caring for their parents. That is the difference. That is the choice. It really is a graphic choice. 
   If you look at this chart, there has been a suggestion that having surpluses at the Federal level must be easy, so anybody can do it, yet history tells otherwise. It wasn't until halfway through the Clinton-Gore administration that we finally turned the corner, and now we are generating the largest surplus in history. We are paying down America's debt for the first time. 
   Look at all the red ink that occurred under Ronald Reagan and President George Bush and the early years of the Clinton administration. We finally turned this corner in the belief we could do a $1.6 trillion tax cut for the wealthiest people and take $1 trillion out of the Social Security surplus and use it for some privatization scheme. Frankly, I don't think that is responsible. If I owe anything to the people of Illinois and this country, it is to maintain the economic growth and prosperity we have seen. 
   Let me mention one other point. Basic economics says Alan Greenspan's greatest fear is inflation. Every time he thinks we are moving toward inflation, what does he do? He raises interest rates a notch and slows things down. I can also say you can create inflation with government spending or tax reductions. Injecting $1.6 trillion into our Nation's economy through tax cuts will energize the economy and create inflationary pressure, forcing the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in response. 
   So George W. Bush gives a tax break on one hand and creates an economic circumstance that raises interest rates on the other. You get to take your new tax break and pay for a higher ARM, your adjustable rate mortgage on your home. There is no benefit to your family. There is a real benefit if you reduce the debt, the deficit of this country, and make sure our kids don't bear that burden.

   Mr. DURBIN. I don't think there is any doubt. It was a tough vote, and we both know some of our colleagues lost their reelection campaigns because of it, because people demagogued and said it was the biggest tax increase. 
   It was on the wealthiest people in the country and also the biggest tax cut in history, and it was right thing to do. It was the right medicine. People on Wall Street and the business community know we finally have a President who will take a difficult but necessary path toward bringing us to a surplus economy. That is exactly what has happened. 
   To think this could happen under any President, I say, is wishful thinking, because I have served under three Presidents and I can say in the early days we didn't see any indication that the deficits were going to decrease. In fact, just the opposite is true. We can see in the President George Bush era the deficits were increasing each year. It wasn't until the Clinton-Gore administration started that the deficits were reduced, leading to a surplus. 
   Then take a look at the overall impact to which the Senator from Nevada alludes. We are in the longest economic expansion in the history of the United States of America, 115 months. We have seen the effort made, the longest sustained surplus coming out of our Federal deficit in our history. We have seen more money generated to pay down debt than at any time in our history. What does it mean? 
   As the Senator has noted, the unemployment rate of this country has been coming down steadily since 1992, the election of Bill Clinton and AL GORE. We can see the unemployment rate is the lowest peacetime level in 42 years. This does not happen automatically. It isn't just something we can expect to see automatically. We have to make the right choices. Some of them are difficult. Some are painful. Some are easily demagogued in 30-second ads. These choices have paid off for America. 
   Let me show the Senator from Nevada some charts to back up other things he said: 22 million new jobs have been created under the Clinton-Gore administration. Is this something that is easy to do? Obviously, President George Bush couldn't do it. In his 4 years, he managed to create some 2.5 million jobs; President Reagan, 16 million under his 8-year period. But 22 million were created across this country in Clinton-Gore. 
   There used to be a debate whether we value work. Since I was a little boy growing up in my family, work was important. You proved your mettle as a person by going to work. Now 22 million Americans have a chance to go to work and their chance to realize the America dream. 
   Look at the inflation rate. This is the lowest level since 1965. Inflation being low means a lot of people can understand that their take-home pay is still worth a lot if it keeps up with inflation. 
   In the bad old days, we had inflation rates in double digits. Now we are down to an inflation rate that is below 3 percent. People who are always left out in this equation are the poorest in America. We see now the lowest poverty rate in two decades was in 1999. It means basically we have not just helped those the best off in America, we have tried to help everybody. 
   That means more job creation bringing more people off welfare, and our welfare rolls are the lowest they have been in modern memory. All these positive things have occurred. The question people have to face in the election on November 7 is basically the same election question Ronald Reagan posed many years ago: Are you better off today than you were 8 years ago? For the vast majority of Americans the answer is, overwhelmingly, yes. There is a fear, of course, unless we make the right decisions and elect the right leaders, we could jeopardize that situation. 
   Look at Federal spending. I noticed George W. Bush goes around saying AL GORE wants to spend more and more at the Federal level, but this chart shows spending is moving in the opposite direction. Since the election of Bill Clinton in 1992, we have seen a steady decline of Federal spending as a percentage of our gross domestic product. Our spending is more effective. We are trying to do things that are important for America, and it has been evidenced in our economy and economic growth.  
   Take a look a little more closely at the tax cut that would be happening here under the proposals we have seen from George W. Bush. We see basically the average tax cut for the lowest 20 percent of Americans ends up this year being worth about $18. If you happen to be in the top 1 percent, it is worth over $4,000. As you look at these, you understand this is a clear choice. 
   I want to go back to one point made by the Senator from Nevada. I think it is an important one. Last week it wasn't the Democratic Party, it wasn't the Republican Party, it was the American Academy of Actuaries that analyzed the George W. Bush proposal for Social Security. This is a group that is supposed to know their business when it comes to analyzing what policy changes would mean. 
   Here is what they said in their release of October 27: Bush's plan on Social Security would signal a return to Federal budget deficits around 2015. 
   How could that be good for America? How could it be good for us to go back to a deficit situation, adding to our national debt and drawing more money out of the economy to pay interest on it, raising interest rates, creating an inflationary spiral? 
   They went on to say:  
   Texas Governor George W. Bush's plan to cut taxes and divert Social Security payroll taxes to establish individual accounts would make it all but impossible to eliminate the publicly held national debt.

   Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair. 
   The program is a pay-as-you-go system, meaning most of the payroll taxes collected now are disbursed to recipients. We say, If we draw money out of Social Security, and we know we need to have it, how do you replace it? He was asked repeatedly in the third debate: Governor Bush, how do you replace the $1 trillion you take out of Social Security? He cannot answer the question because the hard answer to that question is the only way to replace it is to take one of three options: Reduce Social Security benefits; raise the payroll tax on Social Security; or somehow extend the retirement age beyond 67. 
   I do not think any of those is a popular option. I hope we never have to face them, but if Governor Bush is going to propose massive changes in Social Security, then he has to face the music and explain it to the American people before the election. 
   I would like to address a separate issue, but one equally important in this debate over the next President of the United States.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the pace of U.S. deployments and the use of force overseas has been a hot issue in policy debates in Congress and on the campaign trail. Presidential candidate, Governor George W. Bush, says that he will put an end to the Clinton Administration's ``vague, aimless and endless deployments;'' that he would replace ``uncertain missions with well-defined objectives.''

   Mr. DURBIN. I want to look at why a deployment of between 10,000 and 30,000 soldiers to the Balkans, or deployments of several thousand military personnel at a time for disaster relief or humanitarian aid could disrupt a military that has a combined force of about 2.2 million active and reserve personnel. 
   The hardships suffered by our men and women in uniform are painfully real and should not be understated. I salute the sacrifices our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines are making everyday to defend our national security. Many of these hardships have arisen because the world has changed drastically and so has our military. 
   Our military has changed from a post-World War II forward-based force to much more of a projection force. When we talk about deployments going up, we are talking about times when we send our forces away from their home bases and their families. After World War II, we had a half million troops stationed in Europe, but with their families, if they had families. Those troops were not considered ``deployed,'' because they were based there. So when people talk about a massive increase in deployments, they are generally not counting those who are stationed in overseas bases. 
   That is how having 10,500 soldiers in the Balkans today can be considered and counted as a major deployment, but stationing a half million troops in Europe from the end of World War II through the 1980s is not even counted as a deployment by classic definition. 
   Our military has also changed drastically. It used to be a force of mainly single, young men. Today, our forces are filled with married men and women, many of whom also have children. So deploying them on repeated missions overseas, along with frequent job changes, as well as being over-worked at their home bases, creates serious hardships for family life. 
   I submit today that many of the problems encountered by our men and women in uniform are related to the ways our military is organized and managed, based on the assumptions developed following our experience in World War II. I recommend to my colleagues an excellent, thoughtful paper, entitled ``It's The Personnel System,'' by John C. F. Tillson of the Institute for Defense Analysis. His paper explores the personnel and organizational assumptions that underlie the military, as well as the intersection of deployment tempo, personnel, or job-changing 
   tempo, and operating tempo at home bases. 
   These are complex problems that require serious thought. I think it is very sad that these issues would be reduced to a conclusion that the United States must pull out of our leadership role in the world instead of addressing those problems head-on. 
   What are those unending missions that the Clinton Administration has gotten us into? Most of them were inherited from the Bush administration or Ronald Reagan's administration, or even earlier ones. 
   Of the 100,000 troops currently deployed long-term away from home, only 10,500 or a little over 10 percent are deployed by the Clinton Administration--to the Balkans. The rest of the major long-term deployments were inherited, including deployments in Japan, the Korean peninsula, the Persian Gulf, and Navy deployments in the Western Pacific and the Mediterranean, as well as the mission that went wrong in Somalia. The only other major mission that the Clinton Administration took on that it did not inherit was to Haiti; and contrary to what Governor Bush said during the second Presidential debate, that mission is over. 
   I have seen many figures bandied about claiming that the Clinton Administration has used force at a much greater pace than Presidents Bush and Reagan before him. Where do these claims come from? 
   For example, an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal on October 18th by Mackubin Thomas Owens from the Naval War College and the Lexington Institute, says that:  
   Deployments have increased three-fold during the Clinton years.  
   He further stated:  
   These deployments have included some combat missions, but have consisted primarily of open-ended peacekeeping and humanitarian operations--48 missions, to be precise, from 1992 to 1999.  
   Apparently, a 1999 Congressional Research Service report, Instances of Use of United States Armed Forces Abroad, 1798--1999, was used to substantiate these claims. Specifically, the CRS report shows that during the Reagan and Bush administrations there were 17 and 16 uses of force overseas respectively. This compares to 49 uses of force overseas during the first 7 years of the Clinton administration. 
   Unfortunately, reading the CRS report this way is a gross misrepresentation of the facts and an absurd misuse of the CRS report, which was intended  only to be a compendium or rough survey of the range of uses of force. CRS and its fine analysts should not be blamed for the poor analysis of others who used the report as a source. 
   For instances of use of force in recent years, the CRS report is just a list of times when the President and Defense Secretary reported to Congress consistent with the 1973 War Powers Resolution, and the report notes that the instances of use of force listed vary greatly in size and significance. The degree to which each President reports to and consults with Congress on war powers matters varies greatly. The Clinton Administration has reported to Congress diligently. To simply add up each instance without reading and analyzing them inevitably leads to a gross misinterpretation of the facts and to conclusions that cannot 
   survive serious scrutiny. 
   Let me provide that scrutiny using CRS' numbers. 
   Of the 49 instances of use of force cited in the CRS report, 14 were either evacuations of U.S. citizens from Third World countries or minor increases in security at U.S. embassies. This is hardly the troop deployment depicted by the critics of the Clinton administration. Moreover, 24 other uses of force were merely continuing operations or simply status reports about continuing operations, 5 of those separate entries for status reports on peacekeeping operations in the Balkans. 
   There are 7 separate citations regarding air attacks on Iraqi ground targets after the gulf war. 
   The analysis suggests the numbers have been misused. Frankly, it raises a question of whether or not the military has been used effectively over the past 8 years. I certainly think it has. 
   There were 4 entries regarding the deployment of troops in Haiti--3 of which were reporting on the number of troops coming home! But those ``counted'' as uses of force by the Clinton Administration. So did reductions in US forces from Bosnia. 
   The largest deployment under President Clinton--some 30,000 troops to Bosnia for peacekeeping missions--is dwarfed by the 600,000+ troops sent to the Persian Gulf during Desert Shield/Storm under President Bush, yet the deployment to Bosnia counts for 15 entries in the CRS report, and the entire Gulf War, only one. The invasion of Grenada with 8,800 US troops has but a single entry. 
   The entries for the Clinton years included many instances of rescuing American citizens or humanitarian aid. Yet there were very few such instances for the Reagan-Bush years. It seems unlikely that hardly any U.S. citizens needed rescuing during those years, so I suspect such entries are simply missing. 
   How do we make sense of these numbers? 
   If we sort out all the multiple entries for the same deployment, as well as the minor deployments for embassy security and evacuations, it becomes clear that the number of distinct uses of force by the Clinton Administration is not that different from the Bush or Reagan years. 
   Deconstructing the CRS instances of use of force to include only distinct uses of force, we find that: over 8 years, there were 16 distinct uses of force by President Reagan, the major one the invasion of Grenada; 13 uses of force over the 4 years of the Bush Administration, the major ones being Panama, the Persian Gulf, and Somalia; and 13 uses of force for 7 years of the Clinton Administration, the major ones being Haiti, Bosnia and Kosovo. 
   The misuse of the CRS report was an egregious distortion of the Clinton Administration's record. To set the record straight, I asked the Defense Department what its numbers show. 
   First, I should note that there is no uniform method for counting deployments at the Defense Department; some count training and exercises as deployments, and some count domestic missions, like fighting the fires in the West or helping with Hurricane Andrew 
   clean-up. 
   In March 1999, Defense Secretary William S. Cohen sent a report to Congress entitled, ``U.S. Military Involvement in Major Smaller-Scale Contingencies Since the Persian Gulf War.'' In that report, Secretary Cohen notes that:  
   ..... since the end of the Persian Gulf War in February 1991, U.S. military forces have conducted or participated in approximately 50 named, overseas SSCs [small-scale contingencies] involving the deployment of 500 or more military personnel at any one time. This includes three crisis response/show of force operations, three limited strike operations, ten noncombatant evacuation operations, four no-fly zone enforcement operations, three maritime sanctions enforcement operations, six migrant operations, ten peace operations, ten humanitarian assistance operations, and one operation to provide emergency overseas assistance to other U.S. government agencies.  
   I asked the Defense Department for more detail, so DoD also sent me supporting data for the Secretary's report, showing 60 contingencies from 1980-1999--26 from 1980-1992, the Reagan-Bush years, and 34 during the Clinton Administration. Instead of 50 since February 1991 mentioned in the Secretary's report, it lists 44 contingencies since then. 
   The 34 contingencies during the Clinton Administration are those missions that have a ``name,'' like ``Avid Response'' or ``Sustain Hope.'' The sources of this information are the reports to Congress consistent with the War Powers Resolution, just like the CRS report. However, the data doesn't suffer from repetition, since it only uses named missions, so multiple reports were consolidated. These contingencies also include many instances of rescuing Americans or humanitarian aid missions. 
   However, almost all the data from 1980-1991 uses that same CRS report, Instances of Use of United States Armed Forces Abroad, 1798-1999, as its source, which may suffer from undercounting smaller deployments for that time period. I would like to ask the Defense Department today to look at its own internal data for the period on which it relied on the CRS report.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DURBIN. As a point of comparison, the Institute for Defense Analysis (IDA), under contract from the Defense Department, completed a study in February 1998 entitled, Frequency and Number of Military Operations. Contained within the study are a number of databases detailing the deployment of U.S. forces overseas. One data set from an earlier IDA study covering U.S. military overseas deployments from 1983-1994 showed that President Reagan averaged 9 deployments per year, President Bush averaged 9.5 deployments per year, while Clinton averaged 5.5 deployments per year. 
   Another data set from Defense Forecasts, Inc. listed U.S. Air Force deployments from 1983-1996. It showed the following number of average annual Air Force deployments: 19 per year under President Reagan, 37 per year under President Bush, and 27 per year under President Clinton. 
   For all those critics of the pace of the use of military force under President Clinton, I would like to ask, which missions of those in the lists I have submitted for the RECORD should this country not have done? Governor Bush mentioned only one in the second Presidential debate--the mission to Haiti. 
   Of the missions listed in the table from the Defense Secretary's report, which should we have skipped? Should we have said no to the 9 missions evacuating noncombatants and Americans in trouble? Should the United States have said ``sorry we can't help'' to those in the 9 humanitarian assistance missions? Should the military have been prevented from helping stem the flow on illegal immigrants or not helped give safe haven to the Kurds, as in the 6 missions listed under ``migrant operations''? How about enforcing the no-fly zone and the sanctions against Iraq, or perhaps the shows of force and limited strikes to keep Iraq in check? 
   Looking at the Army's list, perhaps critics would like to show where the Army was over-reaching? Was it when it helped the residents of my state of Illinois and of Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota during the massive flooding in 1993? Maybe we shouldn't have asked soldiers to help put out the fires all over the West last August? Maybe we shouldn't have helped the victims of Hurricane Mitch in Central America in  1998, or perhaps we should have turned down the humanitarian mission to the survivors of the Rwandan genocide in 1994? Some say we shouldn't have even tried to restore democracy in Haiti. 
   When I read these lists, it makes me proud of what our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines have done for our country and for the world, at great cost to themselves and their family lives. 
   Clearly there is a national consensus that we have been over-working our troops and we need to look deeply into what assumptions and management systems we need to change to fix these problems--rather than decide that we must pull back from the world and from the vital national security missions those men and women have been so ably undertaking. 
   But where on these lists are those ``vague, aimless and endless deployments'' that Governor Bush referred to? Which ``uncertain missions'' would he ``replace with well-defined objectives''? 
   There's only one major long-term peacekeeping mission on those lists, and that's the U.S. mission to the Balkans--the only major deployment still in place that President Clinton did not inherit from 
   Governor Bush's father. 
   Governor Bush has called for a U.S. withdrawal from the Balkans and for a ``new division of labor'' between the United States and its NATO allies--this at a time when the U.S. strategy is bearing fruit with the fall of the Serbian President, Slobodan Milosevic, and when United States forces make up less than 15 percent of the troops on the ground in the Balkans. 
   Bush's intent to reduce the United States' role in Europe and NATO has been greeted with alarm and dismay across Europe. 
   Following two world wars, history has shown us the importance of the U.S. role in keeping peace and promoting stability in Europe; of stopping racist, ultra-nationalist dictators. After the United States and Europe alike spent years wringing its hands about the ultranationalist policies that ripped Yugoslavia to shreds, the United States led to step in and stop the ethnic cleansing. Was that the wrong policy? Should we have just watched while Southeastern Europe went to pieces? It was painful and messy, and it took time, but I think we did the right thing. The new leaders in Croatia, and now, I hope, in Serbia, are ready for a new, democratic path. 
   Our experience with the Kosovo campaign showed just how important American leadership and American defense capability is to the NATO alliance. Europe has said it's ready to do more to beef up its defense and peacekeeping capabilities, but it's a long way from being able to undertake a Kosovo-like campaign without the United States. That reality became painfully clear to European leaders during the Kosovo campaign, and they have determined to do something about it. 
   Just a few years ago, I was proud to vote in the United States Senate to enlarge NATO to include Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. This enlargement was to help integrate the states that had thrown off the yoke of the Warsaw Pact into Western European institutions. It helped to cement democracy and give those countries a stake in the defense of Europe. I want to see more East European countries join NATO, particularly the long-suffering Baltic countries of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. I am afraid that will not happen if the United States pulls back from its commitment to NATO. 
   After the United States led Europe and NATO to stop the Yugoslavian wars, are we to pull back? After the United States led NATO to expand the fold of democratic, market-oriented states committed to Europe's defense, are we to leave? 
   I believe the answer to those questions is a resounding no. 
   It is time to address the hardships of those in the military as the management issues that they are and stop claiming that the United States can no longer handle vital national security missions like our involvement in the Balkans because of those hardships. 
   Let's stop hiding behind the many differing deployment statistics and debate policy. This Administration has kept our commitment to NATO and to Europe, while it has continued to contain Saddam Hussein, and protected our vital interests in protecting Japan, South Korea, and the Taiwan Strait. Those aren't ``vague, aimless, or uncertain'' missions. These missions are at the heart of our national security and our leadership role in the world today. 
   I close by pointing to one particular thing that has come up in the last 2 weeks in the Presidential campaign. For months, Governor Bush's senior foreign policy advisers have been complaining that the U.S. military is overextended and engaged in too many peacekeeping operations. It is this last deployment in the Balkans that has drawn Governor Bush's ire, even though the 10,000 troops represent, as I said earlier, less than 1 percent of the U.S. military. 
   Recently, Governor Bush's foreign policy adviser, Condoleeza Rice, called for withdrawal of U.S. forces from the Balkans as a ``new division of labor'' under which the United States would ``handle a showdown in the Gulf, mount the kind of force needed to protect Saudi Arabia and deter a crisis in the Taiwan Strait,'' while Europe would be asked to do peacekeeping on its own. 
   I have always been in favor of burden sharing, and I believe the Europeans and every other group across the world who need our assistance should not only pay for that and defer the costs to American taxpayers but put the lives of their young men and women on the line. 
   I believe it is naive of Governor Bush to suggest that America's commitment to NATO is just a statistical commitment. America's commitment to NATO makes it work, and the suggestion that Governor Bush, if he had the chance, would diminish the American role in NATO, has raised concerns all across Europe because for over 60 years now, NATO has been a source of stability and pride and defense for our European allies.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I close this segment by saying if we are going to maintain the superiority of the United States in the world, we must maintain a military force second to none, and that is a fact. For those who suggest we have somehow diminished our power, I suggest to them: Which military would you take in place of the United States? It is not just our technological advantage--that is amazing--what is amazing is the commitment of the men and women in this military to this country and to the defense of our values. I am proud of the fact that as a Member of Congress, in the House and the Senate, I have been able to support this buildup of military strength, which has meant we have conquered communism, we have allowed countries to see their freedom for the first time in decades, and we have built alliances, like NATO, into the envy of the world. 
   For those who suggest the American military is somehow understaffed, overmanned, underutilized, overutilized--whatever the criticism may be--I do not think that is a fact. I also think those who want to rewrite the history of the last 50 or 60 years and try to define a new role for NATO are causing undue concern among our allies in Europe. NATO is important. I know this because of my own experience dealing with the Baltics. 
   My mother was born in Lithuania. I followed the arrival of democracy in Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia. I know they are 
   concerned about their future and security. They are counting on NATO. They are praying for the day when they can become part of it. 
   When Governor Bush suggests we are somehow going to diminish America's  role in NATO, it raises serious questions not only in the United States but around the world. It goes back to the point I made earlier: If being the President of the United States and Commander in Chief of our forces was an easy job then many people could fill it. If it is a tough job demanding experience and good solid judgment, then I think the American people should best look to someone involved in that. Vice President GORE has tried to stand not only for the strength of NATO in the past but in the future. I believe as leader, if he is elected on November 7, he will continue in that proud tradition. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it has been more than a year since the Columbine tragedy, but still this Republican Congress refuses to act on sensible gun legislation. 
   Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. Until we act, Democrats in the Senate will read the names of some of those who have lost their lives to gun violence in the past year, and we will continue to do so every day that the Senate is in session. 
   In the name of those who died, we will continue this fight. Following are the names of some of the people who were killed by gunfire one year ago today.  
   October 30, 1999: 
   Hichem Belhouchet, 31, Houston, TX; 
   Joel Cobrales, 21, Chicago, IL; 
   Gustavo Delgado, 81, Miami-Dade County, FL; 
   Ollie T. Fisher, 34, Chicago, IL; 
   Jermaine Jones, 21, St. Louis, MO; 
   Woodrow Kelly, 51, Washington, DC; 
   Deshawn Powell, 28, Detroit, MI; 
   Paula Proper, 33, Rockford, IL; 
   Lewis Queen, Washington, DC; 
   Fidel Quiros, 41, Miami-Dade County, FL; 
   Derrick Redd, 19, Chicago, IL; 
   Quinten Reed, 18, Nashville, TN; 
   Antonio Sanchez, 24, Charlotte, NC; 
   Tanisha Simmons, 17, Detroit, MI; 
   David Walterson, 36, Miami-Dade County, FL; and 
   Unidentified Male, 26, Newark, NJ. 
   Following are the names of some of the people who were killed by gunfire one year ago Saturday and Sunday. 
   October 28, 1999: 
   Duane Brown, 17, Chicago, IL; 
   John Cardoza, 24, Denver, CO; 
   David Clemons, 35, Bridgeport, CT; 
   Melvin K. Owens, 28, Chicago, IL; 
   Victor Rijos, 25, Bridgeport, CT; 
   Tom Shields, 54, Detroit, MI; 
   Nelson J. Sullivan, 17, Chicago, IL; 
   Alicia Valladares, 30, Houston, TX; 
   Nyere Waller, 25, Oklahoma City, OK; 
   Cameron Wojaciechaski, 22, Detroit, MI; 
   Michael Yslas, 54, Oakland, CA; and 
   Unidentified Male, 15, Chicago, IL. 
   October 29, 1999: 
   Tobey Antone, 18, Louisville, KY; 
   Richard Brumfield, 42, Louisville, KY; 
   Kenyatta Evans, 28, Detroit, MI; 
   Troy Johnson, 38, Oakland, CA; 
   James Middleton, 40, Baltimore, MD; 
   Rasheed Mohammed, 22, Binghamton, NY; 
   Jesus Rodriquez, 24, Dallas, TX; 
   Rene Wright, 38, Fort Worth, TX. 
   We cannot sit back and allow such senseless gun violence to continue. The deaths of these people are a reminder to all of us that we need to enact sensible gun legislation now.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Utah would stay on the floor for a moment. It is my understanding that, as chairman of the Senate Committee, the Senator from Utah has jurisdiction over immigration issues. I am trying to recall.

   Mr. DURBIN. Senator HARRY REID of Nevada, Senator KENNEDY, and I have each introduced bills relative to the three elements the administration is urging and they have been pending for months now. 
   Frankly, I understand the good faith of the Senator from Utah, but when we literally have hundreds of thousands of people across America whose fate is hanging in the balance here on a decision to be made by the Senate and we have not seen on the Senate floor--other than the H-1B visa bill--frankly, some bills of smaller consequence, I think perhaps the Senator from Utah can understand the anxiety and concern of these families. 
   I deal with these families all the time, and I am sure the Senator does, too. Two out of three of my constituent cases coming into the Chicago office deal with immigration. I hear these heartbreaking stories about families that are torn apart because of some of the laws we have passed, the failure of this Congress to respond to this. And I, frankly, have urged the President to take the position he has taken--don't go home and leave these poor families out there, frankly, languishing because we failed to address three basic things. We failed to say we are going to give those refugees who have come to this country and have faced the same kind of political persecution as refugees from Nicaragua and Cuba--we believe they should receive equal and fair treatment. I don't think that is a radical idea. Secondly, 245(i) says if you are going to get a chance to finally get your green card and become a naturalized citizen, go through the process, we think it is an unreasonable hardship to force you to go back to your country of origin and apply for a visa, which is an economic hardship and, in many cases, a danger that families should not go through. 
   I can't imagine why that is a radical idea. The idea of updating the registry in this country that we have used to affect immigrants has been updated regularly since 1929. We are not bringing a radical notion to the Senate. In fact, we are following the tradition of Democratic and Republican administrations, and we have not had a bill come to the floor. 
   We have hundreds of thousands of people whose lives hang in the balance. Frankly, I can understand the position of the President, and I agree with him. I am sorry we have not had hearings on this issue nor brought it to the floor; but to say that it is something we might look at next year is cold comfort to these people who, frankly, face the fear of being extradited or somehow removed from this country in a situation that could be a great hardship to their families. 
   I say to the Senator from Utah, there is another side to the story. I deal with it every day in my Chicago office and all across Illinois.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this image is being created under this immigration act that we are talking about people who managed to sneak into the United States illegally and who have lived their lives in violation of the law and are now trying to sneak into citizenship. There are people like that, I am sure, but they are an extremely small minority. 
   The vast majority of people we are concerned about are people such as Sarah. Sarah is a 19-year-old girl in southern California. She was born in Mexico and adopted at the age of 4. English is her primary language. She lives at home with her family. She is adored by her parents and her five older siblings. She is also an illegal immigrant. Why is she an illegal immigrant? It turns out that Sarah's parents made a crucial mistake at the time of adoption. They didn't apply for citizenship. The family wrongly assumed that she automatically became a citizen when they completed the formal adoption procedures in the California courtroom. No one told them they had to file separately for citizenship. It was only last year when they decided to take a trip to Mexico and asked for a passport that they realized Sarah is here illegally. 
   Is this someone who managed to sneak across the border and is living in violation of the law? 
   There are thousands of Sarahs who are, frankly, looking for relief in Congress and who can make a contribution to the United States. 
   But the fact that we have not brought a serious immigration bill--but for one H-1B visa bill--before Congress is the reason this President has put his foot down and said: Congress, don't go home until you address this problem. 
   There are people such as Sarah across America who deserve fair treatment. Frankly, they have been ignored. 
   I count the Senator from Utah as my friend. But I have to say that the Senate Judiciary Committee has not taken up this issue. They have ignored it. He identified the reason: It is controversial. 
   When you talk about immigrants, there are a lot of people who say I know how to exploit that issue. Let me tell you something. I know that is the case in my home State of Illinois. But I happen to be the son of an immigrant. I am very proud of the fact that I serve in this Senate as the son of immigrants. And many of us in this country look to our parents and grandparents as immigrants with great pride. 
   We should look at immigration fairly and honestly and in a legal way. You can't do it if you run away from a debate on immigration law the way we have in the Senate for the last two years. 
   President Clinton, hold your ground. For those across America who are waiting for us to do the fair and right and equitable thing for immigrants, hold your ground. Insist that this Senate, before it goes home, and this Congress, before it leaves to go back to campaign, are fair to those across America who are looking to be treated equitably and justly under our immigration system. 
   I am responding, of course, to what the Senator from Utah raised as an issue. It wasn't the reason I came to the floor, but I feel passionately about it. 
   Senator KENNEDY, Senator REID, and myself are the three major sponsors of the measure on which President Clinton is insisting. They can add, I am sure, during the course of this debate their strong feelings as well.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in just a few days the American people get to make one of the most important decisions that we are ever called on to make, and that is to choose a leader for our country. It appears from all of the polls that the American people just can't decide. The polls go up and down every single week. You see one candidate ahead one week and another candidate ahead the next. Frankly, the verdict of public opinion will be rendered on November 7, and we will decide the leader for the next 4 years. 
   Many of us believe this is a decision of importance way beyond 4 years. We think the next President is going to chart a course for many years to come. 
   We have to make a very basic decision. 
   Frankly, if you believe that the Presidency is an easy responsibility, and if you believe that America will run forward in a positive way on automatic pilot, then I think, frankly, you might be inclined to vote for Governor Bush because he has spoken in very general terms about what he thinks about America. He has made specific proposals, which are fairly radical departures from what we have been, and he says everything is going to be fine; in fact, it will be better. 
   Many of us, though, can remember something that perhaps Governor Bush never experienced. He was not a Governor in Texas during the period of time when we dealt with the worst deficits in the history of the United States in Washington. Under Presidents Reagan and Bush, we dealt with deficits that were crippling to this American economy. I saw it in my home State of Illinois with high unemployment and high inflation. People weren't building homes and weren't starting businesses. It was a very bad time. We were in a recession. We paid a bitter price for it--families and businesses across America. Thank goodness, in 1993, we turned a corner and started moving forward. Some of the things that have happened since are absolutely historic. 
   If you take a look, since March 1991--which goes back to the Bush Presidency for a few months--we have had  115 months of straight economic expansion, the longest in the history of the United States. 
   Governor Bush may not remember what it was like back in the old days when we would get 12 months or so of economic expansion. But that is what America truly was like. 
   Look at what happened to the inflation rate during that same period of time. 
   In 1980, the inflation rate was over 12 percent. Then it went down at the end of the administration of Jimmy Carter. Of course, it went down and it stayed down. But we have kept the inflation rate at the lowest sustained level since 1965. 
   These things don't happen easily or automatically. Those who think Governor Bush can come to it with little or no experience and keep it going have to answer some questions. Will he be able to do as we have done in the last 8 years--create 22 million new jobs? His father created 2 1/2 million jobs during his 4 years; President Reagan, 16 million during his 8 years. Twenty-two million is a record, and it is a record of which we are proud. It means people have a chance. 
   But we can see Presidents who came on board such as former President Bush who really didn't have good luck when it came to job creation and getting people back to work. 
   Take a look at Federal spending. 
   The Republicans criticize Democrats as big spenders. Look what has happened to Federal spending as a percentage of our gross domestic product. It has gone to one of the lowest levels since 1966. We have seen Federal spending heading down and we are being criticized for being big spenders. The fact is, we have not been. Just the opposite is true: For the people often left behind, the lowest poverty rate in 20 years; African Americans and Hispanic Americans with the highest employment rates in modern memory; improvement in education scores, an indication that everybody gets a chance to improve in this country. 
   The overall surplus we have seen generated is the largest in our history: $237 billion under the Clinton-Gore administration. Look at the red ink under Presidents Reagan and Bush in the early years of Clinton-Gore and how we turned the corner. There are those who think that will continue, but it isn't true. If we go the wrong way on critical decisions, we will pay the price. 
   The American Academy of Actuaries came out with their report last week. They took a look at Governor Bush's proposal for Social Security and they said we would return to Federal budget deficits around 2015 under George W. Bush's proposal. This group, which is nonpartisan, and is supposed to know basically more than most of us when it comes to accounting and actuary practice, concluded that Governor Bush's plan to cut taxes and divert Social Security payroll tax for individual accounts would make it all but impossible to eliminate the publicly held national debt. 
   There is the choice, America. A choice for the next 4 years is whether we will continue to make sure that we invest in America, keep the economy moving forward, use fiscal discipline and fiscal conservatism, if you will, to make sure we pay down the national debt. I don't believe, nor does Vice President GORE, for that matter, that we should risk the Social Security system by taking $1 trillion out of it, something that Governor Bush couldn't even explain in the last debate. How do you take $1 trillion out of Social Security and then go ahead and spend the $1 trillion, except at the expense of Social Security recipients? Are you going to cut the benefits? Are you going to increase their payroll taxes? Are you going to change the retirement age? 
   All of these things are options that none of us want to face. If you take an approach, and he suggested you may have no other alternative, you may find yourselves battling away at a stock market which looks a lot like the roller coaster at Coney Island in Senator MOYNIHAN's home State.

    Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I would like to pay tribute to a constituent from Illinois, John F. Garde. Mr. Garde will soon be retiring as the Executive Director of the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists, AANA, after 17 years of service. I am very pleased to honor the distinguished career of John F. Garde for his contributions to the practice of anesthesia from my state of Illinois. 
   The AANA is the professional association that represents over 27,000 practicing Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists (CRNAs). Founded in 1931, the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists is the professional association representing CRNAs nationwide. As you may know, CRNAs administer more than 65 percent of the anesthetics given to patients each year in the United States. CRNAs provide anesthetics for all types of surgical cases and are the sole anesthesia provider in two-thirds of all rural hospitals, affording these medical facilities obstetrical, surgical and trauma stablization capabilities. They work in every setting in which anesthesia is delivered including hospital surgical suites and obstetrical delivery rooms, ambulatory surgical centers, and the offices of dentists, podiatrists, and plastic surgeons. 
   John received his anesthesia training in 1957 from St. Francis Hospital School of Anesthesia in LaCrosse, WI and began practicing at the U.S. Public Health Hospital in Detroit, Michigan the following year. Having been a provider of anesthesia for numerous years he became an Associate Professor and Chairman of the Department of Anesthesia at Wayne State University, College of Pharmacy and Allied Health in 1975. Using this experience, he then became the Education Director of the AANA in Park Ridge, IL in 1980 before taking his current role as Executive Director in 1983. He accolades range from propelling nurse anesthesia programs into a graduate framework resulting in 50 per cent of them moving into the College of Nursing, as well as establishing the International Federation of Nurse Anesthetists (IFNA) during his tenure with the AANA. John has served the AANA as a member, board member, past president, and now will be retiring as a very celebrated executive director among his peers. 
   Mr. Garde has many honors to follow his list of career accomplishments. John was inducted as a fellow of the American Academy of Nursing in 1994. In 1999 the Association of Chicagoland recognized him for his outstanding contributions to the Association community, presenting him with the John C. Thiel Distinguished Service Award. 
   I ask my colleagues to join me today in recognizing Mr. John F. Garde, CRNA, MS, FAAN, for his notable career and outstanding achievements.

   Mr. DURBIN. She has raised an important point. Most people would agree that the Governor of Texas has limited personal exposure and experience when it comes to foreign policy issues. That does not mean he is disqualified. There have been Presidents who have been Governors. But we have to judge him on what he has said. 
   His suggestion of the withdrawal of troops in some parts of the world raises serious questions as to whether or not he has considered the consequences. The United States made a commitment, for example, in Europe after World War II to stop the spread of communism. It cost the American people  trillions of dollars. It paid off: 250 years later, communism is virtually wiped off the map and these countries, the Balkans and eastern European countries, now enjoy democracy and freedom. 
   There was only one country in the world that could do that, and that was the United States. We have military skill, the great men and women in uniform, and we have a reputation of involving ourselves in foreign policy--not to come away with any property or treasure; we are there to try to promote the ideals and values of our country. 
   So when Governor Bush suggests withdrawing troops in some parts of the world, you have to wonder, has he really reflected on this? Has he taken the time to try to measure why he would change policies that even his father supported, perhaps President Reagan supported, and now he wants to change these policies and approaches? 
   This is an important element. Thank goodness we live in a world that is generally at peace, but it is a dangerous world that at any moment can flare up. We need leadership in the White House that understands the consequences of its actions. 
   I salute the Senator from California. What we are seeing happen today in North Korea--where they are finally talking to 
   us; they are finally agreeing to perhaps end the missile testing--is a very positive development. It is only because the United States made a commitment in South Korea with the lives of our service men and women and then kept troops there to protect it that we have reached that point today.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in 2 weeks the American people are going to face one of the toughest choices they have had perhaps in modern memory. 
   This Presidential race is not just a choice between two individuals and whether, frankly, one has a better image on television, or more experience, or a better speaking voice. It comes down to basic questions of values envisioned for this country. There  are two contrasting views to be chosen. I can recall 4 years ago coming to the Senate when the Republicans all lined up and said that our economy was in such terrible shape, and the Federal budget was in such bad shape, we would have to amend the Constitution with a balanced budget amendment because of our deficits. They were so desperate they wanted to give the power to the Federal courts to stop Congress from spending. 
   Four years later, look at the difference. We are not talking about deficits; we are talking about how to spend the surplus, and we are talking about an economy which, for 8 years, has been cooking, creating 22 million new jobs. There is more home ownership than at any time in our history. Welfare rolls are coming down and crime rates are coming down. Opportunities for businesses, for minorities, for women are unparalleled in our history. When you look at advanced placement courses in schools, we have more Hispanics and African Americans enrolling in them than ever before in our history. 
   America is moving forward, and I am glad to say we have been part of it in Congress. We can't take credit for it anymore than the President can or Alan Greenspan can. It is a joint effort of families and businesses across America. But make no mistake, the right policy in Washington set the stage for this to happen. When President Clinton said, ``I am going to make a meaningful effort to reduce the national deficits,'' frankly, we didn't get a single Republican vote to support us. Not one. Vice President Gore came to the floor of the Senate and cast the tie-breaking vote, and we started on a path in 1993 that led to where we are today. There are some people who think this is automatic in America, that prosperity is a matter of standing aside and watching it happen. 
   I know better. I have been in the Congress long enough to know that the wrong policies in the White House can jeopardize economic prosperity. Do you remember the early days of the Reagan years when they came up with an idea called ``supply side economics'' and the appropriately named ``Laffer curve''? We followed that crazy notion long enough to find ourselves deep in red ink, with the biggest deficits in history, the largest national debt and America on the ropes. Thank goodness we have broken away from that. 
   Should we experiment again? George W. Bush suggests he wants a $1.6 trillion tax cut going primarily to wealthy people in America. Can we run that risk? The highest 1 percent of wage earners who will see over 40 percent of the George W. Bush tax cut are people who are making more than $300,000 a year. I can't understand why a person who has an income of $25,000 a month needs a $2,000 a month tax cut. But that is what Governor Bush has proposed. He says it is only fair and right; these are taxpayers, too. Think of Bill Gates. He has been very successful with Microsoft. He is worth billions of dollars. According to George W. Bush, he needs a tax cut. I don't think so. 
   George W. Bush should take into consideration that the net worth of Bill Gates is greater than the combined net worth of 106 million Americans. He doesn't need our help. The people who need our help, frankly, are families struggling to pay for college expenses. We on the Democratic side believe that we 
   need tax cuts targeted to help families in a real way so they can deduct college tuition and fees up to $12,000 a year to help kids get through college and have a better life. 
   We also believe we ought to help families who are going to work trying to find something to do with their children. Day care is an important issue for so many families. We want to increase the tax credit for day care and also give a tax credit for stay-at-home moms who are willing to make the economic sacrifice for their children. 
   Finally, when it comes to long-term care, so many of us have seen aging parents and grandparents who need a helping hand. I have seen families making extra sacrifices for those parents. Our tax program would give a targeted tax cut to help those families.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, when I finished speaking, the Senator from Arizona came to the floor and said it is unseemly that we would be discussing the Presidential race. The race has been discussed by Senators on both sides of the aisle, as it should be. There is no more important decision to be made by the American people than the choice of the President of the United States, and that choice will determine what this body considers for the next 4 years. 
   Frankly, we ought to reflect on what has happened with this Republican-led Congress. If you take a look at the fact that we are approaching the Halloween holiday, in that spirit we might consider the fact that Congress has become ``Sleepy Hollow,'' the final resting place for priorities of American families. 
   Take a look at the list of things that have been offered by the Democratic side but have not been acted upon by the Republican side: A real Patients' Bill of Rights. When you go to a doctor, who should make the decision; a doctor or insurance company clerk? That is an easy choice for me. I want the doctor to make the call. When we tried to pass that bill in the Senate, the Republicans defeated us. 
   Prescription drug coverage under Medicare: Not one of these convoluted schemes we just heard described that would somehow give prescription drugs to the States for 4 years, take it back, give it to the insurance companies--we know how it should work. Medicare has been on the books for 35 years. It is proven. It is universal. 
   Frankly, we think all seniors and disabled in that category should be able to make the choice themselves, voluntarily, whether or not they want the benefit under Medicare. The 
   Republicans do not care for Medicare. They called it socialized medicine when the Democrats proposed it and, frankly, they are still criticizing it, doing little to help that system. 
   Most Americans know how valuable Medicare has been to their families. We think a prescription drug benefit under Medicare should be the law. The Republicans and pharmaceutical interests have stopped us. 
   We also believe in an increase in the minimum wage. Ten million Americans went to work this morning for $5.15 an hour, and they are not just kids in their first jobs. Over half of them are women and many of them are raising children and trying to eke out a living at $5.15 an hour. We used to give them a periodic increase in the minimum  wage without even debate, but the Republicans now think this is unacceptable; that we cannot give a minimum wage increase without lording billions of dollars in tax breaks on businesses. For goodness' sake, give these people--400,000 of them in Illinois--an increase in the minimum wage of at least 50 cents an hour for the next 2 years. That bill has not passed, and the Republican Congress has had ample opportunity to address it. 
   We believe on the Democratic side we need tax cuts; use the surplus for tax cuts for families for the deductibility of college education expenses. That is a concern I hear from families as soon as the baby is born. How are we going to pay for this kid's education? When you see the cost of education going up over a 20-year period of time, from the time that child was born until they will be in school--it goes up 200 percent, 400 percent--people ask: How can we possibly do this? 
   On the Democratic side, we want to give the families deductibility of tuition and fees to help them pay for college. The Republicans oppose it. We support it. That is the difference. When we offered it, they stopped us. 
   Also, we are talking about education funds to improve our Nation's schools, to reduce class size. This does not take a Ph.D. in education to understand. If you were a teacher, would you rather walk in on the first day and see a classroom with 30 kids or 15 kids? Are you more likely able to help a struggling student if there are 15 children in the classroom or 30? It is not rocket science. It does not take a Ph.D. 
   We on the Democratic side believe reducing class size is the first step to helping kids from falling behind and helping those better students get a little more attention. 
   We also believe we ought to be supporting afterschool programs for students. Letting kids go now at 3 o'clock is just a gamble because very few of them have parents at home. They do not have Ozzie and Harriet waiting with cookies and milk anymore. They are by themselves. 
   Some do pretty well, but a lot of them do not. We think afterschool programs, supervised, so kids have a chance to maybe catch up on their school subjects, maybe appreciate the arts a little more, maybe become better on a computer, or even just play some basketball, makes some sense as long as there is supervision. We support afterschool programs and fought the Republicans every step of the way trying to put this valuable money back into education. 
   We also believe in commonsense gun safety legislation. The No. 1 story in 1999 in the news was the Columbine tragedy. What has America done to keep guns out of the hands of children and criminals? Congress has done nothing. Nothing. 
   The National Rifle Association and its leader, ``Mr. Moses,'' have decided we are not going to do anything to keep guns out of the hands of children and criminals, and that is criminal. The Republican-led Congress should be held accountable for that. 
   If you have an aging parent or grandparent, the Democrats believe you should have a tax break to help pay for their care. 
   How many folks and families do you know worried about that aging parent and how their last years are going to be? They need a helping hand. We support it, as we support increased targeted tax cuts to help people pay for day care, so kids can be left in a healthy, safe environment and families can afford to pay for it. Stay-at-home moms, who sacrifice for their kids, should get a tax break, too. They are making a sacrifice that will enhance that child's future. We should invest in them as well. 
   When it comes to these myriad issues I have just given you, these are the issues with which working families, middle-income families, and single people as well can identify. Yet we have had no help whatsoever on the Republican side of the aisle. The Republican Congress has failed to address the basic issues of education and health care, taxes that are reduced and targeted tax cuts and credits for families who really need them, prescription drug coverage under Medicare, and a Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   We came to this Congress with all kinds of lofty goals. We are leaving now, unfortunately, with appropriations bills as large as the Washington, DC, telephone book, scarcely read, that serve too many special interests and too few families across this country.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation on behalf of the more than 50 million Americans each year who suffer from mental illness. This bill, the Mental Health Access Act, removes one of the many barriers to health care faced by those who have been treated for a mental condition. 
   The Mental Health Access Act limits the ability of health plans to redline individuals with a preexisting mental health conditions. I undertook this initiative when I learned that some of my constituents were being turned away from health plans in the private non-group market due solely to a past history of treatment for mental conditions. Unfortunately, under the current system of care in the United States, individuals who are undergoing treatment or have a history of treatment for mental illness may find it difficult to obtain private health insurance, especially if they must purchase it on their own and do not have an employer-sponsored group plan available to them. In part this is because while the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPAA) protects millions of Americans in the group health insurance market, it affords few protections for individuals who apply for private non-group insurance. 
   The Mental Health Access Act closes this loophole by limiting any preexisting condition exclusion relating to a mental health condition to not more than 12 months and reducing this exclusion period by the total amount of previous creditable coverage. It prohibits any health insurer that offers health coverage in the individual insurance market from imposing a preexisting condition exclusion relating to a mental health condition unless a diagnosis, medical advice or treatment was recommended or received within the 6 months period to the enrollment date. And it prohibits health plans in the individual market from charging higher premiums to individuals based solely on the determination that the such individual has had a preexisting mental health condition. These provisions apply to all health plans in the individual market, regardless of whether a state has enacted an alternative mechanism (such as a risk pool) to cover individuals with preexisting health conditions. 
   The Mental Health Access Act complements ongoing efforts to enhance parity between mental health services and other health benefits. This is because parity alone will not help individuals who do not have access to any affordable health insurance due to preexisting mental illness discrimination. The Access Act does not mandate that insurers provide mental health services if they are not already offering such coverage. It simply prohibits plans in the private non-group market from redlining individuals who apply for general health insurance based solely on a past history of treatment for a mental condition. 
   Recognizing that we are nearing the close of this year's legislative session. I plan to reintroduced this bill when Congress returns and it is my hope that many of my colleagues will join me. In the meantime, I have asked the General Accounting Office (GAO)to examine the extent to which private health insurers medically underwrite for mental health conditions by either denying coverage or raising premiums, often to a level that is unaffordable for many individuals. Specifically, I have asked the GAO to examine: the types of mental health conditions for which individual health insurers typically underwrite; the degree to which there is an actuarial basis for these carrier practices; the prevalence of medical underwriting for mental health conditions that result in denying coverage or raising premiums; and the extent of state laws that prevent or constrain insurers from denying coverage or raising premiums due to a history of mental health conditions, including consumer protections such as appeals procedures and access to information. 
   It simply does not make sense that just because a person seeks treatment  for mental illness he or she is rendered uninsurable. I invite my colleagues to enlist in this important initiative to ensure that such individuals are not discriminated against when applying for health insurance coverage.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to briefly discuss the Fiscal Year 2001 Agriculture Appropriations conference report, H.R. 4461. 
   First, I would like to commend Senators COCHRAN and KOHL, the Senate Subcommittee chairman and ranking member. They have put together a very good underlying bill and have done so with bipartisan support and cooperation. From the very first hearing of the  year, through conference, Chairman COCHRAN has endeavored to deliver a bill that is helpful to our farmers and ranchers and fair to the Food and Drug Administration. Again, I congratulate him on this important accomplishment. 
   I was a conferee on this bill, as I am a member of the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee. However, I regret to say that I was unable to sign the conference report because of specific provisions on Cuba sanctions and prescription drug re-importation. 
   Specifically, I am distressed that the conferees did not support the Senate position on lifting food and medicine sanctions against Cuba. The House language limiting U.S. sales to a cash only or third-country financing basis will unnecessarily restrict the sales of food and medicine to Cuba. 
   I am further troubled by the language restricting travel by Americans to Cuba. During the Cold War, Americans were able to travel to the Soviet bloc countries, and if they were kept out, it was by the Communists, not by our own government. I believe Castro has more to fear from an invasion force of American tourists than from our sanctions policy. I cannot imagine how restricting the ability of Americans to go to Cuba could possibly advance our shared goal of peaceful change toward democracy and a free market economy in Cuba. 
   With regard to prescription drug re-importation, too many Americans struggle to afford prescription drugs that their doctors believe are necessary to alleviate or prevent illness. Unfortunately, those who can least afford these drugs because they do not have insurance coverage for prescription drugs generally pay far more than the ``most favored'' purchasers such as Health Maintenance Organizations, HMOs, and other big insurers. 
   Instead of dealing with the real issue of providing comprehensive, affordable drug coverage to all America's seniors and the disabled, this conference report takes a much more limited step. It is billed as a means to provide our constituents with access to better priced medicines by allowing for the re-importation of drugs sold at lower prices in other countries. This provision includes measures to ensure the safety of these re-imported products by requiring testing after re-importation. However, the language attached to this conference report still includes several pharmaceutical industry-backed loopholes that will undermine consumer ability to access cheaper drugs. These loopholes were added late in the process and have the potential to nullify the entire provision. 
   Drug companies will be able to limit supplies in foreign countries to thwart re-importation efforts. Nothing in the language of this conference report addresses this issue. In fact, the limitation on the countries from which wholesalers and pharmacists may re-import drugs will clearly aggravate this loophole. The language also omits provisions that would prevent the pharmaceutical industry from forcing foreign wholesalers to sell products at the inflated American price. Without such a provision, the drug industry will be able to prevent U.S. consumers from obtaining more affordable medicines. There is no effort to focus re-importation so as to benefit the most severely disadvantaged Americans: the elderly and the disabled. 
   I am convinced that Congress needs to address prescription drug coverage and the cost of pharmaceutical products here at home. Tortuous transport through other countries to re-import products that were originally manufactured here in the U.S. is not the most effective remedy for the high prices that American consumers pay today. 
   Mr. President, I would like to note with appreciation that this conference report includes important assistance for our nation's farmers who are facing another year of low prices. 
   The assistance farmers received last year helped many Illinois farmers. An October 1999 study by the University of Illinois projected that average net farm income for Illinois farmers would have been just $11,000 in 1999 without federal assistance. But with federal assistance, their income rose to $25,000. 
   Although the U.S. economy continues to thrive, farmers and those who live in rural America do not appear to be reaping the benefits. This measure provides $3.6 billion for weather-related crop losses and livestock assistance, and it increases funding for the Farm Service Agency to carry out vital farm programs and emergency measures. The conference report also doubles the loan deficiency limits to ensure farmers are able to receive the income support they need. 
   The conference report also contains $1 billion for P.L. 480--Food for Peace, $697 million for the Food Safety and Inspection Service, $2.5 billion for USDA Rural Development programs, $9.5 billion for child nutrition programs--including a School Breakfast pilot program, and $1.2 billion for the Food and Drug Administration. 
   Mr. President, although I have some serious reservations with regard to Cuba sanctions and prescription drug re-importation, I am voting for this conference report because of its other valuable provisions that are simply too important to Illinois agriculture to delay.

    Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Tony Romolo, in whose honor the Anthony C. Romolo Training Center in Mt. Sterling, Illinois, is being dedicated this month. 
   Tony Romolo was the Center's founding administrator and is now the longest-serving training administrator within the Laborers' International Union of North America. 
   As administrator, Tony has been responsible for creating policies that have guided the procedures and management of the training center, including the development of training goals and priorities. His leadership has resulted in the training of thousands of laborers throughout Illinois. 
   The Laborers' Training Program was one of the first within the State of Illinois to receive accreditation from the Illinois Department of Public Health for teaching environmentally beneficial courses in asbestos abatement. Mr. Romolo also oversaw the creation of the Construction Craft Laborers' Apprenticeship Program that was approved February 3, 1997. 
   Tony Romolo's work has been diverse but unwavering in its commitment to improving the skills of our nation's workers. We are fortunate to have dedicated, hard-working men like Tony in our society today. Illinois is a better place because of his commitment to the working men and women of our state and country.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it has been more than a year since the Columbine tragedy, but still this Republican Congress refuses to act on sensible gun legislation. 
   Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. Until we act, Democrats in the Senate will read the names of some of those who have lost their lives to gun violence in the past year, and we will continue to do so every day that the Senate is in session. 
   In the name of those who died, we will continue this fight. Following are the names of some of the people who were killed by gunfire one year ago today. 
   October 12, 1999: 
   Michael S. Chambers, 43, Seattle, WA; 
   Rueben M. Clark, 22, Memphis, TN; 
   Kenneth Ditter, 30, Philadelphia, PA; 
   Charles Guerra, 28, Houston, TX; 
   Joel Holbrook, 33, Kansas City, MO; 
   Walton Jerry Holmes, 68, Euless, TX; 
   J.C. Jones, 48, Miami-Dade County, FL; 
   Gregory Mabrey, 27, Baltimore, MD; 
   Khidetra S. McBride, 22, Memphis, TN; 
   Jorge Millan, 40, Miami-Dade County, FL; 
   John Ray, 23, Fort Wayne, IN; 
   Michael SHELBY, 34, Detroit, MI; 
   Nicholas Singleton, 19, New Orleans, LA; 
   Honore Sissoko, 46, Philadelphia, PA; 
   George THOMAS, 19, St. Louis, MO; and 
   Duane G. Weigelt, 69, St. Paul, MN. 
   One of the victims of gun violence I mentioned, 19-year-old Nicholas Singleton of New Orleans, was shot and killed one year ago today by a 19-year-old friend while the two were having an argument. 
   We cannot sit back and allow such senseless gun violence to continue. The deaths of these people are a reminder to all of us that we need to enact sensible gun legislation now.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, with the passage of the Violence Against Women Act in 1994, the Federal Government for the first time adopted a comprehensive approach to combating violence against women. This bill included tough new criminal penalties and also created new grant programs to help both women and children who are victims of family violence. 
   Since that time, violence against women has significantly decreased. But in spite of these improvements, far more needs to be done. 
   Every 20 seconds a woman is raped and/or physically assaulted by an intimate partner and nearly one-third of women murdered each year are killed by a husband or boyfriend. 
   Domestic violence still remains the leading cause of injury to women ages 15 to 44 and sadly, there are children under the age of twelve in approximately four out of ten houses that experience domestic violence. 
   Many victims of domestic violence are not recognized and therefore do not get the help that they need. 
   I am happy to report that the conference report includes several provisions that I authored with Senator COLLINS to assist both older and disabled women who are the victims of domestic violence. Those provisions were part of S. 1987, the Older and Disabled Women's Protection from Violence Act. 
   Unfortunately for some, domestic violence is a life long experience. Those who perpetrate violence against their family members do not stop because the family member grows older. Neither do they stop because the family member is disabled. To the contrary, several studies show that the disabled suffer prolonged abuse compared to non-disabled domestic violence victims. Violence is too often perpetrated on those who are most vulnerable. 
   In some cases, the abuse may become severe as the victim ages or as disability increases and the victim becomes more isolated from the community with their removal from the workforce. Other age-related factors such as increased frailty may increase a victim's vulnerability. 
   It also is true that older and disabled victims' ability to report abuse is frequently confounded by their reliance on their abuser for care or housing. 
   Every 7 minutes in Illinois, there is an incidence of elder abuse. 
   Several research studies have shown that elder abuse is the most under reported familial crime. It is even more under reported than child abuse with only between one in eight and one in fourteen incidents estimated to be reported. 
   National and State specific statistics are not available for domestic abuse against disabled individuals. However, several studies of specific areas indicate that abuse is of longer duration for women with disabilities compared to women without a disability. Canadian studies over the last decade indicate that the incidence in that country at least of battery for women with disabilities was 1.5 times higher than for women without a disability. 3 other independent studies indicated that ``Regardless of age, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation or class, women with disabilities are assaulted, raped and abused at a rate of more than two times greater than non-disabled women'' Sobsey 1994, Cusitar 1994, DisAbled Women's Network 1988. 
   Older and disabled individuals who experience abuse worry they will be banished to a nursing home or institutions if they report abuse. 
   Many older women were raised to believe that family business is a private matter. Problems within families were not to be discussed with anyone, especially strangers or counselors. 
   They also must struggle with the ethical dilemma of reporting abuse by their children to the authorities and thus increasing their child's likelihood of going to jail. Shame and fear gag them so that they remain ``silent victims.'' 
   Disabled women also wrestle with the fear that they may lose their children in a custody case if they report abuse. 
   This bill includes modifications of the STOP law enforcement state grants program and the ProArrest grants program to increase their sensitivity to the needs of older and disabled women. These programs provide funding for services and training for officers and prosecutors for dealing with domestic  violence. This 
   training needs to be sensitive to the needs of all victims, young and old, disabled and non-disabled. The images portrayed in the media of the victims of domestic violence generally depict a young woman, with small children. Consequently, many people including law enforcement officers may not readily identify older or disabled victims as suffering domestic abuse. 
   Only a handful of domestic abuse programs throughout the country are reaching out to older and disabled women and law enforcement rarely receive training in identifying victims who are either older or disabled. 
   The bill also sets up a new training program for law enforcement, prosecutors and others to appropriately identify, screen and refer older and disabled women who are the victims of domestic violence. 
   Improvement in this program can be made with respect to identifying abuse among all age groups especially seniors who are often overlooked. When the abuser is old, there may be a reticence on the part of law enforcement to deal with this person in the same way that they might deal with a younger person. Who wants to send an ``old guy'' to jail? However, lack of action jeopardizes the victim further because then the abuser has every reason to believe that there are no consequences for their actions. Another common problem is differentiating between injuries related to abuse and injuries arising from aging, frailty or illness. Too many older or disabled women's broken bones have been attributed to disorientation, osteoporosis, or other age-related vulnerabilities without any questions being asked to make sure that they are not the result of abuse. 
   With the graying of America, the problems of elder domestic abuse in all its many ugly manifestations, is likely to grow. I believe that we need to take a comprehensive look at our existing family violence programs and ensure that these programs serve seniors and are sensitive and knowledgeable of elder domestic abuse. 
   In addition, the disabled's injuries may be falsely attributed to their disability and the bill authorizes a new program for education and training for the needs of disabled victims of domestic violence. 
   I thank Chairman HATCH and Senator BIDEN for working with me to include these provisions that should help to ensure that Federal Anti-Family Violence Programs are indeed available for all victims whether young or old, or whether able-bodied or a woman with a disability. 
   In just the past year, the Supreme Court offered an important ruling on the Violence Against Women Act. The decision was certainly not one that I would have hoped for. 
   In the case of U.S. v. Morrison, the Supreme Court struck down a provision of the Violence Against Women Act that gave victims of rape and domestic violence the right to sue their attackers in federal court. Congress passed this law to give women an additional means of pursuing justice when they are the victims of assault. We passed this law because the States themselves did not always adequately pursue rapists and assailants. And the States acknowledged this. 
   Thirty-six States had entered this suit on behalf of the woman who had been victimized. They wanted victims of violence against women to retain the right to bring their attackers to court. But the Supreme Court, in a narrow vote, decided otherwise. The vote: five to four. 
   This action by the Senate reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act will overcome that court decision.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to offer some remarks on a timely and important topic--our national celebration of Hispanic Heritage Month. 
   Hundreds of years after the decline of the Spanish Empire, a new Hispanic presence is making itself felt on the world stage. Democracy is taking deep root throughout much of Latin America. Mexico just celebrated the selection of a new President in an election that is widely viewed as the freest and fairest election in that country's history. Central America is largely at peace. Free trade has spread south of our border, and will continue to spread further south. 
   And Hispanic Americans are taking their rightful place in this country as an important part of our thriving economy, as a wonderful contributor to the diversity of American culture, and as a powerful political force that deserves attention. 
   It is fitting, then--as National Hispanic Heritage Month is upon us--to recognize the Hispanic-American population for its many important contributions to the traditions and history of this nation. Started 32 years ago, this festive month acknowledges the great history of the Hispanic people, celebrate their past achievements, and recognizes that the Hispanic-American community is an essential component in the future of the United States. 
   Hispanics have immigrated to the United States for many different personal reasons. They have taken the journey to America in hope of a better life for themselves and their families. They have persevered throughout their struggle to maintain their own identity while learning to assimilate into American ways. 
   Today, the Hispanic population in the United States has expanded and become more diverse. It is now our fastest growing ethnic group, its population increasing almost four times as fast as the rest of the population. The Hispanic population is projected to account for 44 percent of the growth in the nation's population between 1995 and 2025. Hispanics are literally changing the face of this nation. 
   The label ``Hispanic-American'' encompasses an enormous diversity of individuals. Hispanics are not a single ethnic group but are comprised of people from Puerto Rico, Cuba, Mexico, and the countries of Central and South America. This diversity has brought a tradition of resilience and excellence to the United States, a country that derives its strength from the diversity of its people. 
   There is an emerging awareness of the contributions and achievements Hispanics have made. Hispanic individuals are prominent in every aspect of American life. In the business world, such names as Adolfo Marzol, executive vice-president of Fannie Mae and George Munoz, CEO of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, are being recognized. Oscar Hijuelos, the first American-born Hispanic to win the Pulitzer Prize for fiction, is known as one of literature's award-winning authors. Maria Hinojosa, a CNN correspondent, was named one of the most influential Hispanic Americans by Hispanic Business magazine, and has received many awards for her reporting. These are just some of the extraordinary individuals who contribute to Hispanic-American culture in our country. 
   A few of the names of Hispanic-Americans from my home state of Illinois will resonate in history, like Luis Alvarez, the Nobel Price-winning physicist, who studied at the University of Chicago before going on to become a central figure in the Manhattan project during World War II. Others are heroes on a quieter scale, like Raymond Orozco who, until his retirement a few years back, headed the Chicago Fire Department with distinction, or Sandra Cisneros whose beautiful stories of women's courage in the midst of poverty have won her international acclaim. But most of all we benefit as a state and as a nation from the thousands of ordinary folks whose lives and dreams and everyday actions make this a richer, stronger, more interesting place to live. 
   The emergence of a sizable Hispanic-American population has been particularly notable in Illinois, to the great benefit of the state. More than a million Illinoisans are of Hispanic heritage. They own 20,000 businesses in the state and generate more than $2 billion in commerce. More than a quarter of a million Hispanic-Americans are registered to vote here, and the state can boast over 1,000 elected officials--from school board members to members of Congress--of Hispanic heritage. 
   While celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month, we shouldn't blind ourselves to the problems that still beset the Hispanic-American community. The poverty rate among Hispanics is still unacceptably high, and Hispanic youth are graduating from high school at rates significantly lower than the general population. Thankfully, many of these problems have abated in the last decade--unemployment among Hispanics is at historically low levels, for example--but there's still plenty of work to be done. 
   That's why I support the ``2010 Alliance'' crafted by Hispanic-American leaders and key policymakers, and announced by President Clinton this June. The Alliance sets educational goals for Hispanic-Americans in five key areas, such as increasing the rate of high school completion and increasing English language proficiency for students. The President's budget for 2001 contains more than $800 million for programs to enhance educational opportunities for Hispanic-Americans. 
   I am also hoping to see passage this session of the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act. This important piece of legislation will insure that all immigrants from Latin America are treated equally in the eyes of the law. The current system that treats immigrants from one country differently from those from another country is cumbersome, confusing and inherently unfair. This Act will also restore some important rights that have historically been offered to the immigrant population, but that are now denied to them due to the highly restrictive policies adopted in the past few years. The Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act as the support of virtually every Democratic Senator as well as strong support from President Clinton and Vice President GORE. I am working hard to overcome Republican resistance to the bill so that it can become law. 
   The Hispanic population has become an integral part of the American mosaic. We have become united by the aspiration to make a better life for ourselves and our children. We know that America and what it stands for--freedom, prosperity, and hope--should extend to everyone the opportunity to achieve their dreams. 
   Through the celebration of Hispanic Heritage Month we can deepen our understanding and appreciation for a culture that has been so influential in creating the America of today and that will help shape the America of tomorrow.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have strongly advocated strengthening so-called 3809 regulations, which governs hardrock mining on public lands. However, attempts to update these regulations have been subject to much debate. 
   I am pleased to see that the Interior conference report included a compromise provision related to the regulations, which should allow the BLM to move forward with their efforts to better protect taxpayers and the environment from the impacts of the hardrock mining industry. 
   However, I am concerned about recent statements made by my colleagues, Senators REID and GORTON, which I feel distort the intent of the provision and would weaken the 3809 regulations. I would like to take this opportunity to clarify my understanding of the meaning of this provision. 
   To paraphrase the language of the bill text included in the conference report, the mining provision permits the BLM to prevent undue degradation of public lands with a new and stronger rule governing hardrock mining on public lands. The only requirement is that the rule be ``not inconsistent with'' the recommendations contained in a study completed by the National Research Council, or NRC. 
   I agree with the Department of the Interior's interpretation that the key phrase ``not inconsistent with'' means that so long as the final mining rule does not contradict the recommendations of the NRC report, the rule can address whatever subject areas the BLM finds necessary to improve environmental oversight of the hardrock mining industry. 
   For example, one of the recommendations made in the NRC report would clarify the BLM's authority to protect valuable natural resources not protected by other laws. Given that recommendation, it would be ``not inconsistent with'' the report to issue a rule that would allow the disapproval of a mine proposal if it would cause undue degradation of public lands, even if the proposal complied with all other statutes and regulations. The final mining provision included in the report would permit such a rule.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it has been more than a year since the Columbine tragedy, but still this Republican Congress refuses to act on sensible gun legislation. 
   Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. Until we act, Democrats in the Senate will read the names of some of those who have lost their lives to gun violence in the past year, and we will continue to do so every day that the Senate is in session. 
   In the name of those who died, we will continue this fight. Following are the names of some of the people who were killed by gunfire one year ago today. 
   October 11, 1999: 
   Clifton Aaron, 21, Kansas City, MO; Daniel Bennett, 23, Washington, DC; Larry Clark, 51, Atlanta, GA; Mico Curtis, 28, Atlanta, GA; Thomas Spivey, 22, Nashville, TN; Arthur Strickland, 28, Gary, IN; Kristian Sullivan, 25, Detroit, MI; Lloyd Whitfield, 28, Detroit, MI; and Arshon Young, 19, Miami-Dade County, FL. 
   We cannot sit back and allow such senseless gun violence to continue. The deaths of these people are a reminder to all of us that we need to enact sensible gun legislation now.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is my sad duty to report to the Senate and to the Congress that I learned a few moments ago that one of the greatest servants of the American people in the Congress in the 20th century passed away last night. 
   Sidney Yates was a Congressman from the city of Chicago who was elected in 1948 and served until 1999, with only 2 years that he wasn't in service. His was an amazing story. I guess it was a great story of America. His mother and father were Russian immigrants who came to this country in the beginning of the last century. He grew up in the city of Chicago and went to law school. Before that, he distinguished himself, as hard as it may be to understand today, in athletics. He was a semi-pro basketball player and was a member of a Big Ten basketball team when he was a student at the University of Chicago. His semi-pro basketball team was called the Lifschultz Fast Freighters. I used to joke with him about this trucking company and the fact that he was the basketball star for them in the city of Chicago. 
   On an impulse, in 1948, he decided to run for Congress. It didn't look like a very good year. Tom Dewey was supposed to be elected President, and this young man who had never run for office before was going to try to be elected to the House of Representatives. People didn't give him much of a chance, and his style of campaigning was in sharp contrast with what we do today. I asked him how he ran for office in 1948. He said he had a buddy who  played a guitar and they went from one ward meeting to the next singing ethnic folk songs for the groups there. If there was a German group, he sang in German. If it was a group of his fellow Jewish Americans, he sang something they would find appealing. 
   There was a young lady watching that campaign by the name of Mary Bain. She had volunteered to work on the Truman campaign. She saw this young man in 1948 wandering around Chicago running for Congress and, frankly, took pity on him and said, ``I am going to try to help this fellow.'' To everyone's surprise, he won in 1948 and came to the House of Representatives; he began a long term of service there. His term of service included many years on the House Appropriations Committee. He was a stalwart, a fighter, a person of real value and principle. 
   In 1962, Sid Yates was persuaded to leave the House of Representatives and run for the Senate. He ran against Everett M. Dirksen--no small task even in 1962. He lost that race, which was the only loss in his political life. In 1964, he returned to the House of Representatives and once again took up service on the House Appropriations Committee. 
   I was elected many years later, in 1982, and a couple years after that began to serve on that same Appropriations Committee. Probably the best fortune I had as a Member of Congress was when I decided to take a chair next to Sid Yates in the Appropriations Committee and sit next to this great man for more than a decade. I learned so much and had such a great time in that experience because of who Sid Yates was and what he stood for. 
   When you look back at Sid's career, there were several things that really made a difference to him, meant a lot to him, and made a difference in this country. He had a passionate commitment to the arts. You know, that gets to be controversial from time to time. The National Endowment for the Arts is occasionally a whipping boy here on Capitol Hill. But Sid Yates never faltered. He believed in the arts. He was a man of the arts. I used to love to listen to him quote the classics from memory. His knowledge of art and music was absolutely legendary. 
   When Sid retired from the House of Representatives, the tributes came pouring in, but particularly from people around the United States who understood that Sid Yates stood up and defended 
   the arts in America when nobody else would. My daughter is an art student at the Art Institute of Chicago. She knew of Sid Yates. She never met him personally, but she knew what he stood for. He was always there fighting for the National Endowment for the Arts and for arts in America. 
   As chairman of the Interior Subcommittee of Appropriations, he also had the responsibility to protect America's national parks and many of our national treasures. He protected them with a vengeance. I can recall some of the titanic struggles in the Appropriations Committee when people would want to exploit America's national treasures. They didn't have a chance when they fought Sid Yates. 
   There were so many other areas where he worked so hard. I recall the creation of the Holocaust Museum. Sid was devoted to the nation of Israel. So many people across America looked to him, and so many Members of Congress looked to him for guidance on important issues involving the Middle East. When he was asked to be part of the creation of the Holocaust Museum, you just knew it would be a success, as it has been here in Washington, DC. He was one of the founding members on the board of directors there and a person absolutely revered for his commitment in that regard. 
   Through it all, too, he was committed to the rights and freedoms of Americans. I know it wasn't always popular, but you could count on him to stand up, in good times and in bad, for the freedoms that were guaranteed under the Bill of Rights. Sid Yates was a great man, and he had a great partner in life in his wife Addie, who was always by his side during his public service. 
   I once asked him what his greatest achievement was in the Congress, and I was surprised that he said: Well, you would not think of it when you think of me as a Democrat, but back in the 1950s, the atomic submarine program was being debated in America, and a fellow by the name of Hyman Rickover was being criticized on Capitol Hill. I came to his defense because I thought he was a good man and had a good program. I am proudest of that moment. 
   I never would have guessed that, but that was just part of Sid's career. For over 50 years, Sid Yates was fighting for America, fighting for Chicago. He left his mark on the Chicago shoreline and the museums and institutions of that great city. But most of all, he left his mark in our hearts--those of us who had the good fortune of serving with him, learning from him, and standing today in tribute to his great memory.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I thank the Senator from Nevada for his comments. I think each one of us who served with Sid Yates on either side of the aisle will never forget him. When his retirement came about, Congressman RALPH REGULA, a Republican from Ohio, never missed a retirement event for Sid Yates. I think it showed that he reached across the aisle and established friendships and alliances that were not just good for Congress but were good for America. He was a wonderful man. I am blessed to have known him, to have served with him, and perhaps to have learned a few lessons at his side. 
   I think his legacy will be his efforts for education, for defense of the arts, for defense of the environment, and for the rights of Americans. 
   Our condolences go to Addie and his family. We wish them strength in this time of loss and tell them we stand by their side.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, before I address the issue that I would like to speak to this evening, I would first like to acknowledge a press conference which was held today, and one which I believe could have some significance across the United States. It was a press conference here on the lawn of the U.S. Capitol. In attendance were Senators BILL FRIST of Tennessee and Senator DEWINE of Ohio--both Republican Senators--as well as my Democratic colleague, Senator CARL LEVIN and I. 
   What would bring together two Democrats and two Republicans in rare agreement here in the close of a session? It is an issue which, frankly, transcends party and transcends region. It is the issue of organ donation in America. 
   Mr. President, 72,000 of our friends and neighbors are sitting by a telephone across America at this very moment waiting for the phone to ring to be told that there is an organ available to be donated to them which could save their lives--72,000. In my home State of Illinois, there are 4,500 such people. Sadly, 300 of them will die before they receive the phone call that an organ is available. 
   So last year I joined with Senators FRIST, DEWINE, LEVIN, and KENNEDY, and half a dozen other Senators from both sides of the aisle, to try to address this on a national basis. We came up with the concept that this Thanksgiving in the year 2000 will be designated ``Give Thanks, Give Life Week,'' where we will try to alert families across America, as they come together for Thanksgiving, that they should take a few moments of time in that festivity and just perhaps talk to one another privately about their feelings about organ donation. 
   We were lucky to have the endorsement of this effort by the National Football League. At 17 different NFL games on Thanksgiving Week, they will have ``Give Thanks, Give Life'' activities. 
   Today, we had at this gathering on the Capitol lawn, Connie Payton, who is the widow of the great Chicago Bear running back Walter Payton. Of course, he died in November of last year from liver disease. He might have been saved by a liver transplant. She has really dedicated her life since trying to work for children and for organ donation in his memory. 
   Connie is a wonderful lady who has been on television in public service spots across Illinois with our Secretary of State, Jesse White, for the past 6 or 7 months. She really is well respected for her efforts. 
   Joining her were representatives of the National Football League from the Washington Redskins and from the Tennessee Titans. It is going to be a great opportunity across America to use what is a great family get-together to remember the very basic: If you want to give thanks, you can give life with an organ donation. 
   So I hope a lot of my colleagues in the other NFL cities will be part of this and will participate. In Chicago, we are going to set up tables in Soldier Field for those who want organ donation cards and to encourage people to sign their driver's licenses. At half time we are going to bring out a bunch of kids and older folks who successfully received organ transplants. 
   At this meeting, we had Jon Hochstein, a 5-year-old boy from Virginia. He had a heart transplant a year and a half ago, and he looks like he will play in the NFL some day. 
   It is a great miracle, but it can't happen without organ 
   donors. Those of us who made that commitment, and have made it known to our families, stand at least the possibility to bring a lot of joy to families.

   Mr. DURBIN. I agree with you. 
   But I remember it well because I was lucky enough to serve on that same subcommittee. I remember that testimony as if it were yesterday. It was amazing that this issue was brought forward. We have done so much. 
   Our Republican colleague, who is a medical doctor, Senator BILL FRIST, was a former heart and lung transplant surgeon. He came down here. He talked about how he used to carry around in his pocket the names of 10 or 12 people who needed an organ donation. He would go through the hospital to see if there were any families with a loved one who was about to pass away who would even consider that. He said since he stopped that practice a few years ago, the number of organ transplants has been increasing each and every year. But it can't continue unless there are more donors. 
   I hope this ``Give Thanks, Give Life Week'' around Thanksgiving will become an annual event. I want to really salute the National Football League and Paul Tagliabue, the Commissioner, for all the support they have given us. They have at least given it the kind of sendoff we hoped to achieve. Connie Payton, who was here the other day; Mark Moseley, who is a former most valuable player in the NFL; Bill Brundage, who was also a lineman for the Washington Redskins--they all came out here to endorse the concept.  
   Many times, people in sports can come forward and spur a lot of folks to take seriously what politicians, such as 
   ourselves, may not be able to impress upon them. So this meeting today was a good one.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I also come to the floor today to talk about an issue that came up the other night during the course of the Presidential debate. I did a television show last night called ``Crossfire.'' Some people probably have seen it. It was typical. It was kind of a controlled shouting match, you might say, on ``Crossfire,'' with Republicans on one side and Democrats on the other. Mary Matalin, who is from Illinois, and has been quite well known for her chairmanship of the campaign for George Bush's election as President, was there representing the Republican side. Of course, we had Bill Press on the Democratic side. We talked about the debate. 
   The interesting thing to me was, the analysis of the debate by these commentators kind of came down to what I consider to be fairly superficial questions: Did George Bush show disrespect for Al Gore when he brought up the whole question about fundraising? Did Al Gore show disrespect for George Bush when he shrugged or was guilty of audible breathing? 
   I thought to myself at one point, is that as good as it gets in a Presidential campaign in America? We can listen to 90 minutes of debate and wonder if someone perhaps cleared their throat at the wrong time, or shrugged their shoulders, or someone else brought up a word or two that might have crossed the line. 
   I think it is worth a lot more for us to have these debates. I think it is important that all of us who are in this business--Republicans and Democrats--take it as seriously as the American people want to take it. 
   What I hear from people across the country is, we are looking for political candidates who speak candidly, honestly, openly, and truthfully. Tell us what you believe, even if we might disagree with it, so we can draw a conclusion about you, not just our ideas about you. 
   The issue that AL GORE came to the debate to talk about is one which was addressed a few moments ago by our colleague, Senator PETE DOMENICI of New Mexico. I listened carefully because I really respect this man. For years, when I served in the House of Representatives on the Budget Committee, and now on the Senate Budget Committee, I have watched PETE DOMENICI. He has gone after the deficit like a tiger and for years and years was admonishing Congress to cut spending, trying to bring down our deficit. He continues in that effort. 
   As a consequence, I wish he were here on the floor. I told him I was going to bring up this issue. I wish he were here on the floor so we could have a little debate about the proposed tax cuts of the two candidates, AL GORE and George Bush, and the impact it would have on America. 
   I think that is the point that AL GORE was trying to make the other night in the debate. There really are two clear choices. Both parties are for tax cuts, but they are entirely different approaches. The American people get to take their pick whichever they think is best for the future of this country and fairest for the taxpayers. 
   Frankly, I think the choice is very stark and very clear. 
   Let me show you, as an example, this chart, which demonstrates George Bush's proposal. It is true, we are at the point in our history where we are going to have a surplus; more money coming into the Federal Treasury than going out for the next 10 years. 
   The amount of that surplus will be somewhere in the neighborhood of $4.8 trillion--a huge amount of money. It sure is a far cry from just a few years back when we had, year after year, deficit after deficit. But, thank goodness, we are now living in an era of projected surpluses. We can start thinking about doing things with that money that will be good for the Nation. 
   The first thing you have to notice out of the $4.8 trillion surplus over the next 10 years is we have all agreed--Democrats and Republicans--that $2.6 trillion of the $4.8 trillion will not be touched. 
   That is a surplus in the Social Security funds. We have said that is off limits. Nobody gets to touch the Social Security fund. So you start off with a 10-year surplus of $2.2 trillion, which I have indicated on this graph. 
   Then we take a look at the projection, first from George Bush, as to what you might do with that. Well, there will be a surplus as well in the Medicare trust fund, the hospitalization plan for the elderly and disabled, of about $360 billion. We think that should also be off the table. We should not touch it. We know Medicare won't last forever, and we want it to be solvent. So if you take away that amount, you are down to $1.8 trillion over the next 10 years. 
   Then, of course, you take the proposal of George Bush for tax breaks of $1.3 trillion, and you find that you have $500 billion left over the next 10 years. 
   Then George Bush has also endorsed other Republican tax breaks, such as the estate tax, the marriage penalty tax, the telephone tax, a whole variety of tax breaks which total $940 billion. Now we find ourselves in short order in the deficit category again. If you do all these things, you are back in the deficit world. 
   Then take a look at proposals by Governor Bush for additional spending on a variety of things--the military, education, whatever it happens to be--$625 billion, and that brings the deficit to a total of $1 trillion over the next 10 years. Then there is the proposal by Governor Bush that suggests we should privatize Social Security. That would cost $1.1 trillion. So add that to the $1 trillion, and now you have $2.1 trillion. With added interest costs of these additional debts of $400 billion at the end of 10 years, you started off with a $4.8 trillion surplus and now, at the end of it, under the George Bush plan, you have a $2.5 trillion deficit. 
   None of us wants to see a return to those deficits. So the alternative which has been proposed on the Democratic side by Vice President GORE suggests a much more reasonable approach: Start with the same $2.2 trillion, the non-Social Security surplus; protect the Medicare trust fund, $1.8 trillion; targeted investments, $530 billion. What is that for? Additional medical research at the National Institutes of Health, more money for our schools, environmental protection, cleaning up some of the environmental waste sites across America. Now add in the prescription drug benefit under Medicare, which we support on the Democratic side. You are now down to $943 billion. 
   Then we bring in our tax cuts, $480 billion worth of tax cuts, which I will describe in a few minutes. Then after you have reduced interest, you have a net of $310 billion on the plus side. You are not back in deficit land again. You don't see the red ink on this chart. You are still above the line. You still have a surplus. 
   The Vice President has suggested that we should put this in a rainy day fund because, frankly, all of these economic projections are just guesses about the future. If we guess wrong, we should have a rainy day fund for emergencies. The good news is, as we address this approach, by the year 2012, we will have eliminated, under Vice President Gore's proposal, the publicly held national debt in America. 
   What does that mean? It means that the debt being held by folks who own treasuries and securities in the Federal Government will have been retired. And if that is retired, then 
   it means less competition for capital, lower interest rates, more opportunity for businesses to expand and families to borrow money for mortgages. It also means that our kids will not be carrying the burden of the national debt on their shoulders. I don't think we can leave our children a better gift. Those who would suggest that a tax cut is a much better deal miss the point. 
   The best deal is for us to eliminate the publicly held national debt, have targeted tax cuts, and end up with a surplus at the end. To find ourselves, as Governor Bush has proposed, running into all of this red ink from his proposals would be a recipe for disaster. We would not only still have our national debt, we would be adding to it. I don't think that does our kids and grandchildren any good whatsoever. 
   When AL GORE said repeatedly the other night that the Bush tax cut spends more for the wealthiest 1 percent than the total that he wants to  spend on education, defense, health and prescription drugs, that is exactly what the figures show. The tax cuts proposed by George Bush for the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans, $667 billion worth of tax cuts, are greater than the investments he wants to make in defense, health care, education, and prescription drug benefits combined. It is his choice. In this business of politics, it is a business of choices. I think it is important for us to reflect for a moment on the distribution of those tax cuts proposed by George Bush. 
   This was a point raised earlier by Senator DOMENICI. I am sorry that we didn't have a chance to be on the floor together so we could explore what we are talking about. 
   Who are the people who make the top 1 percent of income in America? They turn out to be folks who make more than $319,000 a year. That is $25,000 a month. I don't expect people to hold up their hands if they happen to be in that category. When you talk about those who need a tax cut, does it spring to your mind automatically that this is the first group we should care about, that 40 or 50 percent of all the tax cuts ought to go to people making over $25,000 a month? Boy, that sure doesn't calculate in my mind. 
   And the Bush tax cut, the average tax cut for those people making over $319,000 a year, is $46,000 a year. That is the Bush tax cut for the top 1 percent. You go down to people in the lower income categories and you see that it is small change. If you are making less than $14,000 a year, George Bush thinks you need a tax cut, too, $42 a year. If you are making less than $24,000 a year, it is up to $187 a year; under $40,000 a year, $453 a year. 
   As you look at this, you have to ask yourself a question: Is it really important for Members of Congress to feel the pain of the wealthiest people in America or perhaps to identify with a lot of middle-income and working families who are struggling with the necessities of life? 
   I come to this job believing that our responsibility isn't to the wealthiest. I think they are doing pretty well. America has been pretty prosperous for the last 8 years, more economic prosperity than at any time in our history. And it shows. People are living better. They are saving more. They are enjoying a better lifestyle. To think they need a tax cut at this moment in our history rather than to eliminate the national debt, rather than to provide tax cuts for people in lower income categories, is beyond me. 
   There are some interesting statistics, too, about what has 
   happened to Federal tax rates since Bill Clinton and AL GORE took over. There was a statement made frequently by Governor Bush that he wants to cap the total Federal tax rate at 33.3 percent. He said no one should pay more than a third of their income in Federal taxes. That is an interesting proposal. But as you get into it, this is what it says. Let me give you an idea. 
   For middle-income families, since the Clinton-Gore administration took office, the total Federal tax rate has dropped to 22.8 percent, the lowest rate since 1978. So telling those folks we are not going to let your taxes go beyond 33.3 percent, they are already doing well. Tax rates are coming down. We want to continue to see them come down with more targeted tax cuts. For families with incomes of $24,000, the tax rate went from 19.8 percent in 1992 to 14.1 percent in 1999, the lowest tax rate since 1968. 
   So when the suggestion is made that the Federal tax rate won't be any higher than a third for anybody, it really goes back to the highest income categories. That is his shorthand version of saying: I want to give a tax cut not to working families but to people at the highest income categories. What George Bush is challenging is basically the idea of a progressive income tax, something that we really agreed on almost 80 years ago in America. 
   We said, if you are well off and you are doing better, you should pay a higher tax rate than people who are struggling to get by. 
   Every President has gone along with that from the beginning, Democrats and Republicans alike. But the arguments coming from Governor Bush at this point suggest he doesn't believe that. He believes we should reduce the rate for the wealthiest people in the country and not provide similar tax relief for those who are in lower income categories. 
   It would be a virtual windfall, in terms of tax benefits, for some of the wealthiest people in America. Honest to goodness, should we be on the floor of the Senate and in the House dreaming up ways to make Bill Gates' life more comfortable? I don't think so. How about Donald Trump? I think he is doing okay. I watch the way he dresses and his lifestyle. I don't think he will need this $46,000 from George Bush. In fact, if he receives it, he may not even notice it. 
   When we talk about tax cuts on the Democratic side, we are talking about things that working families will definitely notice. Let me give you some ideas of the things we have come up with that we think are targeted tax cuts consistent with keeping the economy moving forward and helping everybody, not just a few. The Republicans criticized these, but that is what campaigns are about. 
   On the Democratic side we believe the No. 1 concern of working families is paying for their children to attend college. You can look at kids coming out of college who are $15,000, $20,000 in debt, and higher. Parents wonder, for goodness' sakes, how can we save up enough for this child to be able to go to college. I did a survey in Illinois. Over the last 20 years, college tuition in public and private universities in my State has gone up 200 to 400 percent. So it is understandable that there would be anxiety among parents as they try to think about how they are going to pay for college. 
   Well, Vice President GORE and the Democrats have suggested that up to $12,000 of college tuition and fees should be deductible on your taxes. You can't do that now. We think you should. That would be a helping hand to working families who want their kids to go to college and acquire the best skills, but they don't want them loaded down with debt when they graduate. It is simple, straightforward, honest, and popular. I have been across my State, which is split down the middle politically. I have yet to run into a crowd that didn't applaud that suggestion. They know, either through their kids or their own life's experience, that this is the sort of thing that works. I went to Rockford College in Rockford, IL, and I asked them, ``What is the average indebtedness of your graduates upon graduation?'' They said, ``It's $20,000 after getting out of school.'' 
   If the Gore plan for education expense deductions were in place, that student would graduate with a debt of $4,000 or $5,000, instead of $20,000. And if you have accumulated college debt, you will be able to claim a tax credit for the interest that you have to pay on it. So I think that is the kind of targeted tax cut that makes more sense, rather than giving Bill Gates $46,000 a year, which he won't even notice. 
   Secondly, a lot of people are concerned about day care. I understand now with a grandson--and Senator REID and I were talking about our grandkids earlier. I have a 4-year-old grandson, and my daughter and son-in-law are concerned about quality day care and the cost of it. We want Alex to have the very best. But it gets expensive. A lot of families can't afford the best. So we give a tax credit for day care, but it 
   is not adequate. It doesn't meet the need. A lot of families struggle and worry. They are hoping that the kids they pick up at the end of the day will be better off than when they left them, but they are never sure. 
   Wouldn't it make more sense for us to have a greater tax credit for day care? A lot of working families would applaud that. Kids in a better environment have a better chance to be healthy and safe and to succeed. So that is a targeted tax cut which has been supported by Vice President GORE and supported on the Democratic side. 
   A third one relates to long-term care. This is one that virtually all of us face as our parents get older and need additional attention. We may find, perhaps, that a visiting nurse, or some sort of convalescent care, or assisted living situation is the key for happiness for a person you love very much, a parent who has given you their entire lives. But it is expensive, and there are a lot of out-of-pocket expenses involved when a conscientious family cares for an aging parent or grandparent. 
   As the Democrats have proposed, I think a tax break for those engaged in  long-term care assistance for their parents and relatives is a sensible investment. Today, at a town meeting which we have every Thursday--Senator FITZGERALD and I--for visitors from Illinois, a young lady talked about her little boy who suffered from autism and how, after all of the efforts by the school district and her health insurance, she and her husband still had to borrow from relatives and take out of pocket to care for their disabled little boy. She said to me: Why in the world can't I get help under the Tax Code for that? 
   I think she is right. Doesn't it make more sense for us to make sure the Tax Code is sensitive to people's real needs in raising their families? 
   When these folks are making a sacrifice for their children, shouldn't we be there to help them along? That is the difference. On the Democratic side, we target the tax cuts as I have just described. On the Republican side, they say, no, we think the wealthiest top 1 percent in America should get 42.6 percent of the tax breaks; those making over $300,000 a year should get $46,000 a year in tax breaks. And, frankly, they disparage our approach as being ``too selective.'' Well, it is true; our tax cuts do go for specific purposes, but they are purposes with which real families can identify. 
   So when the debate started disintegrating into a question about who was clearing their throat, or shrugging their shoulders, or glaring at whom, I thought there is much more at stake in this election. I hope in the closing weeks of the election--and the Vice Presidential debate is tonight, and the Presidential candidates will debate on two more occasions in the next few weeks--we can get down to business here. I think there is a clear choice on so many issues. 
   I haven't mentioned prescription drugs, and I would like to do that for a moment. There is such a dramatic difference between the approach that George Bush proposed for prescription drugs and that by proposed by Vice President GORE. Did you know the Bush proposal, in the first 4 years, would depend on each State enacting a prescription drug benefit? That's right. Every single State would have to enact the law and do it their own way. That means just a handful of people will be assisted. In Illinois, over a million people might qualify for prescription drug help, but because of the way the law is 
   written, only 55,000 actually do. It is limited to a certain number of diseases and certain drugs. Frankly, that doesn't do the job. As a consequence of that, you will have a lot of people left behind. 
   Governor Bush says for 4 years we will let the States take care of it, if they want to. Some States already have prescription drug benefit plans. Illinois is one of them, but Texas is not. So the State of Texas, where he is Governor, hasn't even enacted a prescription drug benefit plan. And now George Bush says we will leave it up to the States and they can show the initiative and leadership when it comes to prescription drugs for 4 years. Then, at the end of 4 years, things get very interesting under Governor Bush's plan. It is at that point he says we will take it away from the Governors in the States and put it in the loving and caring arms of a group which we know America trusts the most--insurance companies. Insurance companies. 
   So the decisions on the prescription drugs won't be made by doctors, nurses, or health care professionals. Once again, they will be made by clerks at insurance companies, who will decide which drugs they are going to put in their formulary, their accepted prescription drugs, and which ones they will not. They will decide the premiums and how much the copay will be. You will decide on your own how much help you will get. If you happen to be making a certain amount of money, you may not qualify for any assistance whatsoever. That is the George Bush plan. That is his approach. He says it gives you maximum choice. You get to pick your own insurance company. What a break. Then your insurance companies get to pick the drugs which you may be allowed to take. 
   Contrast that with the Democratic plan, supported by AL GORE. He says this ought to be a voluntary universal plan under Medicare. There is your choice. The private insurance companies versus Medicare. That is the choice I think a lot of people don't understand is really before us in this Presidential election. Gore believes in a prescription drug benefit under Medicare that is universal, voluntary, and available for everybody. Bush says to first give it to the States, let them work with it for a while, and then give it to the insurance companies and let them take it over. That is the choice. It is no choice at all. Under the Gore plan, the Medicare prescription drug benefit plan, your doctor will be prescribing your drugs. Medicare will help you pay for them. Under the Bush plan, the health insurance company will decide which drugs you can apply for and how much you pay in premiums. 
   I don't think that is much of a choice. I think back to 1965 when I was a student. I can remember the debate under Medicare. The Republicans opposed the creation of Medicare. It was Lyndon Johnson's idea that they called socialistic, the Great Society, so forth and so on. 
   Look at where we are today, 35 years later: A health insurance plan for the elderly and disabled which has lengthened the lifespan of senior citizens and which has brought dignity and independence to their lives. Medicare is a system they trust. When AL GORE suggests that prescription drug benefits should be under Medicare, seniors say: We feel at home with Medicare. We know how it works. 
   Do seniors who voluntarily sign up have to pay a premium? Of course, they pay for Medicare now. 
   It is understandable. They will be making a monthly payment. But look at the peace of mind they buy for $50 a month. They realize there is a maximum amount they will have to pay each year for prescription drugs. If a medical catastrophe comes along, they know they are not out on a limb and unable to fill those prescriptions if they need to. 
   When it comes to tax cuts and prescription drug benefits, what a clear contrast between the two candidates for President of the United States. Elections are about choices. 
   Many of our friends on the Republican side of the aisle, frankly, who didn't have much of an inclination toward these issues are now discovering these issues. They are now newfound converts to the idea of prescription drug benefits. They have come up with a plan, which is interesting, about the reimportation of drugs after they have been sent overseas. You know a lot of drugs made in the United States go to other countries and they are sold for a fraction of the cost. The question is, can you bring them back into the country, buy them at a fraction of the cost in Canada and Mexico, and bring them back in the United States? I support it. 
   It really shows how far this system has disintegrated when the drug companies sell drugs in Canada for a fraction of what they cost consumers in the United States, where the drugs were developed with taxpayers' money through the NIH and inspection by the FDA and others. 
   This reimportation of drugs from other countries, as appealing as it sounds, can't possibly solve the problem. It is impossible to believe that American drug companies will just be shifting drugs overseas on a wholesale basis and expect Americans to import them back into the United States. At some point, they will slow down the sales overseas and they will take control of the situation. 
   The only real answer for a prescription drug benefit under Medicare is for the Medicare system to bargain with the drug companies for reasonable prices and costs for these drugs. That is really a key issue in this campaign and a key difference between the two candidates. 
   I know this is likely to come out tonight in the debate between our colleague, Senator JOE LIEBERMAN, and the former Secretary of Defense, Mr. Cheney. But I don't believe this is the end of the debate. I think it will continue on the Senate and House floor in the closing days and weeks of this session. Ultimately, the American people will be the judge. We have asked the American people in many polls which approach they prefer, and they say, hands down, that the Democrats understand Medicare, understand prescription drug benefits, and understand how to bring tax cuts that work for working families so that prosperity is there for everyone and not just a few.

   Mr. DURBIN. I can respond in this regard. I know the Republican so-called Patients' Bill of Rights was so good that the insurance companies approved of it and embraced it and endorsed it. Frankly, it is supposed to be a law that protects consumers against the excessive attitude and conduct of these insurance companies. Excuse me if I am skeptical, but this bill is endorsed by the lobby that is supposed to be fighting for the Patients' Bill of Rights. I smell a rat. Maybe I shouldn't use that term in light of the political campaign that is going on. I suggest perhaps that it not a real Patients' Bill of Rights.

   They have created their own Trojan horse, this phony bill on the Patients' Bill of Rights. Honestly, I think the American people are going to see through it.

   Mr. DURBIN. The Republican leadership in the Senate doesn't want to allow a vote on the Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights, almost the identical bill that passed in the House, because they know it would pass and it would be an embarrassment to them. The Democrats would win that battle. I don't think the people at home care whether the Democrats win or the Republicans win. They want families to win. This is an example where families would win, where you could have protection. 
   Let me give an example. I am sure the Senator is well aware of this. If a woman in the course of a pregnancy is going to her obstetrician, and because there is a change of insurance companies at her employment, she is asked to go to a different HMO, we provide that she can continue with the same doctor's care, in whom she has confidence, through the completion of her pregnancy. I think it is common sense and good medical judgment. I think both sides could agree on it. That is part of our Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   It says if you are going to the emergency room with a child, you don't have to check in the glove compartment, pull out the insurance policy, and go through it page by page to get the right hospital. It says if somebody at an insurance company makes a wrong decision and you lose your life or your health, they can be held accountable, as every business and person in America is held accountable. 
   Those are some basics in the Democrats' Patients' Bill of Rights. The Republican leadership does not want that issue to come to the floor because they now know we have the votes to pass it. They have blocked us every step of the way.

   Mr. DURBIN. That is the reason a Patients' Bill of Rights hasn't passed in the Senate. It is not a question of what is right and popular, what the people want, and what health care professionals say will be best for the future of health care. It is a question of political muscle. The insurance companies have more political muscle in the Senate. They have stopped us from bringing this bill to the floor for a vote. 
   Shortly we will adjourn and go home with a lot of unfinished business. This is one of them. We came this close to doing it, but the Republican leadership said: No, we are not going to allow the Patients' Bill of Rights to come to the floor for a vote. That is an illustration of their insensitivity to what people in this country really care about: good health care. This Congress has not responded to it. In many respects, this Congress couldn't care less. That is sad because it is our responsibility, as representatives of the people of the States who elect us to listen to their needs and to respond to them. We have been totally unresponsive because of the efforts of the Republican leadership.

   Mr. DURBIN. The Senator is right. The efforts of our colleague, Senator RUSS FEINGOLD, and Republican Senator JOHN MCCAIN are well documented. AL GORE has said: As President, the first bill we will send the Congress is the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform. The first bill he will accept is a bipartisan bill to deal with campaign finance reform. 
   If we cannot come to grips with the abuses of the campaign finance system, several things will occur. The special interest groups, which rule the corridors of Congress and continue to rule the campaigns, will set the agenda; and secondly, many good men and women will continue to refuse to get into this business because they don't want to mess with multimillion-dollar campaigns, these attack ads that come from every direction, and the attacks on personal lives and reputation which have become so commonplace in negative campaigning. 
   It is interesting to me we have a bill so clearly bipartisan. The Republican Senator, JOHN MCCAIN, was very popular as a Republican candidate for President. In fact, he carried a few States in the Republican Presidential primary. Yet we can't even get that  bill to the floor for a vote in a Senate that is controlled by the Republican Party. 
   I think the American people see through this. I think they understand that this is not a fight over the Bill of Rights, it is a fight over the rights of Americans to be well represented.

   The presiding Senator from Oregon has showed exceptional leadership and courage on the hate crimes issue. This was not an easy issue, I am sure, for him; it was not for any of us. He stood up on that issue. I will remember that for a long time. It was exceptional. We want to make sure we continue in that bipartisan spirit. I hope even in the closing days we might reach out and find some bipartisan common ground to deal with some of these important issues.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, 31 years ago, when I graduated from law school here in Washington, DC, my wife and I picked up our little girl, took all of our earthly possessions, and moved to the State capital of Springfield, IL. It was our first time to visit that town. We went there and made a home and had two children born to us there and raised our family. 
   So for 31 years Springfield, IL, has been our home. It has been a good home for us. We made a conscious decision several times in our lives to stay in Springfield. It was the type of home we wanted to make for our children, and our kids turned out pretty well. We think it was the right decision. Springfield has been kind to me. It gave me a chance, in 1982, and elected me to the House of Representatives, and then it was kind enough to be part of the electorate in Illinois that allowed me to serve here in the Senate. 
   I have come to know and love the city of Springfield, particularly its Lincoln history. I was honored as a Democrat to be elected to a congressional seat of which part was once represented in the U.S. House of Representatives by Abraham Lincoln. Of course, he was not a Democrat. He was a Whig turned Republican--first as a Whig as a Congressman and then Republican as President. But we still take great pride in Lincoln, whether we are Democrats or Republicans. 
   When I was elected to the Senate, their came a time when someone asked me to debate my opponent. They said it was the anniversary of the Douglas-Lincoln debate of 1858 which drew the attention of the people across the United States. Douglas won the senatorial contest that year. Two years later, Lincoln was elected President. 
   It seems that every step in my political career has been in the shadow of this great Abraham Lincoln. 
   In about 1991, I reflected on the fact that in Springfield, IL--despite all of the things that are dedicated to Abraham Lincoln, the State capital where he made some of his most famous speeches and pronouncements, and his old law office where he once practiced law, the only home he ever owned across the street from my senatorial office, just a few blocks away the Lincoln tomb, and only a few miles away Lincoln's boyhood home in New Salem--of all of these different Lincoln sites in that area, for some reason this great President was never given a center, a library in one place where we could really tell the story of Abraham Lincoln's life to the millions of people across the world who are fascinated by this wonderful man. 
   We had at one point over 400,000 tourists a year coming to the Lincoln home. I know they are from all over the world because I see them every day when I am at home in Springfield. 
   I thought: we need to have a center, one place that really tells the Lincoln story and draws together all of the threads of his life and all of the evidence of his life so everyone can come to appreciate him. 
   In 1991, that idea was just the idea of a Congressman, and I tried my best to convince a lot of people back in Illinois of the wisdom of this notion. I worked on it here in Washington over the years. Once in Congress, people came along and said: Maybe it is a good idea. There should be a Lincoln Presidential center. We really ought to focus the national attention on this possibility. 
   We passed several appropriations bills in the House. Some of them didn't go very far in the Senate. But the interest was piquing. All of a sudden, more and more people started discussing this option and possibility. 
   I recall that in the last year of the Governorship of Jim Edgar in his last State of the State Address he raised this as a project that he would like to put on the table for his last year as Governor. He told me later that he was amazed at the reaction. People from all over Illinois were excited about this opportunity. He weighed in and said the State will be part of this process. His successor, Gov. George Ryan, and his wife Laura Ryan, also said they wanted to be part of it. The mayor of Springfield, Karen Hasara, asked that the State accept from the city of Springfield a parcel of real estate so they could build the center. 
   All of a sudden, there came together at the local and State level this new momentum and interest in the idea of a Lincoln 
   Presidential library and a Lincoln center. I was energized by that. 
   Then, of course, the Illinois Congressional Delegation weighed in in support of it, and we have tried now to make a contribution from the Federal level toward this national project, which brings together local, State, and Federal sources in the name of Abraham Lincoln. 
   This Interior appropriations bill, of course, includes $10 million of a $50 million authorization for that purpose.  I think that is a good investment and a very worthy project for which I fought for 10 years. 
   I am happy to have joined with my colleague, Senator FITZGERALD, who offered a bill which authorized this center. He offered this bill as a freestanding piece of legislation. I coauthored it with him. He added an amendment relative to the bidding process, and that amendment was adopted in committee. It was agreed to on the floor. It is my understanding that it is now going to be sent over to the House for conference. I was happy to stand with him in that effort. 
   But I think I would like to reflect for a moment on this project and to say a few words about the debate that has gone on today on the floor of the Senate. 
   The debate seems to focus on several different aspects of this Lincoln center. I cannot tell that it is in the best location in the city of Springfield. I didn't choose that location. I believed it wasn't my place to get involved. The minute this Lincoln center was suggested, people from all over Springfield who owned real estate came flocking to my door and reminded me of what good friends they were and asked me to pick their location for the Lincoln center. I said I wasn't going to do it. It shouldn't be a political decision. It should be a decision made in the best interests of the hundreds of thousands of people who will come and visit this location. 
   The location which they have chosen is in a good spot when you consider the restoration of the old railroad station from which Abraham Lincoln left for his Presidency, and the old State capital which was important in his life and to this new center. They create a campus that I think will be visited and enjoyed by a lot of people. 
   There was also a question about the design of the center. I am no architect or planner. I really defer to others. I know what I would like. I would like to put in my two cents worth. But I am not going to act as an architect, a planner, or an engineer. That is really a decision to be made by others. It should not be a political decision. 
   I think what Senator FITZGERALD said during the course of this debate is that the bidding process for this center should not be political either. I agree with him completely. I think he is on the right track. 
   As he and I have said in various ways, a center that honors ``Honest Abe'' should be built in an honest fashion. That is what we are going to try to do in Springfield, IL. Senator FITZGERALD and I have been in agreement to this point. I believe, though, that we may have some difference of opinion in how we are going to progress from here. 
   I, frankly, believe that trying to create a new bidding process for this center involving Federal rules may be difficult and may be impossible. What agency is going to do it? Who is going to implement these rules and regulations? How will this law apply? But I agree with him that whatever process we use--whether it is Federal, State, or some other means--that it should be one where competitive bidding is the absolute bottom line so that it is open and honest. 
   That is why I asked of the Capital Development Board in Springfield, which I believe will be the agency supervising this bidding, for a letter that expressly states that this process will be done by open competition and open bidding. I received that letter yesterday.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this letter was sent to me by the executive director of the Illinois Capital Development Board, Kim Robinson. I don't know Kim Robinson personally. But she writes to me in this letter of October 3 that there are certain exceptions to competitive bidding under the Illinois State law. She lists all six of them, and then concludes:  
   None of these exceptions have ever or will apply to the library project, as they do not apply to the overwhelming majority of CDB's projects.  
   By that statement it is clear to me that there is going to be open competitive bidding on this project. 
   The point that was raised by Senator FITZGERALD earlier in the debate about qualified bidders is a valid one. Who will be bidding on this project? I do not know. Frankly, no one has come forward to me and suggested that they want to be bidding on this project. It wouldn't do them any good anyway. I am not going to make that decision. I haven't involved myself in the location or design. I leave that to others. 
   But I hope when this happens and bidders are solicited that it is an entirely open process as well. I will guarantee that there will be more attention paid to this bid for this project in Springfield, IL, than probably anything in its history. 
   I credit Senator FITZGERALD for bringing that attention forward. But let us proceed with the premise that it is going to be a transparent process. And let us make certain that as it progresses we will have at least an opportunity to assess it every single step of the way. 
   I also add that during the course of his statement today my colleague has raised questions about previous bidding processes by Governors in the State of Illinois.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, questions have been raised by Senator FITZGERALD about the bidding processes under Governors in the State of Illinois. For the record, there has not been a Democratic Governor in the State of Illinois for 24 years. So if he is suggesting that there have been irregularities under Governors, it is likely that they have not been of my political party. I can tell you without exception that I have never involved myself in any bidding process in Springfield by the State government. I have considered my responsibilities to be here in  Washington and not in the State capital. Frankly, the people who bid on contracts and whether they are successful is another part of the world in which I have not engaged myself. I am not standing here in defense of any of these bidding processes, or making excuses for any of these processes. 
   If there was any wrongdoing, then let those in appropriate positions investigate that and come to conclusions. Whether there was any reason for any kind of prosecution or investigation, that is not in my province nor my responsibility. 
   I hope at the end of this debate we can remove any cloud on this project. This project should go forward. The Illinois congressional delegation supports this project. Let us demand it be open and honest, and then let us support it enthusiastically. Frankly, I think we all have an obligation to taxpayers--Federal, State, and local alike--to meet that goal. 
   I close with one comment because I want to be completely open and honest on the record. My colleague, Senator FITZGERALD, during the course of the debate has mentioned the Cellini family of Springfield. The Cellini family is well known. My wife and I have known Bill and Julie Cellini for over 30 years. We are on opposite sides of the political fence. He is a loyal Republican; I am a loyal Democrat. Seldom have we ever come together, except to stand on the sidelines while our kids played soccer together or joined in community projects. They are friends of ours. I have taken the floor of the Senate to note that Julie Cellini is an author in our town who has done some wonderful profiles of people who live in Springfield. 
   I make it part of this record today, when I came up with the original concept of this Lincoln center, there were three people who came forward and said they were excited about it and wanted to work with me on it. This goes back 10 years now. They included Susan Mogerman, who works with the Illinois State Historical Library, as well as Nikki Stratton, a woman involved in Springfield tourism, and Julie Cellini. These three women have worked tirelessly for 10 years on this project. I never once believed that any of them would be involved in this because they thought there was money at the end of the rainbow. I think they genuinely believe in this idea and they believe it is good for Springfield and good for the State of Illinois. 
   I can't speak to any other dealings by that family or any other family, but I can say every contact I have had with those three women and their families about this project has been entirely honorable, entirely above board, and in the best interests of civic involvement for an extremely important project, not only to our city of Springfield but to the State of Illinois and to the Nation. 
   I hope when this is all said and done, this delegation can come together, closely monitor the bidding process, do everything in our power to help make this center a reality, and at the end of the day I hope we will be alive and be there at the opening of this great center. 
   I was honored a few months ago by our Democratic leader, TOM DASCHLE, to secure a spot as a member of the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission. I can think of few higher honors than to work and celebrate the life and accomplishments of one of the world's greatest leaders. The actual bicentennial will not be fully celebrated until 2009. This legislation is a great first step in a celebration of the life and accomplishments of a great President.

   Mr. DURBIN. I thank Senator FITZGERALD. 
   In closing, you know your senatorial lineage is traced to Steven Douglas, and I checked the history of the Senate. I am afraid he is on our side of the aisle, and he traced himself to my seat. You have some distinguished senatorial colleagues who proceeded you, and I am certain you are very proud of them as well.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have spoken with the staff of Senator LEAHY and, if I go beyond 10 minutes, I ask that the additional time be taken from that allocated to Senator LEAHY. 
   I thank Senator HATCH for his leadership and friendship on the Senate Judiciary Committee. We have our differences. When I served on the committee, we had some profound differences, but I respect him very much, and I respect the job he does. 
   I thank Senator HATCH personally for the kind attention which he has given to the vacancies in my home State of  Illinois. I am happy to report that with the nomination and confirmation of Michael Reagan, we will have a full complement of Federal judges in our State, which will make the workload more manageable all across the State. So I thank Senator HATCH and also Senator FITZGERALD. We have been working for the last 2 years, on a very bipartisan basis, toward approving these nominees to have come before the Senate. 
   Before I address the nomination of Michael Reagan, I would like to address a larger issue which involves not only the Senate Judiciary Committee but the entire Senate, the Congress, and the people of this country because this week marks the opening of the Supreme Court's new term. It is a good moment to reflect on the role of the Supreme Court, its past, and its future. 
   This brief statement that I present to you represents some of the concerns I have about the Supreme Court, the role it is playing, and the impact of the Presidential election on the future of that Court. 
   One of the most interesting books ever written about America was written by a French tourist by the name of Alexis de Tocqueville. He came to the United States 165 years ago, traveling around different cities and making observations about this American character. This was a brand new nation. De Tocqueville wrote in his famous work his observations and took them back to Europe. 
   One might think that a book such as that would be lost in history. It turns out that de Tocqueville's observations were so impressive that 165 years later we still turn to this book, and I think it is nothing short of amazing that his observations turn out to be valid today. De Tocqueville made an observation about America and about all of the important political questions in our country which sooner or later turn out to be judicial questions. This wasn't a criticism. Quite the contrary. De Tocqueville admired the innovations in the American judiciary that granted the courts the independence and clarity of function that were found nowhere else in the world. De Tocqueville believed these observations would mean that America's judicial system would hear, and act on, the most important issues of the day. He couldn't have been more correct. 
   Think about the ``big issues''. The issues that the American people have cared about--argued about--most deeply. The issues that spark the most debate--and the most passion. Sooner or later, the battle over these issues comes before the highest court in the land. Slavery. Child labor. Worker safety. Monopolies. Unionization. Freedom of the press. Capital punishment. Segregation. Environmental protection. Voting rights. A woman's right to choose. 
   The battle always comes to the Supreme Court; always comes before the nine justices who are Constitutionally granted enormous responsibilities, and enormous power. 
   In just the past year, the Supreme Court has offered important rulings on abortion, school prayer, gay rights, aid to parochial schools, pornography, Miranda rights, violence against women, parental rights--just to name a few. Not all of these decisions have turned out as I would have hoped. 
   For instance, take the case of U.S. vs. Morrison. The Supreme Court struck down a provision of the Violence Against Women Act that gave victims of rape and domestic violence the right to sue their attackers in federal court. Congress passed this law to give women an additional means of pursuing justice when they are the victims of assault. We passed this law because the States themselves did not always adequately pursue rapists and assailants. And the States acknowledged this! 
   Thirty-six States had entered this suit on behalf of the woman who had been victimized. They wanted victims of violence against women to retain the right to bring their attackers to court. But the Supreme Court, in a narrow vote, decided otherwise. The vote ..... five to four. 
   But this close margin is not unusual on our highest court--it is becoming commonplace. Rarely has the Supreme Court been so narrowly divided for such a long period of time. The replacement of just one judge could drastically change the dynamic of the Court for decades to come. 
   Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices Scalia and Thomas--the Court's most conservative members--tend to vote together on hot button social and political issues such as affirmative action and school prayer. Centrist conservatives, Justices O'Connor and Kennedy, usually join them. The dissent is often written by the more liberal justices--Stevens, Souter, Ginsberg and Breyer. Both Ginsberg and Breyer are Clinton appointments. 
   Many of the Supreme Courts decisions have been made on the basis of a single vote. Partial birth abortion--five to four. Age discrimination--five to four. Gay rights--five to four. Warantless police searches--five to four. The federal role in death penalty cases--five to four. 
   These are not mere academic cases. These are decisions that change people's lives. We all hope that the Supreme Court will act wisely and fairly. But we also all know--history and human nature tell us so--that 
   this is not always the case. 
   We learned in school about the Dred Scott case. Mr. Scott had lived in my home state of Illinois--where slavery was banned--and sued for his freedom on the basis that he had already lived as a free man, and had the right to continue to do so. The Supreme Court infamously disagreed, finding that Mr. Scott was nothing more than property--``to be Used in Subserviency to the Interests, the Convenience, or the Will, of His Owner'', a man ``Without Social, Civil, or Political Rights.'' The decisions of the Supreme Court--and at times, the opinion of just one Justice--can make the difference between having, or losing, a cherished right. 
   Perhaps that is the reason that my colleague, the senior Senator from Utah, is of the opinion that a President's power to make nominations to the Supreme Court and to the federal bench is--and this is a quote--``.....the single most important issue of this next election.'' 
   I think he's right. The next President may have the opportunity to make two or three appointments to the Supreme Court. He may even appoint the next Chief Justice. 
   In the first two hundred years since the signing of the Constitution, the Supreme Court invalidated 128 laws that had been passed by Congress. About one law every two years, on average. Since 1995, however, the Court has struck down 21 laws, more than four per year. This is an unprecedented assertion of judicial power. 
   Will the next President try to use the appointment process to further shift the balance of power between the branches of government? 
   Will the next President of the United States use a litmus test to ``pack'' the Supreme Court with Justices--Justices whose minds were already made up on important issues? 
   That is what the far right, members of the Federalist Society, want. They want to turn back the hands of the clock. 
   So I'm inclined to agree with the distinguished Senator from Utah. This is, indeed, one of the most important issues of the Presidential campaign. 
   Imagine a Supreme Court with three Antonin Scalia's--three Clarence Thomases--three radically conservative Justices bent on greatly restricting the authority of the federal government. The philosophical balance of the Court would shift dramatically. One by one the protections that have been built up over the past thirty five years could fall. 
   If you read the history of the Supreme Court, you will note that up until the time Franklin Roosevelt was President, it was an extremely conservative and somewhat lackluster Court. The Court started to change during Roosevelt's Presidency, and beyond. Republican and Democratic Presidents thereafter appointed more activist judges who looked at the problems facing America. One by one, the protections which we built up over that period of time would be in jeopardy. 
   Protection of the rights of minorities, women, and the handicapped; protection of voting rights, civil rights, worker rights, reproductive rights; protection of the environment; protection from gun violence; and protection of our fundamental freedoms as Americans. One by one, a different court could challenge each of these protections.  
   No longer could the federal government require background checks for gun purchases, rein in polluters, or protect the persecuted. 
   I hope all Americans will give some thought to the type of Supreme Court they feel can best serve the American people. I hope they give it some thought before they go out and vote in November. 
   In addition to who will be appointed, it's also critical to realize who is not being appointed. 
   More than any previous president, President Clinton has succeeded in diversifying the bench. Nevertheless, women and minorities are still underrepresented in our Federal courts. 
   It isn't as if some Members of Congress have not tried to address this disparity. But as hard as we try to diversify the bench, we have not been able to produce the record of success that we would like to show. 
   I wonder how one of the great Justices ever to serve on the Supreme Court, Justice Thurgood Marshall, would have reflected on the treatment of a nominee, Ronnie White for the Federal District Court in Missouri. He is a member of Missouri Supreme Court. He is African American. He was judged qualified and reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee. Then he was rejected on the Senate floor by a party-line vote. Some labeled him a ``judicial activist.'' They produced some excuses or reasons for not confirming him, and he was defeated--one of the few times in modern memory that a judge made it to the floor and lost on a recorded vote. 
   I wonder how Justice Thurgood Marshall, the first black Justice appointed to the Supreme Court 33 years ago, would observe and reflect on what happened to Ronnie White. 
   I think Justice Marshall would have viewed the current state of judicial nominations differently than the Federalist Society. This conservative group has over 25,000 members plus scores of affiliates, including former Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr; Supreme Court Justices Thomas and Scalia; and University of Chicago's Richard Epstein and Frank Easterbrook, also a federal appellate judge. 
   And their numbers are growing. The Federalist Society has chapters in 140 out of the 182 accredited law schools. The campus chapter at the University of Illinois College of Law is very active. 
   I don't have to tell you about the Society's ``originalist'' approach to the Constitution. Justice Scalia's and Justice Thomas's opinions clearly reflect their point of view. 
   I don't have to tell you the Federalist Society has been instrumental in influencing the law. They have helped to weaken or rolled back statutes on civil rights and affirmative action; voting rights; women's right's and abortion rights; workers' rights; prisoners' rights; and the rights of consumers, the handicapped and the elderly. 
   Martin Luther King., Jr., once said, ``The moment is always right to do what is right.'' 
   I think the moment is right to hold the tobacco industry responsible for the costs incurred by the federal government for the medical treatment of individuals made ill by their deadly products. 
   I think the moment is right to hold the gun industry accountable for the irresponsible design, manufacture, distribution and marketing of their lethal weapons. 
   The moment is right to ensure that HMOs and health insurance companies can be held accountable for their wrongdoing that results in the injury or death of American citizens. 
   The moment may be right to elect a President who will appoint Justices who reflect that point of view and will protect our civil liberties. 
   I think the moment is right to remove barriers to the bench so that every citizen--whether man, woman, or whatever ethnic, racial, or religious background--can be adequately represented on our court. 
   I will say a word on behalf of my nominee who is before the Senate, Michael Reagan, the judicial nominee for the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois. Senator FITZGERALD and I reached an agreement about the selection of these nominees. Michael Reagan is the product of this agreement. 
   Michael Reagan possesses all the qualities necessary to make a tremendous contribution to the federal bench. 
   He has strong bipartisan support, as well as, the support of several respected judges, leaders, and organizations including: the National Sheriffs' Association; the Honorable Moses Harrison II, Chief Justice, Illinois Supreme Court; The Most Reverend Wilton D. Gregory, Bishop of the Diocese of Belleville; the Illinois Federation of Teachers; and the Illinois Pharmacists Association. 
   They have all written letters supporting Michael Reagan's nomination to fill the Southern District of Illinois' judicial vacancy. 
   Michael Reagan is a full-time public servant who wears several hats. In addition to his private practice, Mr. Reagan serves as a Commissioner of the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission of the Supreme Court of Illinois. Mr. Reagan has held this position since 1995 and is responsible for supervising the attorney registration and disciplinary system in Illinois, a very important assignment. 
   In addition, Mr. Reagan serves as Assistant Public Defender in St. Clair County, Illinois. In this capacity, he represents indigent criminal defendants charged with major felonies. Mr. Reagan has served as an Assistant Public Defender since 1996. 
   Mr. Reagan also serves as an Honorary Deputy Sheriff in St. Clair, a fully commissioned law enforcement position that he has held for the past three years. His background as a police officer certainly qualified him in that capacity. As an Honorary Deputy Sheriff, Mr. Reagan has full arrest powers and is subject to be called to duty in the event of an emergency. 
   Mr. Reagan began his career in public service as a police officer after graduating with a Bachelor's of Science degree from Bradley University in 1976, his law degree from St. Louis University in 1980. 
   Although Mr. Reagan holds many notable positions, the most important roles he plays are that of husband and father. Mr. Reagan has been married to Elaine Catherine Edgar since 1976. They have four boys. 
   I have met them all; they are great kids. 
   The Reagans will soon be celebrating their 25th anniversary. It is a great family. 
   I am pleased that the Senate will have this opportunity to vote for Michael Reagan. He possesses a rare combination of intelligence, practical experience, temperament, and devotion to public service that makes for a great Federal judge. I look forward to his service on the Federal bench. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it has been more than a year since the Columbine tragedy, but still this Republican Congress refuses to act on sensible gun legislation. 
   Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. Until we act, Democrats in the Senate will read the names of some of those who have lost their lives to gun violence in the past year, and we will continue to do so every day that the Senate is in session. 
   In the name of those who died, we will continue this fight. Following are the names of some of the people who were killed by gunfire one year ago today. 
   October 3, 1999: 
   Jonos Baptiste, 21, Miami-Dade County, FL; Stephen Barnett, 39, Baltimore, MD; Brandon Brewer, 26, Nashville, TN; Frederick Darrington, 30, Kansas City, MO; Ernesto Galvan, 33, Dallas, TX; Charles Hart, 45, Detroit, MI; Lloyd Hilton, 24, Gary, IN; Herman M. Logan, 26, Chicago, IL; Pablo A. Martinez, 20, Oklahoma City, OK; Melvin B. McPhail, 51, Madison, WI; Arthur Michael, 50, San Antonio, TX; Joe Moore, 29, Fort Wayne, IN; Ryan Pearson, 22, Kansas City, MO; Michael J. Plancia, 18, Salt Lake City, UT; Miquel Rivas, 21, Houston, TX; William M. Smith, 52, Memphis, TN; Brandon A. Wakefield, 20, Longview, WA; Porsche Williams, 15, Miami-Dade County, FL; and unidentified male, 62, San Jose, CA. 
   One of the victims of gun violence I mentioned, 15-year-old Porsche Williams of Miami-Dade County, Florida, was a young mother. In addition to caring for her own three-year-old child, Porsche cared for her younger brothers  and sisters after her mother died of cancer. Porsche's life ended tragically when her ex-boyfriend shot and killed her one year ago today. The 21-year-old gunman later shot and killed himself 
   We cannot sit back and allow such senseless gun violence to continue. The deaths of these people are a reminder to all of us that we need to enact sensible gun legislation now.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Georgia, MAX CLELAND, my usual seatmate. I moved over here since he was speaking. I thank him for his presentation. He is one of the hardest working Members of the Senate. I echo his words. We both find ourselves, as do all Members of the Senate, in a real predicament. We have only passed three of the appropriations. Two of the bills have been signed into law, and now we are going to send three of the appropriation bills, as I understand it, into a conference committee without any consideration on the floor of the Senate. 
   This is not unprecedented. It has happened, but very rarely. What troubles me is it is becoming a rather common practice. When the President gives a State of the Union Address at the beginning of the year, he spells out to Congress his hopes for what we can achieve. Many of these hopes are never achieved. That is the plight of a President--relying on a Congress which has its own will and agenda. But the one thing the President is certain will be achieved is that, at the end of the congressional process, the spending bills necessary to keep the Government in business will be passed--13 bills. 
   If Congress did nothing else, it would have to pass the spending bills. Otherwise, agencies of Government would close down and important functions of Government would not be served. So the President, after giving all of his ideas in the State of the Union, steps back and watches Congress, which starts by the 
   passage of a budget resolution and considers 13 different bills, funding all of the agencies of the Federal Government. 
   Sadly, over the last several years we have seen this whole process disintegrate to the point where, at the end of the session--and we are nearly there now as we come to the floor today on September 28; our new fiscal year begins October 1. Sadly, each and every year we end the session without doing our work. We end up with all of these spending bills which involve literally billions of dollars and many different functions of the Federal Government that have never been worked through the system. There are authorizing committees and appropriating committees, and they have the right names on the door. But when it comes to the bottom line, they don't, in fact, do their business and bring a bill out of the committee to the floor for consideration. 
   When we are studying civics and political science, one of the first books we run across is a pamphlet entitled ``How Laws Are Made.'' We teach our children and students across America, and around the world, for that matter, that there is a process in the Congress. The process involves committee consideration, floor consideration on both sides of the Rotunda, and if there are differences, a conference committee, which results in a compromise which is sent to the President for signature. It is very simple and American. 
   Unfortunately, it is also very unusual around this Congress, and now we are seeing more and more bills coming out of the committee, bypassing the Senate Chamber, and heading straight to a conference committee, which means that billions of dollars' worth of spending is never subject to debate or amendment. That means that Senators who don't serve on an appropriations subcommittee or the full Committee of Appropriations never get a chance to even speak on a bill, let alone change it. 
   The beauty of this institution, the most important deliberative body in our Nation, is that we are supposed to represent the people and speak to the issues involved in the bills and then come to some conclusion on their behalf. That is what representative government is about. It is what democracy is about. Yet we have been thwarted time and time again. 
   This time around, we find that only 10 of the bills have seen floor action. The Commerce-Justice-State bill, the Treasury bill, general government bill, and the VA-HUD bill are all moving directly from committee to conference. If this process continues, we will see this year what we have seen in previous years: a bill that comes at the end of the session, called an omnibus bill, that tries to capture all of the unfinished business and a lot of other items that are extraneous and put them in one package. And then, as my friend Senator BYRD from West Virginia can attest, we are handed a bill literally thousands of pages long and told to read it, vote, and go home. A lot of us wonder if we are meeting our constitutional responsibility in so doing. 
   I asked the staff if they kept one of those bills from previous years so I could show it during the course of this debate, but one wasn't readily available. These bills, as Senator BYRD can tell you, are sometimes 2,000 pages long, and we are asked to look at them and evaluate them. That is hard to do under the best of circumstances and impossible to achieve when we have very little time to do it. The best I could find was the Yellow Pages of the District of Columbia. It is not a good rendition because it is only 1,400 pages long. There is about another 600 pages we can expect to receive in the omnibus bill handed to us at the end of the  session. We will be told: ``Take it or leave it. Don't you want to go home and campaign?'' 
   I think that is an abrogation of our constitutional responsibility. 
   I believe that most of us--even those of us on the Appropriations Committee--believe we are duty bound to come before this Senate to address the issues contained in these appropriations bills, to debate them, as we are elected to do, to reach an agreement, hopefully on a bipartisan basis, and pass the bill on to the House for its consideration and to a conference committee. 
   There was a mayor of New York City named Fiorello La Guardia--a famous mayor--who, when there was a newspaper strike in his town, went on the radio and read the cartoons and the comics to the kids so they wouldn't miss them. But he said what I think is appropriate here: There is no Democratic or Republican way of cleaning the streets. 
   What he was saying, I believe, is that in many of the functions of government, we really do not need partisanship. In fact, there shouldn't be partisanship. 
   In this situation, Senator BYRD spoke eloquently today about the traditions of the Senate--the idea of federalism, and the respect for small States and large States alike. 
   The fact is that this Chamber, unlike the one across the Rotunda, in which I was proud to serve for 14 years, gives every State an equal voice. But that is a fiction if in fact the legislation never comes to the floor so that Senators from every State can use their voice and express their point of view. 
   That, sadly, is what has been happening time and time again. Their appropriations work may be the most important part of our responsibility in Congress. 
   A few years go when Congress reached a terrible impasse, we actually closed down several agencies of Government for an extended period of time. There were some critics, radio commentators and the like, who said: Well, if they close down the Government, no one will ever notice. 
   They were wrong because, frankly, our phones were ringing off the hook. I can recall people calling my offices from Chicago and Springfield, IL, saying: How are we supposed to get our visas and passports to go overseas? How can we get these Federal agencies to respond? The Department of Agriculture was closed and the farmers needed to contact people about important decisions they had to make. In fact, closing down the Government is noticed, and people should take notice not only because important responsibilities of government are not being met but because Congress has not met its responsibility to make certain that we pass the appropriations bills that lead to the continuation of government responsibilities. 
   The people across America who elect us get up and go to work every morning knowing that if they stayed home and didn't do their job they wouldn't get paid. If they didn't get paid, they couldn't feed their families. We have to do our job. We have no less of a responsibility as Senators to stay here and work as long as it takes to accomplish these things. 
   The interesting thing, as you reflect on this session of Congress, is how little time we have spent in Washington on the Senate floor doing the people's business. This will be the shortest session of Congress we have had since 1956. Out of 108 days of session so far, we have had 34 days without a vote. If we continue at the current pace, it will take us nearly 2 full years to complete the remaining appropriations bills. That is a sad commentary. 
   Most of us who are elected to serve come to work and try to do our best. But if you look at this past year, you will find that we are only going to be in session 2 days longer than a Congress which was dubbed the ``Do-Nothing Congress'' back in the late 1940s. I think that is a sad commentary on our inability to face our responsibility. 
   Why do we find ourselves in this position? I think there are two major reasons. One is we are dealing with spending caps. These are limitations on spending which have been enacted into law which are there to make certain we don't fall back into red ink and into deficits. These spending caps are strings on the Federal Government's spending in appropriations bills. Some of them are reasonable and some of them are easy to live with. Some of them are very difficult to live with. Those of us on appropriations committees know that. As a member of the Budget Committee, I can attest to it as well. 
   The budget resolution, the architecture for all of our spending at the Federal level, was enacted by Congress--not by the President. He has no voice in that process. It was enacted by Congress. We try to live within the spending caps. Then we start to try to put together appropriations bills and quickly learn that in some areas there is just not enough money. Neither party wants to be blamed for breaking the spending caps early in the process. 
   We created unconscionable situations in previous years. One of the most important appropriations bills--the one for Labor, Health and Human Services and Education--was literally ravaged of its money. That money was taken and used in other appropriations bills. It was saved for the very last thing to be done. Knowing of its popularity across the country, many people on Capitol Hill felt that if we were going to bust the caps, we would do it for education, health care, and labor. It happened. 
   This year, as I understand, VA-HUD is one of those bills. What is more important than our obligation to our veterans? Men and women who served this country with dignity and honor were promised health care and veterans' programs. They rely on us to come up with the appropriations for that purpose and then find there is nothing in the appropriations bill to meet those needs. 
   Housing and urban development, an important appropriations bill that provides housing for literally millions of families across America, is similarly situated. We have ravaged the VA-HUD bill this year in an effort to try to make up for all of the other spending shortfalls in the other bills. 
   Everything stacks up as we come near the end of the year. Unlike many previous years, we haven't routed these bills through the Senate floor. So we have never been able to debate what the level of spending on the Senate floor should be for the Veterans' Administration, for the Treasury Department, and for a lot of agencies such as the Department of Justice and the State Department. That puts us at a disadvantage and creates the blockade that we find ourselves in today. 
   There are amendments as well in some of these bills that are extremely controversial because most of the authorizing committees do not come up with their authorizing bills. Many Members of the Senate have said: I have good legislation. I have a good idea. I will put it on the spending bill. I know they have to pass the spending bill ultimately, so we will do that. 
   That introduces controversy in some of these spending 
   bills, and as a result, we find ourselves bypassing the Senate floor in an effort to avoid a controversial vote. 
   I am forever reminded of a quote from the late Congressman from Oklahoma, Mike Synar, who was chiding his fellow Members of the House of Representatives because they did not want to cast controversial votes. The late Congressman Mike Synar used to say, ``If you do not want to fight fires, do not be a firefighter.'' If you do not want to cast controversial votes, don't run for Congress. That is what this job is all about. You cast your votes for the people you represent with your conscience, and you go home and explain it. That is what democracies are all about. 
   Many of these appropriations bills have been kept away from the floor of the Senate so Members of the Senate who are up for reelection don't have to cast controversial votes. That has a lot to do with the mess we are in today. 
   Sadly, we have found that as to a lot of these amendments--some related to gun safety, for example, and some related to the treatment of gunmakers and how they can bid on contracts with the Government--because they were introduced in the appropriations bill, the bill was circumvented from the floor. They never got to the floor for fear Members would have to vote on them, and didn't want to face the music with the people who don't want gun control and with the National Rifle Association. They do not want to face reality. The reality is we have a responsibility to consider and vote on this important legislation.  
   Some have said we don't have time to do all of that. I have been here all week. I think we have been casting a grand total of about one vote a day. I think we are up to a little more than that. 
   There have been days in the House and Senate where we have cast dozens of votes. We can do that. We can limit debate, cast the votes, and get on with our business. 
   This week we have been consumed with the H-1B visa bill, a bill which would allow an increase in the number of temporary visas so people with technical skills can come into the United States. We spent a whole week on it. 
   We are going to go home in a few hours having achieved virtually nothing this week, except for the passage of this short-term spending bill that is pending at the moment. We will delay for another week the business of the Senate. 
   One has to wonder what will happen in the meantime. I think the President is right to insist that Congress stay and do its job. Some people have said: Why not leave the leaders of Congress here in Washington and let the Members go home and campaign? Let the leaders haggle back and forth as to what the spending bills should contain. I oppose that. I oppose it because I believe we all have a responsibility to stay and meet our obligation to the people of this country and to consider these spending bills. 
   A few years ago, in major sports, there was a decision made about the same time, in basketball. I can recall that in high school when your team would get ahead, you would freeze the ball; you would try to run the clock. Players would dribble around and not get the ball in the hands of the opposition and hope the clock ran out. That used to happen at all levels of basketball. Finally, people said, that is a waste of time. People came to see folks playing basketball, not wasting time dribbling. So they put shot clocks in and said after every few seconds, if you don't take a shot, you lose the ball. 
   They did the same thing in football. They said we will basically speed this game up, too; we will make you play the game rather than delay the game. 
   I think we ought to consider, I say to Senator BYRD, the possibility of a vote clock in the Senate that says maybe once every 12 hours while we are in session the Senate is actually going to cast a vote. I know that is radical thinking, somewhat revolutionary. But if we had a vote clock, we wouldn't be dribbling away all of these opportunities to pass important spending bills. We wouldn't be running away from the agenda that most families think are important for them and the future of our country. 
   Look at all of the things we have failed to do this year. This is a Congress of missed opportunities and unfinished business. It is hard to believe we have been here for 115 days and have so little to show for it. When the people across America, and certainly those I represent in Illinois, talk to me about their priorities and things they really care about, it has little or nothing to do with our agenda on the floor of the Senate. They want to know what Congress is going to do about health care. They have kids who don't have health insurance. They themselves may not have health insurance. They wonder what we will do about a prescription drug benefit. We had a lot of speeches on it. We just don't seem to have reached the point where we can pass a bill into law. Sadly, that says this institution is not producing as people expect Congress to produce. 
   With a vote clock running on the Senate floor and Members having to cast a vote at least once every 12 hours while in session, maybe we will address these things. Maybe people won't be so fearful of the prospect of actually casting a vote on the floor of the Senate. 
   Patients' Bill of Rights is another example. People in my home State of Illinois and my hometown of Springfield come to me and tell me horror stories about the insurance companies and the problems they are having with medical care for their families; serious situations where doctors are prescribing certain medications, surgeries, certain hospitalizations, and there will be some person working for an insurance company 100 miles away or more denying coverage, time and time again, saying: You cannot expect to have that sort of treatment even if your doctor wants it. 
   Many of us believe there should be a Patients' Bill of Rights which defines the rights of all Americans and their families when it comes to health insurance. I believe and I bet most people do, as well. Doctors and medical professionals should make these judgments, not people who are guided by some bottom line of profit and loss but people who are guided by the bottom line of helping people to maintain their health. 
   We can't pass a Patients' Bill of Rights. The insurance 
   companies, which are making a lot of money today off of these families, just don't want Congress to enact that law. So they have stopped us from passing meaningful legislation. 
   Another thing we want to do is if the insurance company makes the wrong decision, and you are hurt by it, or some member of your family dies as a result of it, you have a right to sue them for their negligence. Every person, every family, every business in America is subject to a lawsuit, litigation, being held accountable in court for their negligence and wrongdoing--except health insurance companies. We have decided health insurance companies, unlike any other business in America, will not be held accountable for their wrongdoing. 
   With impunity, they make decisions denying coverage. I think that is wrong. I think they should be held to the same standard every other business in America is held to; that is, if they do something to hurt a person because of their negligence or intentional wrongdoing, they should be held accountable. That is part of our law, the ones that we support on this side of the aisle. 
   One can imagine that the health insurance companies hate that idea just as the devil hates holy water. They don't want to see that sort of thing ever happen. So they have stopped us from passing the bill. It is another thing we have failed to do in this Congress--a Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   On prescription drug benefits, to think that we would finally take Medicare, created in 1965, and modernize it so that the elderly and disabled would have access to affordable prescription drugs is not radical thinking. I daresay in every corner of my State, whether a person is liberal, conservative, or independent, they understand this one. People, through no fault of their own, find they need medications that they cannot afford. So they make hard choices. Sometimes they don't take the pill and sometimes they bust them in half, and sometimes they can afford them at a cost of the necessities of life. Shouldn't we change that? Shouldn't we come to an agreement to create a universal, voluntary, prescription drug plan under Medicare? But unless something revolutionary occurs in the next few days, we are going to leave Washington without even addressing the prescription drug issue under Medicare. 
   Another question is a minimum wage increase. It has been over 2 years now we have held people at $5.15 an hour. Somewhere between 10 and 12 million workers in America are stuck at $5.15 an hour. In my home State of Illinois, over 400,000 people got up this morning and went to work for $5.15 an hour. Quickly calculate that in your mind, and ask yourself, could you survive on $11,000 or $12,000 a year? I know I couldn't. I certainly couldn't do it if I were a single parent trying to raise a child. And the substantial number of these minimum wage workers are in that predicament. They are women who were once on welfare and now trying to get back to work. They are stuck at $5.15 an hour. 
   We used to increase that on a regular basis. We said, of course, the cost of living went up; the minimum wage ought to go up, too. Then it became partisan about 15 years ago, and ever since we have had the fight, year in and year out. We may leave this year without ever addressing an increase in minimum wage for 12 million people across America in these important jobs--not just maintaining our restaurants and hotels but also maintaining our day-care centers and our nursing homes. These important people who cannot afford the high-paid lobbyists that roam the Halls of Congress are going to find that this Congress was totally unresponsive to their needs. 
   Issues go on and on, things that this Congress could have addressed and  didn't address. Sadly enough, we are not only failing to address the important issues, we are not doing our basic business. We are not passing the spending bills that we are supposed to pass. As Senator BYRD said earlier, we are derelict in our responsibilities under the Constitution. We have failed to respond to the American people when they have asked us to do our job and do our duty. 
   I hope that before we leave in this session of Congress, we will resolve to never find ourselves in this predicament again; that we are never going to find ourselves having missed so many opportunities that the people of this country have to wonder why we have not accepted our responsibility in a more forthcoming way. 
   I don't know if next year I will be making the proposal on the Senate floor. I have to talk to Senator BYRD. It is kind of a radical idea of installing a vote clock that will run and force a vote every 12 hours around here so we can get something done. But it worked for the National Football League. It worked for the National Basketball Association. 
   And Senator BYRD, I know you can't find it in that Constitution in your pocket, but maybe that is what it will take to finally get this Senate to get down to work on the business about which people really care. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it has been more than a year since the Columbine tragedy, but still this Republican Congress refuses to act on sensible gun legislation. 
   Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. Until we act, Democrats in the Senate will read the names of some of those who have lost their lives to gun violence in the past year, and we will continue to do so every day that the Senate is in session. 
   In the name of those who died, we will continue this fight. Following are the names of some of the people who were killed by gunfire one year ago today. 
   September 28, 1999: 
   Stephanie Borjon, 25, Fort Worth, TX; Fransisco Cabera, 17, Oklahoma City, OK; Everett Lee, 27, Detroit, MI; Dennis Mattei, 19, Bridgeport, CT; Ronald L. Pearson, 29, Memphis, TN; Sohan S. Rahil, 65, Bedford Heights, OH; Justin Thomas, 27, Baltimore, MD; Christopher M. Williams, 26, Memphis, TN; Douglas Younger, 43, Houston, TX; and Unidentified Male, Detroit, MI. 
   We cannot sit back and allow such senseless gun violence to continue. The deaths of these people are a reminder to all of us that we need to enact sensible gun legislation now.

   Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Nevada for leading this debate. I think it is important from time to time, as we get into debate, if the Senator would respond, for us to recap where we are so those who are trying to follow the debate understand it. 
   The underlying bill, the H-1B visa bill, will allow companies in America to bring in skilled workers from overseas. They are telling us they cannot find those workers in America's labor pool. We decided under the H-1B visa, in 1998, to increase the number who could be brought in this fiscal year to 107,500. They are telling us that number is inadequate. They cannot find the workers in America to fill their needs and they do not want to move their companies overseas. 
   So the underlying bill--I ask the Senator from Nevada to confirm this--the underlying bill, at the request of businesses across America, would increase the number who can be brought in for these skilled labor jobs to 195,000 a year. Am I correct?

   Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator would further yield for a question, the underlying bill, at the request of the business interests in this Nation, will allow us to increase the number of skilled immigrants coming in on temporary visas to 195,000 a year. 
   The amendment which the Senator from Nevada, Mr. REID, the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. KENNEDY, as well as the Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. REED, Senator LEAHY of Vermont, and I want to offer to this legislation even addresses it, I think, with more persuasion because the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act, which we are pushing as an amendment to this bill, is supported not only by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce but by the AFL-CIO as well. Business groups and labor groups have come together and said: If you are going to address the issue of immigration, jobs, keeping the economy moving, don't stop with the H-1B, 195,000; deal with American workers who are here who need to be treated fairly. 
   Am I correct in saying to the Senator from Nevada, this is one of the rare examples I have seen on an immigration issue where business and labor have come together so strongly, saying to us this is the best thing for workers and their families and the economy, the amendment we are cosponsoring--the amendment being resisted by the Republican leadership, is it the same amendment?

   Mr. DURBIN. I think the distinction here on the H-1B visa question is, we are talking about bringing new workers, new skilled workers, in on a temporary basis to fill the needs of companies. The amendment, which we want to offer and which the Republicans are resisting, deals with workers already in America, many of whom are asking to be treated fairly under our immigration laws. Business and labor, as well, are saying they deserve to be treated fairly. 
   As an example, the Senator from Nevada has talked about those who came to this country, started families, started working, paid their taxes, never once committed a crime, building their communities and their neighborhoods, and are now caught in this snarl, this tangle, this bureaucratic nightmare of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. They are asking for their chance, as many of our parents and grandparents had, to become American citizens legally and finally. 
   It strikes me as odd that those of us in the Senate who understand how bad this immigration battle is for individuals and families would resist this amendment, the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act. 
   In my office in Chicago, in my senatorial office, two-thirds of the casework is on immigration. We are in a constant battle with the INS. What our amendment seeks to do is to say these people deserve fair treatment. For goodness' sake, you can call yourself a compassionate conservative or a compassionate liberal or a compassionate moderate, but if you believe in compassion, how can you resist an amendment that is going to give to these families here in America--working hard, building our Nation--a chance to be treated fairly under the law?

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would be remiss, following the remarks of the Senator from Alaska, if I didn't comment on the whole energy issue, which is one of great concern to families, individuals, and businesses across America. 
   I have listened carefully as critics of the Clinton-Gore administration came out with statistics about the reason for our plight today. One that is often quoted, and was quoted again by the Senator from Alaska, is the fact that we have not built a new refinery in the United States for the last 24 years. I have heard this over and over again. There are two things worth noting. If I am not mistaken, during the last 24 years, in only 8 of those years have we had a Democratic administration. So if there has been any laxity or lack of diligence on the energy issue, I think that statement reflects on other administrations as much as, if not more than, the current administration. 
   Secondly, the people who make that statement hardly ever note that existing refineries have been expanded dramatically across the United States. That is the case in Illinois and in so many other States. I think it is worth noting that to say we have ignored the increased energy demands for our economy is not a complete statement. We have responded to them. The question, obviously, is whether we have responded enough. 
   There have also been statements made as to whether oil companies have been guilty of price gouging or profiteering. Those of us in the Midwest who, this spring, endured increases in gasoline prices of $1 a gallon, and more, in a very short period of time did not believe that market forces were at work. We believed what was at work was the forces of monopolies that virtually can dictate prices to American consumers. We were not alone in our belief. The Federal Trade Commission, after looking at the issue, could find no reasonable economic or market explanation for this increase in gasoline prices in Chicago or Milwaukee. 
   The other side would blame the Environmental Protection Agency and virtually everybody connected with the Clinton administration. Yet there was no evidence to back up those claims. As a consequence, the FTC is investigating oil companies to determine whether or not they did take advantage of consumers, businesses, and families across the Midwest. We believe it cost tens of millions of dollars to our local economy, and I believe if any fine is ultimately imposed on the oil companies, it should go to benefit the businesses and families who were the victims of these high gasoline prices by these oil companies. 
   The Senator from Alaska also made reference to the decision of this administration within the last few days to release oil on a swap basis from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. It was a hot topic. Mr. Bush and Mr. GORE were involved in this debate for a long period of time. The question, obviously, is whether or not it is going to have any impact on our growing concern about the cost of fuel and energy, particularly the cost of heating oil. Well, we might be able to speculate for a long time, but we don't have to. 
   I call the attention of my colleagues in the Senate to this morning's Washington Post in the business section. The headline reads ``Price of Crude Oil Drops Below $32.'' Let me read from this article by Kenneth Bredemeier of the Washington Post:  
   The price of oil fell to its lowest level in a month yesterday in the wake of the Clinton administration's announcement last week that it is releasing 30 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help ensure adequate supplies of home heating oil this winter.  
   He goes on:  
   ``It was not unexpected,'' said John Lichtblau, chairman of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation. ``It reflects the fact that inventories will be increased. This is not a sharp decline, but it is headed in the right direction. They could fall somewhat more.'' 
   Lichtblau said that while very recently there had been speculation about $40-a-gallon oil, ``now there's speculation that it will drop to below $30. The assumption has changed directionally.''  
   So those who would argue against Vice President GORE and President Clinton's position on the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, saying it won't help consumers and families and it won't help businesses, frankly, have been proven wrong by this morning's headline in the business section of the Washington Post. This is not a campaign publication, this is a report on the realities of the market. Of course, we can't stop with that effort. We have to continue to look for ways to reduce the cost of energy so that families and businesses can continue to profit in our strong economy. 
   But I think the suggestion of the Senator from Alaska embodied in this bill that we begin drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in his State is the wrong thing to do. 
   I recently ran into the CEO of a major oil company in Chicago. I asked him about this. How important is ANWR to the future of petroleum supplies in the United States? He said: From our company's point of view, it is a nonissue. There are plenty of sources of oil in the United States that are not environmentally dangerous situations. He believes--and I agree with it--that you do not have to turn to a wildlife refuge to start drilling oil in the arctic, nor do you have to drill offshore and run the risk of spills that will contaminate beaches for hundreds of miles. There are sources, he said, within the U.S. that are not environmentally sensitive that should be explored long before we are pushed to the limit of finding sources in these environmentally sensitive areas. 
   But the Senator from Alaska and many of our colleagues are quick to want to drill in these areas first. Their motive I can't say, but I will tell you that I don't believe it is necessary from an energy viewpoint. There are plenty of places for us to turn. But drilling for new oil energy sources is not the sole answer, nor should it be. We should be exploring alternative fuel situations. 
   They come to the floor regularly on the other side of the aisle and mock the suggestion of Vice President GORE in his book ``Earth In The Balance'' that we look beyond the fossil-fueled engine that we use today in our automobiles, trucks, and buses and start looking to other sources of fuel that do not create environmental problems. They think that is a pipedream; that it will never occur. Yet they ignore the reality that two Japanese car companies now have a car on the road that uses a combination of the gas-fired engine with electricity; with fossil-fueled engines, and those that do not rely only on fossil fuels to prove you can get high mileage without contaminating the atmosphere. 
   I am embarrassed to say again that the vehicles we are testing first come from other countries. But they are proving it might work. We should explore it. It seems an anathema to my friends on the other side of the aisle to consider other energy sources. 
   But if we can find, for example, a hydrogen-based fuel which does not contaminate the atmosphere and gives us the prospect of providing the energy needs of this country, why wouldn't we explore that? Why shouldn't we push for that research? 
   That is the point made by Vice President GORE. It is a forward visionary thing that, frankly, many people in the boardrooms of oil companies might not like to consider. But I think we owe it to our kids and future generations to take a look at that. 
   To go drilling in wildlife refuges and off the shores of our Nation with the possibility of contaminating beaches is hardly an alternative to sound research. I think we should look at that research and consider it as a real possibility.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the reason for my rising today is to address the issue that is pending before us, which is the H-1B visa bill. This is a bill which addresses the issue of immigration. 
   Immigration has been important to the United States. But for the African Americans, many of whom were forced to come to the U.S. against their will in slavery, most of us, and our parents and grandparents before us, can trace our ancestry to immigrants who came to this country. I am one of those people. 
   In 1911, my grandmother got on a boat in Germany and came across the ocean from Lithuania landing in Baltimore, MD, and taking a train to East St. Louis, IL. She came to the United  States with three of her children. Not one of them spoke English. I am amazed when I think about that--that she would get on that boat and come over here not knowing what she was headed to, not being able to speak the language, unaware of the culture, and taking that leap of faith as millions have throughout the course of American history. 
   What brought her here? A chance for a better life--economic opportunity, a better job for her husband, and for her family, but also the freedoms that this country had to offer. She brought with her a little prayer book that meant so much to her and her Catholic church in Lithuania. It was printed in Lithuanian. It was banned by Russian officials who controlled her country. This woman who could barely read brought this prayer book, considered contraband, because it meant so much to her. She knew once she crossed the shores and came into America that freedom of religion would guarantee that she could practice her religion as she believed. 
   She came, as millions did, in the course of our history--providing the workers and the skills and the potential for the growth of this economy and this Nation. 
   As we look back on our history, we find that many of these newcomers to America were not greeted with open arms. Signs were out: ``Irish Need Not Apply.'' People were giving speeches about ``mongrelizing the races in America.'' All sorts of hateful rhetoric was printed and spoken throughout our history. In fact, you can still find it today in many despicable Internet sites. That has created a political controversy around the issue of immigration, which still lingers. 
   It wasn't that long ago that a Republican Governor of California led a kind of crusade against Hispanic immigration to his State. I am sure it had some popularity with some people. But, in the long run, the Republican Party has even rejected that approach to immigration. 
   The H-1B visa issue is one that really is a challenge to all of us because what we are saying is that we want to expand the opportunity for people with skills to come to the United States and find jobs on a temporary basis. We are being importuned by industry leaders and people in Silicon Valley who say: You know, we just can't find enough skilled workers in the United States to fill jobs. 
   We ask permission from Congress, through the laws, to increase the number of H-1B visas that can be granted each year to those coming to our shores to work and to be part of these growing industrial and economic opportunities. 
   Historically, we have capped those who could be granted H-1B visas--115,000 in fiscal year 1999 and fiscal year 2000, and 107,500 in fiscal year 2001. The bill we are debating today would increase the number of people who could be brought in under these visas to 195,000 per year. 
   I think it is a good idea to do this. I say that with some reluctance because I am sorry to report that we don't have the 
   skilled employees we need in the United States. Surely we are at a point of record employment with 22 million jobs created over the last 8 years. But we also understand that some of the jobs that need to be filled can't be filled because the workers are not there with the skills. We find not worker shortages in this country but skill shortages in this country. 
   I think there are two things we ought to consider as part of this debate. First, what are we going to do about the skill shortage in America? Are we going to give up on American workers and say, well, since you cannot come up with the skills to work in the computer and technology industry we will just keep bringing in people from overseas? I certainly hope not. 
   I think it is our responsibility to do just the opposite--to say to ourselves and to others involved in education and training that there are things we can do to increase and improve our labor pool. 
   The second issue I want to address in the few moments that I have before us, is the whole question of immigration and fairness. 
   Many of us on the Democratic side believe that if we are going to address the issue of immigration that we should address it with amendments that deal with problems which we can identify. 
   I came to the floor earlier and suggested to my colleagues that in my Chicago office, two-thirds of our casework of people calling and asking for help have immigration problems. I spend most of my time dealing with the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Sometimes they come through like champions. Many times they do not. People are frustrated by the delays in their administrative decisions; frustrated by some of the laws they are enforcing; and frustrated by some of the treatment that they receive by INS employees. 
   What we hope to do in the course of this bill is not only address the need of the high-tech industry for additional H-1B visas and jobs, but also the need for fairness when it comes to immigration in our country. 
   In the midst of our lively and sometimes fractious debates in the Senate, I hope we can all at least take a moment to step back and reflect on our very good fortune. We are truly living in remarkable times. The economy has been expanding at a record pace over the last 8 or 10 years. A few years ago we were embroiled in a debate on the Senate floor about the deficits and the growing debt in this country. We now find that the national topic for debate is the surplus and what we can do with it. What a dramatic turnaround has occurred in such a short period of time. It has occurred because more Americans are going to work and more people are making more money. As they are more generous in their contributions to charities and as they are paying more in taxes at the State and Federal level, we are finding surpluses that are emerging in this country. That, of course, is the topic of discussion. 
   Unemployment is at a historic low. So are poverty rates. Our crime rates are coming down. Household incomes have reached new heights. Our massive Federal debt--an albatross around the neck of the entire Nation--has all but vanished, replaced by surpluses that have inspired more than a bit of economic giddiness. 
   We have a need in this country for many high-skilled technology workers. We are all witnesses to this incredible technological revolution, the Internet revolution that is unfolding at a pace almost too rapid for the imagination to absorb. Indeed, in many respects it has been a revolution in modern information technology that has revolutionized the fields of business, medicine, biology, entertainment, and helped to spur our robust economy. 
   When I visit the classrooms across Illinois, particularly the grade school classrooms, I ask the kids in the classroom if they can imagine living in a world without computers. They shake their heads in disbelief. I remember those days, and I bet a lot of people can, too. It was not that long ago. Technology has transformed our lives. These two phenomena, a vibrant economy and an amazing technology, have combined to create an unprecedented level of need in American industry for skilled technology workers, for men and women to design the systems, write the software, create the innovations, and fix the bugs for all the marvelous technology that sits on our desktops or rides in our shirt pockets. 
   The Information Technology Association of America reports the industry will need an additional 1.6 million workers to fill information technology positions this year. A little more than half of these jobs will go unfilled due to a shortfall of qualified workers. Mr. President, 1.6 million workers are needed; with only 800,000 people we cannot fill the jobs. 
   Another trend marks our modern age, the trend towards economic globalization. The other day, we passed the legislation for permanent normal trade relations with China. It is not surprising that our industries are looking for highly skilled workers in the United States. When they can't find them here, they start looking in other countries. 
   Why should workers in another country want to uproot themselves, leave their homes and families, and make the long journey here? The same reason that my grandparents did, and their parents might have before them. They made the journey because for thousands, America is the fairest, freest, greatest country there is. It is a land like no other, a land of real opportunity, a land where hard work and  good values pay off, a land where innovation, creativity, and hard work are cherished and rewarded, a land where anyone, whether a long-time resident whose family goes back to the Revolutionary War, or a brand-new immigrant clutching a visa that grants them a right to work, can achieve this American dream. 
   We have before the Senate this bill to open the door for that dream to greater numbers of high-tech workers, workers the information technology industry needs to stay vital and healthy. It is a good idea to open that door wider. I support it. It is the right thing to do. We can do it in the right manner. We can meet the demanding needs of the technology situation and create a win-win situation for all American workers, no matter what their craft or what their skills, while avoiding the pitfalls that a carelessly crafted high-tech visa program would create. 
   To do it the right way, we have to consider the following: First, we must make available to industry an ample number of high-tech worker visas through a program that is streamlined and responsive enough to work in ``Internet time.'' 
   At the same time, we must set appropriate criteria for granting these high-tech visas. There is a temptation to hire foreign workers for no other reason than to replace perfectly qualified American workers. Perhaps it is because foreign workers are deemed more likely to be compliant in the workplace for fear of losing their visa privileges or because they are willing to work for lower wages, or because they are less expectant of good work benefits. 
   Whatever the perception, we must be on guard against any misuse of the visa program. There must be a true need, a type of 
   specialty that is so much in demand that there is a true shortage of qualified workers. 
   We must also bear in mind that we have not just one, but two principal goals that must be held in balance. The first goal is to fulfill a short-term need by granting high-tech visas. The second, and ultimately more important goal, is to meet our long-term need for a highly skilled workforce by making sure there are ample educational opportunities for students and workers here at home. A proposal to address this need will receive strong support if it embraces the goal of training our domestic workforce for the future demands of the technology industry and provides the mechanisms and revenue to reach that goal. 
   It is interesting that in every political poll that I have read, at virtually every level, when asking families across America the No. 1 issue that they are concerned with, inevitably it is education. I have thought about that and it has a lot to do with families with kids in school, but it also has a lot to do with the belief that most of us have in America--that education was our ticket to opportunity and success. We want future generations to have that same opportunity. 
   I see my friend, Senator WELLSTONE from Minnesota. He has taught for many years and is an expert in the field of education. I will not try to steal his thunder on this issue. But I will state that as I read about the history of education in America, there are several things we should learn, not the least of which is the fact that at the turn of the last century, between the 19th and 20th century, there was a phenomena taking place in America that really distinguished us from the rest of the world. 
   This is what it was: Between 1890 and 1918, we built on average in the United States of America one new high school every single day. This wasn't a Federal mandate. It was a decision, community by community, and State by State, that we were going to expand something that no other country had even thought of expanding--education beyond the eighth grade. We started with the premise that high schools would be open to everyone: Immigrants and those who have been in this country for many years. It is true that high schools for many years were segregated in part of America until the mid-1950s and 1960s, but the fact is we were doing something no other country was considering. 
   We were democratizing and popularizing education. We were saying to kids: Don't stop at eighth grade; continue in school. My wife and I marvel at the fact that none of our parents--we may be a little unusual in this regard, or at least distinctive --went beyond the eighth grade. That was not uncommon. If you could find a good job out of the eighth grade on a farm or in town, many students didn't go on. 
   Around 1900, when 3 percent of the 17-year-olds graduated from high school, we started seeing the numbers growing over the years. Today 80 or 90 percent of eligible high school students do graduate. 
   What did this mean for America? It meant that we were expanding education for the masses, for all of our citizenry, at a time when many other countries would not. They kept their education elite, only for those wealthiest enough or in the right classes; we democratized it. We said: We believe in public education; we believe it should be available for all Americans. What did it mean? It meant that in a short period of time we developed the most skilled workforce in the world. 
   We went from the Tin Lizzies of Henry Ford to Silicon Valley. We went from Kitty Hawk to Cape Canaveral. In the meantime, in the 1940s, when Europe was at war fighting Hitler and fascism, it was the United States and its workforce that generated the products that fought the war not only for our allies but ultimately for ourselves, successfully. 
   That is what made the 20th century the American century. We were there with the people. We invested in America. Education meant something to everybody. People went beyond high school to college and to professional degrees. With that workforce and the GI bill after World War II, America became a symbol for what can happen when a country devotes itself to education. 
   Now we come into the 21st century and some people are resting on their laurels saying: We proved how we can do it. There is no need to look to new solutions. I think they are wrong. I think they are very wrong. Frankly, we face new challenges as great as any faced by those coming into the early days of the 20th century. We may not be facing a war, thank God, but we are facing a global economy where real competition is a matter of course in today's business. 
   We understand as we debate this H-1B visa bill, if we are not developing the workers with the skills to fill the jobs, then we are remiss in our obligation to this country. Yes, we can pass an H-1B visa as a stopgap measure to keep the economy rolling forward, but if we don't also address the underlying need to come to the rescue of the skill shortage, I don't think we are meeting our obligation in the Senate.

   Mr. DURBIN. The Senator is right. I am sure he finds the same thing that I do in rural Illinois when he goes through Minnesota. There are towns  literally hanging on by their fingernails, trying to survive in this changing economy, and some of them are responding in creative ways. In Peoria, they have create a tech center downtown, jointly sponsored by the Chamber of Commerce, the local community, and the community college, where they are literally bringing in people, some our ages and older, introducing them to computers and what they can learn from them. So they are developing skills within their community, the lifelong learning that I mentioned earlier. 
   Down in Benton, IL, which is a small town that has been wracked by the end of the coal mining industry, for the most part, in our State, they have decided in downtown Benton not to worry about flowers planted on the streets but rather to wire the entire downtown so they will be able to accommodate the high-tech businesses that might be attracted there. They are trying to think ahead of the curve. 
   I am not prepared to give up on American workers. I know Senator WELLSTONE is not, either. We need to address the need for more training and education in rural and urban areas alike.

   Mr. DURBIN. I agree with Senator WELLSTONE. As he was making those comments, I thought to myself, that is right up Senator MIKULSKI's alley, and I looked over my shoulder and there in the well of the Senate she is. Senator MIKULSKI addressed this issue of providing opportunities to cross the digital divide so everybody has this right to access. I invite the Senator to join us at this point. We were talking about the H-1B bill that addresses an immediate need but doesn't address the needs of the skill shortage which she raised at our caucus luncheon, or the digital divide. I would like to invite a question or comment from the Senator from Maryland on those subjects.

   Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Maryland. She has been a real leader on this whole question of the digital divide. She caught it before a lot of us caught on. Now she is asking for an opportunity to offer an amendment on this bill. Unfortunately, it has been the decision of the leadership in this Chamber that we will not be able to amend this bill. We can provide additional visas for these workers to come in from overseas on a temporary basis, but they are unwilling to give us an opportunity to offer amendments to provide the skills for American workers to fill these jobs in the years to come. 
   Alan Greenspan comes to Capitol Hill about every 3 or 4 weeks. Every breath he takes is monitored by the press to find out what is going to happen next at the Federal Reserve. On September 23, he gave an unusual speech for the Chairman of the Federal Reserve. He called on Federal lawmakers to make math and science education a national priority. Who would have guessed this economist from the Federal Reserve, the Chairman, would come and give a speech about education, but he did. He called on Congress:  
   ..... to boost math and science education in the schools. 
   He said it was ``crucial for the future of our nation'' in an increasingly technological society. 
   He noted 100 years ago--the time I mentioned, when we started building high schools in this country at such a rapid rate--only about 1 in 10 workers was in a professional or technical job, but by 1970 the number had doubled. Today those jobs account for nearly one-third of the workforce. 
   Greenspan said just as the education system in the early 20th century helped transform the country from a primarily agricultural, rural society to one concentrated in manufacturing in urban areas, schools today must prepare workers to use ever-changing high-technology devices such as computers and the Internet....... 
   ``The new jobs that have been created by the surge in innovation require that the workers who fill them use more of their intellectual potential,'' Greenspan said.......'' This process of stretching toward our human intellectual capacity is not likely to end any time soon.''  
   If we acknowledge that education and training is a national problem and a national challenge, why isn't this Congress doing something about it? 
   Sadly, this Congress has a long agenda of missed opportunities and unfinished business. This is certainly one of them. For the first time in more than  two decades, we will fail to enact an Elementary and Secondary Education Act. At a time when education is the highest priority in this country, it appears that the Senate cannot even bring this matter to the floor to debate it, to complete the debate, and pass it into law. 
   It is an indictment on the leadership of the House and the Senate that we will not come forward with any significant education or training legislation in this Congress. 
   We will come forward with stopgap measures such as H-1B visas to help businesses, but we will not come forward to help the workers develop the skills they need to earn the income they need to realize the American dream. 
   I remember back in the 1950s, when I was a kid just finishing up in grade school, that the Russians launched the satellite, Sputnik. It scared us to death. We didn't believe that the Russians, under their Communist regime, and under their totalitarian leadership, could ever come up with this kind of technology, and they beat us to the punch. They put the first satellite into space. 
   Congress panicked and said: We have to catch up with the Russians. We have to get ahead of them, as a matter of fact. So we passed the National Defense Education Act, which was the first decision by Congress to provide direct assistance to college students across America. I am glad that Congress did it because I received part of that money. I borrowed money from the Federal Government, finished college and law school, and paid it back. And thousands like me were able to see their lives open up before them. 
   It was a decision which led to a stronger America in many ways. It led to the decision by President Kennedy to create the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, putting a man on the moon and, of course, the rest, as they say, is history. 
   Why aren't we doing the same thing today? Why aren't we talking about creating a National Security Education Act? Senator KENNEDY has a proposal along those lines. I would like to add to his proposal lifetime learning so that workers who are currently employed, as Senator WELLSTONE said, have a chance to go to these tech centers that Senator MIKULSKI described, to community colleges, and to other places, to develop the skills they need to fill these jobs that we are now going to fill with those coming in from overseas. 
   Make no mistake--I will repeat it for the RECORD--I have no objection to immigration. As the son of an immigrant, I value 
   my mother's naturalization certificate. It hangs over my desk in my office as a reminder of where I come from. But I do believe we have an obligation to a lot of workers in the U.S. today who are looking for a chance to succeed. Unfortuantely, we are not going to have that debate. The decision has been made by the leadership that we just don't have time for it. 
   Those who are watching this debate can look around the Chamber and see that there are not many people here other than Senator WELLSTONE and myself. There has not been a huge cry and clamor from the Members of the Senate to come to the floor today. The fact is, we have a lot of time and a lot of opportunity to consider a lot of issues, and one of those should be education. 
   I might address an issue that Senator WELLSTONE raised earlier, as well as Senator MIKULSKI. How will workers pay for this additional training? How can they pay for the tuition and fees of community colleges or universities? It is a real concern. 
   In my State, in the last 20 years, the cost of higher education has gone up between 200 and 400 percent, depending on the school. A lot of people worry about the debt they would incur. I am glad to be part of an effort to create the deductibility of college education expenses and lifetime learning expenses. I think if you are going to talk about tax relief--and I am for that--you should focus on things that families care about the most and mean the most to the country. 
   What could mean more to a family than to see their son or daughter get into a school or college? And then they have to worry about how they are going to pay for it. If they can deduct tuition and fees, it means we will give them a helping hand in the Tax Code to the tune of $2,000 or $3,000 a year to help pay for college education. 
   I think that is a good tax cut. I think that is a good targeted tax cut, consistent with keeping our economy moving forward, by creating the workforce of the future. It is certainly consistent with Alan Greenspan's advice to Congress, as he looks ahead and says, if we want to keep this economy moving, we have to do it in a fashion that is responsive to the demands of the workplace. Many Members have spoken today, and certainly over the last several months, of the importance of skills training. 
   Robert Kuttner, who is an economist for Business Week, wrote:  
   ..... what's holding back even faster economic growth is the low skill level of millions of potential workers.  
   I think that is obvious. As I said earlier, in visiting businesses, it is the No. 1 item of concern. The successful businesses in Illinois, when I ask them, What is your major problem? they don't say taxes or regulations--although they probably mention those--but the No. 1 concern is, they can't find skilled workers to fill the jobs, good-paying jobs. It really falls on our shoulders to respond to this need across America. 
   The sad truth is, we have allowed this wonderful revolution to pass many of our people by. We have to do something about American education. It is imperative that we look to our long-term needs, expanding opportunities in our workforce. 
   This means providing opportunities in schools, but also it means afterschool programs, programs during the summer, worker retraining programs, public-private partnerships, and grants to communities to give the workforce of the future a variety of ways to become the workers of the 21st century. 
   As far as this is concerned, I say, let a thousand flowers bloom, let communities come forward to give us their most creative, innovative ideas on how they can educate their workforce and students to really address these needs. 
   We have to improve K-through-12 education. I will bet, if I gave a quiz to people across America, and asked-- What percentage of the Federal budget do you think we spend on education K through 12? Most people would guess, oh, 15, 20, 25 percent. The answer 
   is 1 percent of our Federal budget. One percent is spent on K-through-12 education. 
   Think about the opportunities we are missing, when we realize that if we are going to have more scientists and engineers, you don't announce at high school graduation that the doors are open at college for new scientists and engineers. 
   Many times, you have to reach down, as Senator WELLSTONE has said, to make sure that the teachers are trained so that they know how to introduce these students to the new science and the new technology so that they can be successful as well. That is part of mentoring for new teachers. It is teacher training for those who have been professionals and want to upgrade their skills. 
   I would like to bring that to the Senate floor in debate. I would like to offer an amendment to improve it. But no, we can't. Under this bill, all we have is the H-1B visa. Bring in the workers from overseas; don't talk about the needs of education and training in America. 
   In addition to improving K-through-12 education, we also have to look to the fact that science and math education in K-through-12 levels really will require some afterschool work as well. 
   It has been suggested to me by people who are in this field that one of the most encouraging things they went through was many times a summer class that was offered at a community college or university, where the best students in science and math came together from grade schools and junior highs and high schools to get together and realize there are other kids of like mind and like appetite to develop their skills. I think that should be part of any program. 
   The most recent National Assessment of Educational Progress has noted that we are doing better when it comes to the number of students who are taking science courses. We are doing better when it comes to SAT scores in science and math. But clearly we are not going to meet the needs of the 21st century unless we make a dramatic improvement.  
   Teacher training, as I mentioned, is certainly a priority. In 1998, the National Science Foundation found that 2 percent of elementary schoolteachers had a science degree--2 percent in 1998; 1 percent had a math degree; an additional 6 percent had majored or minored in science or math education in college. In middle schools, about 17 percent of science teachers held a science degree, 7 percent of math teachers had a degree in mathematics; 63 percent of high school science teachers had some type of science degree; and 41 percent of math teachers in high school had a degree in that subject. 
   It is a sad commentary, but a fact of life. In the town I was born in, my original hometown, East St. Louis, IL, I once talked to a leader in a school system there. It is a poor school system that struggles every day. 
   He said, he'd allow any teacher to teach math or science if they express a willingness to try, because they couldn't attract anyone to come teach with a math and science degree. We can improve on that. We can do better. There are lots of ways to do that, to encourage people to teach in areas of teacher shortages and skill shortages, by offering scholarships to those who will use them, by forgiving their loans if they will come and teach in certain school districts, by trying to provide incentives for them to perhaps work in the private sector and spend some time working in the schools. All of these things should be tried. At least they should be debated, should they not, on the floor of the Senate? And we are not going to get that chance. Instead, we will just limit this debate to the very narrow subject of the HB visa. 
   We also need to reach out to minorities. When it comes to developing science and engineering degrees, we certainly have to encourage those who are underrepresented in these degree programs. The National Science Foundation reports that African Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans comprise 23 percent of our population but earn 13 percent of bachelor's degrees, 7 percent of master's degrees, and 4.5 percent of doctorate degrees in science and engineering. 
   Recruiting young people in the high-tech field will require initiatives to not only improve the quality of math and science education but also to spark kids' interest. I talked about the summer programs in which we can be involved, but there are many others as well. The National Defense Education Act should be a template, a model, as the GI bill was, for us to follow. It really was a declaration by our Government and by our people that the security of the Nation at that time required the fullest development of the mental resources and technical skills of its young men and women. That was said almost 50 years ago. It is still true today. The time is now for the Congress to step up to the plate and reaffirm our commitment to education. 
   Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?

<TEXT>
   Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair. 
   Let me close by addressing another critically important amendment which is not being allowed with this bill. It is one of which I am a cosponsor with Senators KENNEDY and JACK REED of Rhode Island and HARRY REID of Nevada. It is entitled the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act. There are many issues which come to the floor of the Senate, but there are few that enjoy the endorsement and support of both the AFL-CIO and the national Chamber of Commerce. This bill is one of them. 
   What we wanted to propose as an amendment was a change in our immigration laws to deal with some issues that are truly unfair. While we look to address the needs of the tech industry, we should not do it with blinders on. There are many other sectors of this robust economy--perhaps not as glamorous as the latest ``dot-com'' company but still very much in need of able and energetic workers--that have difficulty finding workers they need in the domestic workforce. Oddly enough, many of these workers are already here. They are on the job. They are raising families. They are contributing to their communities. They are paying taxes. But they are reluctant to step forward. 
   I am speaking now of immigrants who come to this country in search of a better life. Many immigrants left their homelands against their will. They left because of the appallingly brutal conditions they encountered, whether at the hands of despotic Central American death squads or in the chaotic collapse of much of Eastern Europe. To stay there in those countries meant death for themselves and their families. 
   I am reminded of those immortal words of Emma Lazarus on our Statue of Liberty: Give me your tired, your poor. 
   Maybe some of these immigrants are tired. Who could blame 
   them? Many of them are poor. I can tell you this: Whether people come from other lands to work in high-tech jobs, as the H-1B visa bill addresses, or clean the offices, wash the dishes, care for our children, care for our grandparents and parents in nursing homes, these are some of the hardest working people you will ever see. As Jesse Jackson said in a great speech at the San Francisco Democratic Convention: They get up and go to work every single day. 
   Here they are in this new land, looking to make the best new start they possibly can. But for many of these immigrants, we require them to make that effort with one hand, and maybe even both hands, tied behind their backs. I am afraid our current immigration laws are so cumbersome, so complex, and so inherently unfair that thousands of immigrants to this country are afraid to become fully integrated into the workforce, afraid because our laws, our regulations, and sometimes the unpredictable policies of the INS have created a climate of uncertainty and fear. 
   Employers are looking for workers. The workers are looking for jobs. But they are afraid to step forward. There are thousands upon thousands of people in this country, this great country of ours, who are being treated unfairly--people who have lived here now for years, sometimes decades, but are still forced to live in the shadows, where they are loathe to get a Social Security number, respond to a census form, or open a bank account. People who are an essential component of this thriving economy--everybody knows this. People who are doing jobs that most other people simply do not want to do. Yet we refuse them the basic rights and the opportunities that should belong to all of us. 
   There is no other way to say it: This is simply a matter of an unfair system, created by our own hands here on Capitol Hill, that is ruining lives, tearing families apart, and keeping too many people in poverty and fear. We have the means at hand to change this. With an amendment to this bill, we can rally the forces in the Senate to change the immigration laws and make them fairer. My good colleagues, Senators KENNEDY and REED, and I have made a vigorous effort to bring these issues to the floor. We have been stopped at every turn in the road. We want to have a vote on the bill, the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act. 
   I can't go back to my constituents in Illinois and tell them, yes, we made it easy to bring in thousands of high-tech workers because Silicon Valley had their representatives walking through the Halls of Congress and on the floor of the Senate and the House, but we couldn't address your needs because you couldn't afford a well paid lobbyist. No, we have to do the very best we can to be fair to all. That is a message that will inspire confidence in the work we do in the Senate. 
   Let me tell you briefly what this bill does. This bill, the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act, supported by both organized labor and the Chamber of Commerce, establishes parity; that is, equal treatment for immigrants from Central America and, I would add, from some other countries, such as Liberia, where Senator REED of Rhode Island has told us that literally thousands of Liberians who fled that country in fear of their lives, by October 1 may be forced to return to perilous circumstances unless we change the law; where those who have come from Haiti, Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, Eastern Europe, and other countries, who are here because of their refugee status seeking asylum, may see the end of that status come because the Congress failed to act. We will have their future in our hands and in our hearts. I hope the Senate and Congress can respond by passing this reform legislation. 
   We also have decided, since 1921, from time to time to give those who have  been in the United States for a period of time, sometimes 14 years, and have established themselves in the community, have good jobs, have started families, pay their taxes, don't commit crime, do things that are important for America--to 
   give them a chance to apply for citizenship. It is known as registry status. The last registry status that we enacted was in 1986, dating back to 1972. We think this should be reenacted and updated so there will be an opportunity for another generation. 
   Finally, restoring section 245(i) of the Immigration Act, a provision of the immigration law that sensibly allowed people in the United States who were on the verge of gaining their immigration status to remain here while completing the process. This upside down idea has to be changed--that people have to return to their country of birth while they wait for the final months of the INS decision process on becoming a citizen. It is terrible to tear these families apart and to impose this financial burden on them. 
   I hope we will pass as part of H-1B visa this Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act. It really speaks to what we are all about in the Congress, the House of Representatives and the Senate. 
   Many people have said they are compassionate in this political campaign. There are many tests of compassion as far as I am concerned. Some of these tests might come down to what you are willing to vote for. I think the test of compassion for thousands of families ensnared in the bureaucratic tangle of the INS is not in hollow campaign promises. The test of compassion for thousands from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Haiti refugees asking for equal treatment is not in being able to speak a few words of Spanish. The test of compassion for hard-working people in our country who are forced to leave their families to comply with INS requirements is not whether a public official is willing to pose for a picture with people of color. 
   The test is whether you are willing to actively support legislation that brings real fairness to our immigration laws. That is why I am a cosponsor of this effort for the 6 million immigrants in the U.S. who are not yet citizens, who are only asking for a chance to have their ability to reach out for the American dream, a chance which so many of us have had in the past. 
   These immigrants add about $10 billion each year to the U.S. economy and pay at least $133 billion in taxes, according to a 1998 study. Immigrants pay $25 billion to $30 billion more in taxes each year than they receive in public services. Immigrant businesses are a source of substantial economic and fiscal gain for the U.S. citizenry, adding at least another $29 billion to the total amount of taxes paid. 
   In a study of real hourly earnings of illegal immigrants between 1988, when they were undocumented, and 1992 when legalized, showed that real hourly earnings increased by 15 percent for men and 21 percent for women. Many of these hard-working people are being exploited because they are not allowed to achieve legal status. The state of the situation on the floor of the Senate is that we are giving speeches instead of offering amendments. It is a sad commentary on this great body that has deliberated some of the most important issues facing America. 
   Those watching this debate who are witnessing this proceeding in the Senate Chamber must wonder why the Senate isn't filled with Members on both sides of the aisle actively debating the important issues of education and training and reform of our immigration laws. Sadly, this is nothing new. For the past year, this Congress has done little or nothing. 
   When we see all of the agenda items before us, whether it is education, dealing with health care, a prescription drug benefit under Medicare, the Patients' Bill of Rights for individuals and families to be treated fairly by health insurance companies, this Congress has fallen down time and time again. It is a sad commentary when men and women have been entrusted with the responsibility and the opportunity and have not risen to the challenge. This bill pending today is further evidence that this Congress is not willing to grapple with the important issues that America's families really care about. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for the comments he is making. I ask him if he would draw a historical parallel to the situation we faced in the late fifties, when the Russians launched Sputnik and we, as a nation, decided to devote resources into a National Defense Education Act, so that we would have the scientists and engineers to be able to compete then with the Russians in the space race. President Kennedy followed on with our exploration into space. 
   Aren't we facing a similar challenge today regarding whether we will be able to compete in the 21st century with the scientists and engineers and skilled employees with all the other nations competing for the very best jobs?

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I salute my colleague, the Senator from North Dakota. He has been a leader on the issue of prescription drugs and has challenged all of us to focus on an issue which most American families understand completely. 
   They know what it costs to go to the pharmacy, if you are not lucky enough to have good insurance. They know what it means when you go into your local pharmacy and they tell you how much a drug costs and you almost faint.  
   They say: Wait a minute; don't you have some insurance coverage? 
   Well, yes, I think I do. 
   This happened to me recently in Springfield, IL. It ended up costing me a fraction of what it would have cost. It was a prescription where I had to think twice about whether I wanted to spend that kind of money on it, if the insurance didn't cover it. But that was an option for me; I am in pretty healthy shape. Imagine a person who is really struggling to just survive, to stay healthy and strong, and the choices they have to make when they have limited income. 
   What I am talking about is not an outrageous situation or an outlandish idea. It happens every single day. It happens across America. People, families across America, keep looking to Washington and saying: Do you get it? Do you understand this? Do you care? 
   I have a quote one of my staff came up with that I thought was apropos. It is very old. It goes back to 1913. President Woodrow Wilson wrote it to a friend. He was venting his frustration because several Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee were blocking something he considered to be a high priority. He wrote:  
   Why should public men, Senators of the United States, have to be led and stimulated to what all the country knows to be their duty? Why should they see less clearly, apparently, than anyone else, what the straight path to service is? To whom are they listening? Certainly not to the voice of the people when they quibble and twist and hesitate.  
   That is what this debate gets down to. Are the men and women elected to the Senate and the House of Representatives really listening to the people back home? If we were, would we be wasting a minute and not dealing with the prescription drug benefits people need to survive? 
   Yet when we take a look at what has been proposed, they are dramatically different, the two major proposals coming from the two major candidates for President. The one that comes from AL GORE and JOE LIEBERMAN on the Democratic side suggests to treat the prescription drug benefit as a Medicare benefit; to say, yes, it is available to every American. It is universal. It is an option which every American can take, and we will protect you under Medicare. You will know that there is a limit to your out-of-pocket expenses. It is simple. It is straightforward. It is consistent with the Medicare program that has been around for over 40 years. 
   Frankly, there are some people who don't care for it. The drug companies don't care for it. They are making very generous profits every single year, and they know if all of the people under Medicare came together and bargained with them on drug prices and drug costs, their profits may go down. That is why they resist it. That is why this special interest group has been so good at stopping this Congress from doing what the American people want done. Their profits come first, 
   unfortunately, in the Senate--not the people in this country, not the families struggling to pay the bills. 
   On the other side, they make a proposal which sounds good but just will not work. Under Governor Bush's proposal on prescription drugs, he asserts, for 4 years we will let the States handle it. There are fewer than 20 States that have any drug benefits. Illinois is one of them, I might add. His home State of Texas has none. But he says: Let the States handle it for 4 years; let them work it out. 
   In my home State of Illinois, I am glad we have it. But it certainly isn't a system that one would recommend for the country. Our system of helping to pay for prescription drugs for seniors applies to certain illnesses and certain drugs. If you happen to be an unfortunate person without that kind of coverage and protection, you are on your own. That is hardly a system for America. 
   It is far better to take the approach which has been suggested by Mr. GORE and Mr. LIEBERMAN, to have a universal plan that applies to everyone. Let's not say that a person's health and survival depends on the luck of the zip code, where you happen to live, whether your State is generous or not. I don't think that makes sense in America. I think we are better than that. 
   We proved it with Medicare. We didn't say under Medicare: We will let every single State come up with a health insurance plan for seniors. We said: We will have an American plan, a national plan, and every single American--Hawaii, Alaska, and the lower 48--everyone who can benefit from it gets the same shot at quality health care. And it worked. The critics said, in the 1960s; that is big government; that is socialism, Medicare will be the end of health care as we know it in America. ``Socialized medicine,'' they called it. 
   Wrong, completely wrong. Ask the people in the hospitals and the doctors today what Medicare has meant. It has meant they are able to give the elderly in America quality health care. Just take a look at the raw statistics. Seniors are living longer today than they did in the 1960s. They are healthier. A lot of good things have come from Medicare. 
   We believe the same standard should be applied when it comes to prescription drugs. Let us base this on the Medicare system. If you doubt for a moment that this is a serious problem, I wish you would go to your local pharmacy and ask your pharmacist. When I held hearings across Illinois, I brought in doctors and pharmacists and seniors to talk about this issue. The people who were the most adamant about the need for reform were the pharmacists, the men and women in the white coats behind the counter who get the prescriptions from the doctor and try to fill them for the patient and have to face the reality of the cost. Those are the men and women who know every single day that there are seniors who are not filling prescriptions, taking half of what they are supposed to, ignoring the request and, frankly, the best advice of their doctors because they cannot afford otherwise. 
   Here we stand in the Senate, 7 weeks away from a national election, an election where the American people say a prescription drug benefit is the highest health care priority, and we are not prepared to do anything. Is it any wonder that people looking at the Congress of the United States wonder whether we are paying attention to the reality of life for families across this country? When people can go across the border into Canada and buy the same exact drug sold in the United States, made in the same laboratory, subject to the same FDA inspection, for a fraction of the cost, how in the world can we stand here and say there is nothing we can do about it? There is something we can do about it. There is something we must do about it. 
   This election is a referendum on whether this Congress has the will to respond to families in need. A lady in Chicago, IL, received a double lung transplant. What a miracle. 
   Years ago, that was unthinkable. Now it is possible. It works. She stood before me and looked good several years after it occurred. But she said:  
   Senator, it cost me $2,500 a month for the immunosuppressive drugs to stay alive. I cannot afford it. So what I have done, frankly, is to give up everything I have on earth and move into my son's home, where I live in the basement. I asked for Medicaid at the Department of Public Aid in Illinois and for the money to pay for my prescription drugs each month. I fill out the forms every month to try to make sure I qualify for the drugs.  
   She said:  
   Senator, one month I missed it. I didn't get the paperwork back in time. For one month, I didn't take the drugs and I was worried sick. I went back to the doctor after that month and he said, ``Don't ever let that happen again. You had irreversible lung damage that occurred during that one-month period of time.''  
   Think about the burden on that poor lady's shoulders. How many of us dream of being dependent on our children in our elderly and late years? None of us wants that. Many times my mother has said to me, ``I don't want to be a burden.'' 
   That woman is living in the basement of her kid's home. She has no place to turn and is wondering if she can get the paperwork in on time to qualify for Medicaid. Missing that opportunity, she could lose the chance for the miracle of two new lungs that gave her new life, losing the chance for that miracle to continue. 
   That is the reality of what is happening. Hers is the most extreme case, and I remember it because of that. But as I went across my State, people said: Senator, I get $800 a month from Social Security and it costs me $400 a month for prescription drugs. I don't have any insurance to cover that. 
   A third of the seniors in this country have no insurance protection whatsoever; a third have poor protection, and  a third are lucky because they worked in the right place and had the right retirement. They are covered and protected. When you hear stories and you come back to Washington, you think: Why are we here? The men and women here are supposed to be here to respond to the real needs of America's families. Yet in this case, and in so many others, this Congress has come up empty. Missed opportunity after missed opportunity. 
   Let me suggest another thing to you. One thing I have noticed as I visited families in my State of Illinois is that they talk about their children. They will brag about how good they are at playing soccer or playing the piano or getting good grades. But then there will be a pause, a hesitation, and they say: I wonder how we are ever going to pay for that college education. I hear that over and over. New parents with a little baby might say: He looks like his dad and he is sleeping all night, but how in the world are we going to pay for this kid's college? 
   That is a real concern. The people know the cost of a college education has gone up dramatically. We did a survey in Illinois of community colleges, private colleges, and public universities. Over a 20-year period of time, when a child might consider being in college 20 years later, what happened to the cost of tuition and fees at universities and colleges in my home State of Illinois? They have gone up over 250 percent and, in some cases, over 400 percent. So even if you think you are 
   putting enough money away today to cover what is already a high cost of education, quadruple that cost and you are dealing with the reality of what that could cost in years to come. 
   So families say to me as a Senator and to those of us serving in Congress: Do you hear us? Do you understand it? You tell us that education is good for our kids and for our country. What are you doing in Washington to help us out, to give us a helping hand? 
   The honest answer is: Absolutely nothing. There is something we can do. Senator CHUCK SCHUMER, my deskmate here from the State of New York, and Senator JOE BIDEN of Delaware, have been pushing for a plan that I think makes a lot of sense. It is a plan the Democrats are proposing as part of this Presidential campaign. It is very simple and straightforward. It says that you can take the cost of college tuition and fees and deduct them from your income. What it means is that up to $12,000 of tuition and fees can be deducted. For a family, that means they are going to have a helping hand of around $3,000 each year to pay for it. I wish it were more, but it is certainly a helping hand. 
   When I went to Rockford College in Rockford, IL, I said: What did the average student graduate with in terms of debt? They said it was about $20,000. That is a lot of money when you are first out of college. Yet if the deductibility of college expenses were part of the law in America, that student would be walking out with a debt of $5,000 or $6,000 instead of $20,000. 
   Wouldn't that be good for this country and for that family? Doesn't it give that young man or woman the right opportunity to make a choice of a job or a graduate education? I can't tell you how many young people I ran into who said: Because of my college debts, I had to take the best-paying job. I really want to be a teacher, but they don't pay enough. I got a chance to go with a dot-com and make a zillion, so I had to do that. 
   We lost something there. We lost a potential teacher, someone who wanted to put his or her life into teaching others, but decided, because of the finances, to postpone it or never do it. That is reality. 
   If we look at that reality, the question is, What does Congress do to respond? Instead of coming up with tax relief for middle-income families to pay for college education expenses, the only tax relief bills we have come up with is for the wealthiest people--the so-called elimination of the death tax and the elimination of the marriage penalty tax. When you lift the lid and look inside, it ends up giving over 40 percent of the benefits to people making over $300,000 a year. Excuse me, but if I am making $25,000 a month in income, how much of a tax break do I need? My life is pretty good, thank you. And thank you, America, for giving me the opportunity to have it. I don't need a tax break from this Congress. 
   But the families struggling to pay for college education expenses deserve a tax break. If we really believe that the 21st century should be the American century, we need to invest not only in helping families put their kids through college, but in helping workers who realize that additional skills give them greater earning potential, the chance to get that training and education. Sometimes that costs money. If it is going to cost money and tuition and fees, they, too, should be able to deduct it. Lifetime learning, lifelong learning is a reality today if you want to be successful. You can't step back. 
   When I went into my Senate office representing Illinois 4 
   years ago and put the computer on my desk, believe me, I am not of an age where I am a computer wizard, but I am learning. I realize I have to learn to keep up with this technology because it makes me more effective and efficient. Everybody is learning that lesson, whether you are in a classroom or a workplace, and the people who want to prosper from that experience and want to make their lives better sometimes need additional training. So when we talk about the deductibility of these expenses for lifelong learning and for college education, we are talking about people setting out to improve themselves. It is not a handout. These people are asking for an opportunity to be educated and trained and skilled. 
   One of the bills we are going to debate this week is the H-1B visa. You may not know what the term means, but basically it is a question as to how many people we will allow to immigrate into the U.S. to take highly paid, unfilled jobs--jobs that require skills America's employers say they can't find in the American workforce. Well, it is a real problem. I think we need to have an expansion of the H-1B visa to allow people to come in from overseas to fill these jobs so American companies will stay in America, so that they will continue to prosper, pay their taxes, profit by their ventures, and I think we can help them. 
   But what a commentary on our workforce and our education system that we continue to have to look overseas not for what used to be the brute force of labor coming to build railroads and towns, but now they are the most skilled people in the world. So if we say we are going to allow more people to come into this country to fill the highly skilled jobs, don't we have a similar responsibility to the people and families of this country to explain how, the next time around, there will be Americans skilled to fill these jobs? I think that is part of the debate. Yet you won't hear much about it on the floor of this Senate. We don't talk about education much here. 
   Some of my colleagues want to dismiss it as a State and local issue, that the Federal Government has little or nothing to do with that. I disagree. We should be giving tax relief to families to pay for higher education and even more. When you look at the schools in America, there are genuine needs. I think everybody who has raised a family, as my wife and I have, appreciates that the more kids you have in the room, the tougher it is to manage it. A teacher with 30 kids in a classroom has her hands full. We have to talk about lower class sizes, smaller classes with more individual attention. 
   On the Democratic side, we have proposed 100,000 new teachers who will go into classrooms. Schools are growing and the population is getting larger, and 100,000 teachers will cut back on the number of kids in a classroom and give a teacher a better chance to teach. 
   A teacher came up to me at O'Hare Airport in Chicago and said: I teach on the south side of Chicago. We qualified for the Federal program to have smaller classrooms. Thank you, Senator. It is working. Those kids are getting a better education. 
   I don't deserve the credit. It wasn't my idea. But I happen to support it. We should support more of it. We are not even discussing education on the floor of the Senate. We are talking about H-1B visas to bring in more skilled employees from overseas. And we are not talking about educating and training our kids in the next generation to fill those jobs. We have lost it in this debate. Somehow we are consumed with things that other people think are much more important. I can't think of  anything more important than education. Health care for prescription drugs and education so kids have a better chance for their future makes all the sense in the world. 
   While we are talking about a better future, let me also address the 10 million Americans who got up to go to work and went to work this morning, and who go to work every single morning, not looking for a government check but for a paycheck at the end of the week where they are paid $5.15 an hour. That is the minimum wage in this country, and it has been stuck there for over 2 years. Why? Because this Congress refuses to give some of the hardest working people in America an increase in the minimum wage. These are people who get up and go to work every day, who are waiting on tables in the restaurants, and who make the beds in the hotels. They are the day-care workers to whom we entrust our children, they are people working in nursing homes watching our parents and grandparents, and we refuse to give them an increase in the minimum wage. 
   For decades in this Capitol, this was not a partisan issue. From the time Franklin Roosevelt created the minimum wage until the election of Ronald Reagan, it was a bipartisan undertaking. We raise this wage periodically so people can keep up with the cost of living in this country. But, sadly, it has become a partisan issue. 
   While we fight on the Democratic side to give 10 million Americans an increase in the minimum wage, we are resisted on the other side of the aisle. They don't want to see these increases. Sadly, it means that people who are struggling to get by with $10,000 or $11,000 a year--and, frankly, have to turn to the Government for food stamps and look to other sources and more jobs--many of those people are single parents raising their kids, working at jobs with limited pay and limited requirements for skills, trying to do their level best. We have refused time and time again to increase the minimum wage in this country. That is a sad commentary on this Congress. 
   I also want to comment on the reality that we will be increasing congressional pay this year, as we have with some frequency, to reflect the cost-of-living adjustment. I think that is fair. But doesn't fairness require that we give the same consideration to people who are working for $5.15 an hour? I hope my colleagues, Senate Democrats and Republicans alike, will share my belief that this is something that absolutely needs to be done. 
   Whether we are talking about health care or prescription drugs and fairness in paying people for what they work for, there is an agenda that has gone unfilled in this Congress. It is an agenda which has been ignored and about which the American people have a right to ask us to do something. 
   I can tell you that as we talk about the future of this country and its economy, we are all applauding the fact that we have had the longest period of economic expansion in our history. We have had 22 million new jobs created during the Clinton-Gore administration. There is more home ownership than anytime in our history. There are more small businesses being created, particularly women-owned small businesses, across America. We have seen our welfare rolls going down. The incidence of violent crime is going down. We have seen an expansion of opportunity in this country that has been unparalleled. But if we sit back and want to rest on our accomplishments and our laurels, the American people have a right to throw all of us out of office. Our responsibility is to look ahead and say we can do better to improve this country and make it better for our children and grandchildren. 
   This Congress has refused to look ahead. It has refused to say how we can expand health care so that over 40 million Americans without any health insurance will have a chance to get the basic quality health care on which all of us insist for ourselves and our family. 
   This Congress has refused to address the prescription drug needs of families across America at a time of unparalleled prosperity in these United States. 
   This Congress has refused to look to the need of education when we know full well that the benefits of our economy can only accrue to those who are prepared to use them and who are prepared to compete in a global economy. 
   Yesterday, by an overwhelming vote, we voted for permanent normal trade relations with China. I voted for that. It was 83-15. It was a substantially bipartisan rollcall. We said that country, which represents one-fifth of the world's population, is a market we need. I hope when the President signs the bill we will begin to see an opening of that market for our farmers and our businesses. But we will only be as good in the global economy as we are in terms of the skill and education of America's workers. 
   We know full well that there will always be some country in the world--if not China, some other country--that will pay a worker 5 cents an hour and they will take it. We also know that those workers have limited education and limited skills, perhaps doing a manual labor job. And those jobs are always going to be cheaper overseas; that is a fact of life. 
   But if we are going to prosper in America from a global economy, we have to bring our workforce beyond manual labor, beyond basic skills, and that means investing in our people. It is important to have the very best technology, but it is even more important to have the very best skilled people working in the workplace. We happen to think if we are going to keep this economy moving forward, we need to make certain we don't do anything that is going to derail the economy. 
   We have seen some suggestions--for example, Governor Bush and some of his Republican friends in the Senate who have suggested over a $1 trillion tax cut that they want to see over the next 10 years. They have suggested we change the Social Security system.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak this afternoon on an issue which is important to all Americans, particularly the 10 million who are presently working for a minimum wage. Senator KENNEDY of Massachusetts will join me in a few minutes to discuss the issue, which has been a major crusade for him for the last several years. 
   Earlier I noted that until the mid-1980s the issue of a minimum wage increase was never a partisan issue. In fact, Republican and Democratic Presidents alike endorsed the idea of periodically trying to increase the minimum wage to reflect the cost of living. But for some reason, in the mid-1980s, that all changed. It became a Democratic and Republican battle as to whether people who were earning a minimum wage should be able to keep up with the cost of living, keep up with inflation. Because of that battle, fits and starts and the wins and losses, many minimum wage workers across America started falling behind. In fact, their buying power, working for a minimum wage, was diminishing because Congress had failed to give them an adequate increase in their income to keep up with the cost of living. 
   Some arguments on the other side suggested: If you raise the minimum wage for workers who have no skills, entry level workers, it is going to basically kill jobs because employers are going to have to make a choice. They are either going to pay more to a minimum wage worker on the job and then reduce the size of the workforce or pay less to that minimum wage worker and keep a larger workforce. 
   It seems as if there is linear logic to this argument, but, in fact, when you look at it, the economic history of this country just does not back it up. As you will notice on this first chart which I am showing, as we have seen increases in the 
   minimum wage from April of 1995 where the wage was increased, in October of 1996, to $4.75, and then again in October of 1997 to $5.15 an hour, the current minimum wage, the number of people working in America has continued to grow. So the argument that increasing the minimum wage is a job killer just does not make any sense. 
   Just the opposite seems to be true. In a growing economy, when you give to  the workers at the lowest level an increase in their living wage, they are likely to spend it. They need it for rent, for groceries, for their kids' shoes, for school expenses. So little of it is saved as lower income families are forced to spend everything to make ends meet; that spending, of course, creates demand in the economy for the production of more products and services. That is what has happened to us repeatedly. Since 1996, if you will take a look here at the minimum wage increase, unemployment is down in all the major groups. 
   People say these minimum wage jobs are just for kids who do not have any skills or background. When they come to the workplace and get their first job, they have to be prepared to be paid very little for it. I used to be one of those a long time ago. Take a look at what has happened here between September of 1996 and August of the year 2000. The 1996 minimum wage increase did not kill job opportunities in a single category here: Among teenagers, even among high school dropouts, African Americans, Hispanic Americans, or women in the workforce. 
   One of the other misconceptions is that somehow the minimum wage is just going to be paid to those who are, frankly, children who have limited work experience, a first job, so they will get a minimum wage. Who are these 10.1 million workers across America who would benefit from an increase in the minimum wage? I think you would be surprised to learn, as I was, that 69 percent of the workers who benefit are adults over the age of 20. So the idea that this is a children's wage or a teenager's wage is just wrong. Mr. President, 69 percent of minimum wage workers, 7 million of them, are over 20; 60 percent of these are women and many of these women have children. 
   You know what we are talking about here. We are talking about someone who has gone through a divorce, perhaps has a child they are trying to raise and do their very best by working a minimum wage job. Sixty percent of these minimum wage workers are women and 45 percent of them have full-time jobs. They are full-time minimum wage workers making less than $11,000 a year: 16 percent African American, 20 percent Hispanic; 40 percent of them work in retail. They sell us our hamburgers and our CDs at the store and all the things we buy; 27 percent are in the service sector; 83 percent of the minimum wage workers are heads of households and they are earning between $5.15 an hour and $6.14 an hour. Mr. President, 40 percent of minimum wage workers are the sole adult breadwinners in their families. 
   The argument that we are talking about a training wage for kids who really just want a first time on the job overlooks 40 percent of the minimum wage workforce who are adults trying to make enough money to feed a child--those are the minimum wage workers. I can recall a speech given many years ago by Rev. Jesse Jackson from Chicago, which I am proud to represent in the Senate, when he talked about these people going to work every day--the invisible workforce. We do not see them cleaning our hotel rooms, clearing off the tables, working in the kitchens and the day-care centers and the nursing homes; people we rely on to make America a better place, who do the tough, often thankless jobs in America for $5.15 an hour. 
   In my home State of Illinois, the estimate is we have over 400,000 minimum wage workers. These are people who deserve an increase in that minimum wage for a chance to be able to get out of poverty. Frankly, most Americans agree: If you are a hard-working person who is not looking for a handout but just looking for a chance to go to work, you really deserve some sort of basic living wage. 
   Look at this chart. ``Americans Support Wages That Keep Working Families Out Of Poverty.'' Overwhelmingly, 81 percent strongly agree with this. Does anyone really, listening to this speech, this debate, believe if you are making $10,700 a year you are out of poverty? That you have a comfortable life? Even with the Earned-Income Tax Credit, one of the few things with which we try to help these working families, by and large life is from payday to payday. They are striving just to meet the necessities and basics of life. So when we talk about an increase in the minimum wage, we are talking about helping these families who are going to work every single day finally reach up over the ledge and look ahead, beyond poverty. 
   If welfare reform was not about rewarding that type of person, what was the debate all about? I voted for it. Some of my colleagues said don't do that because you are going to leave the poor behind when they really need help. I hope we never do. 
   But I can tell you, this minimum wage debate is about those people, folks with limited job experience. They are finally off the dole, off welfare, trying to do their best, stuck in a $5.15-an-hour job; showing up for work on a regular basis, full-time employees--45 percent of them--and still stuck at $5.15 an hour. 
   During the Republican Convention in Philadelphia, there was a lot of talk about the economy. It was amazing, in a way, because they failed to acknowledge, as you might expect, we are in a period of prosperity unparalleled in the history of the United States. We have had the longest run of economic expansion ever. We are now talking about eliminating our national debt. That has not happened since the Civil War, I might add--the Civil War in the 19th century, if there is any doubt what I am referring to. 
   In Philadelphia, they said the problem with this economy is it has left too many people behind. It has helped create 22 million new jobs in this country, a lot of them in my State and other States around the Nation. But if you are talking about leaving people behind, how about the people on minimum wage who have been left behind because a Republican dominated and controlled Congress refuses to give a minimum wage increase to the hardest working people in this country? 
   Oh, the Republicans in the House have come forward with a proposal. They have had the idea of implementing this $1-an-hour increase over 3 years. They want to bring it down to 2 years, but there are a couple attachments to it and riders and things they would like to add. For example, they would like to really challenge paying overtime to workers in general--not talking about minimum wage workers but talking about workers in general. Frankly, many of us think that is a bitter pill to swallow; that a lot of hard-working families would have to give up on their overtime pay so the lowest paid workers in this country earning $5.15 an hour would have a chance to get out of poverty and have a living wage. That is not a deal which, frankly, any of us should buy. 
   It is time for us to do the right thing. We are going to go home in a few weeks. A lot of Senators will be campaigning for other candidates or for their own reelection, and they will face a lot of crowds and people coming up to them. You aren't likely to see a lot of minimum wage workers in those crowds. These are hard-working folks struggling to get by, many times with more than one job; they do not have time to listen to politicians who get out and gab and make their speeches on the stump. 
   But it is a shame we will not have a chance to see them because, if we do, we, frankly, have to ask of them some understanding and forgiveness, that this Congress, with its large agenda of important items, has failed to address the most fundamental need in their lives--an increase in the minimum wage so they can survive and raise their children and live in dignity. 
   If we value hard work in this country, we should compensate the hard workers, the minimum wage workers adequately. For over 2 years we have refused to do it. I see my colleague, Senator KENNEDY, is on the floor. I salute him for the leadership he has shown on this issue time and time again. I am sorry we are in a position where both parties no longer have come to a bipartisan agreement on dealing with a minimum wage. 
   But I say to Senator KENNEDY, as I am prepared to yield the floor to him, that this is a battle worth fighting in 
   the closing weeks of this session. As we consider all of the possibilities and all of the special interests that need to be tended to and made happy before we leave, let us not forget the people who cannot afford a lobbyist in this town--the minimum wage workers across America who we count on week in and week out to make America work. 
   I think we owe it to them to increase the minimum wage by 50 cents an hour  over each of the next 2 years, to a level of $6.15, knowing full well that that is not a comfort level, that isn't going to give them relief from concern about paying for the necessities of life; but we owe it to them to increase this wage. Frankly, this Senator is prepared to say that this experience with this minimum wage increase has convinced me once and for all that relying on the goodness and gratitude of Congress on an infrequent basis to give the hardest working people in this country enough money to scrape themselves out of poverty and make a living has to come to an end. 
   We need to put into law a cost-of-living adjustment for the minimum wage, so we can say to the people across America, the millions who work for this minimum wage: Your life is not going to be hanging in the balance as to whether politicians in Washington are paying attention. You pay attention to your family and your job every day. We should pay attention to you by making certain you have a living wage. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor to my colleague from Massachusetts, Senator KENNEDY.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the Senate has been considering an important measure to increase the number of visas available for high-technology workers from other countries to come to the United States. I urge my colleagues to lend their support to that measure but also to an equally important measure, not only for providing a workforce in America but for keeping true to our fundamental sense of American fairness. The bill to which I refer is the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act. I am honored to be a cosponsor of one of the three major elements of that act. 
   The United States is known throughout the world for the splendid vision that guides the actions we take as a nation. America is first and foremost a country that cherishes equality, a land where all people are equal under the eyes of the law, a land of liberty and justice for all. 
   This vision of America is a constant challenge to those of us in the Senate who are privileged to be working for the American people, working to make it concrete and real in everyday life. It is a hard task, indeed, to ensure equality of opportunity for all people, harder still to provide equal justice. Perhaps most difficult of all is the challenge of ensuring that equality of opportunity, of liberty, and of justice are available to the poorest, the most underrepresented, the most disenfranchised segments of American society. 
   There is an area of public policy where our efforts at achieving this American ideal have not always been successful, an area where counterproductive laws and cumbersome bureaucracies have dealt a series of unfair blows against people least able to defend themselves, an area where inequality in the eyes of the law is too often the rule rather than the exception. I am speaking of the plight of our immigrant population. 
   Let me confess at the outset that I come to this subject with some prejudice. My mother was an immigrant to this country. In my office in the Senate above my desk is my mother's naturalization certificate. I keep it there as a reminder that the son of an immigrant to this country can one day be a U.S. Senator, representing a State as great as the State of Illinois. 
   My story isn't unique. There are stories such as mine all over America--of people who came here as immigrants, their sons and daughters, looking for the American dream and finding it. Given that opportunity to participate in this great society, to work hard, to try to achieve their very best, they did. Because of that, we are a great nation. 
   The current state of affairs is shocking when it comes to the arbitrary treatment of immigrants coming to our country. Almost at random, Federal authorities deem some immigrants to be legally here while others in identical situations are denied any legal protection. 
   In a nation that treasures and respects ``family values'', immigrant families are being torn apart under the capricious application of our current laws. Husbands must leave their wives, parents are separated from their children, brothers and sisters told they may never be able to see one another again, all in the name of an immigration policy that treats Nicaraguans differently from Salvadorans, children differently from adolescents, and skilled carpenters differently from skilled computer technicians. 
   The simple, inescapable fact is that our current immigration laws are unfair. They create a highly unworkable patchwork approach to the status of immigrants, one that assaults our sense of fair play. Immigrants from Nicaragua and Cuba who have lived here since 1995 can obtain green card status in the U.S. through a sensible, straightforward process. Guatemalans, Salvadorans and East Europeans are covered by a different, more stringent and more cumbersome set of procedures. A select group of Haitian immigrants are classified under another restrictive status. Hondurans by yet another. 
   Here are some examples: 
   As if this helter-skelter approach isn't bad enough, existing policies also treat family members of immigrants--spouses and children--differently depending on where they live, and under which provision of which law they are covered. Consider the case of young Gheycell, who came to the U.S. when she was 12 years old with her father and sister. The family was fleeing from war-torn Guatemala; fleeing the carnage, brutality and utter chaos that ravaged their poor country. They applied for asylum here in the United States, and received work permits as their case was decided. Nine years  later, the case is still pending. Gheycell's father and sister have been told they will get their green cards, but Gheycell, now 21 years old, is no longer a minor child, and has thereby lost her legal status. Although she has grown up in the United States, although she has become an active and integrated member of her community, although she has attended college here and wants to further pursue her education and her career and, most of all, although she desperately wants to stay together with her family, the vagaries of our current system have plunged this young lady into a status as an undocumented alien. 
   Or consider the plight of Maria Orellana, a war refugee from El Salvador, who fled the country when soldiers killed two members of her family. She has lived the past ten years in the United States. Recently, the INS ordered her deported even though she is eight months pregnant and even though her husband--himself an immigrant--has legal status here and expects to soon be sworn in as a U.S. citizen. When a newspaper reporter asked the INS to comment on Maria's case, the reply was: ``I don't know why Congress wrote it differently for people of different countries. We're not in a position to change a law given to us by Congress ..... we just enforce the law as written.'' 
   Well, the law, in this case, was written badly, and needs to be fixed. That fix is before us today. It is the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act. This bill addresses three areas of the most egregious inequities in immigration law, offering fixes that are not only meet the test of simple fairness, but also benefit our nation in important ways. 
   The first area that the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act addresses is NACARA parity. Currently, the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act--NACARA--creates different standards for immigrants depending on their country of origin. This patchwork approach relies on artificial distinctions and inevitably creates inequities among different populations of immigrants. The Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act would eliminate these inequities by providing a level playing field on which all immigrants with similar histories would be treated equally under the law. The Act extends to other immigrants--whether from the Americas or from Eastern Europe--the same opportunities that NACARA currently provides only to Nicaraguans and Cubans. 
   Secondly, a provision to restore Section 245(i) of the Immigration Act would restore a long-standing and sensible policy that was unfortunately allowed to lapse in 1997. Section 245(i) had allowed individuals that qualified for a green card to obtain their visa in the U.S. if they were already in the country. Without this common-sense provision, immigrants on the verge of getting a green card must return to their home country to obtain their visa. However, the very act of making such an onerous trip can put their status in jeopardy, since other provisions of immigration law prohibit re-entry to the U.S. under certain circumstances. Restoring the Section 245(i) mechanism to obtain visas here in the U.S. is a good policy that will help keep families together and keep willing workers in the U.S. labor force. 
   Third, and equally important, is changing the Date of Registry. Undocumented immigrants seeking permanent residency must demonstrate that they have lived continuously in the U.S. since the ``date of registry'' cut-off. The Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act would update the date of registry from 1972--almost 30 years of continuous residency--to 1986. Many immigrants have been victimized by confusing and inconsistent INS policies in the past fifteen years--policies that have been overturned in numerous court decisions, but that have nonetheless prevented many immigrants from being granted permanent residency. Updating the date of registry to 1986 would bring long overdue justice to the affected populations. 
   Correcting the inequities in current immigration policies is not only a matter of fundamental fairness, it is good, pragmatic public policy. The funds sent back by immigrants to their home countries are important sources of foreign exchange, and significant stabilizing factors in several national economies. The immigrant workforce is important to our national economy as well. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has frequently cited the threat to our economic well-being posed by an increasingly tight labor pool. Well, this act would allow workers already here to move more freely in the labor market, and provide not just high-tech labor, but a robust pool of workers able to contribute to all segments of the economy. 
   In short, the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act is an important step for restoring a fundamental sense of fairness in our treatment of America's immigrant population. Even in the midst of the Senate's busy end-of-session schedule, this is a bill that should be passed into law. It is a matter of common sense, and of good public policy but most of all, it is a matter of simple fairness. 
   But--and this must be said--the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act has had an extraordinarily difficult time seeing the light of day. My good colleagues, Senators KENNEDY and REID and I tried to bring this bill forward for consideration in July, before the Senate left for its August recess. We were unsuccessful. We are trying again now, in the limited time left for this Congressional session, and again, we have been unsuccessful. And I must ask, for the sake of preserving families, shouldn't this bill be voted on? For the sake of our national economy--beset as it is by a shortage of essential workers--shouldn't this bill be voted on? For the sake of the economies of those Latin American countries that receive considerable sums from immigrants to the U.S. who are able to legally live and work here, shouldn't this bill be voted on? For the sake of our national sense of fairness, of justice, of our very notion of right and wrong, shouldn't this bill be voted on? 
   The Latino Immigration and Fairness Act has unusually broad support. President Clinton and Vice President Gore both actively support the provisions in this bill. So does Jack Kemp. Empower America supports this bill as pro-family and pro-market. AFL-CIO supports it as pro-labor. Many faith-based organizations have lent their support as well, recognizing the simple fairness that is at the heart of this legislation. In light of this broad spectrum of bipartisan support for the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act, it seems the only proper course of action is to bring this bill forward in the Senate for full consideration. Again, I have to close by asking this esteemed body: Shouldn't this bill be voted on? 
   Mr. President, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it has been more than a year since the Columbine tragedy, but still this Republican Congress refuses to act on sensible gun legislation. 
   Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. Until we act, Democrats in the Senate will read the names of some of those who have lost their lives to gun violence in the past year, and we will continue to do so every day that the Senate is in session. 
   In the name of those who died, we will continue this fight. Following are the names of some of the people who were killed by gunfire one year ago today. 
   September 20, 1999: 
   Donetta L. Adams, 26, Bloomington, IN; Barbara F. Allen, 65, Bloomington, IN; Eugene S. Bassett, Jr., 35, Davenport, IA; Antonio Butler, 19, Miami, FL; William Cook, 38, Detroit, MI; Rosa Gomez, 41, Miami, FL; Travis L. Harris, 27, Chicago, IL; James Hoard, 31, Bloomington, IN; Katherine Kruppa, 39, Houston, TX; Teal Lane, 19, Baltimore, MD; Mark Pitts, 22, Detroit, MI. 
   One of the victims of gun violence I mentioned was 65-year-old Barbara Allen of Bloomington, Indiana. Barbara's boyfriend shot and killed both her and her pregnant daughter, 26-year-old Donetta Adams, before turning the gun on himself. 
   Another victim of gun violence, 41-year-old Rosa Gomez of Miami, was shot and killed by her ex-boyfriend after having been harassed and threatened by him on several occasions. 
   We cannot sit back and allow such senseless gun violence to continue. The deaths of these people are a reminder to all of us that we need to enact sensible gun legislation now.

   Mr. DURBIN. Thank you very much. 
   Mr. President, I rise today in support of Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China. Today the United States Senate will vote to grant PNTR to China and its 1.2 billion people. We will decide whether or not to allow American farmers, manufacturers, businessmen and women to trade their products, their ideas, their goods with one-fifth of the world's population. 
   Last November, after more than a decade of negotiations, the Clinton Administration signed a bilateral agreement that will drastically reduce barriers on American products and services going to China. The agreement is clearly in the best interests of our nation's farmers, manufacturers, and workers. Supporting China's entry into the WTO is clearly in the best interests of our economy, national security and foreign policy. 
   Trade is the future. Make no mistake about it: trade can open up the exchange of ideas--ideas like democracy, freedom of speech, freedom to worship, and freedom of association. China stands on the brink of becoming the most important trading partner the U.S. has ever seen and the U.S. Senate will go on record in support of this important step in international trade and foreign policy. 
   When China concludes similar agreements with other countries, it will join the WTO. For us to benefit though, we must grant China PNTR status--the same status we have given other countries in the WTO. And, Mr. President, that's what this debate is about. Do we give China the same status as the other countries already in the WTO? Do we put them in an environment where  they will have to follow the rules and be held accountable if they break them? 
   Many of my colleagues have come to the floor of the United States Senate over the last several weeks to offer amendments to this legislation. They've all been defeated, with my help, despite the fact that I agree with the intention of almost everyone of them. I voted against every amendment offered because I know and the American people watching this debate know that amending H.R. 4444, at this point in the process is a death knell. 
   We defeated goodfaith amendments like Senator THOMPSON's non-proliferation amendment, Senator WELLSTONE's religious freedom and right to organize amendments, and Senator HELMS' amendment regarding forced abortions. I agree with the intent of my colleagues. China should not engage in the proliferation of nuclear technology. China should not prevent workers from organizing. China should not force women to adhere to any type of ``one family, one child'' policy. 
   But, the bill we're debating is a trade bill. And if it's changed in any way, shape, or form, it will go back to the House of Representatives and die. 
   My friend in the House of Representatives, Rep. Sander Levin, successfully added language to the House-passed legislation that, I believe, holds China accountable. The Levin/Bereuter language establishes a formal Congressional-Executive Commission on China to institutionalize mechanisms for maintaining pressure on China to improve its human rights record, increase compliance with basic labor standards, and abide by current and future commitments. This commission would review and report on China's progress in these areas and make recommendations to the Administration and Congress. My friends who offered amendments regarding human rights on the floor of the Senate will be able in the future to review China's record in this important area. 
   The Levin proposal would also push for more transparency at the WTO, including urging prompt public release of all litigation-related documents and the opening of secret meetings of the dispute settlement panels. The United States pays dues to the WTO and we have a right to know what goes on in those meetings. I've heard over and over again about the secrecy of the WTO. It's time for the WTO to shed some light on what really happens in these meetings that affect real American workers, so that workers will be able to see that we can rely on their rules-based trading system for relief when and if it's needed. 
   The Levin-Bereuter proposal empowers the Congress by seeking special 
   congressional review of U.S. participation in the WTO two years after China's accession, to assess China's implementation of WTO commitments. We'll have the power to see just how well China is abiding by its commitments. 
   And finally, the legislation expresses congressional support for Taiwan's accession to the WTO immediately after China's accession. While the Chinese aren't happy about this provision, I believe that it's important to allow Taiwan the same trading rights as mainland China. 
   America began as an agrarian nation, then transformed itself into an industrial power, and now over 200 years later, we're the leading economy in the world due, in part, to our ability to recognize that competition can force a country or a company to excel or fail. America has never feared competition. 
   And it's a reality that global competition is here and it's here to stay. Opponents argue that we must stop globalization, that we must punish the Chinese for all their human rights abuses, for prison labor abuses, for Tiananmen Square. Every year, we vote on whether or not to grant NTR status to China. Throughout my time in the House and Senate, I've voted both for and against NTR. Every year, we take a look at how China treats its citizens, wondering whether or not our annual review of their trade status would change their behavior. 
   Many say that the Congress shouldn't give up that right to annual review--that if we annually examine how the Chinese treat their people, and based upon that, deny or give them preferred trading status, somehow they will clean up their act and guarantee every Chinese citizen basic human rights. It's time we changed our approach. It's time to bring democracy to China via the Internet, via U.S./Chinese commerce relationships, via other U.S. products. It's time to bring social progress to China, not with messages from Congress but messages from across America, from businesses, labor traders, educators with new access to a society too often closed to diverse opinion. 
   President Clinton noted recently that ``In the new century, liberty will spread by cell phone and cable modem.'' Take a look at America with access to the Internet and now think back to the days when access to world knowledge was only through the printed media. America is a different nation because of this progress and China has the potential to change too. 
   Think for a moment about what would happen if we denied PNTR to China. I believe that if we sent that signal to the Chinese people, the walls of isolation would be strengthened. The hardline Communists would be emboldened more so than before. If we vote against PNTR, Beijing won't free a single prisoner. They will turn inward and the limited freedoms the Chinese people currently enjoy could well disappear. 
   And this argument ignores our experience with the Soviet Union during the height of the Cold War. We spent trillions of dollars to oppose a regime that was rife with human rights abuses, yet we still sold them, in the words of the late Hubert Humphrey, ``just about anything they could not shoot at us.'' 
   China will enter the WTO, with or without our support. The questions is: will America benefit from it or will the Chinese buy products and services from the Europeans or the Canadians or the Mexicans? To me, it's a clear choice: Americans will benefit from free and fair trade with China. And China will change for the better as it opens its doors to the world. 
   What about Illinoisans? How will farmers from Peoria and Cairo benefit from this action? How will major Illinois-based U.S. corporations like Motorola and Caterpillar and Bank of America and the thousands of Americans they employ benefit from this agreement? 
   The average tariff for agriculture products will be 17.5 percent and, for U.S. priority products, 14 percent, down from 31 percent. Farmers in downstate Illinois, will benefit from this; there's no doubt about it. At present, China severely restricts trading rights and the ability to own and operate distribution networks. For the first time, Illinois exporters will have the right to distribute products without going through a State Owned Enterprise. 
   Illinois is already a significant exporter of farm and industrial goods. In 1999, Illinois exported $9.3 billion worth of industrial/agriculture machinery. We shipped just over $6 billion in electric equipment as well. Illinois farmers exported roughly $3 billion in commodities to other countries. Illinois exports in 1999 totaled over $33 billion. Of that, $850 million was sold to China. 
   Companies like Motorola (with over 25,000 employees in Illinois) which pays tariffs of 20 percent on pagers and 12 percent for phones, will see those tariffs slashed. The Illinois soybean farmer will see the tariff-rate quotas completely eliminated. 
   Banks will be able to conduct business in China within the first two years of accession. They will have the same rights as Chinese banks. Geographic and customer restrictions will be lifted in five years, thereby allowing them to open a branch anywhere in China, just like they can here. U.S. automakers, like the Chrysler plant in Belvedere, Illinois, will see tariffs on their products slashed from 100 percent to 25 percent. 
   Pike County, Illinois pork producers will be able, for the first time, to export pork to China. Under the current scheme, China's import barriers have effectively denied access to American pork products. We're talking tariffs in the range of 20 percent that will drop to 12 percent by 2004. 
   What about Illinois steelworkers, still reeling from the 1998 steel crisis? China will reduce its tariffs on steel and steel products from the current average of 10.3 percent to 6 percent. They've agreed that any entity, like Acme Steel with facilities in Riverdale and Chicago or Northwestern Wire and  Rod in Sterling, will be able to export into any part of China, phased in over 3 years. 
   Peoria-based Caterpillar, with almost 30,000 Illinois employees, has recently invested in several new facilities in China. They've also recently announced the sale of 18 new trucks to the Shanghai Coal Company, trucks that will be made in Decatur, Illinois, and shipped halfway around the world. This is the type of investment by Caterpillar that maintains local jobs throughout towns and cities across Illinois. 
   Of course, many of these are big corporations. What about small businesses? How will they benefit from this agreement? 
   In 1997, 82 percent of all U.S. exporters were small businesses, generating over 35 percent of total merchandise exported to the East. Paperwork burdens for America's small businesses will be reduced drastically as customs and licensing procedures will be simplified. America's small businesses don't export jobs to China. They export ideas and products to a people who need and want their products and services. 
   No one expects this trade agreement and our future relationship with China to be easy. Already, Beijing officials have begun backtracking on several of their commitments made last November. I understand that at the most recent session of the WTO Working Party on China's accession, China objected to having its implementation of trade obligations reviewed every other year. A Chinese proposal dated July 14th strikes language in the protocol referring to bi-annual reviews and replaces it with language providing for reviews every four years. Their rationale is that they're a ``developing'' country. 
   This is absolutely unacceptable. The fact is, China is not a typically developing country and it shouldn't be allowed to cloak itself in that status. It's a uniquely large country and economy, where the essential elements of a market economy are taking root. Four years is far too long a time between reviews of China's implementation. If this proposal were adopted, it would make WTO dispute settlement the only formal channel by which we could ensure China's fulfillment of its trade obligations. Just one example: if China automatically received developing country status, it would receive special treatment like allowable export subsidies that wouldn't be treated as subsidies. If the Chinese flooded the U.S. market with steel (as is the case now), the U.S. steel industry wouldn't be able to use U.S. countervailing duty trade laws because that law doesn't apply to subsidization for developing countries. 
   There are other areas where the Chinese would like to backpedal. But, Mr. President, we must hold them to the November agreement and discourage future backtracking of that agreement by Chinese trade officials. Any unwillingness by the Chinese to abide by this agreement at this point should be roundly condemned by this Administration and other foreign nations, who just might find the Chinese backtracking with them as well. 
   Trade with foreign countries means nothing if it's not carried out under a rules-based system. Trade commitments require full enforcement to have meaning. With China's WTO membership, we will gain a number of advantages in enforcement we do not currently enjoy. 
   First, there is the WTO dispute mechanism itself. Remember that China has never agreed to subject its decisions to impartial review, judgment, and possible sanctions if necessary. That will now happen. 
   Second, we will continue to have the right to use the full range of American trade laws, including Section 301 and our Anti-dumping/Countervailing Duty laws. It's important, though, to have an administration that will use these trade laws effectively. It's my hope that the next President will not hesitate to bring cases against China and other countries if they break our trade laws. 
   And finally, we strengthen our enforcement capabilities through the multilateral nature of the WTO. In effect, China will be subject to enforcement by all 135 WTO member nations, thus limiting their ability to play its trading partners against one another. The U.S. won't be alone if China breaks the rules. 
   Opponents of PNTR argue that it's NAFTA all over again. You'll remember Ross Perot's soundbite: ``That great sucking sound.'' You'll remember that some said the American economy would go down the tubes, that hundreds of thousands of American workers would lose their jobs to cheap labor in Mexico if NAFTA were enacted. 
   Here's Illinois' story. Gross jobs added in export industries from 1993-1998 totaled over 60,000. Net jobs totaled almost 40,000. There was no great sucking sound. US unemployment is still low. There are more people employed in Illinois right now than at any time in its history. The Illinois Department of Commerce estimates that nearly half a million jobs are supported by exports and that there's been a 51.6 percent increase in Illinois jobs sustained by exports since enactment of NAFTA. 
   Yes, some folks have lost their jobs due to trade. The Department of Labor certified 50 Trade Adjustment Assistance cases in Illinois from 1994-1999, totaling 5,718 jobs lost. Frankly, losing 5,718 jobs is still too many. When workers lose their jobs, we should do more than just provide TAA. We should find ways to train our workers in emerging fields and industries so they get new jobs that are at least as good as the ones they lost. That's the responsibility of the American business community, educators, and federal, state, and local governments. This is the best opportunity we've had in years to export American ideals and products. We should also ensure we don't export American jobs. 
   Worker re-training is one of the most important debates that this Congress should focus on. Today, we voted on a cloture motion on H1B visas. I have almost 6,000 Illinoisans who've lost their jobs due to trade, yet we have to import workers from foreign countries because we have industries begging for skilled workers to show up for that 9-5 job. Yet, our way of solving the skills shortage in the U.S. seems to be through the importation of highly-skilled foreign workers--a Band-Aid approach that doesn't solve the underlying problem. America, as a nation that gains from trade, has an obligation to use a portion of those gains to support and re-train those who've been ill-affected. We must do more to help American workers train for and get jobs that will move them up the economic ladder. 
   In 1998, we passed the Workforce Investment Act. One important component of the WIA is the funding stream for dislocated workers. Grants to states and local communities provide core, intensive training and support services to laid off workers. Under President Clinton, dislocated worker funding has tripled from 
   $517 million in 1993 to $1.589 billion for FY2000. This is an important program, like Trade Adjustment Assistance, that helps American families deal with an economy that's transforming itself as ours is today. 
   But is it enough? Is it enough to train workers after they lose their jobs or do we need to start before it's too late? With public/private partnerships, we can train America's workforce for the jobs of the 21st Century, the hi-tech jobs, the nursing jobs, the educator jobs. It's our responsibility to encourage companies like Caterpillar and Motorola and Cargill and others to let local, state, and federal officials know what types of workers they must have to meet their needs for the future. We should encourage more Americans to pursue higher education and skills training. I'm working for measures like college tuition tax incentives that would provide tax deductions or credits for America's working families to give their children the opportunity to prepare for the jobs of this new economy. We also need assistance to help workers with skills training and lifelong learning. 
   Some would argue as Lenin did that a capitalist will sell you the rope you will use to hang him, but I think such trade serves a greater purpose than profit. Information technology, now a key element in the future of business, also is a key element in undermining government control of thought and appetite. If you can flood a nation with modems people use to learn and trade, no government can bridle the expansion of thought and diversity that will follow. 
   Chinese leaders, recognizing the transformative nature of the free flow  of ideas, have tried recently to clamp down on Internet usage by its citizens. This will never work as the authorities in Beijing will learn. China must either give up its desire to build a modern, high-tech economy or allow the free exchange of information that a modern economy requires. I accept the American premise that if you give people a little freedom and enough information, the desire for freedom, democracy and the chance to work hard and succeed will prevail. 
   You can station Chinese tanks on Tiananmen Square on a full-time basis, but if you let the open exchange of ideas and business transactions flow through those glowing modems, China will change for the better. 
   Let's grant PNTR to China and begin a new chapter in the book of U.S.-China relations. Bringing down trade barriers; Opening up new markets; Giving American workers a chance to compete; And giving America's customers a chance to enjoy the best our country can produce: It's a formula for success. It's a challenge America has never shirked. 
   Our workers, our farmers and businesses are counting on us to trust their ability to rise to the challenge in this new century. We cannot fail them. 
   Mr. President, I listened carefully to the debate and statement made by my colleague, Senator WELLSTONE, as well as Senator HOLLINGS of South Carolina. These two Senators and many others have spoken from the heart during the course of this debate. The Senate of the United States and the Nation are well served by the element they bring to this debate, their deep-felt convictions, feelings, and values that have been exhibited not only in their floor statements but in the amendments they have offered over the last several weeks. 
   Though I may disagree in my conclusion on this treaty, I can tell you I have the greatest respect and admiration for their leadership and for standing up on these issues of human rights. 
   I would like to put this in perspective. If we believe the vote we take this afternoon will give China some new benefit, then one could argue that we should ask for something in return. One could argue that if we are going to give China something, we should ask them to make changes in China in their human rights policy, which is reprehensible--the way they treat the press, the way they treat religions in that country, their forced family planning policies, the coercive attitude they have towards families and their future in China, the terrible things which we have heard about, proliferation--all of these should be on the table and part of the agenda as we negotiate, if the agreement we are voting on is, in fact, a benefit given to China. But let me suggest to you it is not. We are receiving the benefit from this agreement. Let me explain. 
   The World Trade Organization is a group of over 130 nations which have come together and said we are going to do away with the old school of thinking where every country would put up tariffs and barriers to trade with other countries. We are going to try a new approach. We are going to try to drop those tariffs and barriers and see what free trade will do. Let each country make a product and a service the best and sell it around the world. That is what the World Trade Organization is about. Over 130 nations have agreed that those are the rules by which we will play. 
   Today in the Senate this will be a historic vote to decide whether or not we bring China into the World Trade Organization and compete with U.S. trade policy--in other words, the relationship between the United States and China. China, in order to be part of this World Trade Organization, has said they will agree to drop our tariffs and barriers substantially so that American companies and farmers and others can export to China. In other words, this is a win-win situation for America's economy. It is China that is making all the decisions to drop the tariffs and drop the barriers and give us a chance to compete--give us a chance to sell to 1.2 billion people; give us a chance to sell to one-fifth of the world's population. We win; they drop the barriers; America gets a chance to sell overseas. That is what is at stake here. 
   If this benefit comes to the U.S. economy to be able to finally get into this market and compete, then it is kind of hard to argue that we ought to be holding off and conditioning this benefit on all sorts of changes in China. 
   I have seen the amendments that have been offered by many of my colleagues on the floor over the last several weeks. Many of these are good faith amendments. Many of these I agree with totally in principle. I voted against every single one of them. How can that be? Because, frankly, they don't belong on this 
   bill. This is a trade bill. Let us address the issues of human rights, workers, environmental concerns, and proliferation by China through a variety of other approaches. But to use this trade bill is a mistake. 
   This trade bill gives us a chance to say to workers across America that we are going to give them a new market; we are going to give them a new chance. If my colleagues believe as I do that globalization and global competition really are the future of this country, we in America need markets in which to sell. That is what this is about. 
   I have a lot of confidence that American workers and businesses and farmers, given a chance to compete by fair rules, can succeed. If you believe that, you have to vote for this bill; you have to open this market. You have to give us a chance to sell in what is one of the largest markets in the world. That is what it comes down to. 
   There is also a provision that was added to the House bill which I support completely. It is known as the Levin/Bereuter amendment. It is a bipartisan amendment by SANDY LEVIN, a Democrat of Michigan, and DOUG BEREUTER, Republican of Nebraska. They come together and say China has to play by the rules. And we will watch them carefully with an executive commission to make sure they are not only playing by the trade rules but treating their people fairly. 
   I think that is the right way to proceed. I think it covers many of the issues raised during the course of this debate. But, frankly, we cannot hold up the expansion of trade opportunities waiting for China to become a democratic nation. In fact, I think expanding trade in exchange will lead China into democracy, into freedom, closer to what we value as principles in this country. Why do I believe that? I saw Tiananmen Square on television. I saw these tanks that were mowing down common citizens standing up for freedom. It was reprehensible. It was disgusting. But we saw it on television. There was a time not that long ago we would have never seen it. We would have heard about it months later. The world is opening up. We are seeing things in real time from around the world, in China and other nations, and as a result the court of world judgment says it is wrong and you have to change it, and the pressure starts building. 
   Think about expanded economic exchange with China, expanded trade, more foreign visitors, American businesses, American farmers, and educators going into China, becoming part of their economy. Think about this information technology as the Internet opens up China to new thinking and ideas around the world. 
   Do you know what we believe in this country? We believe if people are given the opportunity to hear diverse opinions, if they are given the opportunity to see what the rest of the world looks like, they will move closer to our model, closer to democracy, closer to freedom, closer to open markets. I believe that, too. I do not believe the Chinese leadership, even their hidebound old thinking, can turn that tide. This bill opens those markets, opens this exchange of ideas and goods, and gives us a chance to not only provide for workers and farmers and businesses in America the chance to succeed in a new market but a chance to change China for the better. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr President, I rise today to introduce legislation that expands treatment to millions of Americans suffering from a deadly addiction: tobacco. I am pleased to have Senator BROWNBACK join me in this effort. The Medicare, Medicaid and MCH Smoking Cessation Promotion Act of 2000 will help make smoking cessation therapy accessible to recipients of Medicare, Medicaid, and the Maternal and Child Health Program. 
   We have long known that cigarette smoking is the largest preventable cause of death, accounting for 20 percent of all deaths in this country. It is well documented that smoking causes virtually all cases of lung cancer and a substantial portion of coronary heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, chronic obstructive lung disease, and cancers of other sites. And the harmful effects of smoking do not end with the smoker. Women who use tobacco during pregnancy are more likely to have adverse birth outcomes, including babies with low birth weight, which is linked with an increased risk of infant death and a variety of infant health disorders. 
   Still, despite enormous health risks, 48 million adults in the United States smoke cigarettes--approximately 22.7 percent of American adults. The rates are higher for our youth--36.4 percent report daily smoking. In Illinois, the adult smoking rate is about 24.2 percent. And perhaps most distressing and surprising, data indicate that about 13 percent of mothers in the United States smoke during pregnancy. 
   We have also learned the hard way that in addition to the heavy health toll of tobacco, the economic costs of smoking are also high. The total cost of smoking in 1993 in the U.S. was about $102 billion, with over $50 billion in health care expenditures directly linked to smoking. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that approximately 43 percent of these costs were paid by government funds, primarily Medicaid and Medicare. Smoking costs Medicaid alone more than $12.9 billion per year. According to the Chicago chapter of the American Lung Association, my state of Illinois spends $2.9 billion each year in public and private funds to combat smoking-related diseases. 
   Today, however, we also know how to help smokers quit. Advancements in treating tobacco use and nicotine addiction have helped millions kick the habit. While more than 40 million adults continue to smoke, nearly as many persons are former smokers living longer, healthier lives. In large part, this is because new tools are available. Effective pharmacotherapy and counseling regimens have been tested and proven effective. The just-released Surgeon General's Report, Reducing Tobacco Use, concluded that ``pharmacologic treatment of nicotine addiction, combined with behavioral support, will enable 10 to 25 percent of users to remain abstinent at one year of posttreatment.'' 
   Studies have shown that reducing adult smoking through tobacco use treatment pays immediate dividends, both in terms of health improvements and cost savings. Creating a new nonsmoker reduces anticipated medical costs associated with acute myocardial infarction and stroke by $47 in the first year and by $853 during the next seven years in 1995 dollars. And within four to five years after tobacco cessation, quitters use fewer health care services than continued smokers. In fact, in one study the cost savings from reduced use paid for a moderately priced effective smoking cessation intervention in a matter of three to four years. 
   The health benefits tobacco quitters enjoy are undisputed. They are living longer. After 15 years, the risk of premature death for ex-smokers returns to nearly the level of persons who have never smoked. Male smokers who quit between age 35 and 39 add an average of five years to their lives; women can add three years. Even older Americans over age 65 can extend their life expectancy by giving up cigarettes. 
   Former smokers are also healthier. They are less likely to die of chronic lung diseases. After ten smoke-free  years, their risk of lung cancer drops to as much as one-half that of those who continue to smoke. After five to fifteen years the risk of stroke and heart disease for ex-smokers returns to the level of those who have never smoked. They have fewer days of illness, reduced rates of bronchitis and pneumonia, and fewer health complaints. 
   New Public Health Service Guidelines released this summer conclude that tobacco dependence treatments are both clinically effective and cost-effective relative to other medical and disease prevention interventions. The guideline urges health care insurers and purchasers to include the counseling and FDA-approved pharmacotherapeutic treatments as a covered benefit. 
   Unfortunately, the Federal Government, a major purchaser of health care through Medicare and Medicaid, does not currently adhere to its own published guidelines. It is high-time that government-sponsored health programs catch up with science. As a result, I am introducing, along with my colleague Senator BROWNBACK, legislation to improve smoking cessation benefits in government-sponsored health programs. 
   The Medicare, Medicaid and MCH Smoking Cessation Promotion Act of 2000 improves access to and coverage of smoking cessation treatment therapies in four primary ways. 
   Our bill adds a smoking cessation counseling benefit to Medicare. By 2020, 17 percent of the U.S. population will be 65 years of age or older. It is estimated that Medicare will pay $800 billion to treat tobacco-related diseases over the next twenty years. In a study of adults 65 years of age or older who received advice to quit, behavioral counseling and pharmocotherapy, 24.8 percent reported having stopped smoking six months following the intervention. The total economic benefits of quitting after age 65 are notable. Due to a reduction in the risk of lung cancer, coronary heart disease and emphysema, studies have found that heavy smokers over age 65 who quit can avoid up to $4,592 in lifelong illness-related costs. 
   Our measure provides coverage for both prescription and non-prescription smoking cessation drugs in the Medicaid program. The bill eliminates the provision in current Federal law 
   that allows states to exclude FDA-approved smoking cessation therapies from coverage under Medicaid. Ironically, State Medicaid programs are required to cover Viagra, but not to treat tobacco addiction. Despite the fact that the States are now receiving the full benefit of their federal lawsuit against the tobacco industry, less than half the States provide coverage for smoking cessation in their Medicaid program. On average, states spend approximately 14.4 percent of their Medicaid budgets on medical care related to smoking. 
   Our legislation clarifies that the maternity benefit for pregnant women in Medicaid covers smoking cessation counseling and services. Smoking during pregnancy causes about 5-6 percent of perinatal deaths, 17-26 percent of low-birth-weight births, and 7-10 percent of preterm deliveries, and increases the risk of miscarriage and fetal growth retardation. It may also increase the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). The Surgeon General recommends that pregnant women and parents with children living at home be counseled on the potentially harmful effects of smoking on fetal and child health. A new study shows that, over seven years, reducing smoking prevalence by just one percentage point would prevent 57,200 low birth weight births and save $572 million in direct medical costs. 
   Our bill ensures that the Maternal and Child Health (MCH) Program recognizes that medications used to promote smoking cessation and the inclusion of anti-tobacco messages in health promotion are considered part of quality maternal and child health services. In addition to the well-documented benefits of smoking cessation for maternity care, the Surgeon General's report adds, ``Tobacco use is a pediatric concern. In the United States, more than 6,000 children and adolescents try their first cigarette each day. More than 3,000 children and adolescents become daily smokers each day, resulting in approximately 1.23 million new smokers under the age of 18 each year.'' The goal of the MCH program is to improve the health of all mothers and children. This goal cannot be reached without addressing the tobacco epidemic. 
   I hope my colleagues will join me not only in cosponsoring this legislation but also in working with me to see that its provisions are adopted before the year is out. As the Surgeon General states in his report: ``Although our knowledge about tobacco control remains imperfect, we know more than enough to act now.''

   Mr. DURBIN. If I understand correctly, we have 20 minutes equally divided on this amendment. I will try to be brief. 
   I had a conversation with Senator BOND. We are perilously close to being in an agreement. I don't know if we will reach that point; perhaps we will. Let me suggest to him and to those who are following the course of this debate, I think the debate last night between Senator DASCHLE and Senator BOND was a good one because it laid out, I think, very clearly, both sides of this issue. 
   I come to this debate trying to find some common ground, if there is, and I don't know how much common ground one can find on a river. In this situation, we are dealing with the question of the future of the Missouri River. It is not a parochial interest; it is an interest which affects the Mississippi River and many who have States bordering the Mississippi River, and agricultural and commercial interests that are involved in the future of that river. 
   I listened to the debate yesterday and tried to follow it. I came to the conclusion that the Senator from Missouri was arguing that he, with his section 103, did not want to see the so-called spring rise occur next year, in the year 2001, and that was the purpose of his amendment. 
   It is my understanding that if we did nothing, the spring rise would not occur anyway because there is no intention to change the manual for the river that would result in that as of next year. 
   The purpose of my amendment is to say that there would be no final revisions to the manual that would take place in the upcoming fiscal year, October 1, 2000, to October 1, 2001, but we would allow all of the agencies that are currently studying the future of the river and amending the 1960 manual the opportunity to consider all of the options, to have public comment, to invite in the experts. 
   I went through the debate, read through the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. My colleague from Missouri, yesterday, I think, said something along these lines because he said:  
   Contrary to what you just heard, [referring to Senator DASCHLE's debate] any other aspect of the process to review and amend the operation of the Missouri River, to change the Missouri River manual, to consider opinions, to discuss, to debate, to continue the vitally important research that is going on now in the river and how it can improve its habitat will continue.  
   The purpose of my amendment is to say let us protect that. Let us protect that study and that option. No final revision can be made to the manual that would effect the change that I think is a concern of the Senator from Missouri and others during the course of the next fiscal year. So we are preserving the right and opportunity to study the future of the river, but we are saying you cannot make a change in the manual that will change the policies on the river during that period of time. 
   I think that will give us an opportunity for better information and a full opportunity for public comment. We will learn more in the process from the experts and the experts include not only the environmentalists, who are very important to this discussion, but also many, many others, including those in the agricultural community and in the navigation community. All of them should have an opportunity to be part of this debate about what the manual change will be. That is what I am trying to preserve with this amendment, to try to find, if you will, a middle ground between 103 and where Senator DASCHLE was yesterday. 
   Let me also say that under my amendment the spring rise or low summer flows proposal would not be implemented next year. We have discussed this with the Fish and Wildlife, as well as the Corps of Engineers. It is our understanding that if you prohibit a final revision in the manual that you are not going to be able to change the manual as of next year, and there is no proposal on the table that would suggest anything is going to occur before the year 2003. 
   I will concede to my friend from Missouri the letter from the Fish and Wildlife Service, and one particular sentence or two in it, leaves some question. But our followup contact with the Corps of Engineers suggests they are not going to authorize a spring flow next year. 
   I don't know if what I am suggesting by way of an amendment will win the support of the administration. I don't know the answer to that. What I am offering is a good faith attempt to continue the study, continue the survey,  and not make any changes in the policy as of the next fiscal year; but to then be prepared to look at the results, consider the public comments, and try to come up with a policy that is sound. 
   The Senator from Missouri and the Senator from Illinois both represent agricultural interests. We are constantly being asked to try to balance this, the commercial needs and environmental needs. Certainly the same thing applies to this 
   debate on the history. We are trying to balance the commercial needs for navigation and the needs for environment. I think we can do it. 
   I think if we are open and honest and have the public comment, which the Senator from Missouri has invited, that it will occur. I will listen carefully. As the Senator from Missouri said last night during the course of the debate: Let the debates go on. We would like to see sound science. We would like to see the best information available. Fish and Wildlife has not shown it to us. I concede during the next year allowing that information to come forward. 
   Given the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service currently supports the spring rise and low summer flows profile, taking it off the table for discussion is a recipe for stalemate. Let us at least have the discussion about the spring flow. I think section 103 precludes even that discussion. Let us not change the policy as to the spring flow in the next year, but let us debate it. Let's try to find what the best outcome would be for the future of the river and those who depend on it. 
   Proposed revisions to the manual would continue to be developed under my amendment. Studies would continue. Talks about alternatives to river management among all the river's stakeholders could continue. 
   In addition, we want to get the best science we can from the National Academy of Sciences, which is in the process of completing an important study on the future of the Missouri. We should not make any decisions about the future of the river until that study is released, and I think my amendment protects that possibility and gives you the opportunity during this next year to listen to the National Academy of Sciences and to try to resolve that as well as to invite public input. 
   The Corps is working on a lot of alternatives to managing the Missouri River. I think it is fair for us to keep these proposals, developed by farm and navigation interests and proposals developed by recreation and environmental interests, all on the table and all open to debate. 
   This is important to my colleague from Missouri. It is really important in Illinois as well. The Missouri River feeds into the Mississippi, and we have some 550 miles of Illinois border on that river. A lot of people depend on it. I want to make certain we do the right thing for our farmers but also for this important piece of America's natural heritage, the Missouri River and Mississippi River. 
   I am not here to argue about the management of the Missouri River. I am not competent to do it. But I think we have to bring the information together and make the most sound judgment we can about the future of the river, and it is that particular approach I have offered in this amendment. I hope the Senator from Missouri will consider it as a friendly amendment, a positive and constructive alternative in the debate between him and the Senator from South Dakota. I yield the remainder of my time.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to thank the Senator from Missouri, Mr. BOND, as well as Senator REID and representatives from Senator DASCHLE's staff. 
   We just had a floor conversation about section 103, which has been the subject of great debate over the last several days. We are, as I said, close to at least common ground on the floor, but I do not believe we are at a point where we can put language in the bill to solve the problem between the administration and the committee. It is my heartfelt intention to work with Senator BOND, Senator DOMENICI, and Senator REID to try to do that. 
   This is an important bill. We don't want to go through and veto, have a return of the bill, if we can work it out. I hope we can. But I don't believe my amendment, in and of itself, is going to solve that problem this evening. Instead, I would like to, at the end of my remarks, ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment, and pledge between now and the conference and thereafter to work with all of the principals involved to see if we can work out the important question about the future of the Missouri River and the debate that took place both yesterday and today.

   Mr. DURBIN. The Senate and House will be returning to business this week in Washington, DC. The important question is, What did we learn in August? 
   As we went home to our States and spoke to families across Illinois and other States represented in this body, the question was whether the Members of the U.S. Senate will return with the resolve to do something. 
   You see, for the last several years, the Senate has done virtually nothing when it comes to the important issues facing working families across America. The families I met in Illinois during the month of August were, I guess, almost unanimous in their belief that this Congress should waste no time in enacting a meaningful prescription drug benefit under Medicare. I no longer have to give the speech about Medicare and prescription drugs. The audience gives it to me. They say: Senator, did you know if you cross the border and go into Canada, you can buy the same drugs at half the price? I say: Yes, I was about to tell you that. They say: Did you know people are paying more if they are elderly or disabled than 
   virtually any other group in America? I say: Yes, I was about to tell you that, too. 
   The audience gives you the speech before you can deliver it. Then they ask the most important question: If you know all this, why haven't you done anything? Why hasn't this Congress enacted a prescription drug benefit under Medicare? The truth is that the pharmaceutical companies have come to the Congress with their special interests and powerful lobbyists and they have stopped us cold. The Republican leadership in the House and the Senate has basically tried to keep the pharmaceutical companies happy and the insurance companies happy and have said they will trust the insurance companies to provide protection to American families. Well, I can't even say that with a straight face in Illinois because families there know that when you leave it up to insurance companies and it comes to medical care, you don't get the best decisions; you get decisions driven by the bottom line for the profit margin. 
   So those of us on the Democratic side want to give our friends on the Republican side one last chance before the election to vote for a meaningful prescription drug benefit under Medicare that is universal, which will apply to everybody, as Medicare applies to everybody. Instead, of course, the Republicans want to talk about an estate tax break for the wealthiest Americans--a tax cut of a trillion dollars; and, 40 percent of it or more will go to those making over $300,000 a year. After you have spent the trillion dollars on a tax cut for the wealthy, there is not much left to take care of prescription drug benefits under Medicare. There is very little, if any, money left to help families pay for college education. 
   I was at several universities across Illinois talking about a proposal on the Democratic side--one that Vice President GORE supports--to give a college tax credit or a deduction for families. That is what families talk about. 
   ``It is a lovely baby. He looks like his dad. He has been sleeping all night. How are we going to pay for his college?'' That is what you hear when you go to a nursery and look at a new infant. It is a legitimate concern. 
   We on the Democratic side of the aisle believe that if we are going to have any tax cuts, we should target them to the needs of American families--the need to pay for college education and for training. The deductibility of $12,000 a year in tuition and fees can have a dramatic impact on families. 
   The Republican leadership just doesn't buy it. They think if there is to be a tax cut, it has to go to the wealthiest people in America. I think it should go to the hardest working people in America--those who deserve it the most, not the least. Those are the families who get up and go to work every day to try to put their kids through school and who try to make this a better country. 
   That will be the debate you will hear over the next several weeks. If it sounds reminiscent of what you are hearing from the Presidential campaign trail, it is because there is a clear difference between the two major candidates for President. 
   There is a clear difference between the parties on the floor. 
   We on the Democratic side are going to plead with the Republicans to give us four or five votes so we can pass a prescription drug benefit under Medicare, and targeted tax cuts to pay for college education expenses so people can have a deduction--so when they have long-term care for an aging parent, they can take care of that parent or grandparent, and an additional tax credit for day care so people going to work can leave their kids in a safe environment. 
   These are the real family issues. The Republicans have not really listened closely. 
   I hope that Republicans, as they left the Philadelphia convention in August and watched what happened in the national debate at the Presidential level, understand that we really face a serious need in this country in helping families. It is not enough anymore to argue that the wealthy are getting wealthier. Working families want help, too, so their parents and grandparents can pay for prescription drugs and take care of the necessities of life. 
   I yield the remainder of my time.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it has been more than a year since the Columbine tragedy, but still this Republican Congress refuses to act on sensible gun legislation. 
   Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. Until we act, Democrats in the Senate will read some of the names of those who lost their lives to gun violence in the past year, and we will continue to do so every day that the Senate is in session. 
   In the name of those who died, we will continue this fight. Following are the names of some of the people who were killed by gunfire one year ago today. 
   September 5, 1999: 
   Andre P. Bacon, 21, Chicago, IL; 
   Agron Berisha, 18, Miami, FL; 
   Mark Douglas, 34, Fort Wayne, IN; 
   Princeton L. Douglas, 18, Chicago, IL; 
   Willie Lassiter, 20, Atlanta, GA; 
   Denkyira McElroy, 24, Chicago, IL; 
   Jerry Ojeda, 23, Houston, TX; 
   Rodney Prince, 18, Baltimore, MD; 
   Jarhonda Snow, 4, Miami, FL; 
   Unidentified Female, San Francisco, CA. 
   One of the gun violence victims I mentioned, 23-year-old Jerry Ojeda from Houston, was drinking with friends when they began taking turns shooting a 9-millimeter pistol into the air. After firing several shots, Jerry took the gun and turned it on himself. 
   We cannot sit back and allow such senseless gun violence to continue. The deaths of these people are a reminder to all of us that we need to enact sensible gun legislation now.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of a bill that will correct severe injustices affecting thousands of immigrants to the United States, while at the same time strengthening their ability to contribute to the U.S. economy and to the struggling economies of their countries of birth. 
   A short time ago on the floor of the Senate a unanimous consent request was made by Senators KENNEDY and HARRY REID of Nevada asking that this legislation, the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act, be brought to the floor for immediate consideration. It is very difficult to argue that we are so consumed with work in the Chamber of the Senate that we can't consider this legislation. In fact, we have done precious little over the last several days because of an honest disagreement between the leadership on the Democrat and Republican side. 
   I do believe this legislation should be brought on a timely basis for the consideration of the Senate. The bill in question is the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act. It has the support of an impressively broad coalition of groups and individuals, labor unions, business groups, human rights groups, religious organizations, conservative and progressive think tanks. Empower America supports this bill as pro-family and pro-market. The AFL-CIO supports it because it is pro-labor. 
   The administration is committed to its passage. Perhaps the most compelling reason for passing this bill is that it embraces the principles of fairness and justice that are of value to the American spirit and to the work we do in the Senate. 
   I recall, when we discuss the issue of immigration, one of my favorite stories involving President Franklin Roosevelt. President Roosevelt, of course, came from a somewhat aristocratic family in New York and was elected President in 1932. As the first Democratic President in many years, he was invited to speak to the Daughters of the American Revolution in Washington, DC. Of course, the DAR is an organization which prides itself on its Yankee heritage and the fact many have descended from those who came over on the Mayflower. They have a history of being somewhat skeptical of immigration policy in this country. When Franklin Roosevelt spoke to the DAR, his opening words set the tone. He introduced himself by saying: Fellow immigrants, a reminder to the DAR, a reminder to all of us, with the exception of Native Americans, who have been here for many centuries, we are all virtually immigrants to this country. 
   I am a first generation American. My mother immigrated to this country at the age of 2 from the country of Lithuania in 1911. My father's family dates back to before the Revolutionary War, so I really represent both ends of the spectrum of white immigration to America. This bill tries to address the basic principles of immigration fairness and justice which we have tried to hold to during the course of this Nation's history. I bring particular attention to the Senate to the plight of immigrants from Central America and Haiti who have been dealt a severe injustice during the past 20 years, one that would be directly addressed by this legislation. 
   In the recent past, thousands of people from Central America and Haiti have been forced to flee their homes in order to save their lives and the lives of their families. In Guatemala, hundreds of so-called ``extra-judicial'' killings occurred every year between 1990 and 1995; entire villages ``disappeared'', most probably massacred. In El Salvador, political violence was rampant--63,000 people were killed in the 1980's by a combination of leftist guerrillas, right-wing death squads, and government military actions. Ironically, an end to twelve years of civil war did not mean an end to violent internal strife; the death toll in 1994 was higher than it was during the war. In Honduras, the Department of State's Human Rights Reports cite ``serious problems'', including extrajudicial killings, beatings, and a civilian and military elite that have long operated with impunity. In September 1991, Haiti's democratically-elected government was overthrown in a violent military coup de'etat that, over a three year period, was responsible for thousands of extra-judicial killings. 
   Current law creates a highly unworkable patchwork approach to the status of these immigrants, one that assaults our sense of fair play. Immigrants from Nicaragua and Cuba who have lived here since 1995 can obtain green card status in the U.S. through a sensible, straightforward process. Guatemalans and Salvadorans are covered by a different, more stringent and cumbersome set of procedures. A select group of Haitian immigrants are classified under another restrictive status. Hondurans by yet another. As if this helter-skelter approach isn't bad enough, existing policies also treat family members of immigrants--spouses and children--differently depending on where they live, and under which provision of which law they are covered. 
   The United States is known around the world as the land of equal opportunity, but the opportunities we are affording to Central American and Haitian immigrants who have lived in this country for years are anything but equal. The current situation is untenable. Why should a family that has set down firm roots in the United States after fleeing death squads in Nicaragua be treated differently under the law  than another family from, say, El Salvador, who left that country for precisely the same reason. The point was made brutally clear when Amnesty International documented the case of Santana Chirino Amaya, deported back to El Salvador and subsequently found decapitated. This, and many similar stories, led to charges that the U.S. was engaged in a ``systematic practice'' of denying asylum to some nationals, regardless of the merits of their claims. A class-action lawsuit brought by the American Baptist Churches and other faith-based organizations on behalf of Salvadoran and Guatemalan immigrants made a similar case, and was eventually settled in favor of those seeking a fairer hearing. 
   Or consider the plight of Maria Orellana, a war refugee from El Salvador, who fled the country when soldiers killed two members of her family. She has lived the past ten years in the United States. Recently, the INS ordered her deported even though she is eight months pregnant and even though her husband--himself an immigrant--has legal status here and expects to soon be sworn in as a U.S. citizen. When a newspaper reporter asked the INS to comment on Maria's case, the reply was: ``I don't know why Congress wrote it differently for people of different countries. We're not in a position to change a law given to us by Congress ..... we just enforce the law as written.'' 
   Well, the law, in this case, was written badly, and needs to be fixed. The Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act would resolve these many inequities by providing a level playing field on which all immigrants from this region with similar histories would be treated equally under the law. And it would address two other issues of great importance to the immigrant community as well. 
   The provision to restore Section 245(i) would restore a long-standing and sensible policy that was unfortunately allowed to lapse in 1997. Section 245(i) of the Immigration Act had allowed individuals that qualified for a green card to obtain their visa in the U.S. if they were already in the country. Without this common-sense provision, immigrants on the verge of gaining their green card must return to their home country to obtain their visa. However, the very act of making such an onerous trip can put their green-card standing in jeopardy, since other provisions of immigration law prohibit re-entry to the U.S. under certain circumstances. This has led to ludicrous situations, like the forced separation of married couples because one spouse must leave the country to obtain a visa, uncertain as to when they can be reunited. Restoring the Section 245(i) mechanism to obtain visas here in the U.S. is a good policy that will help keep families together and keep willing workers in the U.S. labor force. 
   Let me add, in my office in Chicago, IL, two-thirds of the casework we do relates to immigration. We understand the plight of these families on a personal basis. We meet them in our office, we meet their friends and relatives, we meet members of their churches who ask why the laws on immigration in America have to be so unfair and contradictory. 
   That is why this bill is so important. 
   The Date of Registry provision is equally important. Undocumented immigrants seeking permanent residency must demonstrate that they have lived continuously in the U.S. since the date of registry cut-off. This amendment updates the date of registry from 1972--almost 30 years of continuous residency--1986. The Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act recognizes that many immigrants have been victimized by confusing and inconsistent INS policies in the past fifteen years--policies that have been overturned in numerous court decisions, but that have nonetheless prevented many immigrants from being granted permanent residency. Updating the date of registry to 1986 would bring long overdue justice to the affected populations. 
   It is worth reviewing the recent history of immigration policy to understand how we arrived at such a highly convoluted and piecemeal approach. Prior to the passage of the illegal Immigration Reform and Responsibility Act in 1996, aliens in the United States could apply for suspension of deportation and adjustment of status in order to obtain lawful permanent residence. Suspension of deportation was used to ameliorate the harsh consequences of deportation for aliens who had been present in the United States for long periods of time. 
   In September of 1996, Congress passed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Responsibility Act. This law retroactively made thousands of immigrants ineligible for suspension of deportation and left them with no alternate remedy. The 1996 Act eliminated suspension of deportation and established a new form of relief entitled cancellation of removal that required an applicant to accrue ten years of continuous residence as of date of the initial notice charging the applicant with being removable. 
   In 1997, Congress recognized that these new provisions had resulted in grave injustices to certain groups of people. So in November of 1997, the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act INACARA) granted relief to certain citizens of former Soviet block countries and several Central American countries. This select group of immigrants were allowed to apply for permanent residence under the old, pre-IIRRA standards. 
   Such an alteration of IIRRA made sense. After all, the U.S. had allowed Central Americans to reside and work here for over a decade, during which time many of them established families, careers and community ties. The complex history of civil wars and political persecution in parts of Central America left thousands of people in limbo without a place to call home. Many victims of severe persecution came to the United States with very strong asylum cases, but unfortunately these individuals have waited so long for a hearing they will have difficulty proving their cases because they involve incidents which occurred as early as 1980. In addition, many victims of persecution never filed for asylum out of fear of denial, and consequently these people now face claims weakened by years of delay. 
   Correcting the inequities in current immigration policies is not only a matter of fundamental fairness, it is good, pragmatic public policy. The funds sent back by immigrants to their home countries sources of foreign exchange, and significant stabilizing factors in several national economies. The immigrant workforce is important to our national economy as well. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has frequently cited the threat to our economic well-being posed by an increasingly tight labor pool, and has gone so far as to suggest that immigration be uncapped. While these provisions will not remove or adjust any such caps, it will allow those already here to move freely in the labor market. 
   I come to the floor disappointed because the effort for unanimous consent to bring up the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act was denied. This is an act which advances justice, keeps families together, and strengthens the national and international economy. It deserves unqualified support and rapid passage. 
   Not that many years ago, immigrants to this country faced an onslaught of criticism. There were propositions in the State of California, speeches made by politicians, charges made by groups that really caused a great deal of fear and concern among those who had immigrated to this country. It is a stark reminder that, as a nation of immigrants, we should continue to have a fair and consistent policy of immigration. 
   This country opened its doors to my mother, her family, to give her a chance to leave her land and come to live here. I often think about the courage involved when their family came together, her mother and three small children, to get on a boat in Germany to come to a country where they did not speak a word of the language. 
   But they heard they had a better opportunity here in America, as many millions before them and many millions since have heard the same thing. Should we not in this generation show we are compassionate conservatives, compassionate moderates, and compassionate liberals when it comes to immigration fairness? The way to show that, the way to prove it, is to bring to the floor this legislation as quickly as possible. 
   I hope on a bipartisan basis we can have Republicans and Democrats join in the enactment of this legislation. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if you had happened to be in the Senate Dining Room a few months ago, you might have seen a group of people having lunch and wondered what in the world would gather Ambassador George McGovern, Senators Bob Dole and TED KENNEDY, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, Congressmen JIM MCGOVERN and TONY HALL and myself all at one table. 
   The answer to your question is that we were working together on a bipartisan initiative that could have a positive impact on children around the world and be of great benefit to America's farmers. 
   Former Senator and now Ambassador McGovern has advocated an idea to emulate one of the most beneficial programs ever launched on behalf of children in this country--the school lunch program. 
   He has worked with Senator Dole and others to establish an international school lunch program and President Clinton has jump-started this proposal with his announcement that the United States will provide $300 million in surplus commodities for the initiative. 
   Today, I am introducing legislation to provide a long-term funding source for international school feeding programs that will allow such programs to expand and reach more kids. 
   Today there are more than 300 million children throughout the world--more kids than the entire population of the United States--who go through the day and then to bed at night hungry. Some 130 million of these kids don't go to school right now, mainly because their parents need them to stay at home or work to pitch in any way that they can. 
   In January of this year, I traveled to sub-Saharan Africa, the epicenter of the AIDS crisis, with more than two-thirds of AIDS cases worldwide. There I saw first-hand the horrible impact AIDS is having on that continent. I met a woman in Uganda named Mary Nalongo Nassozzi, who is a 63-year-old widow. 
   All of her children died from AIDS and she has created an ``orphanage'' with 16 of her grandchildren now living in her home. People like Mary need our help to keep these kids in school. 
   Linking education and nutrition is not a new idea. Private voluntary organizations like CARE, Catholic Relief Services, ADRA, World Vision, Save the Children and Food for the Hungry are already helping kids with education, mother/child nutrition programs and school feeding programs.  These organizations and the World Food Program operate programs in more than 90 countries at this time, but typically can only target the poorest children in the poorest districts of the country. 
   Ambassador McGovern, Senator Dole, myself and others have called for an expanded effort, and as I noted earlier, President Clinton has responded. I applaud the President for the program he announced last Sunday in Okinawa. This $300 million initiative is expected to help serve a solid, nutritious meal to nine million children every day they go to school. 
   Think about it: for only 10 cents a day for each meal, we can feed a hungry child and help that child learn. With what you or I pay for a Big Mac, fries and a soft drink, we could afford to feed two classrooms of kids in Ghana or Nepal.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am certain those who were observing the Senate Chamber yesterday and perhaps the day before are curious as to why absolutely nothing is happening. It reflects the fact that there is no agreement between the parties as to how to proceed on the business of the Senate, particularly on the appropriations bills. 
   At this moment in time negotiations are underway, and hopefully they will be completed successfully very soon. At issue is the number of amendments to be offered, the time for the debate, and some tangential but very important issues such as the consideration of appointments of Federal district court judges across America to fill vacancies. These judgeships have been a source of great controversy in recent times because there is a clear difference of opinion between Democrats and Republicans about how many judges should be appointed this year. 
   Of course, the Republicans in control of the Senate are hopeful that their candidate for President will prevail in November and that all of the vacancies can then be filled by a Republican President. That is understandable. The Democrats, on the other hand, in the minority in the Senate, have a President who has the authority to appoint these judges and wants to exercise that  authority in this closing year. Therein lies the clash in confrontation. 
   Historically, the last time the tables were turned and there was a Republican President and a Democratic Senate, President Ronald Reagan had 60 Federal district court judges appointed in the election year. In fact, there were hearings on some of them as late at September of that year. This year, we have had about 30 appointed and we have many more vacancies, many more pending. We are hopeful, on the Democratic side, these will be filled. Those on the Republican side are adamant that they do not want to bring them up. I hope they will reconsider that and at least give Democrats the same consideration we offered President Reagan when he faced a Democratic Senate with many Federal district court vacancies. 
   The other item of business which consumed our attention over the last week or two related to tax relief. It is an interesting issue and one that many Members like to take back home and discuss; certainly most American families, regardless of whether they are rich or poor, desire some reduction in their tax burden. 
   The difference of opinion between the Democrats and Republicans on this issue is very stark. There is a consideration on the Republican side that tax relief should go to those who pay the most. Of course, those who pay the most taxes are, in fact, the wealthiest in this country. We have a progressive tax system. We have had it for a long time. We believe if one is fortunate enough to be successful, those taxpayers owe something back to this country. Those who are more successful owe more back to this country. You can't take blood from a turnip; you can't put a high tax rate on a person with a low income. But you can certainly say to a successful person: We ask you to contribute back to America. We ask you, in the payment of taxes, to help maintain this great Nation which has given you, your family, and your business such a wonderful opportunity. 
   The Republican program from the start, as long as I have served in Congress, has always been to reduce the tax burden on those who are the wealthiest in this country. I happen to believe the tables should be turned and we should have a situation where those who are in the lower income groups and middle-income families who are struggling to make ends meet should be the ones most deserving of tax relief. That is a difference in philosophy, a difference between the parties, and is reflected very clearly in the debate we have had over the last 2 weeks. 
   This is a chart which I have been bringing to the floor on a 
   regular basis. Some House Republicans told me this morning that they are tired of seeing my chart. They are going to have to get a little more exhausted because I am going to produce it again today. This chart outlines what happens with the Republican tax plans, with their idea of tax cuts. 
   In the area of the estate tax, a tax is imposed on less than 2 percent of the American population. Of 2.3 million people who die each year, only 40,000 end up with any liability under the estate tax. It is a tax reserved for those who really have large estates that they have accumulated during a lifetime. There are exemptions that people can write off when it comes to the estate tax liability, and those exemptions are growing, as they should, to reflect the cost of living increases. 
   By and large, the Republicans have proposed to do away with the tax completely, so the very wealthiest of Americans who pay this tax would receive the tax relief. 
   What does it mean? On the Republican plan, if you happen to be a person making over $300,000 a year in income--if my calculations are correct, that is about $25,000 a month in income--the Republicans have suggested you need an annual tax cut of $23,000 as a result of their elimination of the estate tax. That boils down to close to $2,000 a month, for those making $25,000 a month, that the Republicans would send your way when it comes to tax relief. 
   Most American income categories are people making between $40,000 and $65,000 a year. Under the Republican plan, if you happen to be with the vast majority of Americans paying taxes, you aren't going to notice this tax relief; $200 a year is what the Republicans offer to you. That comes down to $16 a month they are going to send your way. If you are in the highest income categories, you receive $2,000 a month; if you happen to be with the vast majority of Americans, you receive $16 a month. 
   That is the Republican view of the world. That is the Republican view of tax relief: If we are going to help people, for goodness' sake, let's help the wealthy feel their pain, understand the anxiety they must face in making investments, in choosing locations for new vacation homes, and give them some tax relief. 
   The fact is that 80 percent of Americans are making under $50,000 a year. For these Americans, $15 or $16 a month is something, but it is certainly not going to change their lifestyle. 
   Mr. President, 26 percent of Americans make between $50,000 and $100,000 a year. In those two categories of people under $100,000 a year and under $50,000 a year, we find the vast majority of American families, the overwhelming majority, and the people who will not benefit from the idea of tax relief propounded by the Republicans on the floor. They suggest to all American families they have them in mind when it comes to tax relief. The facts tell a different story. 
   Look at what we have suggested instead. The Democrats think we have to be much more responsible in spending this Nation's surplus or investing. It wasn't that long ago we were deep in deficit with a national debt that accumulated to almost $6 trillion. Now we are at a point where we have a strong economy, families are doing better, businesses are doing better, people are making more money, and the tax revenues coming in reflect it. That surplus is what we are debating. We have gone from the days of the Reagan-Bush deficits to a new era where we are talking about a surplus and what we will do with it. 
   Those who are younger in America should pay attention to this debate. If you are a young person in America, we are about to give you a very great nation. Our generation hopes to hand over as good a country as we found, perhaps even better, but we are also going to hand over to you a very great debt of $6 trillion. That debt we have to pay interest on. It is like a mortgage. You say to your children and grandchildren: Welcome to America, welcome to this 
   land of opportunity, here's the debt you will have to pay. 
   In the late 1980s and 1990s in America, the political leadership in this country accumulated a massive debt, starting with the election of President Reagan, then with President Bush, and for the first few years of President Clinton we continued to see this debt grow. We have turned the corner. Under the Clinton-Gore leadership, under the votes that have been cast by Democrats in Congress, we now have a stronger economy. 
   People have a right to ask, What are we going to do with the surplus? The Republican answer is: Tax cuts for wealthy people. The Democratic answer is much different: First, pay down the national debt. We can't guarantee the surplus will be here in a year, 2 years, or 10 years. If it is here, shouldn't it be our highest priority? Let's wipe off the debt of this country as best we can, reduce the burden on our children, invest in Social Security and in Medicare. 
   This is not a wild-eyed idea. It is what Alan Greenspan of the Federal Reserve recommends. It is what major economists recommend. But you cannot sell it on the Republican side of the aisle. They think, instead, we should give tax cuts to the wealthy. 
   We think we should bring down the national debt and invest in Social Security and Medicare. If we are to have tax cuts, let us target these tax cuts to people who really need them, not the folks making over $300,000 a year. They are going to do quite well. They are going to have nice homes on islands off the coast of Maine. They are going to have places in Florida and California. They are going to have a very comfortable life. 
   But what about the people who live in Chicago? What about the people who live in Portland, ME? What about those who live in Philadelphia, PA? I would like to take to them this proposal, not to eliminate taxes on those making  over $300,000 a year but to say to working families and middle-income families: Here are targeted tax cuts that you can use, that will help your life. Let's provide for a marriage tax penalty elimination for working families. Let's expand educational opportunities by making tuition costs tax deductible. Think about your concern of sending your son or daughter through college and the increasing cost of a college education. For a family who is struggling to try to make ends meet and to give their kids the best opportunity, to be able to deduct those college education expenses means an awful lot more to them than the comfort in knowing that Donald Trump does not have to pay estate taxes under the Republican proposal. 
   That is the difference in our view of the world. The Republicans feel the pain of Donald Trump, that he might have to pay these estate taxes. We believe that families across America face a lot more anxiety and pain over how to pay for college education expenses. We had a vote on the floor here, up or down, take your pick: Estate tax relief for Donald Trump or college deductions for the families working across America. Sadly, the Republicans would not support the idea of college education expense deductions. 
   Let's talk about caring for elderly parents. Baby boomers understand this. Everyone understands it. As your parents get older, they need special help. You are doing your best. I cannot tell you how many of my friends this affects. I am in that generation of baby boomers--slightly older, I might add--but in a generation where a frequent topic of conversation for my age group is how are your mom and dad doing? The stories come back, and some of them are heartbreaking, about Parkinson's and Alzheimer's and complications with diabetes that lead to amputations and people finally having to make the tough decision of asking their parents to consider living in a place where they can receive some assistance. 
   It is expensive. We, on the Democratic side, believe that helping to pay for those expenses the families endure because of aging parents is a good tax cut, one that is good for this country and good for the families. Not so on the Republican side. When we offered this, they voted against it. They would rather give estate tax relief to the wealthiest people. 
   How about child care? Everybody who got up this morning in America and headed to work and left a small child with a neighbor or at a day-care center understands that this is tugging at your mind constantly during the day. Is my child in safe hands? Is this a quality and positive environment for my child to be in? How much does it cost? Can we afford it? Can we do a little better? 
   We, on the Democratic side, think we ought to help these families. They are working families who should have peace of mind. Senator DODD offered an amendment that proposed tax credits, not only for day care, but also tax credits for stay-at-home moms who decide they are going to forgo working, to stay with the children 
   and try to raise them. We want to help in both of those circumstances. We think those are the real problems facing America. The Republicans instead believe that estate tax relief for the superrich is much more important. 
   Expand the earned-income tax credit for the working poor, help families save for retirement, provide estate tax relief--particularly to make sure that a family-owned farm or a family-owned business can be passed on to the next generation. I think the estate tax needs reform. We support that. We voted for it. But we think the Republican proposal goes way too far in proposing we abolish it. 
   I see my time is coming to a close. We think the agenda before this Congress is an agenda of missed opportunities. The Republicans are in control in the House and Senate. They decide what will be considered on the floor, if anything. They have failed to bring forward commonsense gun safety legislation after Columbine, to try to keep guns out of the hands of kids and criminals. We passed it in the Senate with AL GORE's vote, sent it to the House--the gun lobby killed it. We lose 30,000 Americans every year to gun violence; 12 children every single day. For the Republicans, it is not a priority to bring this bill forward. 
   The Patients' Bill of Rights, so your doctor can make the call on your medical treatment or your family's medical treatment--most people think that is common sense. The insurance companies do not. They want their clerks to make the decision based on the bottom line of profit and loss. It is not a medical decision for them, it is a financial decision. And for a lot of families it is disastrous when they cannot get the appropriate care for their kids and their families. We think a Patients' Bill of Rights makes sense. The insurance lobby opposed it. The insurance lobby prevailed. The special interest groups won on the floor and we have gone nowhere with this proposal. 
   Minimum wage: $5.15 an hour for a minimum wage that affects some 10 million workers across America. It is about time for a pay raise. These folks deserve to do better. It used to be bipartisan. We didn't even argue about it. Now the Republicans say: No, no no, we can't give a 50-cent-an-hour pay raise to people making $5.15 an hour. Do you realize that 50 cents an hour comes out to, what, $1,000 a year that we will give these people? 
   Yet we are going to turn around and give Donald Trump a $400 million tax break on his estate? You cannot give working families a thousand bucks a year, but you can give the one of the superrich $400 million tax relief? Is something upside-down in this Chamber? I think so. 
   Take a look at the prescription drug benefit. Ask Americans--Democrats, Republicans, and Independents--the one thing we ought to do this year? A guaranteed universal prescription drug benefit under Medicare. The pharmaceutical companies oppose it. They are pretty powerful characters in this town. They have stopped this Senate and this House from considering it. Here we are, languishing, doing nothing, when it comes to a prescription drug benefit. 
   Finally, something for our schools. Seven million kids in America attend schools with serious safety code violations; 25,000 schools across our country are falling down. Are we going to be ready for the 21st century? Will our kids be ready? Will our workforce be ready? You can answer that question by deciding at this point in time whether education is truly a priority and, if it is such a priority, then for goodness' sakes we should invest more than 1 percent of our Federal budget in K-12 education. That is what we invest. The Democrats, under the leadership of Senator KENNEDY, believe that investment is overdue. We think that is what families in America are looking for, not for tax relief for the wealthiest among us. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this week will be the last week before we break for the party conventions--the Republicans in Philadelphia; the Democrats in Los Angeles. We have a full array of legislation that could be considered this week. I am not sure, being a member of the lowly minority, as to what issues we will actually address, but the American people should pay close attention to what has occurred in this Chamber in the last 2 weeks. 
   A little bit of history puts it in perspective. Not that many years ago, we were struggling with annual deficits. It was crippling the economy of the United States and certainly causing a shockwave across America as families had to step back and consider the impact of a huge national debt that we passed on to future generations. In fact, our national debt now is approaching $6 trillion, and we collect $1 billion in taxes every single day in America to pay interest on our old debt. 
   That $1 billion in taxes does not educate a child; it does not buy a tank or a gun; it does not provide health insurance for anyone; it does not improve Social Security or Medicare. It pays interest on old debt. 
   It is debt that was accumulated primarily during the period when Presidents Reagan and Bush were in office and some partially during the period when President Clinton first began, but we have turned the corner. People have come to understand a dramatic thing has occurred. We are now reaching a point where we are not talking about deficits and debt but about the possibility, the opportunity of a surplus. This is something which America's families and businesses have worked hard to earn: a surplus that reflects a strong economy with more and more people working, which reflects the fact we have had the greatest period of economic expansion in the history of the United States. In fact, I hope we do not become blase about this. This is something that was hard to achieve and American families and businesses working with our Government leaders reached this new point. 
   Having reached the point where we can look ahead and say we have a strong economy and a surplus coming, it is now up to the Congress to decide what to do with that surplus. There are two very different approaches as to what to do with the surplus. 
   During the last 2 weeks, the Republican Party has come to the floor of the Senate and suggested they know what to do with this surplus. They have suggested we take $1 trillion, approximately half of the projected surplus over the next 10 years or so, and dedicate it to tax cuts. Tax cuts are a popular proposal for politicians. Any of us would like to stand before a crowd in our States or hometowns and talk about cutting their taxes. But the honest question is, Is that the best thing for us to do at this moment in time? 
   On the Democratic side, we believe that there is a better approach. We believe our first obligation is to pay down the national debt, strengthening Social Security and Medicare and making certain that our children carry less of a burden in the future. The Republicans say give tax cuts, primarily to wealthy people, over $1 trillion worth. We say take that money and pay down the debt. We are not sure if that surplus is actually going to be there 2 years, 4 years, 6 years from now. Wouldn't every family and business in America agree it is more sensible to first retire this huge debt that looms over America and its future? That is the Democratic position. 
   Most people believe we should deal with the national debt. The Republican position, with notable exceptions, including the Presiding Officer, who has taken a more conservative approach when it comes to dealing with the surplus--is, no, we should cut taxes on a permanent basis and hope for the best. The tough part of it, too, is that this cutting of taxes is primarily going to those at the highest income levels. 
   I had a chart last week which showed that 43 percent of the estate tax cut proposed by the Republicans went to people making over $300,000 a year. For people with an average income of $900,000 a year--a show of hands is not necessary--the Republicans proposed a $23,000-a-year tax break. If one is making somewhere in the neighborhood of $75,000 a month, will another $2,000 a month really make a difference in their life? I find that hard to imagine. Yet when it comes right down to it, that is what we hear from the Republican side: Give the tax breaks to the wealthiest people in America. 
   On our side, we believe this surplus should be used to pay down the debt, strengthen Social Security and Medicare, and then find those targeted tax cuts that can make a real difference in a person's life. 
   Let me give a few examples of targeted tax cuts that cost far less than what the Republicans have suggested but would mean dramatic tax relief to working families. I start with middle-income families worried about paying for college education expenses, as well they should be. Between 1990 and 1998, average tuition and fees increased 79 percent at public universities, 56 percent at private 4-year institutions, compared to a 23-percent increase in the Consumer Price Index and a 41-percent increase in per capita disposable income. Families know this. When children are born, they think ahead: How are we going to pay for this kid's college education? 
   On the Democratic side, we believe if we are talking about changing tax policy, let us give to middle-income families the deduction of college education expenses, a helping hand so that 
   if a son or daughter is accepted at a good university, they don't have to make the decision that they can't go because of money. That is our idea. We would have deduction for college education expenses. 
   The Republican idea is an estate tax cut that would give an average $23,000-a-year tax break to people making $900,000 a year. What is of more value to the future of America: Someone who gets $2,000 a month to put it in an investment or another vacation home or a family who takes a tax break offered on the Democratic side and helps their son or daughter go to the very best college or university into which they can be accepted? 
   Secondly, working families I know are struggling with the concept of day care, what to do with the children during the day so they have peace of mind in that the children are safe in a quality environment. Some working people choose day-care centers in their hometowns. They can be very expensive. I know my grandson is in day care, a very good one. I am happy he is there. Many families don't have that luxury. They can't turn to good day care because they can't afford it. What about the family who decides that instead of both parents working, one will stay home to care for the child? That is a good decision to make, if one can afford to make it. 
   On the Democratic side--this is another change in tax policy that is far better for America than to give tax breaks to wealthy people--Senator DODD of Connecticut came to the floor and said: Let's help families pay for  day-care center expenses with a tax credit or offer a tax credit to mothers who will stay at home with children so they will get a helping hand, too. I think that is eminently sensible. 
   We know that children in the early stages of their life really are forming their minds and their values, and we want them to be in the very best environment. If they get off to a good start, many kids will do well in school and have a great future ahead of them. But on the other side of the coin, if children are being pushed and shoved from one incompetent and dangerous babysitter to the next, it is risky. It is something no family would want to face. On the Democratic side, instead of tax breaks for the wealthy, we want to target tax breaks for those who are struggling to find a way to keep a parent at home to watch a child or to pay for day care. 
   A third area we have worked on is the whole question of long-term care. Baby boomers understand this. Their parents and their grandparents are reaching an age where they need special attention, special help, special care. Much of it is expensive. Families are making sacrifices for their parents, the elderly, and their families. We think they deserve a helping hand. We understand people are living longer and have special needs. We have proposed a tax break that will help families who are concerned about long-term care and caring for their parents and elderly people. 
   These are the types of targeted tax breaks which the Democrats support: Deduction of college education expenses; help for day care, to keep parents at home so they can watch their children; help for long-term care, to take care of our aging parents. This is our concept of targeted tax relief. The Republican concept of tax relief is a $23,000 annual tax break for people making over $300,000 a year. 
   Frankly, I will take this issue anywhere in my home State of Illinois. I would like to argue this point as to whether we take a handful of people and give them the most exceedingly 
   generous tax breaks or look at 98 percent of America's families who are struggling with the realities of life. 
   I am glad my colleague from Massachusetts is here. I will be happy to yield to him at any point. I want to make one point before I do. 
   There are many other issues which are languishing in this Congress which need to be addressed, issues to which the American people look to us for leadership. I will cite a few so one can understand the frustration, many times, of dealing with real-life problems at home and this Disneyland situation on Capitol Hill. The people need to be represented in this Chamber, not the powerful. The powerful have their lobbyists. The special interests have their political action committees. They have shown extraordinary strength when it comes to stopping issues about which people really care. Allow me to address a few. 
   A prescription drug benefit under Medicare: Is there another action we can take in America that is fairer or better for our seniors and disabled than to give them the opportunity to afford prescription drugs? 
   Is it not scandalous that senior citizens in many States get in buses and take 100-mile trips over the border to Canada to buy their prescription drugs? The same drugs manufactured in the United States, approved for sale in the United States, can be purchased in Canada for a fraction of the cost. 
   Is it not scandalous and disgraceful that senior citizens across America, when they receive the prescriptions from their doctor and are told, take this medicine; you will be strong and healthy and independent if you do, can't afford to fill the prescription, go to the store and find they have to choose between food and medicine, fill the prescription and take half of what they are supposed to because they can't afford it? That is a reality of life. It is something we should address. 
   The simple fact is, this Congress has failed to come up with a prescription drug benefit under Medicare. We have talked about it for a year and a half or longer. The President has called for it for years. The Republican Congress says no because the pharmaceutical companies, which are enjoying some of the greatest profits in their history, don't want to see this prescription drug benefit. They know that if we have the bargaining power under Medicare to keep prices under control, their profit margins might slip. 
   So, once again, the powerful and special interest groups are the ones that are prevailing. The Republican answer to this is, well, why don't we turn to the same insurance companies that offer HMOs and managed care and ask them if they would offer a prescription drug benefit. Excuse me if I am skeptical, but we know what these companies have done when it comes to life-and-death decisions on medical care. Too many times they say no when they should say yes. People are forced into court before judges to plead and beg and do their very best to get the basic care they need to survive. 
   Is that what we want to see when it comes to life-saving prescription drugs, another battle between America's families and these insurance companies? 
   We received a report recently about over a million people who have lost their HMO Medicare policies--cancelled--because the companies didn't think they were making enough money. The Republicans say that is the answer. We don't think so. It should be a universal, guaranteed program under Medicare, one that you are confident will allow your doctor to give you a prescription that you can fill and will allow you to be able to afford to fill it. That is another issue stopped in this Congress by the special interest groups. 
   The Patients' Bill of Rights would let the doctors make the decisions, not the insurance companies. We have lost that issue on the floor of the Senate. We raised that issue and the insurance companies prevailed. They would not let Senator KENNEDY's bill come forward to give people the peace of mind that they were getting the best medical care and that they would not have to fight with a clerk from an insurance company when it came to what they and the people they love might need. 
   As at Columbine High School, all of the press reports about shootings in schools and in other places shock America from one coast to the other. Can this Congress pass commonsense legislation for gun safety for a background check at gun shows, to make sure criminals and children don't get their hands on guns? Can we pass legislation to require a child safety device on every handgun so that kids don't rummage through the closet, find a handgun, and shoot themselves or a playmate? No. The answer is we can't because the powerful gun lobby stopped that legislation from being passed as well. 
   Prescription drug benefits, Patients' Bill of Rights, commonsense gun safety legislation, and an increase in the minimum wage--Senator KENNEDY has fought for that for years. The minimum wage is $5.15 an hour in this country. Imagine trying to live on that, on the $10,000 or $12,000 a year in income that it generates. That is next to impossible. We have tried to raise the minimum wage because we believe it is not only fair but it gives people who go to work every day a chance for a livable wage. The Republicans say, no, we can't afford a livable wage; we can't afford to increase the minimum wage, but we can afford to give a trillion dollar tax break to the wealthiest people in this country. 
   Does that make sense? Is it fair or just? I don't think so. 
   The issues of education and health care, compensation for working people, a Patients' Bill of Rights, prescription drug benefits, none of these have been addressed. The Republicans will be off to their convention in Philadelphia in a few days. They will take great pride in talking about what they have achieved in Washington. I hope the American people will take a look at the list of issues I have referred to and ask themselves 
   how many of those issues are important to their families. I think many of them are. All of them are stalled because the people don't rule in this Chamber, the powerful do. Those powerful special interests have stopped our attempts to try to make sure we have sensible fiscal policy to keep this economy moving forward, to pay down our debt, strengthen Social Security and Medicare, and to make sure that tax cuts help the people who deserve them. 
   We have a big agenda in this town and very little of it has been addressed. I think it is a commentary on this Congress and its leadership that we have failed to respond to the issues that families in America care about.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts because I think he has made his case convincingly that there are many things we have failed to do in this Congress which mean a lot to the American people. 
   Take a look at the inaction of the Republican-controlled Congress on so many issues that are really life-and-death, day-to-day issues that families across America expect us to lead on, such as the issue of commonsense gun safety; 30,000 American lives were lost to gun violence in 1999. We lose 12 children every single day in America. As many children are dying in America because of gun violence every day as were lost at Columbine High School. It is a reminder that we have a situation with gun violence that is unprecedented in the history of the world. The obvious conclusion from the Republican leadership is, there is nothing we can do or want to do to change it. 
   We believe, on the Democratic side, that commonsense gun safety is something we should enact, and do it very quickly. We passed a bill here on the floor of the Senate. It had a tie vote of 49-49. Vice President Al Gore cast the deciding vote. We sent it over to the House of Representatives. In 2 or 3 weeks, the gun lobby tore it to pieces. They sent it to a conference committee. For over 1 solid year, that bill has been stuck in a conference committee because the Republican leadership is unwilling to bring forward any gun safety legislation. Yet we see these statistics where literally thousands of Americans are victims of gun violence. 
   In my State of Illinois, in the city of Chicago, there are now gathering together summit conferences of leaders from communities because of the unprecedented killings which are taking place--particularly of our children--with drive-by shootings. Children are being killed while lying in bed or sitting on the front porch with their parents. It is becoming too commonplace. The obvious attitude of the Republican leadership is, there is nothing they are willing to do to even try to address it. 
   We think if you buy a gun at a gun show, you should go through the same background check as a person who buys a gun from a gun dealer. We want to know if you have a history of violent mental illness. We want to know if you have committed a violent felony in the past. We want to know if you have a history of the kind of activity that has required an injunction to protect someone against domestic violence. We think it is only fair and just that we ask people who want to exercise their rights under the second amendment to accept the inconvenience of a few questions being asked. Yet the Republicans apparently disagree. They refuse to move any gun safety legislation. 
   As to the Patients' Bill of Rights, which Senator KENNEDY addresses, every day 14,000 Americans are denied their needed medicines; 10,000 are denied their needed tests and procedures. You know the stories. You know that in your hometown convenience store there is a little canister which says, can you leave your change for this little girl, who needs a certain medical treatment, which is even denied by her insurance company, for which she has no insurance. That is a reality for a lot of families who are struggling to pay for expensive medical care. It is the reality of many of these families who turn to these insurance companies. These companies say: No, it is not one of our recommended procedures; your doctor is just 
   going to have to be told no. I have talked to those doctors who have said to mothers and fathers what their child needs, and then they turn around and find an insurance company overruling them. 
   We think patients in this country should come first, that quality medical care should be in the hands of professionals and not in the hands of insurance company clerks. 
   More than 11 million Americans have been denied an increase in the minimum wage for over 2 years. In Illinois, 350,000 people got up and went to work this morning for $5.15 an hour. These are not lazy people. These are hard-working people who are asking this Congress to keep them in mind as we give tax breaks to wealthy people, to keep them in mind as we approve congressional salaries for those of us who serve in the House and Senate. But no, the Republican leadership has told us we have no time to consider an increase in the minimum wage. 
   Of course, the prescription drug benefit under Medicare--13 million seniors in America have no prescription coverage. 
   I met a woman in Chicago who had a double lung transplant. Her medical bills are $2,500 a month for the drugs she needs so her body will not reject these lungs. She can't afford it. She has to turn to welfare and to Medicare. She lives in a basement with her children because, frankly, she has no income, no resources. She has had times when she didn't have the money to fill her prescription, and she has suffered irreversible lung damage every time that has happened. That is her life every single day. 
   That is what it means to be poor in America--or, even those with Social Security checks who do not think themselves to be poor and able to afford prescription drugs. 
   Yet when we propose a plan that offers guaranteed universal coverage under Medicare for prescription drugs, the Republican leadership says: No, we think we ought to turn to these same insurance companies that have treated us so well--I use that term advisedly--under our HMO and managed-care system and ask them to give prescription drug benefits, the same insurance companies that have been cutting people off when it comes to HMO supplemental policies under Medicare. 
   Over 1 million Americans have been cut off, many in my State of Illinois. I don't trust the insurance companies to provide, out of the kindness of their hearts, prescription drug benefits. I think there should be guaranteed universal coverage under the Medicare system. 
   Another bill stopped by the Republican Congress is school modernization. 
   We should debate a bill that will allow us to increase the limits of immigrants coming into this country to provide those immigrants to fill highly-skilled jobs and good-paying jobs in this country that can't be filled with American workers. I think it is a reality. It is the No. 1 complaint of businesses that can't find skilled workers. 
   Yesterday, as I got on the plane in Springfield, IL, a fellow from a local company, Garrett Aviation, said: Let me tell you that my biggest problem in business is I can't find workers to fill the jobs. 
   The industries come to Congress and say: Allow us to have more people immigrate to the United States who can fill these jobs. I think it is a real problem. If we don't allow this immigration, some of those jobs and companies will go overseas. 
   But let's look at it in the long term. What are we doing to improve the workforce in America to make sure we have people who are skilled enough to fill these jobs and make these good incomes? Are we dedicating our money in our schools and in training to make this happen? I don't think so. 
   In the 1950s, we were afraid of the Russians. When they launched Sputnik with their advances in science, we passed the National Defense Education Act. We said: We are going to help kids across America pay for their college education. We believed that these kids, once trained, would make America strong so we would not have to worry about this threat from Russia. 
   I know about that program. I was one of the beneficiaries. I borrowed money from this Government to go to college and law school. I hope many people think that was a good investment. Some may not think so. I paid the money back. Shouldn't we do the same  thing again with a national security education act that says we want to train our workers for the future needs in America to make certain they can fill the jobs with Boeing Aircraft in St. Louis or Motorola in the Chicago area? We are not doing that. 
   This Congress won't address that. It won't address school modernization. It won't address the question of the deduction for college education expenses. It won't address the need to improve teacher skills. That is something we don't have time for on the agenda of this Congress. 
   Businesses across America look to us for leadership. Families across America expect us to create opportunities. Time and again, we have seen instead efforts by the Republicans in the Senate to give tax breaks to the wealthiest people in America and to ignore the realities facing our families. I think our agenda has to be an agenda closer to the real needs of America. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator for his leadership. I say to those listening to this debate that Senator WELLSTONE of Minnesota has been a consistent voice on the floor of the Senate on the issue of health care. Many of us visit that issue and believe it is important. He has dedicated his life in Congress and the Senate to champion the cause of good health care for all Americans and is recognized nationally for his leadership on issues such as coverage of those who suffer from mental illness. 
   To put the agenda of the Senate in perspective for a moment, because the Senator raises an important question about 40 million Americans who have no health insurance, and many who are underinsured today, and the fact that this Congress refuses to even debate the issue or discuss the issue when we reach out for a good program that Senator KENNEDY, Senator WELLSTONE, and I supported to extend health insurance coverage to children of working families in many States, and reaching out in other areas, but we seem to be reluctant to address what most American families have to address every single day--the lack of security, and the lack of peace of mind when it comes to health insurance--I would like the Senator from Minnesota to comment on the fact that we are in possibly one of the greatest periods of prosperity in the history of the United States. We are talking about surpluses under the budget that may reach $2 trillion. The only suggestion from the Republican side of the aisle is that we should use $1 trillion of the surplus--almost half the surplus--to give tax breaks to the wealthiest people in America rather than addressing working families who are uninsured and people who are looking for the peace of mind by having some protection when it comes to basic health care. 
   Will the Senator from Minnesota reflect on what we have done on the floor of the Senate over the last 2 weeks in the context of what I consider the high priority he has raised?

   Mr. DURBIN. The Senator has come to this floor repeatedly and discussed concerns that I hear in Illinois and that the Senator from Minnesota hears in Minnesota from working families and middle-income families trying to do their business. They get up and go to work every morning. They think ahead for their children. They want to realize and live the American dream. The Senator in the parlance of politicians feels the pain of families and their anxieties about their future. It appears that the Senate in the last 2 weeks feels the pain of the wealthy people in America. 
   For those who think I overstate the case, this is an analysis of the tax cuts that have been proposed over the last 2 weeks in the Senate and the people who benefit from them. 
   The Republicans proposed that we take over $1 trillion--over half of the surplus for the next 10 years--and give it in tax cuts to the wealthiest of Americans. We analyzed their tax cut package. Democrats support tax cuts. The Senator from Minnesota talked about tax cuts so people can deduct the cost of college education; so people can deduct and have a credit for quality day care for their kids; for long-term care for their aging parents; for prescription drug benefits. The Republicans focused on the estate tax and a few other taxes. 
   I would like to ask the Senator from Minnesota to comment on this distribution chart because we analyzed the Republican tax cut. Who are the winners and who are the losers? The good news is that everybody gets a tax cut under the Republican plan. 
   But look at the tax cut. If you happen to make less than $13,000 a year--these are people of minimum wage--the tax cut is worth $24 a year, or two bucks a month. 
   Move up to $12,400 in income. You are going to see $82 a year, or about seven bucks a month. Now you get up to people making $40,000 a year. We are up to about $11 a month, or $131 a year. If you are up to $65,000, these folks are going to see a tax cut of about $16 or $17 a month under the Republican plan. 
   Fast forward and jump with me, if you will, to the top 1 percent of wage earners in America. 
   People making over $300,000 a year--people in the gallery don't have to raise their hands--folks who are making over $300,000 a year are going to see an annual tax cut from a Republican proposal of $23,000 a year. On average, these people make over $900,000 a year, $75,000 a month. And the Republicans have proposed giving them an additional $2,000 a month in disposable income. For what? For what? 
   I can tell Members what these working families would do with $2,000 a month. It is fairly predictable. They would be paying for the kids' college education. They would be buying health insurance to make sure they are covered. They would be paying for quality day care. They would be taking care of an aging parent. That is what working families would do with a tax break. That is what Democrats support. 
   The Republicans say no; give the biggest tax cut to those who are making the most money. The response? Well, Senator, you don't understand. These people are paying too much in taxes. People making under $50,000 a year can use some tax relief, too. They are paying payroll taxes and facing a lot of problems every month. 
   The Republicans, frankly, won't listen to this. I want the Senator from Minnesota to comment on this distribution chart on his proposals of what we could be doing to help working families across this country.

   Mr. DURBIN. This chart shows what is happening to families of three trying to survive on a minimum wage. There are lots of people trying to live while earning a minimum wage. It usually means multiple jobs. There are 350,000 in Illinois alone who get up and go to work for a minimum wage. They usually have a second job. One of my friends who works in the Watertower Place across the street from the hotel I stay in Chicago--she is a great friend of mine--is trying to take care of an aging mother. She has two jobs. She works in a parking garage as an attendant and then when she gets off that job she is a hostess in a restaurant. This lady works harder than most of us who think we are hard workers, and she is working for a little bit above the minimum wage. 
   What we see on this chart, I say to Senator WELLSTONE, is when we judge what the poverty line is in America, look what happened in about the year 1989. All of a sudden the minimum wage fell below the poverty line. Those of us who wanted to make sure people who get up and work hard every day get a decent paycheck and a chance to have a livable wage have asked to raise the minimum wage from $5.15 to $6.15 an hour over a 2-year period of time. I guarantee you will not live a life of luxury at $6.15 an hour, but you may be able to take care of some basic needs such as school uniforms for the kids, and shoes, maybe a decent place to live, a safer and cleaner place to live. Yet we cannot seem to get that issue before the Congress. 
   Republican leadership--in what has been a departure from the past where they said this is a bipartisan issue--has now said this is a partisan issue. Republicans oppose a minimum wage increase. The Democrats support it and the Republicans have stopped us. 
   I will give an example. If I'm not mistaken, Governor Bush from Texas, his position is States ought to be able to opt out of the minimum wage increase. That is what he would do. So you would have certain pockets in the United States which would not have a minimum wage increase. That is cold comfort for people who get up and go to work and try to keep things together for their family. But the Senator from Minnesota is correct. The minimum wage has been plummeting in its buying power. Congress has the authority to take care of that issue. Congress has refused. 
   Instead of dealing with a minimum wage and giving people basically $1 an hour increase, which comes out to about $2,000 a year if my math is correct, here we decide to give $2,000 a month in tax breaks to people making over $300,000 a year. We cannot give $2,000 a year to people who work hard every single day, but we can give folks making over $300,000 a year under the Republican tax break plan, a $23,000-a-year tax cut--almost $2,000 a month. Those are the priorities. Those are the differences. 
   I think we try our best to feel the pain of working 
   families. The Republicans feel the pain of the wealthy, the pain they must go through every day trying to decide what to do with another $2,000 when they have a paycheck coming in of $25,000 a month. What anguish, what pain, what frustration it must be to try to figure out another mutual fund or another vacation place. 
   How about the families worried about having a few bucks in the bank and paying for their kids' education?

   Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator, he may recall we asked the Members of the Senate to take their choice, make a pick, make a decision. That is what we are sent here to do, cast a vote. Senator DODD stood up on day care and said: Shouldn't we help working families who are struggling to find a safe, quality place to leave their kids when they are off to work so they can have peace of mind and the children can grow in a positive learning environment, a safe environment? 
   He said: Instead of giving a tax break of $23,000 a year to the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans, why don't we talk about targeting tax cuts so families can have more of a tax credit to pay for day care? He took another step the Senator from Minnesota, I am sure, remembers. Senator DODD said: What about those families where the mother, for example, decides to stay home and raise the kids? Shouldn't we be encouraging that family? They are making an economic sacrifice for the good of their children. Shouldn't they have a tax break? 
   I agree with him. My wife stayed at home. I am glad she did. I guess we did not buy all the things we could have in life, but we sure ended up with three good kids, thanks to her hard work. She stayed home and helped raise those kids. 
   A lot of families make that decision, that economic sacrifice. Shouldn't our Tax Code help those mothers? Frankly, we are going to help you whatever your choice. Whether you go to work and need help with day care or stay home with your children, we are going to give you tax relief targeted to those families. The Republicans said: No, no, that is not a priority. Here is the priority. The priority is giving to people who make an average income of $900,000 a year about $2,000 more a month to figure out what they are going to do with it. 
   That is the difference. That is what the debate came down to. 
   The Senator from Minnesota, as he talks about long-term care, touches my heart, too. My mother passed away a few years ago. Thank goodness, she was able to stay independent for a long period of time, usually watching her son on C-SPAN and calling him in the evening to correct him on some of the things he said. I understand what families go through when they start making these decisions--and they are heartbreaking decisions--about their parents and grandparents. We believe tax breaks should be available to those families who want to take care of their parents and grandparents, who are willing to sacrifice. But not on the Republican side. They are more concerned about this estate tax which, as my colleague from Minnesota says, disproportionately helps the very wealthiest people in the United States.

   Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield before he yields the floor, most of us in the Chamber are well aware of Senator WELLSTONE's background. Having been involved in teaching in Minnesota and higher education in his professional career before his election, he understands, if not better than most of us, what higher education is about, what it offers, and also what it costs. 
   The Senator from Minnesota raises another point. We offered an alternative to this estate tax break which comes down to $23,000 a year for the wealthiest Americans. We said we are 
   going to help for the very first time in America working middle-income families. We are going to allow them to deduct the cost of college education expenses from their income taxes. It is not a major deduction, but it helps. It said, for example, up to $12,000 a year could be deducted, and it would be treated in the 28-percent rate, which means a little over $3,000 a year.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I join my colleague, the Senator from Utah, Mr. HATCH, in offering this amendment for consideration by the Senate. 
   This is an amendment which will provide $2 million more for the processing of approvals of generic drugs. 
   We are all familiar with the issue of prescription drug prices. We certainly understand that Congress should do as much as possible to help reduce the high cost of these prescription drugs, particularly for the elderly and disabled. 
   One of the things we are doing with this bipartisan amendment is providing more money to the Food and Drug Administration for generic drug approvals. The high prices of drugs can be significantly reduced by putting more generic drugs on the market. Generic drugs typically enter the market 25 to 30 percent below the cost of brand name drugs and within 2 years are 60 to 70 percent cheaper than brand name drugs. Increasing the development of safe and effective generic drugs, is good for American consumers. 
   Key to increasing access to such drugs, is making sure that the approval process is as efficient as possible. This chart illustrates the number of applications pending more than 180 days before the Food and Drug Administration for generic drugs. As we can see, the numbers have continued to increase. This is because the numbers that the Food and Drug Administration is being asked to approve has increased over the past few years. 
   In fact, the median approval time for generics has steadily decreased from 19.6 months in 1997 to a little over 18 months in 1998 and 17.3 months in 1999. But under the present budget, according to the Food and Drug Administration, they are estimated to go up again in 2000 and 2001, and we are going to see a slowdown in the approval of generics. 
   Senator HATCH and I have offered this amendment to provide $2 million to the Office of Generic Drugs. It is on top of the increase which the bill already puts in place of $1.2 million. This money will allow them to hire the professional people to approve the drugs, to put the computers and technology in place so that they can move forward with new ways to assess the drugs on a more timely basis, and to make certain that these drugs are available for American consumers as quickly as possible. 
   Very soon some of the blockbuster patent drugs are going to come off patent. Let me give some examples: Mevacor for high cholesterol, Vasotec and Zestril for high blood pressure, Glucophage for diabetics, Accutane for cystic acne, Lovenox to prevent blood clotting and Prilosec for those with stomach acid, heartburn or ulcers. These brand name drugs have sales of billions of dollars. Prilosec alone has sales of over $2.8 billion annually. Together, these drugs represented over $8 billion in sales in 1997. This year, their sales are certainly far more than this. 
   If we want to make certain these drugs move from brand name to generic so consumers across America can afford them, then the investment in the Food and Drug Administration which Senator HATCH and I propose is money well spent. I am happy to join Senator HATCH in this effort. I hope the Senate will approve this amendment and make it part of this appropriation bill.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, section 3102 of the Agriculture appropriations bill does not address the production of food and fiber in America. It does not address any jurisdiction of the Department of Agriculture. It is a provision which has been added to this bill which relates directly to hard rock mining in the United States, which is under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Interior. 
   I might say, parenthetically, I found it very interesting listening to this debate on the Ag appropriations bill, and considering some of the comments that have been made on the Senate floor in the past year about limiting the subject matter of amendments and the substance of legislation. 
   If we can consider an Amtrak amendment on the Ag appropriations bill, and if we can consider an amendment on hard rock mining on the Ag appropriations bill, then those who come before us and say we have to have purity in the amendments we are offering and considering on the bill should remember this particular debate. 
   I was surprised to find that a point of order on a motion to strike, based on that point of order, would not stand because of what I consider to be a very thin connection to some language in the House appropriations bill. But the Parliamentarian advised me of that. I understand that is going to be the rule of the day around here. I suppose that is what we will play by. I am sure each side will find an advantage and disadvantage associated with that interpretation. 
   Allow me to address the amendment before us, and to try to do it in a very concise way, knowing that everyone has waited a long time. I have waited for 8 1/2 hours to offer this amendment. 
   Let me say at the outset, we are dealing with the hard rock mining industry. An effort is being made, with the language in this Agriculture appropriations bill, to stop the Department of the Interior from issuing new regulations to make sure that this industry follows the best practices to protect the taxpayers of this country and the environment. 
   To put it in perspective, just this May the Environmental Protection Agency released its Toxics Release Inventory report. It identified the hard rock mining industry in the United States as our Nation's largest toxic polluter. 
   The mining industry released 3.5 billion pounds of toxic pollution in 1998. I will repeat that. The mining industry released 3.5 billion pounds of toxic pollution in 1998. Almost half of all of the toxic pollution in America comes from this industry, which is being protected by this amendment in the Agriculture appropriations bill.

   Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from South Dakota is absolutely correct. I think it is important that a Senator from a State where this mining is taking place has come to share this story. This is not just testimony presented by environmental groups. These are the real-life circumstances of people in Western States, where the mining is taking place, who are left with a mess when the mines go bankrupt. 
   This environmental rider stops us from revising and reforming the financial assurance language and requiring bonds of companies that literally will protect the communities and the taxpayers and families around these mining sites. That is what it is all about. That is the bottom line. 
   Mr. President, I thank my colleagues in the Senate. I have waited for a long time to offer this. I will not belabor it. I hope they will join me in passing this amendment, which will establish standards which I think are reasonable to make sure this industry can continue but only in a responsible way. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I join my colleague from Illinois in paying tribute to our fallen colleague, Senator PAUL COVERDELL. 
   I have been in the Senate for 4 years and have worked with many colleagues on both sides of the aisle. I agree completely with Senator FITZGERALD: Senator COVERDELL brought to this floor a certain dignity and demeanor to which we all aspire. He was a person of good humor. I think it may be difficult for many people who follow the debates in the Senate to believe that a Democrat who believes very strongly in his party and a Republican who believes very strongly can be engaged in a hot debate on the floor of the Senate and then, as soon as the debate is over, meet each other in the corridor or the well or at another time and be friends. That was the case with PAUL COVERDELL.  
   We disagreed on many issues, but I never found him to be lacking a smile and always looking for some common ground where we might come together. The last conversation I had with him several weeks ago, he walked all the way across the floor to the Democratic side of the aisle and came right up to me. I was wondering what this could be. 
   He said: I need your help. 
   I said: What is it, PAUL?  
   He said: I want to try to secure a gold medal for Ronald and Nancy Reagan; will you help me? 
   I know he was from Illinois. I said: Of course, I will. 
   I signed onto it. That is the kind of person he was. As different as we might be politically, he was always trying to reach out and find some common ground. I think when we get caught up so much in the political debate and the furor here, we 
    forget many times how important it is to have a person such as PAUL COVERDELL here to remind us time and again that after the debates are finished, we are all basically human beings trying to do our very best in the Senate. 
   I agree with my colleague from Illinois: It is hard to imagine that only a few days ago he was standing in the well and smiling and walking around as he always did as a member of the Republican leadership team and then stricken on Sunday, operated on on Monday and passed away. It is a sad day for the Senate. 
   I have noted, interestingly enough, today, as many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have come to the microphone, some have known PAUL COVERDELL for a long time. Some have known him in many different roles in life, some for a very short time. Everyone from both sides has a very positive take on what PAUL COVERDELL meant to each of us and meant to this institution. 
   It is a great loss, not only for the Senate but for the State of Georgia and for the Nation which he served in so many different ways so well. 
   I extend my sympathies to his wife Nancy and all his family and friends in this moment of grief. The Senate has lost a fine Senator. I am honored to have called him a friend.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I just listened carefully to my colleague from Oklahoma correcting the press, and of course I would join him on many days in that effort. As a public figure, I am often quoted enough and read things that I think are a little bit different than what I believe are the facts. I would say in this instance perhaps his characterization of the information presented by the Washington Post at least deserves to be discussed for a moment. He made reference to the Citizens for Tax Justice, a group with which I have worked. He referred to them as, I believe, a left wing or left leaning group. His characterization is his own and he is entitled to it. But I suggest to the Senator from Oklahoma and to anyone who is following this matter, when we assess how much it will cost for the so-called marriage penalty tax relief, we usually make assessments on a 10-year basis. Though the bill may say 5 years, it really strains credulity to suggest at the end of 5 years we are going to reimpose the tax once we have taken it off.

   Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma. I want to show a chart to the Senator from Oklahoma, and anyone else following this, that was not prepared by Citizens for Tax Justice. It was prepared by the Joint Committee on Taxation 
   which is an official body that works for the U.S. Congress. It is bipartisan, as I understand it. They were asked to try to determine how much tax relief of the marriage penalty tax relief bill proposed by the Republicans would be going to certain income groups in America. It is starkly different than what the Senator from Oklahoma has said. 
   If he will take a look at the comparison between the Democratic plan in yellow and the Republican plan in red, he will see different income categories. There is a substantial difference in the tax relief available. In the lower income categories, we find substantial relief available for those making $20,000 a year--under the Democratic plan about $2,000; under the Republican plan about $500. At $30,000, it is substantial help--about $4,000 under the Democratic plan; about $800 under the Republican; At $50,000 a year in income, $1,900 in tax relief on the Democrat plan, $240 on the Republican.

   Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator for his comments. I thanked him before leaving. I don't want him to take this paper with him for this dinner hour, but I will stand by the comments of the Joint Committee on Taxation. This is not a political group, not a partisan group. It is a group authorized by Congress to make these evaluations. The Senator from Oklahoma is entitled to his opinion. I am going to stick with the facts given to me by an organization we rely on all the time. 
   If I can finish the presentation, though, you note when we get to the highest income categories, the Democratic bill does not provide relief under the so-called marriage penalty tax relief, and the Republican plan does, about $1,000 of tax relief for people making $250,000 a year. 
   The important thing to keep in mind, too, in putting this in perspective, is not too many years ago we were laboring with a national deficit and worries about how we were going to pay it off and balance our books. Some suggested we needed a constitutional amendment, a dramatic revision in the budgetary policy here in Congress. 
   There are many of us who believe there is another way to do it, with sound fiscal policy and leadership, not only in the White House but also in Congress. With the leadership of President Clinton and Vice President GORE, we now find ourselves talking about spending surpluses. 
   I would like to speak for a moment about the tax bills we have considered over the last 2 weeks, but before I do that, I would like to yield to my colleague from the State of Nevada.

   Mr. DURBIN. That is exactly my point. Before he rushed off for dinner, the Senator from Oklahoma suggested if that was the case, he would eat the paper. I suggest my friend from Nevada save that. Perhaps we can send it along for lunch tomorrow for my colleague because I stand by that estimate. I have no reason to believe it is not true. For him to suggest the cost of this program is $56 billion whether it is 5 years in length or 10 years in length really does not square with my understanding. 
   It certainly is going to cost us taxpayers more over a 10-year period of time than it did over a 5-year period of time. I believe that is what the Joint Committee on Taxation is telling us.

   Mr. DURBIN. That is true. In fact, what we have done is present a proposal that says if you are in a situation where two wage earners get married and their joint income raises them to a higher tax rate, we protect them. Basically, we voted, if I am not mistaken, to say to those taxpayers: Take your pick. You can file a joint return. You can file a single return. We have a proposal that will protect you from being penalized for your marriage. The Republicans, unfortunately, go one step beyond solving the problem and create a problem. They create a problem because they not only remove what they consider to be the marriage penalty, although their approach is only half hearted--they provide a marriage bonus. In other words, those couples who get married and don't pay higher taxes because of combined joint income receive a tax break under the Republican plan. So it goes far beyond solving the additional problem that was identified. It creates a new problem because it creates a new expense, a new drain on the Treasury, a new expenditure of our surplus.

<DOCNO>106-durbin-il-9-20000719</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from Nevada is correct. What the Republicans suggest is they end the marriage penalty. We know there are somewhere between 62 and 67 provisions in the Tax Code that penalize a couple when they are married and have a higher 
   joint income. We on the Democratic side address every single one of those penalties and remove them for those who are truly penalized. The Republicans, unfortunately, only addressed three of them. They leave all the other taxes on this married couple. So they not only don't solve the problem, they create a new problem by taking the surplus away for people who are not being prejudiced by being married, and they don't address it in a comprehensive way. 
   President Clinton should veto this bill, and in vetoing it send it back to Congress and say if it is your goal to eliminate the marriage penalty, do it in an honest way; do it in a complete way. What we had before us yesterday was very incomplete and, I am afraid, not a very direct way of dealing with this problem. 
   Take a look, if you will, at the impact of the Republican marriage penalty tax cut by income because I am going to return to this theme in just a moment. If you take a look at who will benefit from the Republican tax relief plan, you will find that, as usual, those who are in the richest fifth, top 20 percent of wage earners in America, receive 78.3 percent of all benefits under this Republican tax relief. In fact, the top 5 percent of wage earners receive 25.7 percent of all of this tax relief. This, unfortunately, has become a recurring theme when the issue of tax relief comes before the Republican-controlled Senate. Time and again they believe the people who are best off in this country, the people who are doing well, are the ones who need a helping hand. 
   Many of us come from States and communities where the folks who are making a lot of money are doing very well. They are very comfortable. They have had a very profitable time for the last 7 or 8 years of the Clinton administration. We have seen dramatic increases in the Dow Jones, the NASDAQ. When President Clinton was sworn into office as President, the Dow Jones was about 3,000 or 3,300. Today it is over 10,000. The value of those stocks has more than tripled. In the same period of time, the NASDAQ indicators went up from about 800 when the President was sworn in to around 5,000 today. 
   There is a suggestion there for everyone that if you happen to be invested with savings accounts and retirement accounts in the stock market, you have had a pretty good time of it over the last 7 or 8 years. I am glad that has happened, and I am happy for all the families who profited and businesses and retirement funds that have seen better times because of this improvement. 
   It strikes me as strange, if not odd, that when we talk about tax relief then, the Republicans seem to want to focus on the people who have really done the very best in income and net worth over the last 10 years. 
   Take a look at this chart of Republican tax breaks under both the estate tax reform and the marriage tax penalty reform, and you will find again a dramatic difference in the money that is available. For those in the lowest 20 percent--these are people making the minimum wage or slightly more--the Republican idea of tax relief turns out to be $24 a year in reduced taxes, about $2 a month. 
   Now go up to the top 1 percent, people making over $300,000 a year, and the Republican idea of tax relief is $23,000, almost $2,000 a month. I suggest that anyone making $300,000--which, if my quick calculations are correct, comes out to about $25,000 a month in income--may not notice $2,000 a month. I guarantee the people at the lowest end who are struggling at minimum wage jobs are not going to notice $2 a month. 
   It is far more important for us, when we talk about real tax relief, to keep our eyes on those in the lower- and middle-income groups who are struggling mightily to do well in this economy. They have had some help. The economy is doing well, but they could use some tax relief, and if we are going to take the surplus of the United States and give it to families across America, should we start at the top? Should we start with the wealthiest or should we start basically with the lower- and middle-income families who really need it? 
   Take a look at this chart, too. This chart summarizes it. It shows the Republican tax plans we have debated over the last 2 weeks, and the impact it has, as I described on previous charts. The top 1 percent of people making over $319,000 a year, people with an average income of $915,000, receive a $23,000 tax break, which represents 43 percent of all of the tax relief that was included in those bills. We are taking the surplus generated in our economy for tax relief and 43 percent of it goes to people who have an average income of $915,000 a year. 
   There is a better way to do it. I hope the President vetoes the estate tax bill and the marriage tax penalty bill suggested by the Republicans because these bills are fundamentally unfair. That we would give tax breaks to the wealthiest among us and ignore families who work hard every single day is not fair. 
   If we are going to start a line of people most deserving of assistance in  America, I hardly believe we should start that line with Donald Trump and Bill Gates and folks who are making millions and millions of dollars. Better yet, let us try to bring to the front of that line those who are struggling every single day with the basic challenges that American families face. 
   Tax cuts should be directed. First and foremost, we need a prescription drug benefit. We just had an interesting debate. Pharmaceutical companies cannot be too happy with this debate because we said on a bipartisan basis that we are so 
   upset with drug pricing in America that we are now going to allow companies, pharmacists, and distributors to import drugs from overseas at lower prices so they can sell them to Americans. These are drugs that are basically made and inspected in America, sent to foreign countries, and sold at a fraction of the price. 
   It happens in Canada. It happens in Europe. It happens in Mexico. We all know the story. People are getting in buses in some States and driving across the border to Canada to buy American drugs at a fraction of the cost. 
   The Senate said there has to be a better way. Absent addressing this problem of pricing drugs head on, we are going to allow the reimportation of these American drugs that have been made in inspected laboratories into the United States so that they can be sold to Americans at a reduced cost. I guess it is obvious from this vote that we know families are suffering because of drug prices, and yet before we have enacted any kind of a prescription drug benefit under Medicare, the Republicans have insisted we spend half of our anticipated surplus in tax breaks for the wealthiest in America. 
   It makes more sense to me to create a prescription drug benefit under Medicare, a universal guaranteed drug benefit accessible to every American who chooses to be part of it, one that allows a doctor to prescribe a drug that a person needs to stay strong and healthy in their home for as long as they want to be and be able to pay for the drug. 
   I have seen cases in Illinois and certainly in hearings across the country and in this city have heard from people who are struggling to pay for prescription drugs. That is the highest priority we should deal with, and we should do it before we break for the August conventions so that both parties can go to their conventions and say: We did something for the families across America. For those who are concerned about the elderly and disabled who are stuck with high drug prices, we did something for fathers and grandfathers, mothers and grandmothers, who really cannot afford the drugs their doctors prescribe. 
   We did not do that. Instead, we decided people with an average income of $915,000 a year need an additional $23,000 in tax breaks from the Republicans. I will bet a nickel there is not a person making $915,000 a year who cannot afford prescription drugs. These people know how to pay for virtually everything if they are making that much money, and we gave them more money. 
   Before we directed our attention to those who were struggling to get by on fixed incomes--people on Social Security taking home a check of $800 or $1,200 a month looking at drug bills of $200, $500, $600--we learned from a public hearing in Chicago of a woman who had gone through a double lung transplant. It was a miracle she stood there before us and looked very healthy. Years after that transplant, she still worried because she needed to take immunosuppressant drugs that cost over $2,000 a month. There was no way on her fixed income she could afford it. 
   Frankly, if she stopped taking them, she could have irreversible lung damage. She faced that prospect, she made that decision, she stopped taking the drugs for a period of months because she could not afford them, and did face irreversible lung damage. She got back on the welfare rolls long enough to resume prescriptions and living month to month trying to afford the drug she needed to stay alive. That is a 
   real story of a person whose income is little more than $12,000 a year who literally worries from month to month as to whether or not they will be able to buy the drugs to keep them alive. 
   Did we remember that lady when we talked about tax relief here? No. We focused 43 percent of our attention and 43 percent of our surplus on people making over $300,000 a year, people making $915,000 average income. For those in the category above them, $130,000 to $319,000, we gave them another 14 percent of the surplus as well. 
   There is another group we forget, and when we had an opportunity to vote for an amendment, unfortunately, we could not muster a majority to support them: families who are paying for college education expenses for their kids. 
   We believe--the Clinton administration and Democrats believe--that families who want to put their kids through school should be able to deduct their college education expenses up to $12,000. It means a helping hand from the Government in the range of $3,000 a year. Most families would welcome that so they could pay the tuition expenses and the room and board for the kids who finally are accepted at good colleges and universities. It is a strain for a lot of families, and a lot of kids go deeply into debt to pay for college. 
   We believe tax relief should be directed to those families so they can send their kids to college. We brought it up for a vote, and it was rejected by the Republican side. That is not their idea of tax relief. Their idea of tax relief is $23,000 a year in tax breaks for people making over $900,000 a year. 
   We wanted to address another problem. What about day care? So many working families worry about where their kids are going to be during the course of a day--whether they will be in a place that is safe, clean, and healthy, someplace where a child might have a chance to learn--and they struggle to find that place they can afford. Day care is a real human, family problem. We came up with a proposal to increase the credit that a family can claim for the cost of day care.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, that was rejected as well. The idea of helping families through the Tax Code to pay for day care was rejected. 
   I can tell you with no doubt in my mind, with an absolute degree of certainty, that if you are making $915,000 a year, you probably do not worry too much about the weekly day care costs, but that is the group the Republican majority decided needed help, 
   not the working family, struggling to find a safe, clean, affordable day-care center for their kids. No. 
   The group making over $900,000 a year will get $23,000 in tax breaks from the proposals on the Republican side of the aisle. 
   This list includes an effort by the Democratic side to provide tax credits to businesses offering health insurance to their employees. You know as well as I do that 40 million Americans do not have health insurance. We believe the best way to help them afford health insurance is to help the small business employers provide that benefit. Of course, that insurance is more expensive. Those who buy it in smaller groups, such as the small businesses, have to pay more for the health insurance premiums and their employees are in lower income categories. 
   So I proposed an amendment that said we would give a tax credit to businesses, a tax credit for those who would offer health insurance not only to the owners of the businesses but also to those who work there. That was rejected by the Republican side of the aisle. That is the kind of tax relief they just do not think is necessary. 
   I can tell you, you will not find a single person working for a small business in America making over $900,000 a year--the people we were trying to help with that amendment. 
   I can guarantee you, as well, that people making over $900,000 a year probably don't lose a single moment's sleep each night worrying about whether there will be health insurance. 
   So it comes down to this. The President has proposed he is going to veto these proposals by the Republicans because, once again, as they have done historically, the tax cuts proposed on the Republican side of the aisle have gone overwhelmingly to the wealthy. It happened in August of 1999; again, in May of 2000 under George W. Bush's plan; it happened with the House action recently in March of this year; and  it happened again on this estate tax repeal that the Republicans support. 
   Time and time again, the vast majority of relief goes to the wealthiest people in America. When will this Congress and this Senate listen to the 98 percent of the families in America who are hoping that we share their concerns about their future and their kids' future? Whether it is college education expenses, prescription drugs for their parents, prescription drugs for the disabled and their families, an effort to pay for child care, an effort to make certain they have health insurance on the job, when will this Congress put that as a high priority? 
   The Republican leadership said: Those people can go to the back of the line. We will wait for some other day, if ever, to discuss their needs. First we have to take care of the wealthiest. First we have to make sure that those making over $900,000 a year get about $2,000 more a month so they can be a little more comfortable in their lifestyle. 
   I think that is wrong. The President's veto is right. Let us provide tax relief and target it for the people who really need it. If there is a surplus in America, let working families, 98 percent of whom were ignored by the Republican tax cut plan, be first in line. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

    Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Stronger Tobacco Warning Label to Save Lives Act. This legislation would replace the current cigarette warning label on tobacco products with larger, more direct messages that will have an impact on current smokers and potential smokers who are usually children. The Stronger Tobacco Warning Label to Save Lives Act will require a new series of warning labels modeled after new, more effective warning labels in Canada. 
   On January 19, 2000, Canadian Health Minister Allan Rock unveiled new and larger health warning labels for tobacco products which include color graphics and images that illustrate the damage that cigarettes do to the health of smokers and those around them. These warning labels will cover 50% of the front and back panels of tobacco products--one side in English and the other in French--and provide more information on the harmful ingredients in tobacco products. These new warning labels apply to all tobacco products. They will take effect on January 1, 2001. 
   After the U.S. Surgeon General publicly announced the dangers of tobacco use in 1965, the U.S. became the first country to impose mandatory health warning labels on all cigarette packs. In 1984, the U.S. replaced that label with a system of four rotating warning labels. Since then, the U.S. cigarette warning labels have become stale and ineffective. Many smokers have memorized all of the current warning labels. Others never notice the warnings because they are placed inconspicuously the side of the pack. 
   Other countries have since taken the lead and required stronger health warning labels. These labels have been effective in reducing smoking rates. For example, in South Africa, tobacco consumption decreased by 15% between 1994 and 1997 due to a combination of radio advertising campaigns, increased excise taxes on cigarettes, and new health warning labels. Fifty-eight percent of smokers said that the cigarette warning labels made them want to quit, cut down on smoking, or at least change to a lighter cigarette. Among non-smokers, 38% said that the warnings made them glad they had never started smoking. 
   The tobacco industry's massive expenditures on tobacco product promotion and public relations have ensured that, over time, Americans have seen more positive than negative imagery surrounding tobacco. The Stronger Tobacco Warning Label to Save Lives Act will ensure that every time someone lights up, the first thing that comes to mind is the health consequences--not the alluring lifestyle images associated with tobacco industry marketing. Too many young people smoke because they are led to believe it's cool and glamorous, when the truth is that tobacco kills. 
   Because tobacco products are highly addictive for many users, and because most users start using tobacco at a very young age, the standard of warning for tobacco must be much higher than for other products. The warning labels should at least be as prominent in selling the health message as the industry's design is effective in promoting the product. This is not about banning or regulating a legal product, this is about providing the consumer with the appropriate information so they can make an informed decision. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this important legislation to ensure that every time someone lights up, the first thing that comes to mind are the health consequences--not the alluring lifestyle images associated with tobacco industry marketing. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation be printed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, those who have followed the proceedings of the Senate over the last 2 weeks understand we have been debating changes in the Tax Code. The two changes we have focused on are changes in the estate tax and changes in what is known as the marriage penalty. These are two very interesting proposals that have been before the Senate but they really tell the story about the priorities of the Senate when it comes to dealing with the economy and helping families across America. 
   The estate tax, which we have considered and passed in a version last week to ultimately repeal it, is a tax which affects a very small percentage of Americans. In fact, fewer than 2 percent of American families will pay the estate tax. Those who end up paying it are the wealthiest people in America. 
   It is curious to me that when we established our list of priorities in this Congress as to tax relief, the first people in line were the wealthiest people in America. That is not to say we should not consider tax relief that involves them, but I think everyone understands that average families, smaller businesses, and family farms have priorities, too, when it comes to tax relief. 
   Take a look at what the Republican proposals under the estate tax, as well as the so-called marriage penalty tax, would do in terms of the people in America and their income groups. 
   For the 20 percent of American families lowest in income, the Republican proposals, two of them--the estate tax as well as the marriage penalty--result in tax breaks of $24 a year. Then, as you start moving up in income, you see that not until you get up to the level of the next 15 percent here, of the top wage earners in America, do you find people even seeing a tax break of about $900 a year--about $75 or $80 a month. 
   Now look at what happens when you go to the top 1 percent of wage earners in America, the wealthiest people in America: $23,000 in tax breaks coming from this Republican-led Senate under these two bills, estate tax reform and marriage penalty. 
   So if you happen to be in a working family, down here, you are not going to notice what has been going on in the Senate because, frankly, the tax relief they are sending your way hardly pays for a magazine. But look what happens at the highest income levels: $24 for the lowest wage earners, the people struggling to survive in America; $23,000 for the wealthiest people in this country. Time and time and time again, the Republican leadership, given a chance to deal with tax equity in America, decides the best thing that can be done is to give to the wealthiest Americans more tax breaks. 
   This tells the story as well. I will not go through it in all detail, but the top 1 percent of wage earners in this country, people making over $300,000 a year--those folks are going to see a tax break of $23,000; 43 percent of all the tax relief coming in these two Republican bills goes to people making over $300,000 a year. 
   There are people who will say perhaps they need it. I am not one of them. Frankly, I can tell you who needs it, as far as I am concerned. A working family trying to figure out how they are going to pay for their kid's college education expenses, those are the folks who need a tax break. When we put on the floor a measure sponsored by my seatmate here, Senator Charles SCHUMER of New York, to allow people to deduct $12,000 a year in college education expenses instead of giving tax breaks to the wealthy, it was rejected by the Republican majority. A $12,000 deduction for college education expenses was rejected while we give a $23,000-a-year tax break to the wealthiest among us. 
   Then Senator DODD of Connecticut, who has been a leader in child care, stood up and said we have a lot of people going to work in America every day worried about the safety and quality of child care; let's give them a tax break so they can pay for good, professional, safe child care and have peace of mind while at work that their kids are in good hands. It was rejected by the Republican majority. The idea of helping working families take care of their kids was rejected. 
   Then Senator KENNEDY and others offered a prescription drug benefit for seniors and the disabled under Medicare, struggling to pay for their drug bills. We said we think that is a higher priority than a $23,000 tax break for the wealthiest people in America. The Republican majority said no, it is not a higher priority; it is a much higher priority to keep in the front of the line at all times the wealthiest people in America. That is what this debate is all about. 
   The question is, Whom do we stand for? Do we stand for working families in this country or do we stand for the financially articulate who, frankly, lord over this political process with their representatives who come in expensive suits, well dressed, standing in the corridors here saying we have to 
   help the wealthy of America. 
   For good Heaven's sake, for the last 8 years this economy has been on such a roll, the wealthiest in America have done very, very well. I don't begrudge them that. But when we talk about helping people in this country, why don't we remember the folks who get up and go to work every single day, who worry about their kids' education expenses, who are concerned about day care where they can leave their kids safely, who want to make certain their parents can afford the prescription drugs they need to stay healthy? 
   That is not a priority among the Republican leadership here. They don't want to talk about it. They want to go to their convention in Philadelphia in 2 weeks and talk about how they have worked so hard for tax cuts and President Clinton and the Democrats have stopped them. Don't forget to ask them the question, Who are the winners under your tax cuts? The winners are those who turn out always to win when the Republicans are in control. The wealthiest win again and again in America. 
   I see Senator HARKIN. Senator HARKIN came in with his own proposal, trying to help those concerned about tax equity. I am happy to yield to him at this point.

   Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from Iowa is correct. As these charts indicate, those tax breaks are going to the wealthiest people in America. I think the Senator from Iowa, from my neighboring State, believes as I do: Hard-working people in this country are not looking for a handout; they are looking for an opportunity. Give them a chance to pay for their kids' college education; give them a chance to pay for prescription drugs; give them a chance to pay for day care. And the Republicans say consistently: That is not a priority. That is not important.

   Mr. DURBIN. I might say in response to the Senator from Iowa, to think we live in a nation where 30 percent of our population cannot read any higher than a fifth-grade level, this is a waste of resources in our country. We will  need to be a productive society in the 21st century. The fact is that this Republican-controlled Congress does not even view education as a high enough priority; they would rather put our time and our effort into tax breaks for people who are doing very well under our economy. 
   I will be happy to yield again to the Senator from Iowa.

   Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator from Massachusetts, if you take a look at this chart, this is what the Republicans want to do for those who are working for the minimum wage, for less than $13,000 a year. They want to give them a tax cut of $24. Two dollars a month is their response. We are trying to give them a dollar an hour increase under Senator KENNEDY's leadership in the minimum wage. Yet those at the highest level, those making over $300,000 a year, under the Republican proposal, will see a tax break of $23,000 a year. That is almost double what people making minimum wage are receiving in income. We are going to give that much in a tax break to those making over $300,000. 
   So instead of raising the minimum wage for the millions that the Senator refers to--and the 350,000 people who get up and go to work every day in Illinois at minimum-wage jobs--we are, instead, giving a tax break to the wealthiest among us.

   Mr. DURBIN. I agree completely. 
   When Senator FEINGOLD offered his amendment that said anyone with an estate over $100 million a year will have to pay estate taxes, it was rejected by the Republicans. To think people that wealthy should not pay their taxes, while many seniors have to choose between filling their prescription drug prescriptions or filling their refrigerators with food, I think tells the difference between the two parties when it comes to helping America.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the Nickles amendment is a historic vote. Since 1906, virtually every President of the United States has used the Antiquities Act to protect valuable, irreplaceable national treasures, such as the Grand Tetons and Olympic National Park. 
   With this Nickles amendment, the party of Teddy Roosevelt officially abandons its commitment to his environmental legacy. Without as much of a minute of hearings on this issue, the Nickles amendment strips the President of the authority he has had for generations to protect America's natural and national treasures. The Grand Old Party works overtime to protect the legacy of the wealthy from taxation but refuses to protect the legacies of meadows, rivers, mountains, and forests for our children. 
   Vote ``no'' on the Nickles amendment.

   Mr. DURBIN. I join my colleague from Illinois in recognizing the need for a Lincoln Library. Twelve Presidents, as well as Confederate leader Jefferson Davis, currently have presidential libraries. Abraham Lincoln, as the man who preserved the Union, truly deserves such an institution where people from around the world can learn about his great achievements. 
   This project enjoys tremendous support at the federal, state, and local levels. The entire Illinois Congressional Delegation, the Illinois General Assembly, and City of Springfield have all expressed their strong support for this library to be completed. The State of Illinois has contributed $50 million, and the City of Springfield $10 million, to begin construction on the interpretive center. In addition, the Lincoln Library received $3 million from the FY 2000 Interior Appropriations Bill. While these federal funds are greatly appreciated, we need a stronger federal commitment to make sure construction of the Library can get underway. I would like to ask the Senator from Washington if there is any possibility to receive increased funding from the FY 2001 Interior Appropriations Bill for this important endeavor.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me explain to the body what the Lott amendment does. If you voted in favor of the Durbin-Bond amendment to give full deductibility of insurance premiums to self-employed small businesses and farmers, the Lott amendment eliminates that vote. If you voted with Senator TORRICELLI of New Jersey for lead screening under Medicaid to protect children, the Lott amendment eliminates that. If you voted with Senator TORRICELLI on special provisions in Medicare for those suffering from Lou Gehrig's disease, the Lott amendment eliminates that. If you voted with Senator BURNS to change business accounting to make it more fair to small businesses, the Lott amendment eliminates it. 
   This is done over and over in the House of Representatives by the Rules Committee. It clears the deck of all the activity and progress we have made. It is an effort to make a tabula rasa the last amendment of the day. If you believe the amendments we voted for are worth standing behind, I urge you to vote ``no'' on the Lott amendment.

   Mr. DURBIN. The United States has changed a lot in the last 7 1/2 years. Mr. President, 7 1/2 years ago we were deep into deficits. We were spending more each year than we collected in taxes. We were running up the largest national debt in the history of the United States. We have $6 trillion in debt to show for that experience. 
   Many people have lost faith in the ability of this institution to correct this problem and to respond to what was truly a national crisis. In fact, some went so far as to suggest we should amend the Constitution of the United States to pass what was known as the balanced budget amendment. 
   On the floor today with me is Senator ROBERT BYRD of West Virginia, acknowledged to be probably the most gifted Senator when it comes to the rules of this body and knowledge of the Constitution. He fought a battle, sometimes lonely but ultimately successful, in stopping Members from amending the Constitution and giving power to the Federal courts to tell the Congress to stop spending. Some in this body thought that was the only way we could stop the red ink cascading over the Treasury in Washington, DC. Senator BYRD prevailed. The amendment was defeated. 
   Amazingly, we stand today in this Senate, in this Capitol, in Washington, DC, with a complete change of events. We are no longer talking about the yearly deficits. We are talking about the yearly surpluses, the fact that the economy is so strong, so many people are working, so many people are earning a good income, businesses are successful, people are building homes, America is on the move. For 7 1/2 years or more now, we have seen that prosperity not only lift the boats of the American people but also bring a new opportunity in Congress. For the first time in many years, we can honestly sit back and discuss and debate what to do with the surplus in the Treasury. 
   I think many Democrats share the feeling that we should be conservative in our approach with this surplus. I am not sure what tomorrow, next year, 3 years, or 5 years down the line will bring. I think the decisions we should make as to this surplus should be thoughtful. First and foremost, let's retire our national debt, the $6 trillion debt. We collect $1 billion a day in taxes from Americans, businesses, families, and individuals to pay interest on our old national debt. It is as if to say to our children, we are going to leave you the mortgage on the home we enjoyed our entire lives. 
   I agree with President Clinton and most Democrats; our first priority should be reduce the publicly held national debt to zero. We can do it. We can do it in a short period of time. It will call for some discipline and some honest dialog with the American people. We can take the money from our surplus, pay down the debt in Social Security, pay down the debt in Medicare, strengthen those two very important programs, and bring down our national debt. That is our policy on the Democratic side of the aisle. That, we think, should be the first step that we make, the most important, the most conservative, the most disciplined. 
   The Republican side sees things quite differently. They believe if we are going to have a 
   surplus, the first and most important thing we should do with that surplus is to give tax cuts. There isn't a politician alive who wouldn't like to address a crowd in his hometown and announce a tax cut. There is just no more popular set of words we can use in this business than: I'm going to cut your taxes. Is it the right thing to do? Is it the responsible thing to do? 
   Equally important, if we are to give tax cuts, who should be the beneficiaries? If we are going to have a surplus for the first time virtually in modern memory, what are we going to do with that surplus? Who will benefit from that surplus? 
   Over the last week and a half, we have heard the Republican answer to those questions. They have suggested if we have a surplus in America, if times are good and we can help somebody in America, the very first people in line for help should be the wealthiest in America. Now, is that the conclusion most American families would reach? I don't think so. 
   If you take a look at the proposal of the Republicans to eliminate the estate tax, and the bill that just passed to eliminate the so-called marriage penalty, you can see who the winners are. This chart I am presenting shows the Republican tax plan, their spending of our surplus. Almost half of our surplus is going to benefit the wealthiest people in America. The biggest winners? Mr. President, 43 percent of the total tax cut proposed by the Republicans goes to people making over $319,000 a year. They get 43 percent of the tax breaks. It means for them, on average, an annual tax cut of $23,000. That is almost $2,000 a month. 
   The Republicans believe in good times, after we have been through all this pain, and we now have a surplus, the first group who deserves a break, the first group to deserve a benefit is the wealthiest people in America, those making over $319,000 a year. 
   What about those on the other end? What about the people who get up and go to work every single day and may make a minimum wage or a little better than that? How will they fare under the Republican proposal? How were they considered when the Republicans sat down and said where our priorities will be, here are the people we will help. The lowest 20 percent of wage earners in America, those making less than $13,600 a year, get less than 1 percent of the Republican tax cut. It is worth $24 a year to them, $2 a month. The Republicans didn't forget them, they will send them $2 a month. For the wealthiest, it is almost $2,000 a month. 
   The next group, those making up to $24,400, see about $82 a year from the Republican tax cuts. That comes to $7 a month. Think about that for a second. If we are going to help the people in America who need help the most, shouldn't we be rewarding hard-working families who get up and go to work every single day, play by the rules, try to buy a home, try to build a community, try to provide for their children and their future or should we take this surplus and give it, first, to those who are making over $300,000 a year? 
   Some people say that being in Congress is about a question of being ``in touch'' or ``out of touch.'' The Republican tax plan is in touch with the wealthiest people. It is out of touch with regular families. 
   The Democratic side believes after bringing down the national debt, we should target tax cuts to help these working families who have been virtually ignored by the Republicans in their tax benefits. 
   On the floor of the Senate, we offered an amendment to say every family in America, every single family, can deduct every year $12,000 in college education expenses. I have seen a lot of families with new babies. Everybody is happy to see the child arrive. After a few minutes, people turn and say: What a cute little boy. How in the world are we ever going to pay for his college in 18 years? People know that cost is going up. The average family knows how tough it is to pay it. 
   We say on this side, you deserve a helping hand to help your son or daughter be the absolute best they can be. We offered an amendment. Instead of the Republican plan for the wealthiest, we said let the people of America deduct $12,000 a year in college education expenses from their taxes. It is a deduction which would mean, for some families, as much as $3,000, and a helping hand to pay for tuition. Rejected, rejected on the floor of the Senate last week. They don't want that kind of tax cut. They want the kind of tax cut that gives $23,000 a year to the wealthiest people in America but would not give to average families, worried about their kids going to good schools and having a bright future, a helping hand. 
   We also considered a prescription drug benefit. I think everybody knows what that is about. Your parent and your grandparents, on Medicare, are struggling to pay for their prescription drugs. On the Democratic side, we think there should be a program under Medicare to make sure the elderly have a chance to fill those prescriptions, stay healthy, stay strong, stay independent. We have been fighting for that. We offered it as an alternative. Instead of giving money to the wealthiest in this country, why don't you help those under Medicare, give them a helping hand in paying for some of the drugs? Rejected. The Republicans had a chance to vote for that tax benefit and rejected it on the floor of the Senate.  
   Having been across the State of Illinois, with public hearings on prescription drug benefits, the stories will break your heart. Men and women coming to those hearings get their prescription from the doctor. They go to the pharmacy, and before they ask them to fill it they ask how much will it cost. If it is too much, they either don't fill it or take half the prescription many times, depriving themselves of the basics of life so they can have prescription drugs. 
   That was the choice: To give to people earning over $300,000 a year in income a tax break of $23,000 or to give to seniors and the disabled a chance to pay for the prescription drugs. 
   These are the values we tested on the floor of the Senate, and Republicans rejected the idea of a prescription drug benefit proposed by the Democrats. 
   On child care, do you know a working family with small children? Unless they have someone in the family they can count on, who doesn't worry about safe, quality child care for the kids? I think about it as a grandfather. I have a little 4-year-old grandson, and it finally dawned on me when my daughter told me she was looking for day care, somebody was going to have my little Alex for 8 hours a day. I said, ``Who are these people? I want to know who they are if they are going to have my grandson.'' 
   Every mother and father asks that same question, and they struggle to come up with the money to pay for good child care to guard each day the most precious thing in their lives, and Senator DODD said, can't we give a tax break to working families to help them pay for child care? Wouldn't that be something good for America, so the kids are in good, safe hands during the course of the day so working families have that peace of mind? Rejected by the Republicans in the Senate. No, sir, we are not going to give a child care tax break for working families. We are going to give to the wealthiest in America $23,000 a year in tax cuts. 
   When it comes to putting people in the front of the line for help from this Government, the Republican leadership has said time and again: We are not there helping working families pay for college education. We are not there helping working families pay for child care. We are not there for prescription drug benefits. We are there for changes in the Tax Code that literally help the wealthiest people in America. 
   Another challenge many of us face is the whole question of taking care of aging parents. If you are a baby boomer, you probably know what I am talking about. Your parents, now, who want to live as long as they possibly can as independently as they can, basically come to you at some point and say, ``We are going to need a hand.'' People make sacrifices for their parents in those circumstances. We think the Tax Code should recognize that, and reward that as well, and give to families who are struggling to take care of their aging parents and those with serious illness a helping hand. That is another idea for a tax cut that helps real American families, another idea rejected by the Republican leadership in the Senate. No, these people are not on their radar screen. First and foremost, the tax break suggested by the Republicans has to go to the very wealthiest among us. 
   So half the surplus we are now generating and hope to see in the next 10 or 20 years is not going to the working families of America. It is going to those who already are well off, those who are doing well, those who, frankly, don't need a helping hand. 
   Imagine, if you will, if you are making $300,000 a year, what an extra $2,000 a month means to you. What are you going to do with it? Surely you will find something to do with it. But could it possibly be as valuable as providing what a family needs to help pay for a college education expenses? Prescription drugs? Day care? Taking care of an aging parent? That is the battle that is underway. 
   President Clinton said he is going to veto these bills, and he should, because he was elected by people across America, 98 percent of whom will see no benefit whatsoever from these bills. 
   Let us at least start listening to families across America when it comes to our tax policy. Let us sit down and correct the inequities in the Tax Code. But also let us decide who is most deserving of our tax assistance. I do not believe it is people making over $300,000 a year. They are doing quite fine by themselves. Let's be sensitive, though, to those families struggling every day to realize the American dream and to have opportunity. 
   When you take a look at this Nation we live in, it is the greatest on Earth. God blessed each one of us who had a chance to call this home. But we have an obligation to people who live in this country to make sure they have a chance for opportunity, too. You heard the wonderful story Senator JACK REED of Rhode Island told about John O. Pastore, one of the giants in the history of the Senate. A son of immigrants, he rose to serve in this Chamber and be an ideal and to serve as a model for so many people and so many generations. 
   There are many others like John Pastore out there who need their chance to prove themselves in America. They are not worried about estate taxes paid by fewer than 2 percent of the American people. They are folks who are worried about making sure they have a safe, healthy home, making sure they have health care, have college education expenses taken care of. Those people have been forgotten in the debate over the last 2 weeks. It is up to President Clinton to remind us of our priorities. It is up to him to lead us, now, into meaningful tax relief targeted to help families who really need it. 
   When it comes to prescription drug benefits, I do not think there is a more important issue we can consider during the course of this remaining congressional session. Prescription drug expenditures have been growing at double-digit rates for almost every year since 1980, and the drugs that seniors need the most have increased at four times the rate of inflation. The average prescription drug cost for Medicare beneficiaries will reach $1,100 per year this year. 
   The Republicans have proposed, in a manner to try to deal with this, the suggestion that we should turn to the health insurance companies to let them take care of prescription drugs. Pardon me, we have seen what those same managed care companies and health insurance companies do to families when the families really need help. They turn them down when they need medical care. They let decisions be made by insurance clerks rather than doctors. They force people to go to court to sue for basic health care. That is the same group to whom Republicans would turn over the prescription drug benefit. That will never work. It is best for us to put together a plan that is guaranteed and universal and under Medicare that we can count on. 
   It is also important we have the leverage and the power to make sure we can negotiate for reasonable drug prices. It is just inconceivable to me that some of the same drugs we approve in the United States, some of which we spent taxpayers' dollars to research and develop, end up being sold in Canada for a fraction of the cost. Americans are now getting in buses and driving over the Canadian border to buy their drugs, fill their prescriptions for prescription drugs made by American drug companies at taxpayers' expense because they have to pay three and four times as much in the United States as they would in Canada. That is disgraceful. If this Congress does not address it with not only a prescription drug benefit but also some effort to have reasonable control of 
   price increases, we are not listening to the people we were sent here to represent. 
   We can talk about estate taxes. We can talk about people making over $300,000 a year. But we have lost touch with reality and we have lost touch with America if we do not understand the cost of prescription drugs is something that haunts literally millions of Americans every single day. That is something we can and must do something about in the immediate future. 
   We have to bring Medicare in line with reality. The reality is that prescription drugs can keep you out of the hospital, keep you home and healthy, keep you independent and strong. When Medicare was created, there was no prescription drug benefit. Forty years ago, there were not that many drugs around, for that matter. But the world has changed. You would not buy a health insurance policy today that did not have some prescription drug benefit in it. Today, the most vulnerable people in America are seniors and  disabled under Medicare who virtually have no prescription drug protection whatsoever. 
   We want to change that. We, on the Democratic side, believe if we do nothing else this year, we should enact a prescription drug benefit. We can then say to our parents and grandparents and the elderly we love in this country: We have heard your message. Again, I say while we should have been debating that, we were debating an estate tax change that ends up giving almost $23,000 a year to some of the wealthiest people in America. 
   Look at how this works out in terms of the different income groups and how much they receive. As I mentioned, the lowest 20 percent of wage earners in America, under the Republican plan, get $2 a month. What can you buy with that nowadays? Maybe a coke at McDonald's, I guess. Then up here at the highest level, those making over $300,000 a year, $23,000 in breaks on the Republican tax plan. Again, the inequity is so obvious--the fact that the people who are struggling the hardest, working the hardest, doing the most to make America strong, are the people who are being ignored by the Republican tax relief. 
   This is not the first time that has occurred. Take a look at some of these charts involving Republican tax cuts from years gone by. You will see every single time the Republicans have had a chance--in August of 1999; in May of 2000, the House minimum wage proposal; in March of 2000, and the Republican Congress estate tax repeal--at least 41 percent of all the tax benefits went to the very richest, the top 1 percent in America. 
   When it came to the minimum wage, the same thing was true. Think about that minimum wage for a second. How long could you survive on $5.15 an hour on a job? Well, 350,000 people in my home State of Illinois got up this morning and went to work, and they are being paid today $5.15 an hour. These are not lazy people. These are some of the hardest working people in my State. These are people cleaning the tables, making the beds, doing the laundry, doing the dry cleaning, watching our children in day care, and these people are being paid $5.15 an hour. 
   We have tried, with Senator KENNEDY, for over 2 years to increase the minimum wage in this country, and we have been told America just cannot afford it. We cannot afford to give people who go to work every single day a livable, decent wage of $6.15. That is hardly a great sum of money, but at least it tries to keep up with the cost of living. 
   The same Congress and the same leadership that has rejected a 50-cent-an-hour wage increase for some of the hardest working people in America wants to turn around and give a tax break of $23,000 a year to those making over $300,000. 
   Doesn't it strike you as odd that they are willing to give a tax break to folks making over $300,000 a year, which is the equivalent of more than twice the income of a person earning the minimum wage? Where is the sensitivity to America? I can't understand how the Republicans can feel the ``pain'' of the wealthy but can't feel the pain of those who are working hard every single day to try to make a living and to try to make America better. 
   Again and again, given the chance to come up with the Republican tax cuts, we find that the richest in America are the ones who profit. We just ended up passing the so-called marriage penalty tax cut and exactly the same rules apply. Who are the people who will benefit from this? Under the Republican plan, this so-called marriage penalty turns out to be a marriage bonus. 
   The idea, of course, behind it is if two individuals are earning a certain income and decide to get married and they combine their income on a joint return, many times they find themselves moving up to a higher income tax bracket. That is wrong. We should change it. The Democrats support that change and that reform. 
   The Republicans say that is not enough. They say: For those who happen to get married--and one is working and one isn't--we want to lower the tax rate in their situation, even though there is no tax penalty. You end up giving a break where, frankly, it is not needed. So the tax break goes to whose who are not being penalized. 
   When you look at the ultimate benefit of it, you see, once again, the top 20 percent of earners in America are the ones who benefit the most from the Republican plan. And 25.7 percent of all the benefits under this plan go to the richest 5 percent in the country, and 78 percent of it goes to the richest 20 percent in the country. 
   Again and again, given a chance to help working families and young married people who are struggling to get a start in life, the Republicans have said, no. They say the first people to help are the richest people in our society. That, to me, does not make sense. 
   What we have suggested, under the marriage penalty, is that we should have a simple, straightforward plan. We should define the marriage penalty as when a married couple pays more as a married couple than they would as two singles. Very simple. We say let married couples earning below $100,000 have a choice in filing. They can file as two singles or as a couple. The proposal could not be more simple. 
   The Democratic alternative completely eliminates each and every one of the 65 marriage penalties in the Tax Code for taxpayers making $100,000 a year or less. It reduces the marriage penalty for taxpayers making between $100,000 and $150,000. I think it is realistic, generous, and makes a lot of sense. I supported that, but that is not what passed the Senate a few minutes ago. 
   What passed is a benefit that will, frankly, go to the wealthiest people in this country. Again and again, we forget those who are making America great, working every single day. We forget those who need help in paying college education expenses. 
   We forget those who, frankly, have to make a tough decision at some point in the life of their son or daughter: Where are they going to go to college? Every parent dreams of their son 
   or daughter getting into the very best school, and then they try to think of how they are going to pay for it. Many times they can't; they are unable to pay for it. They have to have that sad meeting in their household where they discuss it and say: Maybe you will have to stay home for a year. Maybe you will go to a school closer to home for a couple years, and then maybe, just maybe, if we save enough, you will get your chance to realize your dream and go to the very best school where you have been accepted. 
   That is a sad situation for a lot of families, but it is a real situation. We know what has happened to college education expenses. Anybody you talk to can tell you that particularly private schools but many public educational institutions have seen their costs increase dramatically. Families struggle with paying for that. 
   We came up with a suggestion on the floor of a tax deduction to help families pay for college education expenses. Rejected by the Republican majority, their belief was, if we are going to give tax relief, let's give it to the folks who are making over $300,000 a year. 
   Prescription drugs, college education expenses, child care, helping to pay for your aging parents, that is my top list when it comes to tax relief in this country. But, sadly, with the Republican majority in control of the Congress now, that will not be the list that is listened to or followed when you talk about tax relief. 
   In just a few weeks, the major political parties will go through the quadrennial exercise of heading off for their national conventions--the Republicans to Philadelphia, the Democrats to Los Angeles. Of course, there will be a lot of speeches. The networks have decided it is not worth listening to, and they are going to tune us out most of the time. But you will read about it and probably catch some items in the news. You will hear a lot of claims being made. 
   You can count on the message coming out of Philadelphia--the Republican Convention--where they will say: President Clinton had a chance to cut your taxes, and he didn't do it. He vetoed the bills that the Republicans passed in the Congress. 
   A lot of people back home might say: That is a shame because I need a tax cut. 
   But for 98 percent of the American families listening to those shows, guess what, you were not protected or improved in any way by those tax cuts. They go to the top 2 percent of the American people. Those are the ones, the biggest wage earners in America, who will benefit.  
   Of course, at the Democratic Convention, you will hear us talk about issues that this Congress has refused to even consider--the prescription drug benefit, an increase in the minimum wage, and gun safety legislation. Think about that. Of course, if you turn on the television in the morning or pick up a newspaper, you hear of another incident of a child shooting up a school. And you think to yourself: What is America coming to that this can happen, in what is supposed to be one of the safest places in our country, that kids can take guns to school? 
   We were paralyzed a year ago--a little over a year ago now--at the tragedy at Columbine High School in Littleton, CO. To think that 12 kids could be killed, and so many others terrorized by those who would come upon these weapons and take them to school and open fire. 
   Every mother and father, and every schoolteacher and 
   administrator, and many students across America said: What are we going to do to protect ourselves? They turned to Congress because we are representing these people and their families and said: Can you do something? 
   We came up with gun safety legislation. Let me tell you what it proposed. It wouldn't end gun violence in America, but it was an effort to try to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and children. We said: If you are going to buy a gun from a gun dealer in America, we are going to check on who you are. We want to know something about your background. It is the Brady law. We stopped a half a million people from buying guns who should not have bought them because they were too young, they had a criminal history or a history of mental illness. That law has worked. 
   But the same people could have turned around and gone to a gun show at the local armory and bought the same guns without any background check. Those are the guns that we are finding more and more popping up in high schools and schools across America, guns purchased at gun shows, by those who were ineligible or questionable. They turn around and sell them. Kids get their hands on them. So we enacted legislation that said: We will do a background check at gun shows, too, to try to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and children and those who would misuse them. 
   That bill passed. It was a tie vote, 49-49, when Vice President GORE came and cast the tiebreaking vote. That was over a year ago. Nothing has happened to that bill since. It went over to the House of Representatives, and the gun lobby ripped it to shreds. They sent it to a conference committee, where it has been sitting moribund for literally a year, while gun violence continues in America and claims the lives of 12 or 13 of our children every single day. 
   One of the other provisions in that bill came from Senator KOHL of Wisconsin. He said: When you sell a handgun in America, it should have a child safety device or a trigger lock on it so kids can't get their hands on them and hurt themselves or their playmates or their classmates. That was part of the bill that we passed out of here. That was stopped by the gun lobby, as well. 
   When you think about it, many parents who decide not to have a firearm in their homes because they have small children never know, when their son or daughter goes to play next door, what the circumstances might be--whether those same kids are going to be vulnerable to some child finding a gun in a drawer or up on a shelf, play with it, and kill their playmate. You read about it almost every single day. 
   So this commonsense idea that we will have child safety devices or trigger locks on handguns in America was in the bill we sent over to the House. It was stopped cold--stopped dead in its tracks--by the gun lobby. They said: We have just gone too far. It is just too radical a suggestion that we would sell child safety devices with handguns. 
   The third provision was from the Senator from California, Mrs. FEINSTEIN, who said: It is against the law to manufacturer and sell high-capacity ammo clips in the United States, but there is a loophole. You can import them from overseas. And it is pretty simple to do. 
   She put into law the provision that you won't be able to buy high-capacity ammo clips that hold up to 100 cartridges and bullets. You have to ask yourself: What sportsman or hunter needs 100 cartridges or bullets? I believe if you need a high-capacity ammo clip and a semiassault weapon to go and shoot a deer, perhaps you ought to stick to fishing. 
   In many instances in America, the people who are buying these high-capacity ammo clips are turning around and using them for these gang banger activities and drive-by shootings that you read about, sadly, here in Washington, DC, and Chicago and cities across America. 
   That was the third provision in the gun safety bill. That was the third provision that the National Rifle Association said was unacceptable: We cannot restrict the right of American hunters and sportsmen to have high-capacity ammo clips that hold over 100 cartridges. 
   To my way of thinking, common sense requires us to say to people who want to exercise their right to legally and safely use a firearm that they, too, have to face some restriction on their activity. Those who have visited Washington, DC, as tourists may have gone through an airport and through a metal detector. It is an inconvenience we accept because we want to be safe when we get on that airplane. To ask that those who own firearms face similar inconveniences is not unreasonable, unless you happen to be the National Rifle Association. They think it is unreasonable to impose any restrictions whatsoever. 
   As a result, sadly, every morning in America, when you pick up the paper, you see instances where children are being killed, instances where kids are taking guns to school, instances where with some foresight and some political courage, this Congress might have been able to do something. We have not. 
   This has been a do-nothing-for-the-people Congress, as Vice President GORE has said. It has failed to take into consideration what the average working family in this country expects of us, not only to balance the books but to balance our priorities, to make sure the people who prosper because of our judgments and our decisions and our legislative leadership are the families across America. 
   I think also of the uninsured in this country. To think that in this time of prosperity in America, after the longest run of economic progress in the history of the United States, at a time when we are envisioning surpluses that have never been seen in our history, that we still live in a country with 40 million people who are uninsured. I offered an amendment to my friends in the Senate that said we ought to give a tax credit to small businesses to help pay for health insurance for their employees. These are the businesses that pay the highest health insurance premiums to protect the family who owns the business as well as their employees. These are the employees working for small businesses who make the lowest incomes. Not surprisingly, they turn out to be the largest source of uninsured people in this country, those workers and their children. 
   What I propose, as part of our tax package on the Democratic side, is to say to small businesses: We will give you a helping hand. We will give you a tax credit so that you can offer health insurance to your employees. It strikes me as one of the basics we should consider. 
   Just a few years ago, we initiated a nationwide plan to help the States pay for covering the children of working parents with health insurance. It is called the CHIP program. It is working well in my State of Illinois and across the Nation. Congress is trying to plug the holes of 40 million uninsured people in America. 
   We had a hearing the other day that would have broken many hearts. The mothers and fathers of very disabled children came to tell us about their plight. They depend on SSI, a program under Social Security and Medicaid, to provide for kids who are profoundly retarded or disabled. They find, sadly, they earn too much money. We heard from a woman who talked about a situation where her State came to her and said: You can no longer provide for your child with your income; you just don't have enough money. We want you to turn your child over to be a ward of the State. 
   Imagine, in America, in the country in which we live, parents who are struggling to raise disabled children  are told that the only answer is to turn their child over to become a 
   ward of the State. That was what she faced. Her health insurance did not cover her needs. 
   Then there was a sergeant in the Air Force who came to see us with his lovely little 9-year-old daughter, Lauren, who has some serious medical difficulties. This is a man who has given most of his adult life to his country in the Air Force. He was recently given a promotion to E-6, where he would make $200 more a month. With that $200 more a month, he was disqualified from receiving Medicaid and SSI. He said it would cost him over $500 a month to take care of his little daughter. So as he gets a tiny increase in pay of $200 a month, he sees that $500 of medical bills fall on his shoulders. 
   These are people in America without health insurance. These are people who I think about when I think about the surplus that we are experiencing. What are we going to do with this to extend health insurance coverage to more and more Americans so it is no longer a question that parents ask their emancipated kids, as I have asked my daughter, Jennifer: Do you have health insurance now? She is a student who works from time to time, does her very best, but I worry about it as a father. I shouldn't have to. No one should have to in this country. Health insurance ought to be a given in America--not the fanciest and most expensive policy but a basic policy. 
   Is Congress debating that? Is Congress even thinking about it? Is Congress sensitive to it? No. We are debating tax breaks for people making over $300,000 a year. That is our priority. The priority is not the parents of the handicapped children, the children of America who are uninsured, the 40 million uninsured Americans in general. That is where we lost sight of the true reality of the challenges facing American families. 
   The choices on the floor of the Senate are clear, and the choices for the American people in the election will be clear in terms of the values that should be represented when we decide who will benefit from the surplus we have generated and the strong economy of the last 8 years. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, there are 44 million Americans without health insurance. Among uninsured workers, most of them work for small businesses. This amendment creates a tax credit for small businesses which will offer health insurance for their employees. The tax credits especially favor those businesses which have not offered it in the past. I think it is a good investment to help small businesses take care of their No. 1 concern: health insurance for the owners of the business, health insurance for the employees of the small business. 
   I urge my colleagues in the Senate to support this amendment.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this amendment which we offer is one that was debated last night on the floor of the Senate. It is very straightforward. If we are to go forward with a national missile defense system, we should have honest, realistic testing, including testing for countermeasures so we can say to the American people: Your money is being well spent; so we can say to them: If this is a source of security and defense for America, it is one that will work and function. 
   Some have looked at my amendment and said it must be critical of the system because DURBIN has questioned the system in the past. I presented, during the course of the debate last night, a letter from the Director of Testing and Evaluation in the Department of Defense, Mr. Philip Coyle, in which he writes to me and says:   
   This letter is to support your effort to reinforce the need for realistic testing of the National Missile Defense System.  
   It is very clear to the Pentagon, as it is to those who listened to the debate last night, that this is not a friendly amendment nor an amendment that sets out to end the national missile defense system. This is an amendment which asks for the facts and asks for the reality. I hope Senators will support it.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this amendment by Senator SCHUMER, and others, is a test as to whether this Senate is in touch with the reality of life for American families. The Schumer amendment will allow families across America, worried about paying their kids' college education expenses, a tax deduction of $12,000 a year. It will say to those paying off students loans that we will give you a tax credit of up to $1,500 a year on the interest on your student loan, and if you are a teacher who wants to go for extra training to be certified, we will give you a $5,000 tax credit so you can be the very best in the classroom. Families across America understand the Schumer amendment. 
   What they don't understand is the alternative on the Republican side, which says we don't need it, that our highest priority is helping the wealthiest people in America be absolved from paying any kind of estate tax. 
   When we start forming a line to come in the Senate for help, the Republicans put the wealthiest people in America first. The Schumer amendment puts American families first. 
   Watch for this vote.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Indiana for his leadership. I fully support his amendment. 
   For those who are trying to understand what is happening on the floor of the Senate, allow me to give a summary of the game to this point. 
   The Republican leadership has come forward with a basic proposal to eliminate the estate tax. They have suggested that we should take $850 billion over the next 20 years and dedicate it to eliminating the tax liability for 44,000 of the wealthiest Americans in our Nation. They believe that is our highest priority. When they look at our Tax Code, the Republicans have concluded the greatest inequity in America's taxes is the tax paid by less than 2 percent of our population. 
   They have decided that the most deserving group for tax relief in America today are 44,000 of the wealthiest people in our Nation. That is their decision. That is their priority. They have made it clear with every single vote. 
   We have come forward and said we can reform the estate tax so that virtually two-thirds of those currently paying will not have any liability and still have money left to do important things. 
   We said to the Republican side of the aisle: Will you join us in allowing families to deduct college education expenses for their kids as part of it? 
   No, they said, we are not interested. 
   Will you join us in a prescription drug benefit for seniors as part of the relief that we are going to offer in this? 
   No, they are not interested. 
   Will you join us in child care relief so that families can afford to have safe and quality child care? 
   No, they are not interested. Their only interest is in protecting the 44,000 wealthiest people in this country. 
   What Senator BAYH is offering in this amendment is a long-term care tax assistance package which every family with an aging parent can understand, which every family that faces that responsibility will clearly understand. This is family oriented. It will affect literally millions. 
   My portion of this amendment will affect 13 percent of the workforce. It will allow the self-employed businesses across America--those are farmers and small businesses, by and large --to deduct immediately next year their health insurance premiums paid for their employees instead of waiting an additional 2 years.  
   Right now, the big corporations deduct all the expenses for the health insurance of their employees. Self-employed people cannot. When you ask small businesses across America: What is your highest priority? it is not the elimination of the estate tax. The highest priority is the cost of health insurance. And the second highest, I noticed this morning, happens to be education and finding skilled and trained workers. 
   So this amendment addresses not only an inequity in the Tax Code that affects literally millions in America--21 million self-employed people--but it is also going to provide for those truly deserving, so they can afford health insurance.

In the Senator's amendment, there is no reference to any public meeting by this committee. On page 2, line B(3), there is a reference that this advisory committee report will be available for public comment. That is the first use of the word ``public.'' There is no reference to the sunshine committee having any public hearings.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I will be offering an amendment at the close of my remarks. It involves a section of this bill which I believe was authored by Senator DOMENICI of New Mexico. I just spoke to him a minute ago to tell him I will be offering this amendment to strike his section. He said to proceed. He will come to the floor in a few moments, and I am sure he is following this debate in the meantime. 
   First, I thank Senator BYRD and Senator GORTON for their fine work on this Interior appropriations bill. I think I have expressed the feelings of many Members of the Senate that this is a spending bill that is near and dear to our hearts. It involves so many of our Nation's greatest treasures, and the stewardship which they showed on this bill will not only reflect their feelings, but will inure to the benefit of generations to come, if we do it right. 
   This bill is considerably different and, in my estimation, considerably better than the bill in previous years. In the past, there have been the so-called environmental riders that have been added on a variety of different issues. Most of them involved public lands and how they were to be used. 
   I come from the State of Illinois. We have some public land in Illinois. We have a national forest in Illinois. We have part of a National Park System--a very small part. I know that some of my colleagues from the Western States have a much different situation. Many of them represent States where the majority of the land is owned by the Federal Government. I am sure that is an awkward situation, at best. I can't quite imagine all of the ramifications of that policy, of owning that public land and managing it. But I am sure it affects their daily lives and the economy of their States. 
   Having said that, though, I think all of us, whether we live in one of those States with a large portion of publicly owned land or whether we live in some other part of the country, have a vested interest in this debate about the use of the public lands. The reason we have a vested interest is twofold. First, these lands are being managed now by this Presidential administration in a temporary way. Soon there will be another President. It could be President Gore; it could be President Bush. I am not certain what the outcome of the election will be. But the next administration will then be handed the responsibility of managing this public land. 
   Each successive administration, each President, and Congress, for that matter, have a voice in determining how that land is to be managed. And if they do the job right, in my estimation, they will hand off to the next generation succeeding an even better stewardship of this Federal land. I drew from my desk a quote from the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. It is a quote from a former Republican President of the United States by the name of Theodore Roosevelt. For those familiar with the administration of President Theodore Roosevelt, you know he created the first national park and that he had a special interest in conserving and protecting our natural heritage and, particularly, in establishing public lands to protect them for future generations. This short quote summarizes his philosophy and, I might add, my own:  
   We must ask ourselves if we are leaving for future generations an environment that is as good or better than what we found.  
   That is a very simple, straightforward statement. I keep it in my desk here because, quite honestly, when the Interior appropriations bill comes up, that question is being asked of us. Are we going to manage the public lands of America in a way that future generations will look back and say we did a good job and protected that legacy from previous generations? It has been handled and managed well under your stewardship. 
   I think that is the test. It is the test of this appropriations bill, and it is the test of every amendment to that appropriations bill. That is half of the test. The other half of the test goes beyond our obligation to explain to future generations, if we did a good job--it goes to the question as to whether or not we have met our responsibility to God's creation because on these public lands we find a great many species, a lot of different plant life, wild flowers, grasses, which are things that, frankly, depend on our good stewardship. If we don't treat those lands well, we not only stand to disappoint future generations, we stand to destroy our natural legacy. 
   So when we talk about environmental issues, a lot of people like to categorize those as some kind of bureaucratic gobbledygook jargon in Washington. I think it is much more than that. It gets down to those two fundamental questions. At the end of the day, when we are called to judgment for our public service, can we say to future generations that the public lands you entrusted us with are given to you in at least as good a shape as we received them, and maybe better, and that we protected God's creation in a reasonable and thoughtful way during our years of management? That is the underlying debate that we hear on the floor of the Senate when we discuss so-called environmental riders; 
   that is, questions of environmental policy raised in the Interior appropriations bill. 
   Let me address the specific issue before us in the amendment I will offer. The Bureau of Land Management is part of the Department of the Interior. It is entrusted with administering millions of acres of our Nation's valuable and diverse public lands located primarily in 12 Western States, including the State of Alaska. 
   Currently, the BLM manages more Federal lands than any other public agency. BLM oversees some 40 percent of our Nation's Federal lands--roughly 264 million acres of surface land predominantly in the western part of the United States. But acreage alone doesn't tell the story. 
   Our Nation's public lands contain a wealth of natural, cultural, historical, economic, and archaeological resources that belong to everybody. They are, in fact, part of the Treasury of the United States--not in dollar terms, but when you want to measure the assets of this country, you would certainly step back and say: I want to include not only what we find in our Treasury but our Grand Canyon, Yellowstone, Yosemite, and all of the land owned by the people of this country. These are our assets that we have a responsibility to protect and manage. 
   The natural and ecological diversity of the BLM-managed public lands is perhaps the greatest of any Federal agency. BLM manages extensive grasslands and forests, islands, wild rivers, high mountains, arctic tundra, and desert landscapes. As a result of the diversity of habitat, many thousands of wildlife and fish occupy these lands. These fish and wildlife species represent a wealth of recreational, national, and economic opportunities for local communities and States in our Nation. 
   The single most extensive use of public land under the jurisdiction of the BLM is grazing in the lower 48. Of the roughly 179 million acres of public land managed by the Bureau of Land Management outside of Alaska, grazing is allowed on almost 164 million acres out of 179 million, and millions of these acres also contain valuable and sensitive fish, wildlife, archaeological, recreation, or wilderness values. 
   At the present time, the BLM authorizes through the issuance of grazing permits approximately 17,000 livestock operators to graze on these 164 million acres of public land. These permits and public land grazing that they allow are important to thousands of Western livestock operators. Many of these livestock operators and ranchers use these permits to help secure bank  loans to provide important financial resources for their operations. 
   BLM typically issues grazing permits for a 10-year period on public lands. Many current grazing permits were issued in the late 1980s and are now expiring in large numbers over 2- or 3-year periods of time. These permits numbering in the thousands present the BLM with an unusually large and burdensome short-term renewable task. 
   We addressed this very issue in previous Interior appropriations bills. Can the Bureau of Land Management keep up with expiring permits or leases and reissue them in timely fashion so that someone who is using the land, the livestock operations, can continue their business, not lose money, and not face uncertainty when it comes to financing their operations? 
   The unusually large number of expiring grazing permits has created a dual dilemma for the Bureau and for its many public 
   constituents. Western livestock operators who currently hold these expiring permits are worried that delays in the processing by the Bureau may cause them to lose their permits or otherwise threaten their ability to use the permits to secure bank loans for their operations. 
   Conservationists-environmentalists--meanwhile believe that the Bureau has a responsibility to perform responsibly for the governmental and environmental stewardship of these lands and analyze the grazing to make certain that if there is to be a renewal it is done in a reasonable and responsible way. 
   It is entirely understandable to me being from my State that ranchers are concerned about issues of security and predictability. So are my farmers. I understand this. Likewise, we require the BLM to wisely manage and protect our public lands for all Americans. 
   The on-the-ground permit level decisionmaking that should legally accompany the BLM's permit renewal process is fundamentally important to the ecologically sound and multiple-use management of our Nation's public lands. 
   The BLM must conduct what we call a NEPA, which is the National Environmental Policy Act, compliance and land use planning performance review before reauthorizing permits. In other words, before they give the permit back to the livestock operator to go back on public land to use it for grazing, they take a look at public land: How are we doing? Are we doing this in a responsible environmental way so ultimately the land is not so degraded or changed as to lessen its value or to endanger species and wildlife? That is a responsibility of BLM. It is an important one. 
   To meet the review requirements under NEPA and other existing Federal laws and regulations, the BLM uses a lot of different teams composed of agency professionals who look at wildlife, range, wild horse, bureau and cultural, and recreation wilderness activities. The BLM also solicits public comments and relevant information from a wide array of people interested in range management, including hunters, fishermen, and many others. 
   The simple fact is this: On most public land, grazing allotments and all of the important decisions that determine the condition of public rangeland resources are contained in the terms and conditions of the grazing permits and in the annual decision about the amount, timing, and location of livestock grazing. These decisions determine whether streams in the areas will flourish or be degraded and whether wildlife habitat will be maintained or destroyed. Public involvement in this process is essential for balanced public management. Without the application of NEPA and related laws, the American public has no real voice in public rangeland management. 
   Let me at this time give you an illustration. A picture is worth more than a thousand words. Any Senator is good for a thousand words at the drop of a hat. This picture will tell you an interesting story of a NEPA review of grazing on BLM land. 
   Let me drop some of these acronyms and abbreviations and try to speak English so those following the debate will understand. 
   The ecological picture here is one of the Santa Maria River in western Arizona, which has improved dramatically as a result of permit management changes under the environmental policies of the BLM. 
   It is important to note that the BLM continues to allow grazing in the areas you are looking at. However, they change some of the conditions of the grazing. As a result of environmental considerations, the grazing permits on the Santa Maria River in western Arizona now contain terms and conditions requiring livestock to be kept away from the rivers and streams during the spring and summer growing season. 
   The Santa Maria River in western Arizona is a rarity. It is a free-flowing river in the midst of a vast, hot, low-elevation desert. 
   The riparian corridor provides essential habitat for dozens of species of wildlife, including 15 species listed by Federal or State agencies as threatened, endangered, or some other special status. The riparian area of Santa Maria and its ability to support wildlife were severely degraded by many years of uncontrolled and unmanaged livestock grazing in the river corridor. 
   The vegetation was literally stripped away. Water was so polluted that streambanks were trampled and miles of riverbed areas and riparian areas were nearly as barren as the surrounding desert. 
   This is the picture of the overgrazed area around the Santa Maria River in Arizona. There is the ``before'' picture. Let me tell you a little bit about the ``after'' picture, which I will refer to in a second. 
   For decades, the BLM issued new grazing permits to ranchers along the Santa Maria River with no terms and conditions to protect the riparian areas. 
   Even though the BLM developed the land-use plan that required the river to be rested from livestock grazing, that requirement was not included in the permits. In the late 1980s, a portion of the Santa Maria River received an unplanned reprieve from grazing. The rancher who held the permit went bankrupt and had to sell all his cattle. 
   The result of 3 years of rest from grazing can be seen in the second photo. These are roughly the same areas. This one looks like a stripped desert; the second is much different. This is a stream bed from the Santa Maria River, showing the natural vegetation and grass that has grown back in the grazing area. The riparian vegetation has begun to return, the stream banks are rebuilding, and the water is cleaner than in other portions of the river. 
   In the early 1990s, the bankrupt rancher sold out to a new rancher who wanted to restock the river corridor with cattle and start the grazing again in this area. The BLM proposed to transfer the grazing permit to the new rancher with no NEPA analysis; that is, no environmental analysis and no public review. The transferred permit would have had the same terms and conditions and ultimately resulted in the same condition as seen in the before picture. 
   A number of individuals and organizations challenged the BLM decision to renew these permits without a NEPA review and public comment. As a result of the environmental assessment, the grazing permits on the Santa Maria contain terms and conditions requiring that livestock be kept out of the riparian area during the spring and summer growing seasons. There is now a chance for vegetation to recover and water quality and wildlife to be restored. 
   The reason this part of the debate is important is it relates directly to the amendment I will offer. If the amendment offered by the Senator from New Mexico remains in this bill, permit level management changes that I have just described will be much more difficult to obtain. 
   Let me speak for a minute about section 116 of this bill that I would strike. This is the so-called grazing right. Most Members of the Senate have received letters from virtually every major environmental group in Washington, asking them to join in supporting my amendment to strike section 116. Here is the reason. This is the third attempt in an Interior appropriations bill to allow grazing permits to bypass current environmental regulations. Section 116 allows renewal of grazing permits that expire in fiscal year 2001 under the same old terms and conditions in which the permits were first issued. 
   Last year, I offered substitute language to similar offerings by the Senator from New Mexico. My language  would have addressed ranchers' needs for the Bureau to process grazing permits in a timely fashion and in a manner by which ranching operations and financial arrangements would not be needlessly disrupted. 
   My intent last year was to not only protect the environment but to protect the ranchers, as well, to give them certainty as to when the new permits would be issued, and to also say that, where necessary, the Bureau of Land Management could step in and make the environmental changes to protect an area, changes that could avoid this and result more in this type of situation, which I think most of us would agree is better stewardship of the land. 
   However, I am pleased to report that my efforts to hold the BLM and their feet to the fire successfully on their own resulted in change. My amendment didn't succeed. But they went on to work to solve the backlog of expiring permits. 
   The bottom line is this: There is no longer any need whatever for section 116 in this bill. 
   Let me show a chart in reference to the activity of the Bureau of Land Management. The BLM issued 3,872 fully processed grazing permits and leases in fiscal year 1999. In fiscal year 2000, the Bureau of Land Management is scheduled to issue 2,893 fully processed grazing permits and leases; 1,408 have been holdovers from the previous year, but they, too, will be renewed this year. In fiscal year 2001, the Bureau of Land Management will only be faced with 1,646 permits that have expired, and a small carryover of 484 from the previous year, for a total workload of 2,130 permits in the next fiscal year. This number is fully within the capability of the Bureau of Land Management. 
   We will hear from the other side, those supporting this environmental rider--that is opposed by virtually every environmental group in the Nation's Capital--that we have to put this rider in place to renew old permits without review because the ranchers and livestock operators cannot be certain that the BLM will meet its obligation to issue the new permits as the old ones expire. 
   The numbers tell a totally different story: 3,872 permits reviewed and approved by the BLM in 1999; this year, another 2,885; in the year for which we are appropriating, the numbers will be down around the 2,100 range. Clearly, the BLM has the capability to handle many more permit renewals than we envision in the next fiscal year. There is no 
   need for this environmental rider to create exception and to tell the old permit holders they don't have to go through the process. The process is there. It is timely. It will give them the certainty they want about their future. All but 79 of the expiring 2001 permits will be completely processed in 2001. 
   The BLM has decided to carry over the permits because they concern areas near the Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument and in the Bookcliffs allotment. Because of the environmental sensitivity of these areas, the Bureau of Land Management will conduct an environmental impact statement instead of the regular environmental assessment. 
   The question arises, if the BLM will no longer have a backlog of permits, why is there such concern that section 116 be included in this bill? Although that question can be easily reversed, the concern is that section 116 will create incentives for livestock operators to delay renewal of their permits in hopes of avoiding environmental compliance by gaining an automatic renewal of their old permits under the old terms and conditions. 
   Section 116, as presented in this bill, undercuts meaningful opportunities for public involvement in a range management process. Is that important? Remember the picture from the Santa Maria situation; the BLM didn't come up with policies that resulted in the second photo. The lands lying in rest for 3 years, and public comments, led to changes in permits, which means that instead of desert, we are going to have a very beautiful area, an important area for habitat which is not environmentally damaging. 
   Section 116 undercuts that opportunity for public comment because it provides for an automatic renewal of the old permit without going through public comment or environmental review. They have to renew under section 116 the old permits under the same terms and conditions for an indefinite period. It effectively eliminates public input into the stewardship of public lands. 
   The Senators in support of 116 are saying to the people of this country who own these lands all across America: Get out of the way. We don't want you to be part of the process. We don't want you to sit back and determine whether the livestock operator who has been on this land for 10 years has done a good job from an environmental viewpoint. 
   Frankly, that is why we are here. Those in Congress and in the administration who have responsibility for the management of the land have to leave it to future generations in at least as good shape as we received it. If we cannot take an objective appraisal of how a rancher or livestock operator has managed the land, if we cannot decide that perhaps there needs to be a change because the way he is managing the lands is destroying it, then frankly we are running away from our responsibility. 
   Section 116 in this bill, which I strike, does exactly that. It takes the public out of the process. It takes the Government, looking at this from an environmental viewpoint, an ecological viewpoint, out of the process. It says it is an automatic renewal, no questions asked or answered. That is why this section 116 is opposed by a wide array of groups, including the Wilderness Society, the Sierra Club, the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. It is important to note that the League of Conservation Voters views this as a very important vote, as well. 
   Let me address specifically the situation involving the State of New Mexico. The BLM says that New Mexico, which is the home State of the Senator who has offered this, will process and issue all fiscal year 2001 expiring permits, as well as all carryover permits from fiscal year 2000. So if we hear the argument on the floor that this backlog is hurting the State of New Mexico, the home State of the Senator who offered section 116, the facts don't back it up. 
   By September 30 of this year, New Mexico is committed to fully processing and issuing all 379 carryover 1999 permits and leases and 179 of the year 2000 permits, for a total of 558. New Mexico plans to issue 192 fiscal year 2000 permits, using Public Law 106-113. 
   In fiscal year 2001, 221 permits and leases will expire in New Mexico. Like the BLM as a whole, in fiscal year 2001, New Mexico will process and issue all fiscal year 2000 carryover and fiscal year 2001 expiring permits, a total of 413. 
   This environmental rider, this section, was sold to us in years gone by as a necessity because of the backlog of cases on permits. The argument no longer holds. The BLM is fully capable of issuing new permits after the environmental consideration and public comment period, without hardship to the livestock operators and ranchers. 
   Let me address one other aspect of this which I think is very important. The reason why section 116 should be stricken from the bill gets to the heart of the question. Assume for a minute that you have a permit for your cattle to graze on public lands. Assume that the permit is about to expire and you are now in a position where you are having a review by the Bureau of Land Management. They come to a conclusion that the way you have used your permit over the last 10 years has been bad, you have damaged the land, you have damaged the water quality, you have destroyed habitat for wildlife, you may have threatened some species that live in that land. So they want to change, in the next permit process, the way that you, for example, graze your cattle. If you remember the example from the previous photograph, the Santa Maria River, they decided at certain times of the year cattle could not graze near the river, for many of the reasons I just explained. 
   If section 116 goes forward as proposed by the Senator from New Mexico, if there is a dispute between the Bureau of Land Management and the permit owner, all the permit owner needs to do is to appeal the decision by the BLM, and, frankly, he gets to live under the terms of his old permit with no restrictions on when the cattle can graze and no restrictions on activity  that might be damaging to the environment. That is the net effect of section 116, that we allow any bad actors who are destroying the environment on our land, our public land, to continue under the old terms and conditions and not face changes that would be in place. 
   If section 116 were not part of this bill, the Bureau of Land Management could step in with a full force and effect order and say: Even while we are debating and appealing this question, you have to stop grazing your cattle near these streams and rivers in the summer and spring seasons when the area is the most vulnerable. 
   The bottom line is, those who support section 116 think environmental concerns should be removed, take second place to moving forward and renewing the old permits. That is the bottom line. That is what this debate is all about. Those who believe, as I do, that this land belongs to us and future generations, that this land is in fact the habitat for many species and wildlife that need to be protected, believe, I hope, section 116 should be stricken. 
   Aldo Leopold wrote a great book called ``A Sand County Almanac.'' It is one of the classics, legends, when it comes to the West and the environment. This is what he said about the land:  
   Having to squeeze the last drop of utility out of the land has the same desperate finality as having to chop up the furniture to keep warm.  
   I hope Members of the Senate, Democrats and Republicans, will step back and acknowledge the obvious. The BLM can meet its obligation. It can renew these permits. It can do it in an environmentally sound way. It can leave this land in as good shape as we received it and maybe better. It can leave a legacy to future generations, and even future ranchers, of which they can be proud. We do not need to carve out an exception here. We do not need to walk away from our environmental responsibility. We do not need to take the public out of the process of debating the future of public lands. 
   A few minutes ago one of my colleagues from Idaho came to the floor, very critical of the Clinton administration because he said they went through a process on roadless lands in the national forests and they were not public enough. The facts are otherwise. There was room for a lot of public comment. But now we are going to hear those who defend section 116 come forward and say: Take the public out of the process. Automatically renew the permits. Don't make the evaluation. 
   That is shortsighted. That does not meet the standard and test that Teddy Roosevelt and so many others before us established for this Nation. If we do this, we are not managing this land in the best interests of the taxpayers and the best interests of our children and in the best interests of God's creation.

   Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator. Mr. President, if there is no other Senator wishing to speak the first time on  this, I will speak briefly in conclusion. I have spoken to the chairman of the committee. It is my hope that I can ask for the yeas and nays and that we can schedule a final vote on the amendment, as well as on any other pending amendments at a later hour when all Senators reassemble. If that is acceptable, I will speak for a few moments in conclusion.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me say in conclusion on this amendment that I have the highest respect for my friend from New Mexico. I often wonder why each year I decide to take on the chairman of the Budget Committee, and the powerful Appropriations Committee, with usually predictable results on the floor of the Senate. He has, much to my consternation, read last year's rollcall, which is another dagger to my heart on this same issue. 
   Notwithstanding that, I am going to soldier on here because, as the Senator from New Mexico does, there are times when you stand up and fight for something you believe in, even if you may not prevail. I still have the highest regard for him and all of my colleagues on the other side of the issue. I respect the fact that many of them have a much more personal knowledge of ranching and livestock operations than I do. When I think about Senator BURNS of Montana and all of his years as a rancher and auctioneer, he stared more cows in the eye than I will ever be able to. 
   I listened to my friends, Senator THOMAS, Senator CRAIG, and Senator DOMENICI. I can readily see that these are men in the Senate who represent areas with many more ranchers and many more livestock operators with much more personal knowledge on this subject, notwithstanding that I come to the floor not trying to preach to them about ranging practices but trying to ask them to at least respect the process of trying to protect our public lands. 
   The Senator from Idaho--I have heard this argument every year when I introduced this type of amendment--has basically said: Why are you sticking your nose into issues about the West? You live in the Midwest. When it comes to an issue such as O'Hare Airport, we would expect you to stand up and talk about it, being from Illinois. But goodness' sake, why are you talking about grazing in 13 Western States if you are from a Midwestern State? 
   I say to the Senator from Idaho that I think we all bear responsibility, no matter where we are from, for the stewardship of public lands. It isn't only Senators who represent Western States. It is all of us. 
   Frankly, if those lands are left to future generations, each one of us should take an interest in it, whether we live in Florida, or Illinois, or Maine. We all have a responsibility for those public lands--that Public Treasury, those resources that we count on so much. 
   I also say to my friend from Idaho that when we stand here and debate gun safety issues representing large cities where a lot of people are victims of gun violence, he stands up on the floor many times and tells us what he thinks gun policy should be in the city of Chicago. He thinks that is his opportunity and responsibility as a Senator from Idaho. So it works both ways. 
   I think he will concede the fact that, being elected to the Senate, we are not restricted in what we can speak to. We may be restricted in our success about what we speak to. 
   But let me also say that I want to get down to a couple of things that were not mentioned at the outset that should be mentioned. For those livestock operators who choose to graze on public lands, this is worthy of mention. The grazing fees paid by those ranchers and livestock operators are a bargain. They are an absolute bargain. This Congress and a President decided that we will continue to give these ranchers and livestock operators access to land owned by the people of the United States so they can make a living grazing their cattle for fees that are, frankly, a fraction of what they would pay on private land. 
   The Federal grazing fee for 1999 was $1.35 per animal unit month grazed. By contrast, the average grazing lease rate for private land is currently more than $11--almost 9 or 10 times the amount these same livestock operators are paying to graze on the lands owned by the people of the United States. In 1996, the fees charged on State land by Western States ranged from $2.18 to $2.20. There was not a single State that leased its grazing land to local livestock operators at a fee as low as the Federal Government. 
   In addition to the subsidized fees, ranchers with Federal permits enjoy subsidized range improvements. As a result, livestock operators with Federal grazing permits actually have lower production costs and higher profits than livestock ranchers without Federal permits. 
   As we talk about hardship that we may be creating for 
   livestock operators, let us at least concede at the outset that we are giving these permit holders a bargain to make a living. I have not stood here and criticized ranchers and livestock operators, nor would I. In my State of Illinois, we have livestock products and a lot of farmers. I respect the men and women involved in my State, as I do in any other State. Nor am I bringing this issue before the Senate to try to put any ranchers out of business. 
   There is one fundamental flaw in the argument on the other side. It is the suggestion that if you had a 10-year permit that expired, that the Bureau of Land Management would cut you off and not give you the right to continue to graze land while they are going through the reissuing of the permit process. 
   I don't know of a single case where that has happened. The BLM goes out of its way to continue the grazing rights of these livestock operators, even while they are debating the terms of the new permit. 
   The suggestion has been just the opposite--that they somehow want to get the ranchers off the land. The only time I have read about that is in a situation where they have a rancher or a livestock operator using Federal land in a way they think is harmful to the environment. I think that is reasonable because BLM has a responsibility to protect those public lands from environmental damage. 
   Let me also address one other thing. The Senator from Montana got up and said there are people managing Yosemite and Yellowstone. There is buffalo and wildlife there, and many of them can destroy land just like any other livestock. I bet that is true. I don't question that it is true. He also went on to say that he thought when it came to range management that we should basically leave it up to the livestock operators to decide what is good for the land. I think that was his conclusion. I think this is a fair summary of his conclusion. I guess in some instance that would be true. 
   In my home State of Illinois, there are farmers who are responsible environmentalists. They think twice before they apply chemicals. They think about the right thing to do to avoid the loss of good topsoil, and about siltation going into the streams that run into the water supplies of surrounding towns. My hat is off to them. I usually spend Earth Day with farmers because I respect a lot of them. They take this  very seriously. I will tell you that conversely there are some I wouldn't put in that category. There are good and bad. 
   But let me tell you what the BLM has to say about the acreage that is being grazed by livestock now under their control. They estimate that only about a third of a total 160 million acres grazed by livestock are in good or excellent ecological condition--one-third. Worse yet, even a higher percentage--almost 70 percent of riparian areas, streams, and rivers and their associated fish and wildlife habitat--are in a damaged condition: A third in good condition; 70 percent near streams in bad condition. The General Accounting Office attributes the vast majority of these resource deficiencies to abusive and excessive grazing practices. 
   When I come before you and show this photo, they say this isn't the real world. But the statistics suggest that overwhelmingly this is the real world. This is a grazing situation where, unfortunately, someone put cattle on this land, and they grazed it down until it looked like a desert. For 3 years after bankruptcy, the land had a chance to recover in the 
   Santa Maria River area of western Arizona. This is what we have to show for it. 
   What I am suggesting is that the statistics and the studies do not back up the statements on the floor which suggest that this land is being managed so well. There is a need for the BLM. There is a need for the environmentalists. There is a need for public comment. 
   That is what I think needs to be protected. That is what section 116 would deny us. Frankly, that is what this debate is all about. 
   It has been the suggestion of my friend from New Mexico--not a suggestion but his notation of the rules of the Senate--that when the time comes for a vote that I am required by the rules of the Senate to remove this photo from the floor. So my colleagues who have not been here for this debate cannot come in and see exhibit No. 1, in my case, for the passage of my amendment. I can understand it. I know why the Senator from New Mexico doesn't want my colleagues to look at this photo. This tells the story as to what section 116 is all about. 
   I made it a point--because I have such high respect for the chairman from New Mexico--to ask those who are well versed in the rules of the Senate. Once again, the chairman from New Mexico is right. I have to remove this photo under the Senate rules. I will probably appeal that to the Supreme Court at some later time. But, for today, I am going to, obviously, follow the rules of the Senate. 
   But it is of interest to me that the Senator from New Mexico doesn't want our colleagues to see this photograph. I hope they are watching it as we broadcast this debate on the Senate floor. It tells the story. 
   This is the bottom line. The BLM is going to process these applications. They are going to get them done on time. There is no need for this amendment. They are going to take a look. In the rare case where they find a livestock operator who is misusing Federal lands that he is getting for a bargain price--where he is misusing land, destroying the ecology, endangering species, and destroying riverbeds and riparian areas--they are going to make him sign a change. If the Senator from New Mexico prevails, they will lose the authority to do that. They will have to renew the permit under the old conditions. 
   That is my objection to it. That is why I think it should be stricken. 
   I sincerely hope we have a better outcome on the vote. If my colleagues have followed the debate and have had a chance to see this photo, which concerns my colleague so much, I am hoping they will support me in my motion to strike section 116. 
   I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, what we are going to discuss this evening is one of the most expensive, and perhaps one of the most important, elements in our Nation's national defense. We are going to discuss the national missile defense system. 
   The reason for its importance, I guess, could be summarized in several ways. First, it is an extraordinary expenditure of money. It is anticipated that if we are going to meet our first goal by 2005, we will spend up to $60 billion. That is an exceptional expenditure, even by Federal standards, even by the standards of the Department of Defense. 
   Second, those who support this system are telling us that our goal is to basically protect America from attack by rogue missiles, by those enemies of the United States who might launch a missile at us and threaten our cities and population. So the importance of the system we are talking about cannot be overstated. 
   Third, we know that if we go forward with this, we run the risk of complicating our negotiations with other countries in the world--particularly Russia and China--about the reduction in their nuclear arsenals. So this is high-stakes poker. We are talking about a decision, in terms of our national defense, which may be one of the most important in history. 
   I have a very straightforward amendment that will require that the national missile defense system test realistic countermeasures before becoming operational, and that an independent review panel--the Welch panel--assess the testing program in light of these countermeasure problems. The President is slated to decide soon whether to deploy a national missile defense system. This bill we are debating authorizes spending almost $5 billion in the next fiscal year for this program. 
   The Congressional Budget Office has estimated the contemplated national missile defense total cost at $60 billion, when all components are considered. Whether one thinks that deciding to deploy a national missile defense system at this moment is a good idea or not, I hope we can all agree that once that system becomes operational, it should work. If we are going to spend $60 billion, we ought to have a high level of confidence that it will in fact protect us from rogue states firing a missile. If the fate of America will truly hang in the balance, we owe this Nation and every family and every mother, father, and child our very best effort in building a credible, effective deterrence. 
   Such a high level of confidence is not possible until this system is tested against likely responses from emerging missile states, known as countermeasures or decoys. If the missile system cannot discriminate between warheads and decoys, it is, as a practical matter, useless because enemies will simply be able to overwhelm it with cheap decoys. 
   At this point, I will yield time to my colleagues who have gathered here to be part of this debate. At the end of their statements, I will reclaim my time and conclude.

   Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I yield myself no more than 3 minutes to make one point. 
   Let me say, first to the chairman of the committee, who has been kind enough to stay here this evening for this important debate, that I think the level of exchange and dialog here this evening is an indication of the knowledge on the subject of the Members who have stayed and the level of their interest. I hope it adds to the national debate. 
   I also say to the chairman of the committee, I believe all of us in this Chamber share mutual respect for our current Secretary of Defense. I think he is doing an excellent job. Nothing that any of us have said or will say should bring into question our admiration and respect for his ability and his service to our country. 
   I also tell my colleagues, I had the good fortune, in preparing for the debate, to go through a classified briefing and also to meet with Director Philip Coyle, who is in charge of Operational Test and Evaluation at the Department of Defense under the leadership of Secretary Cohen. 
   I asked him to put in common terms, that I can take back to 
   a town meeting in Illinois, what we are talking about when we use the words ``technologically feasible.'' 
   He said: Well, consider it this way. Is it technologically feasible to hit a hole in one in golf? Yes. Is it technologically feasible to hit a hole in one if the hole you are shooting at is moving? Yes, but it is getting a little more difficult. Is it technologically feasible to hit a hole in one if the hole you are shooting at is moving, as is the flag in that hole, and five or six other flags are moving as well, and you are not sure which one is actually the hole you are shooting at? Yes, I suppose that is technologically feasible, but now it is getting to be very difficult. 
   But it raises the very question of this debate about countermeasures. 
   I would like to quote and make part of this RECORD a letter that was sent to me on July 11 by Philip Coyle, director of the Office of Operational Test and Evaluation, in which he said:  
   This letter is to support your effort to reinforce the need for realistic testing of the National Missile Defense (NMD) system. It is still very early in the developmental testing of NMD. As we move forward, test realism will need to grow with system capability, and it will become more and more important to achieve realistic operational conditions in NMD system tests. This will include realistic countermeasures and engagement conditions. 
   The very nature of missile defense means that it will not be possible to demonstrate all possible engagements in open air flight intercept tests. Accordingly, it will be necessary to develop realistic ground test simulations including realistic hardware-in-the-loop and scene generation facilities. I especially appreciate your commitment to both ground based and open air flight tests. 
   If I can provide additional information, please don't hesitate to call me.  
   I say to the chairman of the committee, it is true that we are giving a directive to the Department of Defense and it is also true that the gentleman in charge of the testing under this program has said to us he believes it is an honest effort to make certain the system works.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, why do we test? We test so we can justify the taxpayers of America the expenditure of their hard-earned money in the defense of our country, to make certain that the expenditure is made in a way that we can stand and be proud of it. 
   Secondly, we test to make sure that whatever we are building in the defense of this country will work. That is all this amendment is about. It is to make certain if the national missile defense is to go forward and to provide assurance to American families not only now but for years to come, it is because we have a missile defense system that will work. 
   We have heard from a variety of different experts that the question of countermeasures is a critically important question. In the language of this amendment, we are asking the Secretary of Defense to come forward and give us guidance as to what the state of countermeasures might be in the world and to judge whether or not our missile defense system can deal with those countermeasures and whether we are testing to make certain that that happens. That is the bottom line. 
   The response from the Senator from Virginia, and virtually every Senator who has spoken, is the understanding that what we are asking for in this amendment is reasonably calculated to ensure that any missile defense system, in fact, gives us a real sense of security and not a false sense of security. 
   This amendment is not intended to derail the national missile defense system. It is intended to make certain that the system, if America comes to rely on it for national defense, actually works. 
   In years gone by, when we hurried along the testing process, we have had some sorry results. The B-1 bomber went into production in the late 1970s and wasn't fully integrated into flying units for 24 years. There were major problems with avionics, the engines,  and the defensive stealth configuration that costs literally hundreds of millions of dollars. Adequate testing did not take place before money was spent on a system that was not capable of meeting the need of our national defense. Let us not allow that to happen when it comes to something as critical as our national missile defense system. 
   I thank the Senator from Virginia for his patience this evening. I hope he believes, as I do, that this valuable debate will not only help the Senate but the country on this very important issue in a much more complete fashion. I thank the Senator.

   Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator for raising the point that they were going to pass a $750 billion tax break for the wealthiest people in America, those who pay estate taxes, and do it without one minute of committee hearings--I see the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee on the floor--not a minute of hearing. This was going to be done without any discussion, any debate, $750 billion in tax breaks. 
   I ask my colleague, the Senator from North Dakota, whether or not he believes it also says something about the priorities of the Congress, that of all the different people who could be helped by this Congress, the highest, the single most important priority for the Republicans turns out to be the wealthiest. When it comes to helping people pay for their prescription drugs, when it comes to helping people, dealing with areas such as difficulties with HMOs, folks don't even have a voice in this debate. They are not even being considered. 
   Would the Senator address the whole question of prioritization, as to whether or not we are making the right decision in terms of helping the people who really need it the most in this country?

   Mr. DURBIN. The Senator made reference to an alternative to the Republican proposal to eliminate the estate tax. I am reading from this alternative. I would like to have the comment of the Senator from North Dakota. The Democratic alternative to change the estate tax would increase the exemption from $1.3 million per couple to $2 million per couple by 2002, and to $4 million per couple by 2010; meaning, if your estate is at $4 million, in the year 2010 you would not pay a single penny in estate taxes. This would eliminate the tax on two-thirds of the estates currently subject to tax every year. 
   The Democratic alternative would also increase the family-owned business exemption from $2.6 million per couple to twice that, of a general exemption, to $4 million per couple by 2002 and $8 million per couple by 2010. This would remove almost all family-owned farms and 75 percent of family-owned businesses from the estate tax rolls. 
   So the Democratic alternative eliminates two-thirds of the families paying estate taxes in America, 75 percent of the family-owned businesses, and virtually all of the family farms under the Democratic alternative, for a fraction of the cost of the Republican approach. 
   I think the Senator from North Dakota has made it clear that the people who are left at that point paying the estate tax, under the Democratic approach, would include, if I have not mistaken his comment, the Forbes top 400 wealthiest people in America. They would still be paying the estate tax. 
   I would like to ask the Senator from North Dakota if I am not mistaken. Did he not say that the Republican approach, as opposed to the Democratic approach, would mean for the top 400 wealthiest people in America, the Republican tax break would be $250 billion? Was that the comment made by the Senator from North Dakota? It would be a $250 billion tax break for 400 people in America? That is the Republican priority that they want to bring to the floor, and not consider everything else the Senator from North Dakota has raised?

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, for those who are following the Senate proceedings, they are probably aware of the fact that we are involved in something called a motion to proceed, which is basically an introduction or a leadup to a debate on an issue. 
   We are proceeding to an issue on the question of the estate tax. The estate tax has been around, I think, since President Theodore Roosevelt in the last century. It is a source of revenue for the Federal Government that is imposed on the estates of some people after they pass away. 
   It is the position of the Republican majority that when you come to reforming the Tax Code of America, the first and highest priority is to deal with the estate tax. The basis for that statement on my part is the fact that it is the first matter of any consequence in terms of its cost that is being brought to the floor of the Senate by the Republican leadership. 
   So they believe, looking at the Tax Code--that affects literally every American, every individual, every family, every business--and searching out an inequity in it, that the estate tax is the source of an inequity, an unfairness, and it should be the first thing that we address if we are going to reform the Tax Code. 
   That is an interesting observation because when you consider how many Americans are affected by the estate tax, it turns out that they are literally very few in number. 
   In 1997, the estates of fewer than 43,000 people in America had to pay any Federal estate tax. That is 43,000 people out of 2.3 million who passed away in that year. So less than 2 percent--1.9 percent--of the estates of those passing away in the year 1997 had any obligation to pay the Federal estate tax--43,000 people. 
   What the Republicans have suggested as a way to eliminate this estate tax is to take money out of our anticipated surplus in the budget to make sure that those 43,000 in the future will not have to pay any estate tax. 
   What does this cost us out of the surplus? In the first 10 years or so, the estimates are somewhere in the $100-$150 billion range. But in the next 10-year period of time, it grows dramatically, and the cost of this tax relief for literally 1.9 percent of the people who die in a given year is some $750 billion.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I was happy to yield to the majority leader to clarify the procedure. 
   Back to the point I was making. We are dealing with an estate tax that affects very few Americans--people in higher income categories. The decision has been made by the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives and the Senate that if we are going to change the Tax Code as it affects any American, any individual, any family, any business, the first and highest--obviously one of the most expensive--priority is to eliminate this estate tax. 
   I find that curious because I think if you went to the American people and said to them: When it comes to the taxes that you are likely to pay in your life and those that you believe are particularly unfair, would you believe that the estate tax ranks high on that list? It is not likely they would. They may object to taxes in general. They may object to this tax in particular. But the likelihood that the average American, even one who has done pretty well in life, is going to end up paying the Federal estate tax is minimal. Less than 2 percent of those who die each year pay the tax. If a spouse dies and leaves all the property to another spouse, there is no taxable event--no Federal estate tax is paid. 
   When you consider the fact that 98 out of every 100 people who die each year face no Federal estate tax, the obvious question is, Why is this the highest priority when it comes to the Republican agenda for tax reform? Wouldn't you think it would be a tax that would help out a lot more people than, say, 43,000 in 1997, some of the wealthiest people in our country? Wouldn't you think it might be a tax that affects the payroll tax that hundreds of thousands of workers pay each week? Or taxes that businesses pay? Or changing our Tax Code so a businessman can offer health insurance to his employee, for example? No, it is not. It turns out, when they drew up their list of priorities, the Republican leadership came to the conclusion that the most important group to single out for assistance would be the wealthiest among us, with this estate tax. 
   I might tell you, this is not a cheap, inexpensive undertaking. To think we are going to spend some $750 billion for this estate tax reform that is being asked for by the Republican side means, frankly, that money will not be there to be spent for other purposes, which is the reason I am on the floor tonight to discuss this estate tax in the context of choices that are to be made, decisions that are to be made. When the Republicans drew up the line of Americans who needed help the most, they put in the front of the line, in the first place in the line, the wealthiest in our country. That is not new. That is what George W. Bush has proposed when it comes to tax cuts: First help the wealthiest. When it comes to their agenda on the floor of the Senate, the Republican leadership has said: Before you do anything else, help the wealthiest people in our society. 
   Frankly, I come to this argument with a different perspective. I believe our obligation is to the entire Nation, not only to those who are financially articulate; those who are the largest contributors; those who have made the most of their lives by making the most of their income. It appears that I see this somewhat differently than those who are on the Republican side of the aisle. 
   Let me concede at the outset that the estate tax should be 
   changed. The estate tax, as it is currently written, has not kept pace with reality. We have not increased the exemption under that estate tax as we should have, and we on the Democratic side are going to propose, as part of a reform of the estate tax, something I think will be of great assistance to the vast majority of families who are barely qualifying to pay an estate tax. 
   This is what we are going to propose on the Democratic side. We are going to increase the general exemption from  $1.35 million per couple to $2 million per couple by 2002, and $4 million by 2010. That means that by 2010, if your estate is worth $4 million, you will not pay a penny in Federal estate tax. How many people will be eliminated from Federal estate tax liability because of the Democratic proposal? Two-thirds of the estates currently subject to tax would not be subject. So we are really taking those who are on the lower end of liability and removing that liability. 
   We go a step further because there is a legitimate concern in Illinois and around the country that many family farms, for example, cannot be passed on by a surviving spouse to the children; family businesses, small businesses that have been created cannot be passed on to children to carry on. I am sensitive to that. I have met a lot of farmers and a lot of businesspeople who have said: This is something we built our lives around, our family built their lives around. Then when we die, the value of the business is such we could not leave it to our kids. 
   I think we have to find a way to deal with it. The Democratic alternative does. Let me tell you how. We increase the family-owned business exemption from $2.6 million per couple to twice that of the general exemption of $4 million per couple by 2002; $8 million by 2010. The net result of it is this: This will remove virtually all family-owned farms from liability under the estate tax and 75 percent of family-owned businesses from the estate tax rolls. 
   I think this is a realistic and honest reform of the estate tax. I can go back to my home State of Illinois and say, for individuals as well as family farms and small businesses, we heard their pleas for assistance and relief and we responded in a way that I can defend. The cost of our approach, over a 20-year period, is some $300 billion. The cost of the Republican approach is $750 billion because, you see, they go all the way. They take the tax off virtually everyone. So if people have been so fortunate, living in this country, prospering in this country, to die with estates that are worth billions of dollars, then, frankly, the Republicans say they should not owe this country a nickel; at this point we are going to take the tax off of them; we are going to give them a tax break. 
   Let me show some charts to illustrate this tax and its impact. This is estates subject to the current estate tax--97 percent of the current nonfarm, non-small business estates pay no estate tax; 3 percent of small businesses and family farms might face some liability. So it is a tax, as I indicated earlier, that affects very few. 
   Look at this, too, in terms of the share of the estate tax burden. The bottom 98 percent of people who pass away in this country pay zero in Federal estate tax. The top one-tenth of the wealthiest 1 percent of estates in America pay 50 percent. We are talking about the highest rollers in America, the people who have done the best, who would end up paying over 50 percent 
   of the income that comes to this country from estate taxes. Those are the people the Republicans say should be first in line when we talk about tax relief. 
   I see it a different way. Let me tell you some of the things we might consider doing instead of providing this kind of tax relief to people who are in such high-income categories. 
   We could take the difference between the Democratic and Republican plan, some $450 billion over 20 years, and pay down our publicly held national debt. I think that is of value to everybody in this country, rich and poor alike, families, individuals, businesses--big business and small business. Why? As the Government borrows money to pay down its debt, it is money taken out of the system that could have been used for the creation of businesses and capital creation. As the Government borrows money, it competes for available funds in the marketplace and raises interest rates. As we pay down our national debt, we reduce the burden of taxpayers to service that debt and, frankly, give to our children the very best legacy. We do not leave them the mortgage that we incurred for our debts during our lifetime. 
   Many of us believe that is a more responsible thing to do than to give a tax break under the estate tax to the wealthiest people in this country. The Republicans disagree. They say the highest priority is not bringing down our national debt; the highest priority tax relief is for people who are literally making millions of dollars a year. 
   Let me give an example. The Republican estate tax bill gives the Forbes magazine's 400 richest Americans, read this now, a $250 billion windfall tax break. Money that could have been spent to reduce our national debt, to say to future generations we are going to take that burden off your shoulders--instead is being given to literally the wealthiest people in America. 
   That is the idea of tax justice being propounded on the Republican side of the aisle. I don't think it works. I don't think it is consistent with the values and ethics of most American families. 
   There are other things that can be done and may not be accomplished because of this Republican strategy to eliminate the estate tax in its entirety. Let me address one that is so very important to so many people. It is the prescription drug benefit under Medicare. When the Medicare program was created in the 1960s, President Lyndon Johnson did something which literally changed America. He decided, with the help of the Democratic Congress, that we would create a health insurance plan for the elderly and disabled in America. 
   At that point in time, they were on their own. If they had the resources to pay for health insurance, or they were wealthy enough not to care, they were taken care of. But the vast majority of people going into retirement were really vulnerable. They no longer had a paycheck--maybe a Social Security check, but they had little else to turn to. When they faced a huge hospital bill or a doctor bill, they were on their own. So we created Medicare. 
   As good as Medicare has been--and it is a proven success because seniors are living longer--it didn't include prescription drugs. You know what that means today? When you go to a doctor and say, ``I don't feel well,'' the doctor says, ``Let me write out a prescription. Take the pills and see if it helps.'' So you go to the drug store and get the medicine. Maybe it will help, and in most cases it does. But the cost of those drugs continues to increase. A lot of seniors on fixed incomes can't afford to pay for the prescription drugs. 
   I have had hearings in the State of Illinois, and people have told stories that are sad but true, where they have had to make hard choices. There were seniors who were literally deciding whether or not to fill their prescriptions or to fill their grocery orders; seniors who would go into a supermarket and go to the pharmacy first to decide whether or not they could afford their medicine before they shopped for food; seniors who didn't fill prescriptions because they couldn't afford it, or they may take half a pill instead of what they were supposed to take because they couldn't afford to pay for the full prescription. That is a reality of life in America today. 
   When the Republicans say our highest priority has to be the elimination of an estate tax, which means a $250 billion windfall tax break to the 400 richest Americans, I think they have it all wrong. I think our highest priority should be a prescription drug benefit. After we have paid down this national debt, we should take a portion of it and put it in a prescription drug benefit under Medicare. That will help more people. It is certainly going to improve the quality of their lives. 
   If I had to list my highest priority after paying down the national debt, it would be to help with the prescription drug benefit. Now, the Republicans in the House proposed their own version of a prescription drug benefit. It is clearly something supported by the drug companies and pharmaceutical industry because it would allow them to continue to charge their high prices. What it would say is that basically they would subsidize people buying insurance to pay for their prescription drugs. But when you take a close look at it, it falls apart. 
   First off, the insurance industry doesn't offer that kind 
   of prescription drug insurance by itself. If they do, it is extremely expensive. The reason they don't offer it is something called ``adverse selection.'' If you happen to be very ill and need prescription drugs, you would go and try to buy such a policy. Of course, insurance works when people who are buying the insurance include not only those who need a payout immediately, but those who are going to pay premiums regularly until  they do. Well, for that reason, the insurance industry already has said the Republican plan is not likely to ever result in any help to any senior citizens. 
   Plus, there are a lot of people who have misgivings about turning over prescription drugs and their future to insurance companies. They can recall what many of these same insurance companies did when it came to HMOs and managed care. They forgot about the patient and even forgot about the doctor. We had insurance clerks making decisions on health care. Frankly, the losers ended up being patients and their families. 
   I recall going to a hospital in Springfield, IL, and doing rounds with a local doctor. He made a decision that a woman should stay in the hospital over the weekend before important and delicate brain surgery on Monday. He had to call the insurance company in Nebraska and ask for permission for her to stay in the hospital. The insurance company clerk said: No, send her home. The surgery is not until Monday. 
   He said: She is elderly and frail, and she loses her balance; I don't want her to hurt herself, and I want her here Monday for this important surgery. 
   The insurance clerk was overruling the doctor. The doctor hung up the phone and said: Leave her in the hospital and I will appeal this later on. 
   That is the kind of insurance company situation the Republicans want to turn to when it comes to prescription drugs. They want these same insurance companies to decide whether or not you get your prescription drugs filled. Well, we have seen what they have done with managed care and with HMOs. It is no wonder that a lot of Americans are skeptical about the Republican approach to this. They would much rather see a plan for prescription drugs under Medicare, one that is universal and covers everybody. Medicare currently covers everybody. I also recall that in the last couple years some 1.3 million seniors have seen their Medicare HMO plans canceled by the insurance companies. So they are high and dry and are looking for insurance coverage. 
   When the Republicans say we can trust the insurance companies when it comes to prescription drugs and health care, human experience tells us otherwise. These companies make decisions based on the bottom line profit. These companies will cut off people in terms of their coverage when they no longer think they are turning a profit, and they will leave the people high and dry. 
   The other thing that is fundamentally flawed in the Republican approach on prescription drug benefits is they don't even address the question of pricing. You can create a prescription drug benefit that looks beautiful on paper. It will be easy to sit down with any number of Americans and come to that conclusion. But if you don't address the increasing cost of prescription drugs, it is a guarantee that that benefit and that program will fail. The Republicans do not even address that. 
   If we bring this program under Medicare, as the Democrats 
   have suggested, we will have bargaining power. What is that worth when it comes to prescription drug benefits? You have heard stories, as I have, about people who go to Canada and buy the same drugs for a fraction of the cost in the United States. They are exactly the same drugs, made in the U.S., approved by the Federal Government, sent to Canada, where they charge a fraction of the cost. Why is this? It is because of the bargaining power of the Canadian Government. They sit down with the drug companies and they say: We are not going to agree to a price increase every month or to the prices going through the roof. If you want your drugs as part of our health care system in Canada, you will keep the prices under control. 
   Do you know what. The same drug companies--American drug companies--do just that. They keep prices under control in Canada, but they charge Americans skyrocketing drug prices. 
   The Republican plan on prescription drug benefits doesn't even address this. If you don't address the pricing of drugs, frankly, you are offering no benefit whatsoever--no prescription drug benefits. Do Americans want it? You bet they do, in overwhelming numbers. That is a high priority. But to take a look at this, the highest priority for the Republican leadership in the Senate is not prescription drug benefits for the elderly and disabled; it is the elimination of the estate tax, which gives the Forbes magazine 400 richest American families a $250 billion windfall tax break. 
   Which would help America more? Prescription drug benefits so seniors can remain independent and strong and healthy for a longer period of time or a windfall tax break to the wealthiest people in this country? I think the answer is obvious. But it really betrays the statement from the Republican side that they are in tune with the American people when they would come up with an estate tax change of such magnitude and which is so generous to the wealthiest among us, when the American people are looking for something much different from this Congress. 
   We want to make sure the drug benefit is available to everybody. We want to make sure you have your choice, that your doctor will be able to prescribe the necessary drugs for you and that they will be filled. We want to make sure that it is done under Medicare. 
   We think the effort of the Republicans to take this out of Medicare may be the beginning effort to basically tear down Medicare. This has never been a program the Republicans have cheered over. When we want to try to protect Medicare, it is usually a lonely voice on the Senate floor. They have not been willing to come forward. They understand it was a creation of Democratic leadership, and I guess they are not listening to their seniors and disabled at home who understand the critical importance of this program. 
   There are other things we can be doing in terms of the Tax Code that would help real people and families. One of them is the full deductibility of health insurance. The fact that self-employed people in this country cannot fully deduct their health insurance premiums is what I consider one of the major injustices in the Tax Code. If you start a small business and you want to provide health insurance for yourself, your family, or for some of your employees, you might find yourself in a position where you cannot deduct the full cost of the health insurance premiums from your taxes. Large corporations can; small businesses can't. Big corporations can do it; family farmers cannot. 
   That doesn't make any sense. It is unjust. It is a loophole in the Tax Code which should be changed to protect the small businessman and to protect the family farmer and the people who work for them. 
   If I draw up a list of priorities when it comes to tax reform, I don't start off with the 400 richest Americans and give them a $250 billion windfall tax break. Instead, I deal with real families, real businesses, and real people who are trying to find health insurance to cover members of their family. 
   I also think we should be considering a tax credit for small businesses that offer health insurance to their employees. We know in America that there are some 4 million people who have no health insurance whatsoever. I think that is a scandal. Frankly, in a nation as prosperous as we are and at a time when we are talking about literally trillion-dollar surpluses, it is incredible to me that we don't have the political will on a bipartisan basis to start talking about health insurance coverage for all sorts of American families and businesses. But we haven't done it. Instead, we hear from the Republican side of the aisle that before we talk about health insurance, before we start talking about tax credits to businesses, before we start talking about prescription drugs, let's take care of the richest people in America. That is their highest priority. That is the group they put on the front of the line. We see it differently on the Democratic side. We believe there are things we can do to improve the quality of life of many people. 
   Let me also tell you about another proposal on which I prepared legislation. It is called caregivers insurance. We have a plan now for children across America. Many of the States are implementing it. If children don't have health insurance, we help States pay for that health insurance. That is a good plan. I voted for it. I supported it. I think we should extend it to the next  phase--to what I call caregivers insurance. When I make reference to caregivers, I am talking about people who work in day-care centers, those who are literally in charge of our children and grandchildren every single day. The people who work for a minimum wage, or slightly more, have no benefits. There is massive turnover in their jobs. I think we ought to be talking about extending health insurance for those caregivers in day-care centers, those who work in personal attendance of the disabled, home health care workers who take care of people so they can stay home and not have to go to nursing homes, and for those working in convalescent nursing homes. 
   Those are caregivers who have very little benefits. Yet we trust them with our parents, with our grandparents, with our children, and grandchildren. 
   I think that is the kind of thing many American people would like to see. It will help them pay for child care. It won't raise the cost. We will provide the health insurance through a program of our own at the Federal level. I would like to vote on it. I think it would be well received. I might not get that chance because the vote we will face in the next few days is whether or not, instead of helping caregivers who get up and go to work every day and take care of our kids and parents, we are going to give to the 400 richest Americans a $250 billion windfall tax break with the Republican proposal to eliminate the estate tax.

   Mr. DURBIN. I think the Senator hit the nail on the head. What the Republicans are prepared to do is spend our surplus by providing tax breaks for the wealthy people in this country. The Senator and I happen to see it differently. We believe we can reform the estate tax and basically protect small businesses, family farms, and estates of people leaving $8 million, and still have money left for valid programs in this country. It will help a lot of working families and family farmers.

   Mr. DURBIN. As I mentioned earlier, the issue before the Senate is the Republican proposal to abolish the estate tax. This is a tax which is paid by less than 2 percent of the people who die in America. Those who pay it are in the very highest income categories. When the Republican leadership put together its list of priorities of the most important things to be done under the Tax Code, they said the first and most important thing to do, and one of the most expensive things we can do, is to relieve the wealthiest people in America from paying an estate tax. That, to me, raises a question of priorities. 
   Who will be first in line on the Republican side of the aisle to benefit from this congressional action? According to the Republican leaders, the first in line will be the people who are first in line in the world--the wealthiest in this country, the wealthiest who will benefit from the elimination of this estate tax. 
   The New York Times editorial on June 11 of this year summarizes the impact of this Republican proposal:  
   Seldom have so many voted for a gargantuan tax cut for so few. Abolishing the estate tax would have severe consequences. When fully phased in, the bill would cost about $50 billion a year. Repeal would also threaten the Nation's finest universities and museums. Wealthy families no longer facing estate tax cuts might well decide to leave more money to their families, and less to charity. 
   The Democrats offered a more than reasonable alternative. Yet the House swatted the alternative aside, demonstrating that a large majority of Members were less concerned with rescuing family farms and businesses than with enriching their wealthiest supporters.  
   Another editorial worth making part of the RECORD is from USA Today on June 9:  
   But behind the caterwauling about the ``death tax'' the truth is quite different. Most people will never be affected by inheritance taxes: 98 percent of all estates aren't big enough to be liable. Even among the elite 2 percent, very few are farmers and small businesses. But there are better ways to spend $50 billion a year than handing it to the heirs of the wealthiest people in the country. Take your pick: Middle class tax cuts, improved health benefits for seniors or paying down the national debt for starters.  
   That is what this is about. 
   The question we have to ask ourselves, Whose side are we on? Are we on the side of the wealthiest people in this country in terms of helping them out or will we be on the side of businesses, family farms, and families who are struggling to get by? 
   Another topic we are debating that relates to this debate on the estate tax is something called an H-1B visa.

   Mr. DURBIN. The H-1B visa is a request by many people in private industry to increase the number of those who can come into the United States by the tens of thousands to fill well-paying, highly skilled jobs. The argument of these businesses is that they can't find workers in America with the skills necessary. We find these arguments coming out of Silicon Valley and similar high-tech areas. They just cannot find skilled American workers to fill the jobs. They ask us to change the law and allow immigrants to come from other countries to fill these jobs. They have a legitimate concern. 
   Many Members believe we should do something to help them. If the alternative to bringing in people working in this country is shipping the jobs overseas, that certainly doesn't do our economy any good. Isn't it interesting that we are considering the shortages in skilled workers and allowing immigrants to come in to fill these jobs, instead of discussing as part of a program a way to improve education and training in America so we have these skilled workers? 
   If we are going to improve that education and training, it will cost money. Instead of putting the money into education to help kids go to college and to get special skills, the Republicans think we should put the money into tax relief for the wealthiest people in this country. That is the reprise we hear over and over again on the Republican side: Just make the wealthiest people in this country wealthier and America will be a better place to live. 
   I think the wealthy people can take care of themselves. They do pretty well. The people who need a helping hand are families trying to put their kids through school. 
   One of the tax benefits which most of us on the Democratic side support, one that has been proposed by President Clinton, allows working families to deduct the cost of college education from their taxes. That means if we have a tuition bill of $10,000, the Federal Government will basically help pay for college education expenses up to, say, $2,800 a year. That is a direct helping hand from the Government. It doesn't go to the wealthiest among us but to  people who are struggling to make sure their kids have a better chance in this world than they had. 
   I have often thought to myself, when a new child is born into a family, after everybody has come around and admired the child and tried to figure out if he or she looks like mom or dad or grandma or grandpa, one of the things usually said is: Boy, by the time this little one reaches college age, how will we ever afford to pay for it? That is a real conversation I have heard over and over again. 
   Seldom, if ever--in fact, never--have I heard families say, boy, this little one here, I am worried about how much of my estate I will be able to leave when I die. People think in terms of the needs of the living. And the needs of the living include college education. On the Republican side, this is not a priority. It is certainly not as important a priority as giving a tax break to those with the most extensive and largest estates in America. 
   I can recall back in the late 1950s when the Russians launched Sputnik. There was a fear in the United States that they had a scientific advantage on the U.S. and that this advantage that launched the satellite into space might lead to a military superiority. Congress decided for one of the first times in its history to provide direct assistance to students. 
   We created something known as the National Defense Education Act. The reason I recall that so fondly is because I happened to be one of the beneficiaries of that Federal program. It was a loan program. You could borrow money to go to college, complete your degree, and pay it back to the Government. It was the best deal I ever had. I like to think the money I received was money well spent for me and my family and perhaps for the country. 
   Isn't this a time in our history where we ought to be stepping back and, instead of trying to come up with an estate tax break for the wealthiest families in America, shouldn't we be thinking about ways to help families across America pay for college education and training so we in America have a workforce ready for the 21st century? I think education should be the first priority when it comes to tax breaks. I don't think the first priority should be the estate tax repeal that the Republicans have proposed. I think the wealthiest among us, as I said earlier, can take care of themselves. If we can find ways to help families pay for college education, then I think we will be doing something meaningful, something that is responsive to families, to what families across America are looking for. As I said earlier, the basic question is, Whose side are we on in Congress? 
   I also find it interesting that we have the time, whatever it takes, to spend debating and passing tax relief for wealthy Americans, but no time to address the question of an increase in the minimum wage. There are 350,000 people in my home State of Illinois who got up this morning and went to work making a minimum wage. Some of them are teenagers in their first jobs, but, sadly, many of them are folks who are working one, two, and three jobs trying to keep the families together. For years, literally for years, the Democrats have been asking for an increase in the minimum wage across America. Mr. President, $5.15 an hour is not enough. It is not enough to raise yourself, let alone a family. Unfortunately, the Republicans have opposed our efforts to increase the minimum wage by $1 over a 2-year period of time. 
   They say they are fearful of the impact it might have if we give people something closer to a living wage, but they obviously have no fear in spending $750 billion in a tax break for the wealthiest among us, people who are literally making, on average, over $190,000 a year in the year of their death. Those are the ones the Republicans believe need help from Congress. Those who get up every morning and go to work, cleaning tables in a restaurant, making the food in the kitchens, making the beds in the motels, watching our kids in day-care centers, the Republicans believe they do not need an increase in their minimum wage. 
   What a difference in priorities. I would put those folks who are working hard for America and doing the right thing in the front of the line. The Republicans put the wealthiest, those who have made the most in this great country of ours, as the highest priority when it comes to action by Congress. 
   Time and again, when given choices between increasing health care for workers and their families, giving tax benefits to small businesses so they can offer health insurance, giving people the means to pay for the college education of their kids, offering such things as long-term care insurance or help for the care of their aging parents, the Republicans have said: No, it is not on our priority list. Our priority list starts with the wealthiest people in America, the people who Forbes magazine identified as the 400 richest families in America who would benefit from the Republican estate tax repeal to the tune of $250 billion. That is where they believe we should spend the money. 
   Frankly, that is what elections are all about. Those of us on the Democratic side who believe we can have a better Nation, that we can take our anticipated surplus and invest it in the people of this country, think the Republicans are fundamentally wrong. We can reform the estate tax, we can exempt the vast majority of families, over 99 percent of the families in America, we can exempt virtually two-thirds or more of those who are currently paying the tax, and we can exempt family farms and small businesses--75 percent are currently paying the tax--and do it in a way where we will have money left to invest in education and health care. No, the Republicans, frankly, say every penny has to go to the wealthiest people in this country. 
   We ought to keep a running score on the proposals on the Republican side and what they are going to cost. This one is worth about $750 billion. If I am not mistaken, the George W. Bush tax cut for wealthy people--a separate tax cut--is worth over $1 trillion, and the George W. Bush proposal to privatize Social Security will cost some $800 billion and have benefits reduced under Social Security. To that extent, this gives us an idea of how the Republicans time and time again want to spend the surplus which we are now enjoying in this country. That is something many of us think is very shortsighted. 
   The President's belief, and one I share, is that the first commitment of any surplus should be in paying down the national debt so we carry less of a burden for paying interest on that debt and less of a burden for our children. We should take that money in our surplus and invest it in Social Security and Medicare so they are strong for a long time to come, and then target tax cuts to middle-income families, those who are struggling, as I said, to pay for basic expenses, whether it is day care, college education, or long-term care for their parents. 
   That is the difference in philosophy. That is the choice in the election year. For the Republicans, the first group in line will always be the wealthiest among us. That is their party. That is in what they believe. They think if the wealthy are treated right, America is a much better place to live. A lot of us believe differently. We think investing in our people is a much better investment. 
   I want to speak for a moment about prescription drugs, too, because I said earlier this is a priority among Democrats, Republicans, and Independents alike. They believe prescription drug benefits should be passed by this Congress. The Republican answer to that is the same answer they came up with on a Patients' Bill of Rights: They turned to the insurance industry and said to insurance companies: How can we make some money for you in terms of a Patients' Bill of Rights pricing? 
   They came up with this notion we would somehow subsidize insurance plans to pay for prescription drugs. I think Americans are skeptical of that approach. They understand the Democratic approach which would use the Medicare system, which would be universal, and is a tried-and-true system under Medicare to provide benefits to families across America and would give the Medicare system bargaining power to keep drug prices under control. 
   The Republicans want to subsidize insurance companies. It is no surprise Americans are skeptical of whether those insurance companies will be responsive to the needs of families when it comes to prescription drugs. That is why we have a serious difference between the two parties on this issue. The Republican bill does not give seniors a choice of guaranteeing coverage under Medicare. That is the most important single thing that seniors ask  for: guaranteed prescription drug coverage under Medicare. The Republican plan does not respond to that. 
   The Republican plan also provides subsidies to insurance companies, and yet there is no guarantee that the insurance companies will even offer the coverage, and they will not be offering a Medicare-type plan. 
   The Republican approach on prescription drugs does nothing about fair prices. As I said earlier, the pharmaceutical companies must be cheering this idea. The Government is going to subsidize some sort of insurance scheme to pay for prescription drugs, and yet the prices continue to go through the roof. We understand that such a plan will never work. What insurance company is going to sign up to pay your prescription drugs with no guarantee of any control on price? The Republicans, obviously, are insensitive to the price issue. 
   In addition to accessibility to prescription drugs insurance, price is also important. Americans understand that drugs in Canada, made in the United States, sell for a fraction of the cost. One can take the same pill and order it at the veterinarian for one's dog and go across the street and order it for oneself and find a dramatic difference in cost. It is because the drug companies are gaming the system, and they are very open about it. They are going to charge the highest price to those who will pay it, and those who will pay for it in our country are the Medicare beneficiaries--the seniors and disabled. 
   Once again, Republicans have failed to respond to the basic need in this country: a prescription drug benefit. It is no surprise the Republicans do want to use the Medicare system as the Democrats have proposed. We believe we can provide to 
   seniors the choice of a guaranteed prescription drug coverage under Medicare, but the Republicans are opposed to that. They have been critical of Medicare since its creation. They have talked about privatizing this benefit of prescription drugs, leading many to believe that ultimately they are hoping to privatize Medicare. 
   When we tried, incidentally, to privatize a portion of Medicare recently--we said to Medicare recipients: You can buy an HMO plan--the insurance companies, after a year or two, turned around and said they were not going to write coverage anymore. It has happened in Illinois and across the country and a million seniors have been left high and dry by an insurance market that is driven almost exclusively by profit. 
   That is, unfortunately, where the Republicans have turned again, to the insurance industry, to try to provide some help with prescription drugs. It is not going to work, and the American people know better. They are going to hold this Congress accountable. If the best we can come up with is the estate tax relief for the wealthiest estates in America and nothing when it comes to prescription drug benefits, then we have failed the most basic test, and that is whether we respond to the common need in this country. The common need clearly is for a prescription drug benefit, as well as a Patients' Bill of Rights so you can go to your doctor with confidence, and when that doctor makes a decision about you and your family's health, it is not going to be overruled by someone who works for an insurance company. 
   Those are the basics: Minimum wage, prescription drug benefit, Patients' Bill of Rights. These are things Republicans have not added to their list of priorities. No, their highest priority when it comes to spending and tax relief still turns out to be the wealthiest people in America. We believe that is wrongheaded. It does not take into account the folks who built this country and made it strong for so many years. 
   I conclude by saying this estate tax is really a test of the priorities of the political parties. Who will be the first in line in the U.S. Congress for help? Who would you turn to first with $750 billion to provide some equity under the Tax Code? Which group of Americans would you single as needing the most help? The Republicans have answered those questions with the repeal of the estate tax. 
   They believe the people who need the help the most are the folks who have the most in America. I do not believe that is what America is all about. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it has been more than a year since the Columbine tragedy, but still this Republican Congress refuses to act on sensible gun legislation. 
   Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. Until we act, Democrats in the Senate will read some of the names of those who lost their lives to gun violence in the past year, and we will continue to do so every day that the Senate is in session. 
   In the name of those who died, we will continue this fight. Following are the names of some of the people who were killed by gunfire one year ago today. 
   July 11, 1999: 
   Thomas Erwin, 36, Oklahoma City, OK; Bernard Harrison, 17, Baltimore, MD; Anthony L. Holt, 28, Chicago, IL; Judy Holt, 47, Dallas, TX; Christopher F.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today today with my colleagues, Senators DEWINE, FITZGERALD, KERRY, BINGAMAN, SCHUMER and ABRAHAM to offer this critical amendment to increase funding for childhood asthma programs at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
   For the next 15 minutes imagine breathing through a tiny straw the size of a coffee stirrer, never getting enough air. Now imagine suffering through the process three to six times a day. This is asthma. 
   ``America is in the middle of an asthma epidemic--an epidemic that is getting worse, not better.'' So says the PEW environmental Health Commission in its most recent report on asthma. 
   The prevalence of asthma continues to rise at astounding rates--every region of the country and across all demographic groups, whether measured by age, race or sex. In America today, no chronic disease is increasing faster than asthma. And asthma is considered the worst chronic health problem plaguing this nation's children. Among those four years old, it has mushroomed by 160 percent over the last 2 decades. 
   Asthma affects nearly 15 million Americans. That figure includes more than 700,000 Illinoisans, of whom 213,000 are children under the age of 18. Chicago has the dubious distinction of having the second highest rate of childhood asthma in the country. According to a study published by the Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology, of inner-city school children in Chicago, researchers found that the prevalence of diagnosed asthma was 10.8 percent, or twice the 5.8 percent the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates in that age group nationally. The study also found that most of the children with diagnosed asthma were receiving medical care, but it may not be consistent with what asthma care guidelines recommend. 
   If rates continue unchecked, a child born a generation from now will be twice as likely to develop asthma as a child born today. By the end of this decade, if no action is taken to reverse this trend and it continues at its current pace, the PEW Commission calculates that 22 million Americans will suffer from asthma--eight million more than at present. That's one in 14 Americans and one in every five families forced to live with the disease. By 2020, the Commission estimates that the number could increase to 29 million--more than twice the current number. 
   These figures are staggering. At the current rate of growth, that means that the number of asthma cases in 2020 will exceed the projected population of New York and New Jersey combined. If by chance all asthma suffers lived in one state, it would be the second most populous in the country. Put another way, if all those with asthma stood side by side, they would stretch the distance between LA, California and Washington DC, over four times. 
   If general rates of asthma are high and getting higher, the rates are even worse for society's most vulnerable. Asthma disproportionately attacks them. A recent New York Times article described a study in the Brooklyn area where it was found that an astounding 38 percent of homeless children suffer from asthma. Some of the factors known to contribute to asthma such as poor living circumstances, exposure to cockroach feces, stress, exposure to dampness and mold are all experienced by homeless children. They are also experienced by children living in poor housing or exposed to urban violence. There are other factors such as exposure to second hand 
   smoke and smog that also exacerbate or trigger asthma attacks. 
   Not only is asthma itself on the rise but it is becoming more deadly. For minorities, asthma is particularly deadly. The asthma death rate for African-Americans is more than twice as high as it is for other segments of the population. Nationwide, the childhood asthma-related death rate in 1993, was 3 to 4 times higher for African-Americans compared to Caucasian Americans. The hospitalization rate for asthma is almost three times as high among African-American children under the age of 5 compared to their white counterparts. Illinois has the highest asthma related deaths in the country for African-American men. The increased disparity between death rates compared to prevalence rates has been partially explained by decreased access to health care services for minority children. 
   However, even though asthma rates are particularly high for children in poverty, they are also rising substantially for suburban children. Overall the rates are increasing for all groups. Everyone of us knows a child whether our own, a relatives' or a friends' who suffers from asthma. 
   In an effort to stem the tide of this epidemic, Senator DEWINE and I along with 23 other Senators submitted a request to the Labor HHS appropriators to ask for $50 million for childhood asthma programs at CDC. One fifth of the money would be available for improved tracking and surveillance efforts for asthma, as suggested by the PEW commission for environmental health. Currently, the bill does mention a specific allocation for asthma. 
   The amendment, which has been agreed to, provides $20 million for state and community-based organizations to support asthma screening, treatment, education and prevention programs and for a new surveillance and tracking system as called for recently by the PEW Environmental Health Commission in their report ``Attack Asthma.'' Again, one fifth of the amount, in this case $4 million would be available for new surveillance and tracking. 
   The amendment also states that these community funds may be used by both health and school-based services. Many school districts, including the Chicago Public Schools are involved in screening children for asthma and for seeing to it that they get treatment and management to deal with their asthma. CDC should see to it that these new funds are used to coordinate local efforts and to link both school based and health facility based asthma programs. With additional resources, CDC should diversify the types of programs that they fund, so that evaluations can be done to measure the effectiveness of these different programs. Furthermore, programs need to be tailored to the individual needs of localities with coordination of local services and local efforts to combat childhood asthma. 
   The amendment also includes a restriction on the amount that CDC may use for administration or reprogramming including the 1 percent Public Health Service evaluation. Both Senator DEWINE and I believe that asthma  should be a high priority for CDC and that CDC should not seek to reprogram this money or use it for other purposes. Last year, CDC chose to disproportionately allocate rescissions to the asthma program. We strongly object to that decision. At a time of an asthma epidemic, we believe that this program should be protected from such cuts. Therefore, this year we have included language that states that only 5 percent of the total amount allocated for childhood asthma programs may be used for administration, evaluations, or other activities. 
   Let me tell you why we need this money. Despite the best efforts of the health community, childhood asthma is becoming more common, more deadly and more expensive and the effects of asthma on society are widespread. 
   Most children who have asthma develop it in their first year, but it often goes undiagnosed. Many of you may be surprised to learn that asthma is the single most common reason for school absenteeism. Parents miss work while caring for children with asthma. Beyond those missed days at school and parents missing work, there is the huge emotional stress suffered by asthmatic children. It is a very frightening event for a small child to be unable to breathe. A recent US News article quoted an 8-yr old Virginian farm girl, Madison Benner who described her experience with asthma. She said ``It feels like something was standing on my chest when I have an asthma attack.'' This little girl had drawn a picture of a floppy-eared, big footed elephant crushing a frowning girl into her bed. 
   In many urban centers, over 60 percent of childhood admissions to the emergency room are for asthma. There are 1.8 million emergency room visits each year for asthma. Yet the emergency room is hardly a place where a child and the child's parents can be educated in managing their asthma. 
   During a recent visit to Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago, I met a wonderful little boy whose life is a daily fight against asthma. He told me he can't always participate in gym class or even join his friends on the playground. Fortunately, Nicholas is receiving the medical attention necessary to manage his asthma. Yet for millions of children, this is not the case. Their asthma goes undiagnosed and untreated, making trips to the emergency room as common as trips to the grocery store. 
   However, we do have treatments that work for most people. Early diagnosis, treatment and management are key to preventing serious illness and death. The National Institutes of Health is home to the National Asthma Education and Prevention board. This is a large group of experts from all across the fields involved in health care and asthma. They have developed guidelines on both treating asthma and educating children and their parents in prevention. It is very important that when we spend money on developing such guidelines that they actually get out of communities so that they can take advantage of this research. 
   CDC has been working in collaboration with NIH to make sure that health professionals and others get the most up to date information. My amendment could further help this effort by providing grantees with this information. 
   One interesting new model that appears to work is the ``breathmobile' program in Los Angeles that was started 2 years ago. This program provides a van that is equipped with medical personnel, asthma education materials, and asthma treatment supplies. It goes out to areas that are known to have a high incidence of childhood asthma and screens children in those areas. Children are also enrolled in the Children's Health Program if they are income eligible. We have all heard of how slow enrollment in the children's health program has been and anything that we can do to speed enrollment up, I think it vitally important. This ``Breathmobile'' program has reduced trips to the emergency room by 17 percent in the first year of operation. I hope that we can be as successful in Illinois and other parts of the country. 
   In Illinois, the Mobile CARE Foundation is setting up a program in Chicago based on the Los Angeles initiative. In addition, the American Association of Chest Physicians has joined with other groups to form the Chicago Asthma Consortium to provide asthma 
   screening and treatment. Efforts like these need our amendment. 
   In West Virginia, a Medicaid ``disease management'' program which seeks to coordinate children with asthma's care so that they get the very best care has been found to be very cost effective. It has reduced trips to the emergency room by 30 percent. 
   This Childhood Asthma Amendment would expand these programs to help ensure that no child goes undiagnosed and every asthmatic child gets the treatment he or she needs. 
   Last year, an additional $10 million was dedicated to start this program for a total of $11.3 million. CDC will be putting out a request for proposals this summer. The $20 million agreed to here today is a good start and I hope that we will be able to do better by increasing it to $50 million in conference. This $50 million level of funding is supported by the American Lung Association, the Asthma and Allergy Foundation, Mothers of Asthmatics, the National Association for Children's Hospitals and Research Institutions, the Academy of Pediatrics, the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America and others who support children's health. 
   No child should die from asthma. We need to make sure that people understand the signs of asthma and that all asthmatic children have access to treatment and information on how to lessen their exposure to things that trigger asthma attacks. Funding for this program is critical. 
   I am delighted that my colleague Senator SPECTER has agreed to accept this amendment to nearly double the funding level for this important public health effort. I hope that he will work with me in conference to increase this level of funding to as close as possible to the $50 million originally requested by myself and 23 of my Senate colleagues. Again I thank my colleagues SPECTER and HARKIN for recognizing the importance of this issue to the nation's children.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment regarding childhood immunization. Remarkable advances in the science of vaccine development and widespread immunization efforts have led to a substantial reduction in the incidence of infectious disease. Today, as you know, national vaccination coverage is at record high levels. Smallpox has been eradicated; polio has been eliminated from the Western Hemisphere; and cases of measles have been reduced to record lows. 
   Still, the job is not done and it is important that we remain vigilant. Every day, nearly 11,000 infants are born and each baby will need up to 22 doses of vaccine by age two. New vaccines continue to enter the market. And although a significant proportion of the general population may be fully immunized at a given time, coverage rates in the United States are uneven and life-threatening disease outbreaks do occur. In fact, recent data from the CDC indicate that coverage rates may be leveling off and that in many areas of the country, including Chicago, Houston, Delaware, North Dakota, South Dakota and New Mexico, they are actually declining. 
   At the same time, funding to states and localities for immunization delivery activities has also been dramatically reduced over the past five years.  States are now struggling to maintain immunization rates and have implemented severe cuts to immunization activities. Many have already reduced clinic hours, canceled contracts with providers, suspended registry development and implementation, limited outreach efforts and discontinued performance monitoring. 
   Last week, the Institute of Medicine issued a landmark report on the state of our Nation's immunization infrastructure. This report confirmed that the situation requires immediate attention. The IOM in its report stated:  
   The combination of new challenges and reduced resources has led to instability in the public health infrastructure that supports the U.S. immunization system. Many states have reduced the scale of their immunization programs and currently lack adequate strength in areas such as data collection among at-risk populations, strategic planning, program coordination, and assessment of immunization status in communities that are served by multiple health care providers. If unmet immunization needs are not identified and addressed, states will have difficulty in achieving the national goal of 90 percent coverage by year 2010 for completion of childhood vaccination series for young children. Furthermore, state and national coverage rates, which reached record levels for vaccines in widespread use (79 percent in 1998), can be expected to decline and preventable disease outbreaks may occur as a result, particularly among persons who are vulnerable to vaccine-preventable disease because of their undervaccination status.  
   The amendment I am offering today with my colleagues Senator KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON, Senator JACK REED, Senator PATTY MURRAY, and Senator JOHN KERRY addresses the recommendations of the IOM and responds to the issues raised by state and local immunization program administrators who are struggling to reach underserved children. The provision does three things: First, it provides a $37.5 million increase in immunization grant funding to state and local programs for immunization infrastructure activities in FY 2001, bringing the total funding for infrastructure up from $139 million to $176.5 million. Second, it limits to 14 percent the amount of the total that can be spent for incentive grants to states. Third, it targets 10 percent of the total infrastructure funding to areas with low or declining immunization rates and areas susceptible to outbreaks. 
   While $37.5 million is a good start, additional funding is needed. The IOM recommends a $75 million increase in the annual federal share of funding to states for immunization programs. This number was derived from 3 calculations: (1) annual state expenditure levels during the mid-1990's; (2) the level of spending necessary to provide additional resources to states with high levels of need without reducing current award levels for each state; and (3) additional infrastructure requirements associated with adjusting to anticipated changes and increased complexity in the immunization schedule. Dozens of organizations support this level of funding, including Research. America, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the March of Dimes, the Children's Defense Fund, the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, Every Child by Two, and many others. 
   I intend to work with my colleagues on the Committee and in the Senate to increase this funding level by an additional $37.5 million in FY 2002 in order to reach the level recommended by the IOM. 
   The 317 immunization grant program to states and localities for ``infrastructure and operations'' is the sole source of Federal support for many critical activities, including: immunization registries; outreach efforts to educate parents about the value and importance of vaccines as well as the risks and possible side effects; training and education of providers to ensure timely vaccinations and keep them updated about the routine schedule including changes resulting from the addition of new vaccines; outbreak control and monitoring and investigating disease occurrence; identifying under immunized children and development of strategies to overcome barriers to vaccination; linking immunization activities with other public health services such as the WIC program; and evaluations of immunization strategies to determine what works. 
   While overall funding to the Centers for Disease Control's immunization program has actually seen slight increases, the grant program to States and localities has dramatically declined over the past 5 years. Actual appropriations levels have gone from $271 million in FY1995 to $208 million in FY 96 to $139 million in FY2000. But the story is even worse. The measles outbreak of the late 1980's and early 1990's prompted Congress to give states hefty funding increases. Unfortunately, the states were not immediately prepared for the influx of funds. Money was ``carried over'' from one year to the next as they worked through barriers such as computer acquisitions, legislative approvals and hiring freezes. This carryover has compensated for the dramatic reductions in funding that followed. Now there is no more carryover money to pick up the slack. So while actual appropriations have declined by about $68 million since 1996, states are experiencing reductions of 50 percent or more in the same time period. As a result, states are struggling to maintain immunization rates and have implemented severe cuts to immunization activities. Many have already reduced clinic hours, canceled contracts with providers, suspended registry development and implementation, limited outreach efforts and discontinued performance monitoring. An increase of $75 million will barely get states back up to the funding levels they were experiencing in 1998. 
   The amendment also limits the amount that can be allocated for incentive grants to 14 percent of the total infrastructure funding. Historically, Senate report language has included a formula to reward areas that achieved high coverage levels and set aside $33 million out of the state infrastructure money to pay for this incentive. When this was first put in place in 1994, this amount represented approximately 14 percent of all grant funding available. Now, because the total funding has decreased, the percentage is equal to about 25 percent of the total. Because the overall base funding has decreased (from $271 million in FY95 to $139 million), the incentive allocation is eating up a greater share of total infrastructure funding pulling money away from 
   project areas that have lower immunization rates. In addition, because immunization rates have gone up, nearly every state gets some incentive money--but it is no longer considered an ``incentive'' by the states. Rather, states use the money to offset recent decreases in 317 federal grant funding. As a result, this ``incentive'' that has historically been included in the Senate Appropriations report is no longer achieving its intended effect. Quite simply, the advantage of awarding funds as incentives, rewarding successful immunization programs, has decreased as total funding has decreased. Those grantees with the lowest coverage levels and most in need are receiving less funding than those who have already achieved high coverage levels. 
   To address this issue, this amendment would limit the percentage of total funding that can be used for incentive money to the percentage it represented when it was first implemented. No state will experience a reduction in funds. 
   I also want to note that the House Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations report included language, which I strongly support, asking the CDC to report back to Congress regarding the utility of this incentive program and recommending a mechanism to phase it out if it is not found to be achieving its intended purpose. It is my hope that the Senate will agree to this language in conference. 
   The amendment also targets 10 percent of total infrastructure funding to areas of the country with low or declining immunization rates. Even with significant gains in national immunization rates, subpopulations of underimmunized children still exist. Rates in many of the Nation's urban areas, including Chicago and Houston, are unacceptably low and getting lower. These pockets of need create pools of susceptible children and increase the risk of dangerous disease outbreaks. The IOM report highlights the fact that disparities in levels of immunization coverage still exist. National surveys reveal a gap of 9 percentage points between children above and below the federal poverty level. Targeting just 10 percent of the total amount, as IOM recommends, will help CDC respond to unexpected outbreaks, gaps in immunization coverage, or other exceptional circumstances within the states.  
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. It will provide additional funds to every single state. No state loses money. In this day and age, it is simply not acceptable that more than one million children have not been adequately vaccinated. Vaccines are one of the most cost-effective tools we have in preventing disease. For every dollar spent on vaccines, society saves up to $24 in medical and societal costs. Controlling vaccine-preventable disease has been one of the most significant public health accomplishments of the 20th Century. But current success does not guarantee future success. And there is still much work to be done.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if I might address the Senator from Nevada through the Chair, the situation we saw yesterday is clear evidence that we are in the campaign season. Instead of dealing with issues that many of us think are critical for families, such as prescription drugs and gun safety legislation, we are instead talking about further investigations. 
   I think there is a point where this Congress is expected to legislate rather than investigate. The closer we get to the election, I think the more the American people discount some of the rhetoric they are hearing on this issue.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we have just learned within the last few minutes that a decision has been made on Capitol Hill to eliminate the Summer Jobs Program for this year. That decision was made by Republican leaders who have decided that it costs too much--$40 million. 
   We have to sit back, from time to time, and measure the relative cost of decisions we make. If we are going to say to literally tens of thousands of young people across America that there will not be a Summer Jobs Program, what price will we pay for that decision? For many of these kids, it  means there will not be an opportunity for the first time in their lives to have a real job, a real learning experience in the workplace. 
   In this country we are prepared to pay whatever it takes when we sentence someone to prison. In Illinois, it costs about $30,000 a year to keep someone in prison. That failed life that led to crime and conviction ends up costing us $30,000 a year. Is it too much to pay? No, we will pay it. But when it comes to jobs for kids during the summer, the Republican leadership has decided it is too much to pay. 
   How about school dropouts? When kids drop out of school, they not only ruin their own lives but often affect the communities in which they live. These are the kids hanging out on the street corners. These are the ones who may never have a job. These are the ones who become chronic statistics in our society. We will pay for those statistics one way or the other. We have decided that is a cost we will pay. But when it comes to providing jobs in the summer for kids going to school, the Republican leadership decided today it was too high a cost to pay. Of course, when we talk about tomorrow's workers, we realize that kids who are not put on the right track with the right values early in life may not go on to finish school or to become the workforce of the 21st century for America. That is an expense to this country. It is obviously something the Republican leadership is willing to pay, rather than pay for a Summer Jobs Program. 
   What does this program mean? In my home State of Illinois, the decision today by the Republican leaders to take out the Summer Jobs Program means that 10,000 kids coming out of schools in the Chicagoland area will not have a 6-week minimum wage summer job. Is that an important life experience? Boy, it sure was for me. Going to work meant a lot for me. As my folks used to say: We want you to learn the value of a dollar. When I went to work, I understood the value of a dollar. I added up every paycheck and how I was going to save it, how I was going to spend it. It also teaches you the value of hard work, the fact that you do get up with the rest of the world and go to work and don't expect somebody to hand you something. That is the value of a summer job, a value that will be denied to tens of thousands of kids because of a decision the Republican leadership made to kill the Summer Jobs Program. The value of showing up on time to work, dressed properly, prepared to work with your coworkers, you cannot teach all that in school. Some of that is a life experience. It is an experience I had and virtually everyone has on their way to a successful life. For tens of thousands of kids, they will be denied that opportunity because of this decision by the Republican leadership. 
   Of course, for me and a lot of others, that summer job 
   taught us the value of staying in school. How many times did I stop behind that shovel and think: I don't want to do this the rest of my life. I am going to go back to school. I am going to get my college degree and go on. That is the value of a summer job, too. 
   Senator KENNEDY is right. If we have the values, the same values of families across America, we would be voting for this program and this amendment he is proposing for summer jobs for kids so they can have a valuable work experience. We would be voting for this amendment so there will be job training for those dislocated from their jobs. We don't want to give up on workers. I believe in free trade, but I know that millions of workers in America lose their jobs each year because of technology and trade and change. We should be there with programs to help them move to the next job so they do not lose pace with the economy and the quality of life they are used to. 
   This amendment gets to the heart of the values of the Members of the Senate. Senator KENNEDY is right. I am happy to cosponsor it. The mayor of the city of Chicago said: The School Jobs Program keeps kids away from gangs, guns, and drugs. He hit the nail on the head. If we put more and more kids into positive programs where they learn how to work and continue to learn in the workplace, their lives can be transformed. If there is one value we share as Americans, it is the value of hard work. 
   The decision by the Republican leadership to close down the Summer Jobs Program is a decision that flies in the face of the values of this country.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it has been more than a year since the Columbine tragedy, but still this Republican Congress refuses to act on sensible gun legislation. 
   Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. Until we act, Democrats in the Senate will read some of the names of those who lost their lives to gun violence in the past year, and we will continue to do so every day that the Senate is in session. 
   In the name of those who died, we will continue this fight. Following are the names of some of the people who were killed by gunfire one year ago today. 
   June 27, 1999: 
   Samie A. Betouni, 35, Chicago, IL; 
   Terrell Bryant, 46, Miami-Dade County, FL;

    Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, June 23rd marks the 80th anniversary of Voidhupuha, or Victory Day, recalling Estonia's break from Russian control in 1920. On this holiday, Estonians commemorate the battles during the War of Independence in which military forces fought to regain Baltic control over the region. On Victory Day Estonians also celebrate the contributions of all who have fought for the cause of independence throughout their country's history. 
   Many lives were lost for the cause of Estonian independence. Three battles, Roopa, Venden-Ronnenberg, and finally Vonnu were the turning points that ultimately led to the defeat of the opposing army. The Tartu Peace Treaty in 1920 marked the end of centuries of struggle and finally granted independence to Estonia. 
   On Victory Day, Estonians also remember those who battled against the Nazis and the Soviets. From 1944 until 1991 the Soviets again occupied Estonia, and during this time those who voiced opinions against the government were typically sentenced to 25 years in a Gulag prison, and 5 years in exile. The designation of June 23rd as Victory Day signifies that all those involved in the crusade for freedom are remembered for their efforts, and that their messages live on. 
   Estonia has become a strong independent country since 1991 when it again rid itself of Soviet occupation. It is a free-market economy and has established a rule of law. 
   This year we celebrate the 60th anniversary of the refusal by the United States to recognize Soviet domination of the Baltic states. The recognition of Estonia as free and independent is positive, but does not go far enough. What we celebrate this year is what we must help to preserve next year and the year after that. We must be sure that Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia are admitted into NATO as an unequivocal statement of the West's support for Baltic freedom and independence. 
   Being the son of a Lithuanian immigrant myself, I take great pride in the accomplishments of the Baltic states. I support admitting the Baltic states into NATO and I hope my colleagues here in the Senate will support their entry also in the next round of NATO expansion. 
   That debate we will save for another day, but I am sure all of my colleagues can agree on the importance of Estonia's struggle for freedom and independence, and will join me in congratulating Estonia on the 80th anniversary of Victory Day.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in a short time, we are going to have two votes that will define the difference in values between the two political parties in this Chamber. For 2 or 3 years now, President Clinton has been calling for a prescription drug benefit under Medicare. During that period of time, the Republicans were in control of the House of Representatives and the Senate, and a bill never came to the floor to deal with this issue, which is paramount in the minds of families across America. On the Democratic side, we have asked, from day 1, for a chance to bring the President's proposal or our own proposal to the floor. The only way this vote came about this evening on a prescription drug benefit under Medicare is because we had to tie this Chamber into procedural knots to achieve this vote. 
   Well, I commend the Republicans who are supporting this bipartisan measure, and I hope many of them will cross the aisle and join us in a bipartisan show of support for a prescription drug benefit. For those who think they can vote against this prescription drug benefit and go home and explain that it was such a new idea and they didn't have a chance to read it, I can tell them the President has had a proposal here for years. This idea has been out here for years. You have been in control of the committees and in control of the Senate. We have waited for your prescription drug benefit, but there is nothing for us to consider from the Republican side. The vote that we will cast in a few minutes will give Republicans and Democrats alike a chance to go on the record for a good prescription drug benefit bill under Medicare. 
   The second vote we will cast also defines the values of the parties. To think that each year over 600,000 workers in America get up and go to work and do their very best in the workplace and get injured because of these so-called musculoskeletal disorders, and they don't have the kind of protection they deserve from their Government. This is a call to action in this Chamber--a call to action that was heard by Elizabeth Dole when she was Secretary of Labor. She said we needed a standard, a call to action, which has been heard over and over again from working families across America. 
   The Republican position is to turn a deaf ear to these workers, ignore the fact that they are facing debilitating injuries and disorders in the workplace, which haunt them for the rest of their natural lives. It is the position of the Republican Party to stop this effort to bring safety to the workplace. This is nothing new. There has not been a single time in America's history when we have come forward with protection for workers that business interests didn't stand up and try to block it. Whether we are talking about child labor laws, safety in the workplace, time and time again, they have said it is too much Government, too much meddling, it will cost too much. 
   Well, I think the value on human life and the value on safety in the workplace is not too high a price to pay. We have an opportunity today to pass a prescription drug benefit that will truly help the seniors and the disabled, an opportunity to stand up for millions of workers across America who expect us to be sensitive to their needs. In my experience in life, years ago, I had one of those assembly line jobs. I saw injuries in the workplace. I saw people taken out of the workplace, down to the doctors office, and off the job for weeks at a time for injuries. 
   Perhaps there are some in the Chamber who have never seen that. But it is a memory that will be with you for a lifetime. Those workers--men and women--and their families expect us to stand up for safety in the workplace. That is our obligation. The response from the Republican side is, let's postpone this at least another year, and in another year there will be another 600,000 injured American workers. That is unacceptable. 
   The vote we will cast on these two issues really defines the values of our parties.

   Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Kentucky for yielding. 
   Sunday afternoon, 3 days ago, I was in southern Colombia in a Blackhawk helicopter. We spent an hour going over the treetops of a jungle and looking down. A general from the Colombian army was pointing out to me the fields of coca plants, the plant that ultimately produces cocaine. After a few minutes, I told him he could stop because we could literally see them in every direction. I am talking about 600 square miles of coca plants growing a product which has one use: to create an addictive narcotic. Where will it be sold? Right here, most of it in the United States. 
   I think we all know the devastation it wreaks on this country. The likelihood that one will be robbed or murdered is usually connected to narcotics. The safety of American homes, neighborhoods, and communities is usually connected to narcotics. The prisons of America are bursting at the seams primarily because of narcotics. Eighty percent of the cocaine consumed in the United States comes from one country: Colombia. That is a reality; that is a fact. 
   The Senator from Minnesota is one of my favorite colleagues. I say this in all sincerity. Thank God PAUL WELLSTONE is in the Senate. He stands for principle on so many issues and reminds all of us of the issues of conscience which should be part of every debate. 
   I am honored so many times to stand as his ally. This is one of the rare occasions when I am on the opposite side and will oppose his amendment. As some would like to construct it, this amendment is a Faustian choice, an impossible dilemma. Should we allow drugs into the United States? Certainly not. Should we support a Colombian military that has a record of human rights abuse? Well, certainly not. But we have to make a choice here. 
   The Clinton administration has come forward, working with the President of Colombia, and said we think we can find a way to reform the military and we can also reduce the narcotics coming into the United States. 
   I might add that I salute Senator MCCONNELL and Senator LEAHY for this fine bill they have brought to us. They went further than the administration. Please read the section on Plan Colombia, and you will see page after page of efforts by Democrats and Republicans here to address the very real human rights concerns raised by Senator WELLSTONE of Minnesota. 
   Time and again, they come forward and say we are going to do more and make certain, as best we can, that before money comes from our Treasury down to Colombia to eradicate narcotics, the people receiving the money are not going to collaborate with the narcotraffickers who are guilty of things that have been proven in the past. 
   I salute the committee. For friends of mine in the human rights community in the United States, I hope they will read what has been done here by Senators LEAHY and MCCONNELL. It is very positive. 
   Imagine, for 40 years Colombia has been involved in what has been called a civil war or an internal conflict. What does that mean? Forty years ago, groups on the left who were inspired either by Moscow, or Beijing, or whatever, came to the front and said, we are going to push for reform in this country so that the poor people of Colombia  have a better chance. That sort of revolution was taking place all over Central and South America. 
   But things changed over 40 years. What started off as a leftist-inspired, popular uprising to improve life for the poor people in Colombia quickly became subsumed and taken over by the narcotics trade. The World Bank estimates that there is a billion dollars in money coming into Colombia to sustain the narcotics trade. That money is going to the leftist guerrillas and the right-wing group, the terrorist paramilitaries. They all use the same tactics. They don't go into villages and beg for soldiers; they stick a gun to their heads and say, ``You are now part of our paramilitary group.'' They enslave them. If they don't cooperate, they kill them. And they are involved in kidnapping. 
   The President of that country has been kidnapped. His father-in-law was kidnapped and murdered. When we met Saturday morning, the Defense Minister said his brother was kidnapped. Everybody there told stories about kidnapped people. If you think this is a typical civil war where the left is moving for poor people and the government is against it, it doesn't fit the description. When we sat down with the human rights groups, they said the guerrillas on the left and the paramilitaries on the right are just as guilty of human rights abuses in this country as any other group. No question about it. 
   There are very few good guys in this story. But from the U.S. point of view, I think the President is right, and I think 
   this bill is right to say we cannot stand idly by and let these drugs flood into the United States with all of the negative consequences. 
   I totally support Senator WELLSTONE's premise that if we just stop the supply of drugs coming into the United States, that is not enough; we have to deal with the demand side of it. America is a great consumer of narcotics. That is why those plants are being grown thousands of miles away. When Senators WELLSTONE and DEWINE come to the floor and say put more money into drug prevention and rehab in the United States, they are right. But it is not an either/or situation; we need both. 
   This bill addresses reducing and eliminating the supply of narcotics coming into the United States. Senator WELLSTONE believes the military in Colombia has a record of human rights abuses, and he is right. The State Department stands behind that. This bill addresses that and says, we will bird-dog you every step of the way, demand reforms in the Colombian society, and we will demand that you not be engaged in human rights abuses to be part of this partnership to reduce narcotics in Colombia. 
   I might also add, to suggest we will give money to the police and not to the army really doesn't tell the whole story. They are together in Colombia. The national police and the army are together. When I sat down with the Minister of Defense, I sat across the table from General Gilibert, who is head of the police, and General Tapias, head of the army. They work together. We want to use helicopters to secure areas where we can send down planes to spray with Roundup these coca plants and kill them, so that coca is not turned into paste and white powder and sold on the streets of Washington, DC, and Chicago, IL, addicting people and sending them to prison after committing crimes. That is a good thing to do. I support the administration in their efforts to achieve that. 
   It is true that Senator WELLSTONE says we may be taking sides. I hope we are taking sides against narcotics and saying to the leftist guerrillas and right-wing paramilitaries: We have no use for either one of you. 
   As said to me by the President of Colombia, ``They are both our enemies. We have to deal with both of them.'' We should view it that way. As I met with the Army and Marine Corps personnel from the United States advising these troops in Tres Esquinas, a remote location in the Putumayo Province, it is clear that these men in the Colombian Army were prepared to put their lives on the line to stop the narcotrafficking that ultimately will corrupt and kill so many Americans. I think we have to stand behind them. We have no other choice. To step back and say we will do nothing now is unacceptable. 
   This bill makes it clear that we have not forgotten the poorest people in Colombia. I commend again the subcommittee for saying that additional assistance is given to the Agency for International Development, so that once that coca planter in Colombia has his crop sprayed, we can give him an alternative, find some other agriculture in which he can be involved. That is the humanitarian and sensible way to approach this. This bill does that; it tries to make sure some alternative, legal agriculture is available to the people there. 
   Is it worth a billion dollars to America to send this money to Colombia? I will use my State as an illustration. In 1987, we had 500 people in Illinois prisons for the possession of a thimbleful of cocaine. Today, we have 
   9,000 prisoners in Illinois for the possession of a thimbleful of cocaine. It costs us about $30,000 per prisoner a year. The taxpayers of Illinois are spending $270 million a year and the story can be repeated in every other State. That is $270 million a year in Illinois because of what is growing in Putumayo Province in Colombia. 
   I think we have to have a coordinated effort of interdiction and stop it at its source, to do everything in our power not to let these drugs come into the country. Then we can deal with the demand side of it and see that drug rehab is available--a sensible and a balanced approach.

   Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair. 
   I start by asking the sponsor of this amendment, Senator MURRAY, of Washington, just a few questions so we can clarify what we are talking about.

   Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Washington. 
   I wanted to make those points clear. We are talking about a constitutional right which every woman in America enjoys, her right to control her reproductive health. 
   Make no mistake; it is a controversial right. There are people on this floor who do not believe the Supreme Court was right in establishing that, within the right of privacy, every woman should make that decision with her doctor and her conscience. These are people who oppose abortion either completely or want to limit it to certain circumstances. 
   What we are talking about here is whether or not a young woman who takes an oath to defend the United States of America and becomes part of our military service is going to give up her constitutional right to control her own reproductive health. That is the bottom line. 
   What Senator MURRAY is trying to say is, why would we treat women who volunteer to serve in the military as second class citizens? Why would we deny to daughters and sisters and mothers and wives who serve in the military the same constitutional right which every woman in America enjoys? 
   Those who oppose this amendment say women in the military should be treated as second class citizens; they should not have the same constitutional rights as any other woman in America. 
   Second, the question about whether the Government is paying for the abortion is always a controversial question. Some people who in conscience oppose abortion say: I don't want a penny of my taxes to be spent on abortion services. Senator MURRAY addresses this directly and says that any abortion procedure has to be paid for by the woman in uniform. She is paying for it out of her pocket. It isn't a matter of the Government paying for it. Should a woman choose an abortion procedure, they have to pay for it. In this case, Senator MURRAY makes that clear. 
   Finally, to argue we are going to turn military hospitals into abortion clinics and force doctors to perform abortions defiles the very language of the amendment. Senator MURRAY carefully included a conscience clause. If a doctor in a military hospital overseas should say: because of my personal religious beliefs or my conscience, I cannot perform an abortion procedure, there is absolutely no requirement in the Murray amendment that person be involved. The same conscience clause that applies in most hospitals in the United States applies in this amendment. 
   This is the bottom line: Men and women in uniform are asked to risk their lives in defense of our country. God bless them that they are willing to do that. But should women in the military also be asked to risk their health and their lives because they want to exercise their own constitutional right to decide about their own reproductive health care? That is the bottom line. 
   It really gets down to a very simple question: Why would we treat women in the military who have volunteered to serve this country as second-class citizens? 
   Sue Bailey, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, recently wrote:  
   The Department of Defense believes it is unfair for female service members, particularly those members assigned to overseas locations, to be denied their constitutional right to a full range of reproductive health care, to include abortion. The availability of quality reproductive health care ought to be available to all female members of the military.  
   So we know where the military stands. The Department of Defense supports this amendment by Senator MURRAY. 
   There is a current provision in the law for servicewomen overseas, when they have their life at stake or they have been victims of rape or incest, to have an abortion service at a military hospital. This has been stated by those on the floor. But there is no provision, no protection whatever, for that same servicewoman who discovers during the course of her pregnancy that because of her own medical condition continuing the pregnancy may be a threat to her health. A doctor can diagnose during the course of a pregnancy the continuing that pregnancy might result in a young woman never being able to bear another child. Perhaps that baby she is carrying is so fatally deformed it will not survive. And according to those who oppose the Murray amendment, that servicewoman is on her own. 
   What is her recourse? Well, maybe she will turn to a doctor in that foreign country, hoping that she will get someone who is professional and can perform a service that won't harm her more than a continued pregnancy might. Frankly, the alternative is to get on a plane and fly to another location, another country, or back to the United States, wait for space 
   available, or pay for it on commercial fare. Is that the kind of burden we want to impose on young women who volunteer to defend the United States, take away the constitutional right available to every American woman, to say to them, if you find yourself in a delicate or difficult medical situation, it is up to you, at your cost, to get out of that country and find a doctor, a hospital, a clinic, that can serve you? That is the bottom line, as far as I am concerned. 
   This is a question of simple fairness. It is a question of restoring a policy which was in the law between 1973 and 1988 and again from 1993 to 1996. 
   Senator MURRAY has said to those who oppose abortion--and many in this Chamber do--to those who oppose the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade, you are entitled to your point of view; You are entitled to make the speeches you want to make; But you are not entitled to deny to servicewomen overseas the same constitutional rights we give to every woman in America. We will debate abortion for many years to come, whether or not the Supreme Court sustains Roe v. Wade. 
   So long as it is the constitutional right in our country for women to consider their own privacy and their own reproductive health and make those personal decisions with their doctor, with their family, with their conscience, we should not deny that same right to women who are serving in the military. 
   The women in our Armed Forces already give up many freedoms and risk their lives to defend our country. They should not have to sacrifice their privacy, their health, and their basic constitutional rights for a policy with no valid military purpose. 
   I rise in strong support of this amendment, a bipartisan amendment, by Senator MURRAY and Senator SNOWE of Maine. I hope my colleagues will show respect for the women who serve in our military by voting in favor of this amendment. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today having arrived back in the country in the early morning hours from a trip which I took to Colombia this weekend with Senator JACK REED of Rhode Island. I had never been to this country before. In fact, I had never been to South America. But I have come to understand, as most Americans do, that what is happening in that country thousands of miles away has a direct impact on the quality of life in America. 
   Senator REED and I spent a little over 2 days there in intense meetings with the President of Colombia, the Secretary of Defense, and the head of the national police. We met with human rights groups. 
   It is hard to imagine, but yesterday we were in the southern reaches of Colombia in a province known as Putumayo, which is the major cocaine-producing section of South America in Colombia. 
   It was a whirlwind visit but one that I think is timely, because there is a request by the Clinton administration to appropriate over $1 billion for what is known as ``Plan Colombia.'' Plan Colombia is an effort by the President of Colombia, Andres Pastrana, to try to take the control of his country away from the guerrillas and the right-wing terrorists, and try to put an end to the narcotrafficking. 
   The narcotrafficking out of Colombia is primarily cocaine, but it includes heroin. It is now estimated that Colombia supplies 85 to 95 percent of the world's supply of cocaine. How does that affect America? I think we all know very well how it affects America. 
   In my home State of Illinois, the prison population has dramatically increased over the last few years at great cost to the taxpayers in an effort to reduce drug crime in the streets of my State. That story is repeated over and over in States across the Nation. 
   So what is happening in the jungles of Colombia in the cultivation of cocaine has a direct impact on the quality of life in America. That is why President Pastrana has called for a coordinated effort by the United States and the European powers as well to bring his country under control and to end the narcotrafficking. It hits quite a resounding note with most Americans. 
   You would not imagine what it was like yesterday flying over the jungles  of Colombia to look down from a Blackhawk helicopter as a Colombian general pointed out to me all of the coca fields that were under cultivation in the jungle. 
   If you take a step back, we now have the capacity by satellite to take photographs of Colombia, and we can actually pick out where the cocaine fields are located by satellite imagery. When they produce these maps, which I saw over the weekend, you can see provinces such as Putumayo that are virtually covered with cocaine production. 
   What is the cocaine production worth to the locals? Some estimate that a given hectare, or 2.2 acres roughly, can produce 
   some 8.6 kilograms of cocaine during the course of a year. That involves about six harvests. A kilogram is a little over 2 pounds. So you are producing about 17 pounds of cocaine on each 1 of these hectares. 
   What is it worth to the local farmer? He receives about $900 for each kilogram. As you multiply it out, you realize it is a profitable undertaking for many. 
   Then if you want to understand the true value of the cocaine economics, consider that as it moves up the chain, it becomes more and more expensive. The guerrilla who takes the cocaine out of the fields from the landowner and the farmer is going to turn around and turn it into coca paste, a rough paste. It is now going to increase the value from $900 up to over $1,000. 
   The next move is to the trafficker who converts it into the white powder, and that will triple the value of it to some $3,000 for 2 pounds. 
   Now it is headed to the clandestine airstrip where it is going to be shipped to the United States, and in that process maybe go through Mexico, wherever it might be, on its way to the United States. Now it is up from $3,000 to $7,500 for 2 pounds. Then it arrives on the streets of Washington, DC, where it can sell for $60,000--2 pounds of cocaine. 
   When you look at the economics, you can understand why, starting with the peasant farmer and moving up through the chains of guerrillas, traffickers, and exporters, there is so much money to be made that they are willing to take the risk. 
   The World Bank estimated last week that the drug trade in Colombia generates some $1 billion a year in revenue to the guerrillas. These are not people living off the land, as we understand guerrillas. These are the folks who are in the narcobusiness big time, and with this money they can afford to literally create towns, which they have done in some of the remote parts of Colombia. 
   The standing joke, I guess, in Colombia is that if you want to know how well the drug lords are doing, take a look at how sophisticated the discotheque is that they have just created. In one of the towns, one of the most remote jungle areas of Colombia, they created a city and a discotheque with the most sophisticated sound equipment in the world. It was raided, taken over, and closed down. But it shows you the capacity with the money they have. 
   The question before the United States is, What can we do to address this cultivation of cocaine, as well as the emergence of the guerrilla groups, as well as the right wing terrorist groups who have made extortion and kidnapping and narcodrug trafficking a matter of course in this Nation? 
   We try to develop these counternarcotic battalions in Colombia that will attack the guerrillas, and go after them and their narcotrafficking. I visited this camp known as Tres Esquinas yesterday and saw 2,000 young Colombians who are being trained to be better soldiers and will be able to fight. 
   We have a debate going on as to whether we will send them helicopters. It is a big investment. The Blackhawk helicopter, I am told, runs around $10 million, $11 million, $12 million per helicopter. The so-called Huey helicopters, the older models, are slower, slightly smaller, and less expensive. But they don't believe it is up to the task they need to do in Colombia. We will debate sending the helicopters to support those troops to go after the guerrillas supporting this narcotrafficking that sends cocaine to the United States. 
   We are in this and we are in it big time. I came back from a meeting over the weekend, with the impression that we have to sit down at several levels and say these are the things on which we should insist. First, accountability from the Colombians. Any dollars sent by the United States need to be spent for good cause to put an end to this drug trafficking. We need to ask and demand of the Colombian military that they bring in more reform so that they end corruption. Historically, the Colombian army, in many cases, has been in league with the people who are either on the guerrilla side or the right-wing terrorist side. That is changing. I am glad to see it is changing. The new general in charge, General Tapias, is bringing reform. It is a move in the right direction. 
   The so-called Leahy amendment, named after Senator PAT LEAHY of Vermont, says no money goes to Colombia unless their army shows progress on human rights. I think we should insist on that as part of any discussion. 
   In addition, we have to accept the reality that no plan is going to work in Colombia unless it starts with the peasant farmer who is trying to grow something on his land to feed his family. Growing the coca plant and selling it is profitable. We need to talk about alternative agriculture if this is going to work. We talked about the vast expanse of Colombia and that challenge. That has to be part of the program. 
   In addition, we need to discuss how we eliminate these coca plants. Now we are spraying them. It is called fumigation. This herbicide that is sprayed is roughly comparable to one that we are familiar with in America known as Roundup. It is a basic chemical. Once it hits the leaves of the coca plants, it destroys them. I met yesterday with some of the pilots who are on contract with the United States to destroy these coca plants. It is incredible that they can take the satellite imagery which tells them where the coca fields are, convert it through the global positioning system into exact coordinates so they can fly at night and spray this herbicide on the coca plants, killing them, by spraying within 12 inches. That is the accuracy of the spraying, even 
   taking into consideration wind drift. They are fast at work trying to do this. Imagine a strip of land that is some 300 miles long and 3 miles wide. That is what we are talking about in this one province, the square mileage of coca cultivation, how much spraying has to be done to kill the plants. Sometimes we have to come back the next year and do it again. The farmer tries to get around it again. 
   There is a lot to be done, a lot of investment to be made. Clearly, from our point of view in the United States, this is something we should take seriously. When we think of the impact of narcotics and drugs on America and what it means to the safety of each one of us in our homes and neighborhoods and communities, the fact that those who are drug addicts, desperate to buy this drug, will do virtually anything, commit any crime, in order to come up with the resources to feed their habit, we can understand why that drug coming out of Colombia has a direct impact on the United States. 
   Let me talk for a moment about the other side of the equation. It would be naive to believe that this is just a supply side problem, that if we eliminate the supply of cocaine and heroin that America will see an end to drug crimes. We know better. We know there are alternative drugs currently being developed in America, American-grown products that are competing with the traditional drugs. Methamphetamine was started in Mexico, went to California, and now has swept the country. In the rural areas of Illinois, in the small town farming areas of Illinois, they are discovering these methamphetamine labs that can be built with items that are purchased at a local hardware store and can be developed into a drug which is very addictive and destructive. 
   It is important as we look at the narcotics problem in America to establish that it is not only interdiction and elimination of supply we need to address, but also demand. That takes a lot of effort and a myriad of approaches which have been promulgated by this Senate, the House, and so many different agencies. 
   We should take into consideration the limited opportunity for drug addicts in this country to have access to rehabilitation. In other words, if you  were a drug addict in this country and decided you were sick and tired of this life and wanted to change and wanted to eliminate your addiction, would you be able to turn someplace for help? Too many times, the answer is no. There is no drug rehab available. The addict stays on the street. He might have had a conversion at one point and wanted to change his life and found there was nowhere to turn. 
   Let me give an illustration. In my home State of Illinois, in 1987, about 500 people were imprisoned in our State prisons for the possession of a thimble full of cocaine, a tiny amount of cocaine; today in the State of Illinois for possession of the same amount of cocaine, about a thimble full, we have 9,000 prisoners. In 13 years, it went from 500 prisoners to 9,000. It costs roughly $30,000 a year to incarcerate someone in Illinois prisons. We are spending on an annual basis just for those 9,000 prisoners--out of a total prison population of 45,000--we are spending about $270 million a year in the State of Illinois. That story is repeated in every State in the Nation. 
   When we talk about $1 billion to Colombia for the interdiction of drugs, and it seems like an overwhelming amount, 
   put it in the context of what the drugs are doing in America. Remember, too, as I said earlier, it is not only the supply side; it is the demand side. In my State of Illinois, a person incarcerated for a drug crime serves about 9 months in prison and then they are out again. Half the people in our prison population are released during the course of a year. Those who think we will put them away and throw away the key ought to take a closer look at the statistics. Half the people in prisons are coming out each year. Who are they when they come out? We know when they went in they were criminals. In the case of addicts, we know they came into prison with the drug addiction which led to a crime, which might have led to a theft or something worse, a violent crime, and they went into prison for the average 9-month incarceration. We also know in my State of Illinois, it is very rare, if ever, that the person in the Illinois prison system has any opportunity for drug rehab while he is in prison. So he comes in an addict and he leaves an addict. In the meantime, though, he has joined some fraternities of gang members and veteran criminals who told him how to be a better criminal when he goes back on the street. 
   That is very shortsighted. What have we achieved? We have brought an addict in and released an addict 9 months later to go out and commit another crime. We have to look not only to the supply side of the equation and interdiction, but also the demand side: How do we start reducing demand in this country for these drugs so we can have a more peaceful and just society? 
   I am happy I took the weekend to be in Colombia and to learn first hand some of the things we are facing. I certainly hope my colleagues will avail themselves of an opportunity to learn of things that we should be considering as part of a plan with Colombia and as part of our effort to reduce this narcotics dependence in the United States.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am also concerned about another issue which has become very timely. It is related to recent statements by officials in Russia concerning Russia's view of the Baltic countries. I have a personal interest in this. My mother was born in Lithuania, an immigrant to the United States. Over the course of my public career, I have journeyed to the Baltic countries on several occasions and have witnessed the miracle of independence and democracy coming to Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. This was something that many of us had prayed for but never believed would happen in our lifetime; that the Soviet empire would come down and that these three countries, which had been subjugated to the Russians and Soviets in the early forties, would have a chance for their own independence and democracy. 
   In fact, I was able to be there on the day of the first democratic election in Lithuania. My mother was alive at the time, and she and I took great pride that the Lithuanian people had maintained their courage and dignity throughout the years of Soviet occupation and now would be given a chance to have their own country again. 
   I have met with the leaders of these countries. I am particularly close to the President of Lithuania, Valdas Adamkus. The story of Mr. Adamkus is amazing. He fought the Nazis in World War II and then fought the Soviets and finally decided he had to escape and came to the United States where he went to school and settled in Chicago, became an engineer, went to work for the Environmental Protection Agency, spent a lifetime of civil service, receiving awards from Presidents for his service to our country, and then at the time of his retirement announced that he was going to move back to Lithuania at the age of 70 and run for President. When Mr. Adamkus came to me and suggested that, I thought, well, it is a wonderful dream; surely, it is not going to happen. And he won, much to the surprise of everyone. He is currently the President of Lithuania; he is very popular. He believes, as I do, that the freedom in Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia is something that we in the West must carefully guard. 
   Those of us who for 50 years protested the Soviet takeover of these countries cannot ignore the fact they are still in a very vulnerable position. Not one of these countries has a standing army or anything like a missile arsenal or anything like a national defense. Yet they look across the borders to their neighbors in Russia and Belarus and see very highly armed situations--and in many cases very threatening. 
   That is why the recent statements by Vladimir Putin, the new President in Russia, are so troubling. According to the Washington Post on June 15, Russian President Vladimir Putin made a statement in which he said that fulfilling the aspirations of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania for NATO membership would be a reckless act that removed a key buffer zone and posed a major strategic challenge to Moscow that could, in his words, ``destabilize'' Europe. 
   The Russian Foreign Ministry issued a statement on June 9 of this year that claimed that Lithuania's forceable annexation in 1940 was voluntary. 
   This is an outrageous rewrite of history. The Soviets were legendary for their rewrites. They would rewrite history and decide that they, in fact, had developed an airplane first, an automobile first, all these affirmations, and Stalin was, in 
   fact, a benevolent leader and was not a ruthless dictator. All of these revisions were used to scoff at the West. 
   We thought that the end of the Russian empire would be the end of revisionist history. Unfortunately, Mr. Putin and his leadership in Moscow are starting to turn back to the same old ways. By the statements that they have made, they have said, if we went forward with allowing the Baltic States into NATO, it would be an explicit threat to the sovereignty of Russia. And they also go on to say it could destabilize Europe. 
   Such a threat by the Russian Federation against security in Europe cannot go unchallenged, and that is why I come to the Senate floor today. It is incredible that the Russian President would continue to call the Baltic countries ``buffer States'' that would presumably have no say in their own security in the future and could once again be subjugated with impunity. To suggest that the Baltic nations are somehow pawns to be moved back and forth across the board by leaders in Russia is totally unacceptable. It is unbelievable that the Russian Foreign Ministry could forget the secret Molotov-Ribbentrop pact that carved up Eastern Europe between Hitler and Stalin, that moment in time when the Nazis and Communists in Russia were in alliance, in league with one another, and through respective foreign ministers basically gave away countries. 
   At that moment in time, the Baltic States were annexed into the Soviet Union against their will, and for more than 50 years we in the United States protested that. It was the so-called Captive Nations Day we celebrated on Capitol Hill and across America to remember that those Baltic States and so many other countries were brought into the Soviet empire against their will. Somehow, Mr. Putin in this new century is suggesting that we did not understand history; the Baltic nations really wanted to be part of the Soviet  Union. That is a ridiculous statement, and it defies history and defies the facts that everyone knows. It is beyond belief that the Russian Foreign Minister would claim that the Red Army troops occupying the Baltic countries in June of 1940 were not the reason that these countries so-called ``joined'' the Soviet Union. Listen to the statement by the Russian Foreign Minister.  
   The August 3, 1940 decision of USSR Supreme Soviet to admit Lithuania into the Soviet Union was preceded by corresponding appeals from the highest representative bodies of the Baltic States. 
   Therefore it would be wrong to interpret Lithuania's admission to the USSR as a result of the latter's unilateral actions. All assertions that Lithuanian was ``occupied'' and ``annexed'' by the Soviet Union and related claims of any kind of neglect, political, historical and legal realities therefore are groundless.  
   This is the statement by the Russian Foreign Minister. 
   Let me tell you, he not only ignores the history of 1940 which is very clear, but he ignores the fact that in 1991 the Russian Foreign Ministry entered into a treaty with Lithuania in which Russia explicitly admitted that the 1940 Soviet annexation violated Lithuanian sovereignty and that Lithuania, they said, at the time was free to pursue its own security agreements and arrangements. So in 1991, in those enlightened moments as the Soviet empire came down and Russia became a new State with democratic elections, they entered into a treaty with Lithuania and acknowledged the reality that Lithuania was forcibly annexed 
   into the Soviet Union. They said in 1991 Lithuania had the right, as the Baltic States do, to pursue their security arrangements. 
   Now, when Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia talk about membership in NATO, the Russian Foreign Minister and Russian President Putin come forward and say unacceptably, it would destabilize Europe; it would eliminate the so-called ``buffer States.'' They still view these countries as vassals, as pawns to be used. They will not acknowledge the sovereignty which should be acknowledged of these countries. 
   These disturbing statements show clearly why the Baltic countries must be admitted to NATO; that is, to show Russia and any neighboring country that it must give up its territorial ambitions against NATO membership for the Baltic countries, and it would make it critically clear that the West would never again accept ``buffer State'' subjugation of them. The idea that the three tiny Baltic States could threaten the enormous and powerful Russian Federation is laughable. If Russia has no design on the Baltic States, it has nothing to fear from their membership in NATO.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have spoken about the drug problems in America and this issue of foreign policy. But there is another issue which is a continuing concern across America. It is the fact that this Senate and Congress have failed to act on the problem in America of gun violence. It has been a little over a year since the Columbine tragedy, but still the leadership in this Congress refuses to enact sensible gun safety legislation. 
   Most will recall that a little over a year ago, we passed in this Chamber, with the tie breaking vote of Vice President GORE, legislation which would allow us to do background checks on people who buy guns at gun shows. If you go to buy a gun here in America, they are going to ask some questions: Do you have a history of committing a crime; a history of violent mental illness; are you old enough to own a gun? That is part of the Brady law. And with that law, we stopped some 500,000 people from buying guns in America who were, in fact, people with a criminal record or a history of violent and mental illness, or children. We stopped it--half a million of them--but there is a big loophole there. If you go to the so-called gun shows which we have in Illinois and States such as Texas and all over the country, these gun bazaars and flea markets do not have any background checks. 
   You do not have to be John Dillinger and the greatest criminal mind to understand if you need a gun, do not go to a gun dealer, go to a gun show. No questions are asked; you can buy it on the spot. 
   We passed a law. We said we have to close this loophole. If we really want to keep guns out of the hands of people who will misuse them, we need a background check at gun shows. That was part of our bill. 
   The second part of the bill related to a provision with which Senator KOHL from Wisconsin came forward. It said if you sell a handgun in America, it should have a child safety protection device, or so-called trigger lock. You have seen them. They look like little padlocks. You put them over the trigger so if a child gets his hands on a gun, he or she will not be able to pull the trigger and harm anyone. 
   Is this important? It is critically important. We read every day in the newspapers about kids being harmed, killing their playmates, and terrible things occurring when they find a handgun. It is naive for any gun owner to believe if they have a gun in the house, they can successfully hide a gun. Children are always going to find Christmas gifts and guns. We have to acknowledge that as parents. If they find Christmas gifts, it is disappointing. If they find guns, it can be tragic. 
   Those who say they will not have a gun in their house if they have little kids may not have peace of mind if they know their playmates' parents own guns and do not have a trigger lock on them. 
   We said as a matter of standard safety in America, we want every handgun to be sold with a trigger lock. Is it an inconvenience for the gun owner? Yes, let's concede that fact. Do we face inconveniences every day bringing safety to our country and to our lives? Of course we do. Have you gone through an airport lately? Did you have to put that purse or that briefcase on the conveyor belt? Did you go through the metal detector? It is inconvenient, isn't it? It slowed you down, didn't it? We all do it because we do not want terrorists on airplanes and we want to fly safely. 
   So the idea of a trigger lock on a handgun I do not believe is a major obstacle to gun ownership or using a gun safely and legally. That was the second part of the bill that passed and went over to the House of Representatives. 
   The third part is one that is hardly arguable, and that is, we ban the domestic manufacture of high-capacity ammunition clips in this country, clips that can hold up to 100 or more bullets. The belief was nobody needed them. The only people who would need those would be the military or police. The average person has no need for them. 
   I said time and again that if a person needs an assault weapon or some sort of automatic weapon with a 100-round clip to shoot a deer, they ought to stick to fishing. Sadly, there are people who found if you could not manufacture these high-capacity ammo clips in the United States, you could import them from overseas. The third part of our gun safety legislation said we are going to stop the importation of high-capacity ammo clips which are designed to kill people. They have nothing to do with legitimate sports or hunting. 
   Three provisions: Background checks at gun shows, trigger locks on handguns when they are sold, and no more importation of high-capacity ammo clips. Do those sound like radical ideas to you? They do not to me. They sound like a commonsense effort 
   to keep guns out of the hands of people who would misuse them. 
   We barely passed the bill. The National Rifle Association, the gun lobby, opposed it. The bill received 49 votes for, 49 votes against. Vice President AL GORE sat in that chair, as he is entitled under the Constitution, and cast the tie-breaking vote--50-49. The bill went to the House of Representatives--this is after Columbine--and with all this determination, we said: We are finally going to do something to respond to gun violence. 
   Of course, when it went over to the House of Representatives, the gun lobby, the National Rifle Association, piled it on, and the bill was decimated. There is nothing in it that looks like what I described. Then it went to conference. We are supposed to work out differences between the House and the Senate in conference. They have sat on it for a year, and every day in America, 12 or 13 children are killed by guns. The same number of kids who died at Columbine die each day, not in one place but all across America. They are kids  who commit suicide. They are kids who are gang bangers shooting up innocent people. They are kids who are playing with their playmates. 
   The gun tragedy continues in America, and this Congress refuses to do anything. Many of us come to the floor of the Senate on a regular basis as a reminder to our colleagues in Congress that this issue will not go away because gun violence is not going away, and we need to do something to make America safer. 
   Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. Until we act, the Democratic leadership in the Senate who supports this gun safety legislation will read some names into the RECORD of those who lost their lives to gun violence in the past year and will continue to do so every day the Senate is in session. In the name of those who have died and their families, we will continue this fight. 
   The following are the names of just some of the people killed by gunfire 1 year ago on the dates that I mention. On June 19, 1999, these were the gun victims in just some of the States and some of the cities across America: 
   Milton Coleman, 58, Gary, IN; Darnell Green, 28, Gary, IN; Ronald Hari, 25, Chicago, IL; David Jackson, 23, St. Louis, MO; Andre Johnson, 24, Detroit, MI; Eien Johnson, 19, Detroit, MI; Nakia Johnson, 22, Philadelphia, PA; Lewis Lackey, 47, Baltimore, MD; Malcolm Mitchell, Gary, IN; Mann Murphy, 76 Detroit, MI; Robert Rodriguez, 31, Houston TX; Donnell Roland, 20, Kansas City, MO; Denise Wojciechowski, 33, Chicago, IL; an unidentified male, 36, Long Beach, CA; another unidentified male, 53, Nashville, TN; another unidentified male, 19, Newark, NJ.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the reason these names are being read is to share with my colleagues in the Senate the fact that this is not just another issue. The issue of gun safety and gun violence in America is an ongoing tragedy, a tragedy which we will read about in tomorrow morning's paper and the next morning's paper and every day thereafter until we in this country come forward with a sensible gun safety policy to keep guns out of the hands of those who misuse them. 
   I have seen the National Rifle Association, Mr. Heston, and all of his claims about second amendment rights to the ownership of guns. I believe people have a right to own guns, so long as they do so safely and legally, but I do not believe there is a single right under our Constitution--not one--that does not carry with it a responsibility. 
   There is a responsibility on the part of gun owners across America to buy their guns in a way that will keep guns out of the hands of those who would misuse them and to store their guns in a way so they are safely away from children who would use guns and hurt themselves and others, and not to demand guns in America that have no legitimate sport, hunting, or self-defense purpose. 
   Most Americans agree with what I have just said. I think it is a majority opinion in this country. It is clearly not the feeling of the Republican leadership in the Senate and the House of Representatives. They have continued to bottle up this legislation which would move us closer to the day when we have a safer society and when families and communities across America can breathe a sigh of relief that the crime statistics and gun statistics about which we read are continuing to go down and not up.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the last item I want to address today is relative to a suggestion by the Vice President of the United States to create what is known as a Medicare lockbox. There have been many suggestions made during the course of this Presidential campaign about Social Security and Medicare. It is no surprise. There are hardly any programs in Washington, DC, that affect so many people and affect the quality of life of so many families across America. I am proud to be a member of the Democratic Party which, under Franklin Roosevelt, created Social Security. 
   We took a group of Americans--our parents and grandparents, the seniors in America, who were literally one of the most impoverished classes in our society--and said: With Social Security, we will create for you a safety net. With this safety net, when you go into retirement in your senior years, you are going to have some peace of mind that you will not be destitute and poor and have to depend on your children for your livelihood. 
   Social Security has worked. It has now become a very bipartisan program--and it should. Democrats, Republicans, and Independents alike understand that this safety net for seniors and for disabled people in our country really makes America a better place. 
   In the 1960s, President Lyndon Johnson--another Democrat--came up with the idea of Medicare. It was not a new one. President Truman had proposed some version of it earlier, and others had talked about it. President Johnson, with his legislative skill, was able to pass Medicare. 
   In Medicare, we said we would create for America a health insurance program for the elderly. This again was considered socialistic, radical, by its critics. They said America does not need this, that everything will be just fine. 
   Yet we see what has happened since we introduced and passed the Medicare program. Seniors are living longer. They are more independent. They are healthier. They are active. They are leading great lives because of the combination of Social Security and Medicare. 
   Many of us want to take care that in the midst of any Presidential debate about these two programs, we do not go on any risky escapade that could endanger the life of these programs. There are too many people who depend on them; and not just the seniors, but their children who expect Social Security and Medicare to be there. 
   George W. Bush, the Governor of Texas, and soon to be the Republican nominee for President, has proposed changing the Social Security system so that there could be a private investment factor so that individuals could direct the investment of some of their Social Security funds into private investments. 
   On its face, a lot of people who own stocks and mutual funds across America would say: Goodness, that gives me a chance to increase the amount of money I can put into these types of investments. Perhaps if the stock market continues to do well, I will profit from it. It is a surface reaction you might expect that is positive among some American families. But the real issue is, how would we come up with the same level of protection in Social Security if we started taking money out and letting people direct it as they care to in their own private investments? 
   The basic benefits on which many elderly depend for almost all of their retirement income could be cut by as much as 40 percent. How can that be, if George Bush is only talking about a few percentage points of investment? 
   Social Security is a pay-as-you-go program. The amount of money we collect in the payroll taxes goes out to pay today's seniors. When I become a senior citizen, eligible for Social Security--if I live that long--I will be paid by the current wage earners in the payroll tax that is collected from them. 
   It is a pay-as-you-go system. If at any point in time you want to remove some 2 percent, or whatever the number might 
   be, of the money that workers are paying into Social Security, it  has a direct impact on today's seniors because they do not have the pool of money coming in to sustain today's Social Security needs. 
   So when there is a proposal made to cut back the amount of contribution by individuals to give them 2 percent of whatever it might be for their own self-directed investment, the obvious question is, Who will pay it? Who will pick up the difference? 
   The basic Social Security benefit is pretty modest across America, but it is important. For workers with a history of average earnings who retired in 1999 at age 62--most people retire before they reach the age of 62, incidentally--their monthly benefit is $825. For the lower earner, the benefit is $501 a month. Despite these modest amounts, Social Security is the major source of retirement income--50 percent or more--for 63 percent of the older population. 
   The whole point of having Social Security is to provide workers with a predictable retirement benefit. 
   Mr. Bush's plan affects these basic retirement benefits in two ways. 
   First, the program has a long-term deficit of about 2 percent of payroll. The deficit isn't Governor Bush's creation, by any means. It confronts anybody attempting to reform the system. But Governor Bush's proposal makes the problem worse by pledging not to add any new money to the Social Security system. 
   Vice President GORE has said, let's take the surplus and pay down the national debt by paying off the internal debt of Social Security and Medicare. We collect $1 billion in taxes a day from businesses, families, and individuals to pay interest on our national debt. 
   I think the most responsible thing we can do, in a time of surplus, is to take the extra dollars and reduce that debt and reduce the interest we pay and our children will pay for things we did many years ago. I know that is conservative. It isn't as flashy as proposing tax cuts. But I think it is sound. We do not know if these surpluses will be there forever, but as long as they are here, let us pay down the debt of this country. That is the position of President Clinton, Vice President GORE, and the Democratic side of the aisle. 
   On the other side, from Republican Governor Bush, and many Republican leaders, we are told, no, no, no, take this surplus, as it exists, give tax cuts to certain people, and change the Social Security system, and do not address the fundamental concern about this $6 trillion national debt we continue to finance on a daily basis to the tune of $1 billion a day in Federal tax collections. 
   I hope during the course of this debate on reforming Social Security, whether the proposal is from the Democrats or the Republicans, that families across America will look long and hard at whether these proposals are in fact honest, whether they use real numbers, whether they really affect the future of America in a positive way and can continue this economic growth we have seen, and whether they are in fact the kinds of things which reflect the values of this country. 
   When we take a look at some of the proposals coming from the candidates in the Presidential race, particularly on Governor Bush's part, I do not think they meet that test. 
   I am going to close now because I see my colleague from Arkansas has come to the floor. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor to Senator LINCOLN.

   Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, let me say at the outset to my colleague and friend, the Senator from Utah, Mr. HATCH, that it was my honor to serve on the Judiciary Committee when he was chairman and I was a member of that committee. I hope someday to return. It is an interesting and exciting assignment. Occasionally we even agreed. They were rare moments, but there were those moments. I never, at any moment in time, lost any respect for the Senator from Utah and the values he espouses. I believe he is a person of good faith who will genuinely try to find a common ground. I sincerely hope he will. 
   I listened to his explanation of his amendment on this issue, and I really think it comes down to a classic debate, which has been on the floor of this Senate many times in its history, when we were discussing whether or not African Americans were to become full citizens of the United States with all of their rights and responsibilities. There were those on the floor who said: It is not a Federal issue; let the States decide; the Federal Government should not get involved in this. 
   There have been issues involving religious persecution--whether it is people of the Senator's faith, or my faith, or many others. There have been those who said this a State-and-local matter to decide, it should not be a Federal issue. 
   The same thing was true when it came to elevating women in America from their status in the Constitution--which we revere, but a Constitution which, frankly, did not give the women the right to vote when it was initially drafted. When the 
   debate came on about the rights of women, it was usually couched in terms of federalism: Should the Federal Government get involved in this; or, this is a State issue. 
   We can remember the hot debates over the equal rights amendment and all that entailed. The same thing has been true throughout history, the way I read it--whether we are talking about blacks, women, or people of a certain faith, or whether we are talking about people who have certain disabilities. We have always come down to this debate: Is this issue any business of the Federal Government? 
   I respectfully disagree with my colleague and friend, the Senator from Utah. I think when it comes to hate crimes, this is an issue for the Nation to solve. To leave it to individual States to make the decisions is in fact to subject some Americans to less protection than others when it comes to being victims of hate crimes.

   Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Utah. 
   Let me say first how proud I am to cosponsor the legislation that has been introduced by the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. KENNEDY, and the Senator from the State of Oregon, Mr. SMITH. It is bipartisan legislation. Senator CARL LEVIN of Michigan is also one of the lead sponsors of it as well. 
   The difference, as I understand it, between the proposal of the Senator from Utah and the proposal of Senators KENNEDY and SMITH really comes down to one basic point. As I understand it, the Senator from Utah is looking to, first, provide grants to States and localities so they can prosecute these crimes when they are found deserving; and, second, to study the issue to determine whether or not there is a need for Federal legislation. 
   As I understand the amendment before us by Senators KENNEDY and SMITH, it basically creates a Federal cause of action, expanding on what we now have in current law in terms of hate crimes, and expanding the categories of activities that would be covered by this hate crime legislation. 
   I say to the Senator from Utah, if he is on the floor, I believe the Senator from Massachusetts will provide ample evidence of the need for this legislation. I believe the statistics are not only there but they are overwhelming in terms of the reason he is introducing this amendment and why we need this national cause of action. 
   Second, during the course of my remarks I would like to address squarely the issue raised by the Senator from Utah, an issue that has been raised by the Supreme Court. It is, frankly, whether or not we have the authority to create this cause of action. 
   The Senator uses recent Supreme Court decisions relating to the commerce clause. When it came to the Violence Against Women Act, it is my understanding the Supreme Court ruled that they could not find the necessary connection between the Violence Against Women Act and the commerce clause to justify Federal activity in this area. 
   If the Senator from Utah will follow this debate, I think he will find that the Senator from Massachusetts and the Senator from Oregon are taking a different approach. They are using the 13th amendment as a basis for this legislation. They also establish an option of the commerce clause. But they are grounding it on a 13th amendment principle of law and Federal jurisdiction, which our Department of Justice agrees would overcome the arguments that have been raised in the Supreme Court under its current composition of overextension of the commerce clause. 
   I hope as the Senator from Utah reflects on this debate, the information provided by the Senator from Massachusetts, and the new constitutional approach to this, that he may reconsider offering this amendment. As good as it is to study the problem further and to provide additional funds, it doesn't address the bottom line; that is, to make sure there will at least be the option of a Federal cause of action in every jurisdiction in America. 
   I would be happy to yield to the Senator from Utah for a question.

   Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will look closely at the Kennedy-Smith amendment, he will find before the Federal cause of action can be initiated--as I understand it, but I defer to either of the major sponsors--before there can be a Federal indictment under this proposed hate crime, the Department of Justice must certify two things: First, reasonable cause to believe that the crime was motivated by bias; second, addressing the very issue raised by the Senator from Utah, the U.S. attorney has to certify that he has consulted with State or local law enforcement officials and determined one of the following situations is present, and he lists four situations. 
   First, the State does not have jurisdiction or does not intend to exercise jurisdiction; second, the State has requested that the Justice Department assume jurisdiction; third, the State doesn't object to the Justice Department assuming jurisdiction; or fourth, the State has completed prosecution and the Justice Department wants to initiate a subsequent prosecution. 
   When the Senator from Utah suggests that the Kennedy-Smith amendment will necessitate Federal control, I think, frankly, that when you look at the certification required by the Federal Government before the action can be undertaken, we clearly have a situation where the State has either no jurisdiction, or has invited the Justice Department to initiate the prosecution, or they have completed their prosecution. 
   In this amendment, the first option is clearly being given to the States. If they have the authority and exercise it, clearly they will not be preempted by this Federal cause of action, as I understand it. If that is the case, I think it addresses the major concern raised by the Senator from Utah. 
   Why do we need this new law? We have a 30-year-old Federal statute which says when it comes to hate crimes, we have to find a specific federally protected activity. Congress, in the past, tried to ``prophesize,'' if you will, the types of activities  that might be involved in a hate crime. We came up with six activities: Enrolling in or attending a public school or private college; No. 2, participating in a service or action provided by State or local government; No. 3, applying for employment or actually working; No. 4, service on a jury in State or Federal court; No. 5, traveling in interstate commerce or using a facility of interstate commerce; and No. 6, enjoying the goods and services of certain places of public accommodation. 
   We have said over the years if this activity is involved and there is evidence of a hate crime, then the Federal prosecutors can step in. 
   I believe--and I don't want to put words in their mouths --Senators KENNEDY and SMITH have said we have found too many cases arising which do not fall within the four corners of these six federally protected activities. Therefore, they are offering an amendment which gives Federal prosecutors more opportunity to consider the possibility of prosecution. 
   I am wearing a button today that says ``Remember Matthew.'' Matthew, of course, is Matthew Shepard. Two years ago, Matthew Shepard, an openly gay college student in Wyoming, was brutally beaten. He was burned, he was tied to a wooden fence in a remote area, and left to die in freezing temperatures from exposure. 
   Despite this heinous act which we all read about, no Federal prosecution was even possible under the Shepard case. The existing State crime law and federally protected activities that are defined in it did not include what happened to Matthew Shepard. The current Federal statute does not include hate crimes based on a victim's sexual orientation, gender, or disability. The Kennedy-Smith amendment, which I am cosponsoring, corrects that very grievous omission. 
   I think the Senator from Utah would concede that when we are talking about hate crimes, we should certainly include crimes based on sexual orientation, gender, or disability. The Matthew Shepard case would not have been included, as I understand it. That is why the Kennedy-Smith amendment is so important.

   Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to defer to the sponsors of the amendment to respond and yield time if they desire. 
   The information I have been given is this: Under the 13th amendment, Congress may prohibit hate crimes based on actual or perceived race, color, religion, or national origin, pursuant to that amendment. Under the 13th amendment, Congress has the authority not only to prevent the ``actual imposition of slavery or involuntary servitude'' but to ensure that none of the ``badges and incidents'' of slavery or involuntary servitude exist in the United States. 
   What the Justice Department and what the sponsors of this amendment have concluded is that the 13th amendment gives the appropriate Federal jurisdiction and nexus to pursue this matter under the question of whether or not this is a badge or incident of that form of discrimination. 
   I don't want to go any further. I am sure the Senator from Massachusetts will explain this in more detail, but this 13th amendment nexus, I think, overcomes the concern of the Senator from Utah about the interpretations recently handed down.

   Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Utah. Let me say parenthetically I think there is more value to this dialog and exchange than many monologs we hear on the Senate floor. 
   I thank the Senator for his interest and staying to question me, and I am sure we will question him during the course of this debate. 
   I know there are other Members seeking recognition at this point. I will try to wrap up. 
   I do not want to in any way misrepresent the amendment that is been offered by Senators KENNEDY and SMITH. I think the statements I have made to date are accurate. The Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act that is before us, the Kennedy-Smith amendment, was drafted carefully and modified to assure its constitutionality under current Supreme Court precedents, as has been referred to by the Senator from Utah. It has been reexamined in light of the Morrison decision. Moreover, the Department of Justice and constitutional scholars have examined this bill and have confidently  determined that the Local Law Enforcement Act will stand up to constitutional scrutiny. 
   Congress may prohibit hate based on race, color, religion, or national origin pursuant to its power to enforce the 13th amendment to the U.S. Constitution because under the 13th amendment Congress has the authority not only to prevent the actual imposition of slavery or involuntary servitude but to ensure that none of the ``badges and incidents'' of slavery or involuntary servitude exists in the United States, which goes to the very point of the Senator from Utah. He reads the 13th amendment and says this goes far beyond prohibiting slavery. But I might say the Supreme Court, in interpreting congressional authority under the 13th amendment, said it could reach beyond the simple question of prohibiting slavery or involuntary servitude. By using the language ``badges and incidents,'' it opened up the opportunity for Congress to consider this authority and for this amendment to be introduced. 
   None of the Supreme Court's recent Federalism decisions casts doubt on Congress' powers under the 13th amendment to eliminate the badges and incidents of slavery. United States v. Morrison involved legislation that was found to exceed Congress' powers under the 14th amendment. The Court in Morrison, for example, found Congress lacked the power to enact the civil remedy of the Violence Against Women Act pursuant to the 14th amendment because the amendment's equal protection guarantee extends only to ``state action.'' The Senator from Utah, who was one of the proponents of this and deserves high praise for it, makes this point in his opening statement on his amendment. 
   Since the Violence Against Women Act was interpreted by this Court to go beyond State action--that is, Government action--the Court struck it down. We are trying our best to reinstate it, but that is the standard. 
   The 13th amendment, however, not the 14th amendment, which they used to strike down the Violence Against Women Act, plainly reaches private conduct as well as Government conduct, and Congress thus is authorized to prohibit private action that constitutes a 
   badge, incident, or relic of slavery. 
   Moreover, this hate crimes amendment would not only apply except where there is an explicit and discrete connection between the prescribed conduct and interstate or foreign commerce, a connection that the Government would be required to allege and prove in each case. This is consistent with Morrison. Like the prohibition of gun possession in the statute at issue in the Lopez case, the Violence Against Women Act civil remedy required no proof of connection between the specific conduct prohibited and interstate commerce. This amendment requires that a nexus exist between the prohibited conduct and interstate or foreign commerce. 
   Madam President, there are many who believe that a hate crime prevention statute is unnecessary. I don't put the Senator from Utah in that category. He has made it clear he is opposed to hate crimes, and I trust his word. I believe he is genuine when he says it. The question is, Who will have the power to enforce it? If the Senate neither has the authority nor wants the authority, if the State does not want to prosecute a hate crime, and yet it has been committed and truly there is a victim, the Kennedy-Smith amendment says we will create the opportunity for a Federal cause of action. 
   We are not forcing the Federal cause of action, but only in the instance where the State either doesn't have authority or has not exercised the authority or in fact defers to the Federal Government or in fact has completed its prosecution and left open the opportunity for such a Federal cause of action. 
   I wish we did not even have to debate hate crimes legislation. Alan Bruce of my staff has been a person I have turned to many times on issues of this magnitude on this subject. He was the one who gave me this button to wear in the Chamber and can remember Matthew Shepard. It is a grim reminder that there are still people in America who will not accept tolerance as the norm, and if we think it is rare, we only have to go to our new technology of the Internet to find the hate being spewed on so many web sites, efforts by small-minded people in this democratic society to turn our anger against our brothers and sisters who live in America, who happen to be a different color, of a different sexual orientation, a different religion, a different gender. This amendment really tries to address it and say that America as a nation will make it clear that we will not tolerate this sort of hateful, spiteful conduct when it results in violence against one of our brothers and sisters. 
   How many times have we read these harrowing details: Jasper, TX, with James Byrd, Jr., 2 years ago dragged to his death when he was hooked by a chain to the back of a pickup truck. They literally found this African-American's body in pieces. 
   The brutal hate-motivated deaths of James Byrd and Mathew Shepard received national attention. Since their deaths, our Nation has thought long and hard about whether this is an America we can tolerate. I think it is not. 
   Madam President, I bring your attention to two crimes in my own State of Illinois just in the last year. 
   April 5, 1999: Naoki Kamijima, 48 years old, a Japanese American shopowner was shot to death in Crystal Lake, IL, right outside of Chicago. The gunman was allegedly searching stores for employees of certain ethnic groups before finding and shooting Mr. Kamijima. Reportedly, the gunman said to employees he left behind after questioning them on their ethnic background, ``This is your lucky day.'' Hours later, Mr. Kamijima was shot dead, leaving a wife and two teenage children. His crime? He was an Asian-American. A Korean neighbor of the gunman said he used to chase her car when she drove through the neighborhood. 
   On the Fourth of July, 1999, a time of celebration across America, a shadow was cast over Illinois. Benjamin Smith, an individual associated with a racist, antisemitic organization, 
   killed an African-American man, Ricky Birdsong, the former basketball coach at Northwestern University. Then he went on, this same Benjamin Smith, to wound six Orthodox Jews in Chicago. I met the father of one of the young boys whose son was terrorized that night. His life will never be the same. His only crime in the eyes of Benjamin Smith? He did not practice the right religion. Then Benjamin Smith went on to kill a Korean student in Bloomington, IN. 
   Sadly, these incidents are only the tip of the iceberg. There are so many other incidents of hate violence in my State and around the Nation. Since 1991, 70,000 hate crime offenses have been reported in our country. Launching a comprehensive Government analysis of currently available hate crime data would likely be time consuming and not bring us any closer to solving the real problem of hate violence in this Nation. 
   Mr. President, the Local Law Enforcement Act offers a sensible approach to help deter this kind of discriminatory violence. This legislation has bipartisan support: Senator GORDON SMITH, Senator TED KENNEDY, Senator CARL LEVIN, and so many others. It is supported by law enforcement, civil rights and civic groups, and religious organizations. I am proud to cosponsor this legislation. I urge my colleagues to support its passage. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator from Michigan will yield, I commend him for his remarks and also commend the Senators from Michigan and Maine for what they have done and their leadership on this issue. This is a critically important issue in the Midwest. It is certainly an important issue in the State of Illinois. I have been back to my State and I can tell you virtually every single group I have met with--labor, business, education, ordinary families--all bring up this issue as the first concern because it hits them in the pocketbook. Families trying to drive back and forth to a job, small businesses that depend on the cost of fuel for profit--they are all concerned. I commend the Senator from Michigan for the comments he has made. 
   I have listened to the oil companies and their explanations about why these prices have gone up, but I have to tell you they just don't wash. They don't make sense. When you explore them and look to them you say: Sure, that might account for a 2-cent increase or a 5-cent increase. But in the Chicagoland area, it is not uncommon to find gasoline at $2.29 a gallon and higher, for the lowest cost gasoline. That does not explain it away. 
   Frankly, I think the oil companies are coming up with excuses. In the past, they have come up with excuses and, frankly, we have to go further. I think the Senator from Michigan is correct; the Federal Trade Commission has a responsibility here. Next Tuesday, the chairman of that Commission is going to meet with the Illinois delegation to talk about this. I hope they take the Senator's suggestion and go forward with this investigation. At this time I think we need to have the oil companies in for honest answers so families and businesses across America understand what is behind this. 
   I commend the Senator from Michigan, as well as the Senator from Maine, and all those who have shown leadership on this issue. It is really a matter of the quality of life for a lot of families and businesses in the Midwest--across the Nation.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it has been more than a year since the Columbine tragedy, but still this Republican Congress refuses to act on sensible gun legislation. 
   Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. Until we act, Democrats in the Senate will read some of the names of those who lost their lives to gun violence in the past year, and we will continue to do so every day that the Senate is session. 
   In the name of those who died, we will continue this fight. Following are the names of some of the people who were killed by gunfire one year ago today, on June 14, 1999:  
   Juan Avina, 21, San Antonio, TX. 
   Theodoro Espada, 33, Dallas, TX. 
   Samuel Foster, 30, Chicago, IL.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am happy to be in the Chamber this morning to address the issues that are going to be considered before the Congress this week. 
   One of the most important issues that I found in my home State of Illinois, and I think can be found in virtually every State in the Union, is the prescription drug benefit under Medicare. They are telling us, the people who do this for a living, that when they ask families across America what is one of the major issues you are going to look to when it comes to electing the President of the United States or electing a Member of Congress, one of the major issues that comes forward is the prescription drug benefit. It is understandable because the Medicare program, as good as it is--in fact, it has been there for 40 years as the health insurance program for the elderly and disabled--does not have a prescription drug benefit. You would not buy a health insurance plan for your family today that didn't include one because you never know when you are going to be subjected to an illness that a doctor will need to treat with an expensive prescription drug. 
   They can become very expensive. It is not uncommon to spend $50, $100, even several hundred a month to maintain a certain drug that keeps you healthy. 
   When we constructed Medicare, we didn't put a prescription drug benefit in the plan. That was 40 years ago. Today, seniors are finding themselves extremely vulnerable. They will go to a doctor and say: I have a problem. The doctor says: I know just the thing; here is a prescription. They will find out they can't afford to fill the prescription. So a lot of seniors on limited, fixed incomes, make a hard choice and say, I may not be able to take this prescription or maybe I will fill it and only take half. The net result, of course, is that the senior doesn't get well, doesn't get strong. In fact, they can see their health deteriorate simply because they can't afford to fill their prescriptions. 
   The irony, of course, is that if a senior can't buy the drugs they need to stay healthy and they end up in the hospital, guess what. The taxpayers step in and say Medicare will pay for that. In other words, if someone gets sick because they don't have prescription drugs, we will pay for it. If seniors have to go to the hospital, taxpayers pay for it. 
   We on the Democratic side believe that we need to do two things. We need to put a prescription drug benefit in Medicare that gives to senior citizens and the disabled peace of mind that when they need these prescription drugs, they will have help in paying for them. That is something everyone expects from a health insurance plan. It should be the bottom line when it comes to Medicare, as well. 
   The Democratic side has been pushing this literally for years. We believe that is something this Congress should have done a long time ago. Sadly, we have had no cooperation, none whatever, from the Republican side of the aisle. They do not believe this is a critical and important issue. We have tried our very best to bring this issue to a vote on the floor. We have tried both in the House and the Senate. They have blocked us every single time. 
   Who would oppose a prescription drug benefit? On its face, why would anybody oppose that? It will help seniors. It will mean they will buy prescription drugs. 
   There is another issue. If we just passed a prescription drug benefit and did not address the pricing of drugs, the system would clearly go bankrupt in a hurry. In other words, if the drug companies can continue to raise their prices--as they are doing now almost on a monthly basis--and we say we will pay whatever they charge, no program will last. 
   We have to combine with the prescription drug benefit program a pricing program, as well. Americans know this. I go to senior citizen gatherings in my State and they understand what is going on in the world. They know if they happen to live in the northern part of the United States and can drive across the border into Canada, they can buy exactly the same drug--made in the United States, by the same company, subject to the same Federal inspection--for a fraction of the cost. What costs $60 for a prescription in the United States costs $6 in Canada because the Canadian Government has said to American drug companies: If you want to sell in our country, we are not going to let you run the prices up. There is a ceiling. You have to keep your prices under control. We will make sure you don't gouge the customers in Canada. 
   We don't have a law such as that in the United States. 
   Therefore, the seniors in this country pay top dollar for prescription drugs. People in Canada, people in Mexico, people in Europe, get the same drugs from the same companies at a deep discount. I might add, as well, in this country the health insurance companies bargain with the same drug companies, saying, if you want to have your drugs prescribed by our doctors in our plan, we will not let you keep raising the prices on them. Of course, that is part of the reality. 
   Every group in America has a price mechanism, a price competition, except for the most vulnerable in America--the senior citizens and the disabled on Medicare. They pay top dollar for prescription drugs. When they can't pay it and they can't fill the prescription, they can't maintain their health as they should. 
   We believe, on the Democratic side, that we need a prescription drug benefit plan. We need to also address the question of pricing to make sure these drugs are affordable, so that the drug companies treat Americans at least as fairly as they treat Canadians. I don't think that is unreasonable. 
   Many times, we taxpayers, through the National Institutes of Health, have put the money on the front side of research to find these drugs. The drug companies profit from the research, as they should, but they also have an obligation to the people of the United States to price these drugs fairly. 
   We have an obligation to create a prescription drug benefit under Medicare. But this has been a one-sided discussion to this date. The Democrats have pushed this plan, and the Republicans have resisted it. 
   Lo and behold, the people on the Republican side of the aisle have decided to start asking American families, what do they think is important? I have in my hand polling data provided to the Republican conference in the House of Representatives. They went on to find in the course of their polling that they have been dead wrong on this issue, that the American people consider this to be one of the most important issues in America today and in this election. The Republicans, in resisting the Democratic plan, have missed the most important issue for seniors and their families. 
   What are they proposing? They want to change it in a hurry. They don't want to come on board and work out a bipartisan plan based on what the Democrats have been pushing for, for  years. No. Their plan is to come forward with a so-called prescription drug plan that buys them enough time to get through the election, a plan that is a sham and a phony, a plan that does not address the real needs for prescription drug benefits for seniors. They are not offering prescription drugs. They are offering sugar pills. They are offering placebos. That will not keep America healthy. 
   As you read the things they have recommended to the people involved in this on the Republican side of the aisle, they say one of the things you have to do is make sure you keep talking about this issue, make sure you empathize and tell people how much you feel for this issue. 
   It isn't ``feel good'' politics that Americans need. They need results. They need a bipartisan plan that really does help seniors. In the next few days, if you see, as we expect, this presentation by the Republican leadership in Congress that they have finally discovered the prescription drug benefit issue and they have finally come up with a plan, you have an obligation, as I do, to ask them to prove it will work, prove it will make 
   certain that senior citizens who need help in paying for prescription drugs get that assistance. Make certain it isn't a phony that is just buying time until the election. 
   If you hear the Republican leadership, new-found convert to this issue, coming up with rhetoric that we haven't heard for years, don't be surprised. Their polling data has told them they are dead wrong, the Democrats are right on this issue and the Republicans have missed the boat. 
   It is our obligation in Congress to work with those people who have been involved on this issue for years, to make certain that any prescription drug benefit plan is real, it addresses the needs of seniors and disabled across America, it is affordable, and it will work to maintain the quality of care we expect in this country. 
   These health care issues will turn out to be the biggest issue in this Presidential campaign. Yesterday, the Supreme Court decided again that managed care companies don't have an obligation to their patients to find out that they get the best quality care as doctors recommend. Their obligation is to profit and bottom line because of existing Federal law. On this case, as well, on prescription drug benefits, the families across America are the ones who are vulnerable.

   Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to. I say to the Senator from California, this is not unusual. I don't want to mislead people. Democrats take polls as well. We took polls years ago and found out that families really cared about the issue, and we came up with a plan, and literally for years we have been trying to bring this issue to a vote in the Senate and House of 
   Representatives. The Republican leadership has stopped us. They stopped us because the drug companies want to continue to make the money from the seniors and others across this country who pay top dollar for their prescription drugs. 
   So as we pushed this, year after year, we could never find cooperation on the Republican side of the aisle. The deathbed conversion we are witnessing here now reflects the fact that an election is looming and the Republicans understand they are in a bad position. They have taken a position that is unpopular, unwise, and just plain wrong. 
   Take a look at some of the polling data: Preserving Social Security and Medicare is the top issue in the Presidential election campaign. 
   Stopping insurance companies from making health care decisions is the No. 2 issue in the Presidential campaign, according to Republican polls. 
   They have been on the wrong side on both of these. In addition, the No. 2 issue for the Republicans in terms of the Presidential election is helping elderly Americans get access to affordable prescription drugs. Now that they realize they are wrong on the issue and it is going to be a major issue in every campaign, they are rushing to come up with a strategy. 
   The American people don't want a political strategy; They want a law passed that will help these families. They understand these seniors go into their pharmacies on a daily basis and make a life-and-death decision about filling a prescription drug. The Republicans have said in this polling document that they have to attack the Democrats. That is part of this. Say you have a plan, even though you don't tell people what it is, and then turn around and attack the Democrats. Say it is politicians and Washington bureaucrats who are trying to set drug prices. 
   That language is straight out of the pharmaceutical companies' own platform on this issue. They don't want to have their prices affected. When the prices are in any way controlled or regulated, you have a Canadian situation where Canadian citizens pay a fraction of what we pay in the United States for the same drugs. So create this image, according to the Republican strategy, in the minds of Americans, that anytime we talk about pricing, it is just too much of Washington bureaucrats and politicians. 
   Then they say attack the Democrats plan as a  
   a one-size-fits-all plan that is too restrictive, too confusing, and puts the Washington bureaucrats in control.''  
   The one-size-fits-all language is because the Democrats believe this should be a universal plan so people really have a chance to receive help in paying for prescription drugs. You will find the Republican plan cuts off people at levels where, frankly, they are vulnerable and cannot afford to pay for prescription drugs. It also says: Attack the Democrats and say most seniors will be taken ``out of the good private drug coverage they have today.'' 
   Let me concede something. About a third of seniors do have good private drug coverage, a third have mediocre coverage, and a third have no protection at all. I think we can take that into account. But the bottom line is, if you happen to be a fortunate senior because, for example, you worked for a company with a union that gave you good health care benefits when you retired, that is good for you. I have met those folks. But so many others, two out of three, do not have that benefit. We want to 
   make sure everybody in America is protected. Take a close look, a careful look, at the Republican alternative. You are going to find they leave literally millions of seniors behind. 
   The drug companies want it that way. They don't want prices affected. They don't want a major plan. They believe they can create some kind of insurance protection for the seniors. I can tell you pointblank, insurance  company executives have met with us and said already the Republican proposal will not work. That is the bottom line.

   Mr. DURBIN. I say to my friend from California, this phrase says it all. This is the advice given by the pollsters and consultants for the Republican leadership when it comes to the prescription drug issue. It has already been made part of the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, but it is there for the world to see, and I want to quote one line and one line only to tell you what the bottom line message is:  
   It is more important to communicate that you have a plan as it is to communicate what is in the plan.  
   If you talk about the cynicism people feel about politicians and campaigns, that hits the nail on the head. In other words, don't describe it, don't tell people what it is going to do for families across America, just tell them you care, tell them you have a plan. That is the thing I think turns people off the most. 
   If the Republicans have a better idea, for goodness' sake, come forward with it. Let's debate it. That is what this is supposed to be about. 
   We have a plan. We are willing to debate it. We are willing to stand up for it on the floor. I believe in it. I will campaign for it in Illinois and any other place. But to come up with an idea, a few words to try to gloss over this so people forget before the election what this is about, is really a mistake. 
   Here is something else I want to note in the Republican consultants' document to the Congressional Republican leadership:  
   Prescription drug coverage is one of the Democrats' ``Four Corners: offense for winning back the House--along with health care, education and Social Security.  
   That is a quote directly. Yes, it is true. I would say that pollster has really hit the nail on the head. This is exactly what we are trying to do. We are trying to focus this election campaign, not on negative slam ads, not on personal attacks, but on four basic issues. For goodness' sake, we are willing to stand up and say this is what our vision of America will be. We look at this country and we feel blessed. We live in one of the greatest nations in the history of the world. 
   We feel doubly blessed that we are living in such good times for most Americans. This is a period of economic prosperity unparalleled in our history. One cannot find this long a string of good economic progress in the history of the United States. 
   Who can take credit for it? First and foremost, Americans and families can take credit for it because they work hard every day. They start the businesses. They teach the kids. Those things have paid off. That is where the credit belongs, first and foremost. 
   From a policy viewpoint, credit also has to be given to those people who make good decisions when it comes to our economy. We made a good decision in the Senate and in the House as well in 1993 when President Clinton said: The first thing we will do is reduce the deficit. Once we bring that deficit under control, we think the economy will move forward. 
   We could not get a single Republican in the House or the Senate to vote with us on that. Only the Democrats voted for it and Vice President GORE, sitting in the Presiding Officer's chair, cast the tie-breaking vote to reduce the deficit and move us forward. And it worked. 
   Critics on the other side of the aisle, a Republican Senator from Texas, said this was going to create an economic disaster for America. He has a little egg on his face today because for 7 years it has created just the opposite: economic prosperity. That was a good decision. 
   Tough decisions from the Federal Reserve Board regarding interest rates, for example, have kept inflation under control. 
   We are moving forward. We believe on the Democratic side that we cannot stand back and say we deserve election and reelection because of all the good things we did in the past. That is not good enough. If any party deserves election or reelection, it is because they learned the lessons of history and they have a vision of the future. 
   The vision tells us to take the surplus we are generating in our Treasury and pay down the national debt, a debt of almost $6 trillion that cost us taxpayers $1 billion a day in interest payments. That is right, the payroll taxes they are taking out of your paycheck and taking away from businesses and families across America to the tune of $1 billion a day do not educate a kid, they do not buy anything to enhance the security of America. That money is used exclusively to pay interest on old debt. 
   Think about it. We are paying interest on the debt for things we bought years ago that we have already built and maybe have used. We on the Democratic side believe that the fiscally prudent thing to do, the responsible thing to do is to take our surplus and reduce that $6 trillion debt. I want to say to my kids and my grandson: The best legacy I can leave you is less of an American debt so that you do not have to carry my burdens into your generation. 
   I believe that makes sense, and that is what Vice President GORE has stood for: To reduce America's national debt and to strengthen Social Security and Medicare as we do that to make sure those two systems are there for years to come. 
   If we just stop at that point, we would not be doing enough. We have to have a vision for this next century and ask, What decisions can we make as leaders of Government in Washington today to create opportunities for tomorrow? 
   It comes down to the four basic issues already identified 
   by the Democrats and acknowledged by the Republicans. 
   First, health care in America. It is disgraceful in America that we still have tens of millions of people who have no health insurance. Think about their vulnerability: an accident, an illness, and all the plans they have made for their life just fall apart. They have medical bills they cannot possibly pay. People are in a vulnerable position because we have not addressed health care in America. We believe we need to address health care when it comes to not only coverage of health insurance but prescription drug benefits for the elderly and disabled under Medicare and, most basically to make sure medical decisions are made by doctors and not by insurance companies. 
   Yesterday, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in an important  case involving an HMO, a managed care company, in my State of Illinois at the Carle Clinic. A woman called the Carle Clinic in Bloomingdale, IL, and reported she was having pains in her stomach. They said: We would like to examine you. Why don't you come in in 8 days. 
   Before she could go to the clinic her appendix burst, and she went through a terrible situation and a terrible recuperation in the hospital. 
   She came to learn that this plan, as so many other managed care plans, actually rewarded doctors financially if they showed more profit for the company as opposed to providing quality health care. The bottom line was making money. The bottom line said let the lady wait at home for 8 days and see if she still complains instead of bringing her into the office for an examination. 
   She sued them. She said: I thought I could trust you. I thought that was the bottom line when it comes to the health insurance company. The bottom line was profit, and it was made at my expense. I paid for it in a hospital stay. 
   The Supreme Court said: You cannot do anything about it. Congress passed legislation that said managed care companies can do that and you cannot sue them. Your right against these companies is extremely limited. That is a Federal decision. 
   That is a decision that should be changed. That is one Democrats have pushed for on Capitol Hill for years and the Republican leadership has blocked it. These insurance companies are making big dollars. They are big special interest groups. They are big players on the Washington political scene. They do not want anybody changing these rules. That is why they have resisted, and that is why we have done literally nothing in the Senate and the House to deal with these abuses. 
   Education: Can anyone think of anything in the 21st century more important than education in America? I cannot. We are going to have a debate in the near future on trade. It is a hot issue. There are many who believe globalization and free trade are part of America's future, part of the future of the world. To resist trade is to resist gravity: It is going to happen. 
   The question is, How will we respond to it? Many workers are concerned that if there is expanded trade, they might lose their jobs. Companies will take their plants and move them overseas, and folks who have good jobs today will not have them tomorrow. Shouldn't we as a nation acknowledge that, whether the jobs are lost to trade or technology? Shouldn't we be putting in place transition training and education so workers do not have to fear this inevitable change in the economy? 
   We are not hearing any suggestions on this from the 
   Republican side. They do not believe there should be a Federal role when it comes to education and training. They talk about it being State and local. It has been historically, but we have had Federal leadership that has made a difference on these issues. We believe on the Democratic side we should continue to do that. 
   I will tell my colleagues about another related issue. We know from the best companies in America that the single biggest problem they have today is not estate taxes; it is not a tax burden under the code. The single biggest problem they have today is jobs they cannot fill with skilled workers. 
   I hear that in Illinois everywhere I go. I was in Itasca yesterday with the Chamber of Commerce. That is their concern as well. We have to acknowledge the fact there are good paying jobs unfilled in America because we do not have skilled workers to fill them. 
   What do we do about it? Wait for the market to create an answer? I hope we will do more. In 1957, when the Russians launched Sputnik and we were afraid we were going to lose the space race, this Congress responded and said: We will respond as a nation. We will create the National Defense Education Act. We are going to encourage young people to get a college education to be scientists, to be engineers, to compete with the Russians. We did it. It was an investment that paid off handsomely. We created an engine for growth in the American economy that not only made certain the private sector had the people they needed but also sent a man to the Moon and so many other achievements unparalleled in the history of the world. 
   Why are we not doing the same thing today? Why are we not acknowledging we need to make an investment at the Federal level to help pay for college education so kids have a chance to become tomorrow's scientists and engineers, leaders of the 21st century so we do not have to import computer experts from India and Pakistan?

   Mr. DURBIN. I commend my colleague for bringing this issue to our attention. I think it is particularly timely that he would raise this on the floor of the Senate. In a trip to Africa just a few months ago, I discovered the ravages of the AIDS epidemic. There are some 10 million AIDS orphans. These children are likely to become the soldiers in these armies the Senator from Minnesota has just described. The young girls are likely to become either victimized or prostitutes themselves, who are going to really, in a way, continue this cycle of disease and dependency and death. 
   I commend my colleague from the State of Minnesota, Senator WELLSTONE, for calling this important moral issue to the attention of the Senate. I rise in strong support. I ask him if he has considered the impact of the AIDS epidemic and similar health problems that have created so many orphans in Africa, and now we have the fastest growth of HIV infection in the world in India, and the impact this could have on the issue he has raised.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I commend my colleague from the State of Wisconsin. He is a person of principle. He comes to the floor of the Senate and reminds Members, whether in support of or in opposition to the death penalty, it is fundamental to the American system of justice that we insist on fairness. 
   In my State of Illinois, some 13 people who were on death row preparing to be executed by the State of Illinois were found by scientific testing to be innocent and were released. Because of that, the Governor of our State, a Republican, George Ryan, made what I consider to be an important and courageous decision. He suspended the death penalty in my home State of Illinois. 
   The Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. FEINGOLD, reminds Members that the experience in Illinois is not unique. In State after State, we have found people who have been called to justice and have received virtually no representation before the court of law. In the most serious possible cases under our system of justice, these men have been sentenced to death. In many cases,  that sentence was carried out with inadequate defense and representation. 
   For example, I think the decision by Governor Bush of Texas to at least suspend the execution of an individual for 30 days while DNA testing is underway is a thoughtful decision. I commend him for that. The State of Texas, I believe, leads the Nation in the number of executions, and the State of Texas has no public defender system. So in the State of Texas, if you are a criminal defendant facing a capital crime which could result in execution, it is literally a gamble, a crapshoot as to the person who will represent you to defend your life. 
   In cases that have been cited by Senator FEINGOLD, some of the most incompetent attorneys in America have been assigned this responsibility. In our State of Illinois, we found these attorneys to be not well versed in law; we found them to be lazy; we found them to be derelict in their duty, and in some cases, a person's life was at stake. 
   Again, I commend my colleague from the State of Wisconsin for his statement. It is a reminder to all, whether we support the death penalty--as I do--or we oppose it, that we in this country believe in a system that is based on fairness and justice. 
   I have introduced legislation to give to all Federal prisoners who were subjected to capital punishment the same right for DNA testing that exists in my State of Illinois. There are similar bills introduced by my colleagues. I hope that all, conservative and liberals alike, Democrats and Republicans, will at least adhere to the basic standard of justice when it comes to cases of this seriousness and this magnitude.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in the time that remains in morning business, which I will share with my colleague from California, we will address several of the issues which still remain before this session of Congress. Many of us are just returning from a Memorial Day break which we spent with our families back in our States, trying to acquaint ourselves with the concerns of people and the concerns about issues we face here in Washington. 
   One of the concerns in the State of Illinois and in the city of Chicago continues to be gun violence. This is still a phenomenon which is almost uniquely American and which is tragic in its proportion. To think we lose 12 or 13 children every day to gun violence, that is a sad reminder of what happened at Columbine High School in Littleton, CO, a little over a year ago, when some 13 students were killed at that school. It is merely one instance of a situation which repeats itself every single day. 
   It has been more than a year since that tragedy, but still this Congress refuses to act on sensible gun safety legislation. I remind those who are following this debate, the proposal for this gun safety legislation is hardly radical. If people are going to buy a gun from a gun dealer in America, they are subjected to a background check. We want to know if they are criminals. We want to know if they have a history of violent crime or violent mental illness or if they are too young to buy a gun--basic questions. I understand that, as of last year, over 250,000 would-be purchasers of guns were denied that opportunity as a result of a simple background check. 
   Did they turn around and buy a gun on the street? It is 
   possible. But we should not make it easy for them. It should not be automatic. In fact, I hope in many instances, having been denied at a gun dealer, they could not find a gun nor should they have been able to. We believe applying the same standard of gun safety legislation to gun shows just makes common sense. 
   So that is part of the gun safety legislation we passed in the Senate by a vote of 49-49, and a tie-breaking vote was cast by Vice President AL GORE. That bill left the Senate over 8 months ago, went over to the House of Representatives where it was emasculated by the gun lobby, where the National Rifle Association would not accept the basic idea that we should check on the backgrounds of people who buy guns at gun shows. 
   The National Rifle Association believes those who go into gun shows should be able to buy a gun with no questions asked. That is just fundamentally unfair and ignorant. That position prevailed in the House of Representatives. The matter went to a conference committee where it has languished ever since. 
   Since Columbine High School, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. Until we act, Democrats in the Senate will, each day, read the names of some, just some, who lost their lives to gun violence in the past year and will continue to do so every day the Senate is in session. 
   In the names of those who died, we will continue this fight, and in the names of their families who still grieve their losses, we will continue to remember these victims of gun violence. 
   Following are the names of some of the people who were killed by gunfire 1 year ago today, on June 6, 1999, at a time after the Senate passed gun safety legislation: 
   Earnest Barnes, 38, Atlanta, GA; Quentin A. Brown, 29, Chicago, IL; Dexter J. Caruthers, 46, Gary, IN; George Cook, 19, Minneapolis, MN; Don Ferguson, 80, Oakland, CA; Juan J. Gonzales, 28, Oklahoma City, OK; Mark S. Hansher, 33, Madison, WI; Joseph Jainski, 34, Philadelphia, PA; Maurice Lewis, 29, Philadelphia, PA; Donald Norrod, 67, Akron, OH; Allen Ringgold, 23, Baltimore, MD; Lawanza Robertson, 18, Detroit, MI; Agapito Rodriquez, 32, Dallas, TX; Jonathan Shields, 31, Washington, DC; Clarence Veasley, 44, St. Louis, MO; Kirk Watkins, Detroit, MI.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, at the National Rifle Association convention, when it was brought up as an issue that so many young people are killed every single day by gunfire in America, in addition to those who are not so young, the people at the National Rifle Association dismissed it and said these are teenage gang bangers and drug criminals and you just have to expect, in the culture in which they live, they are going to kill one another. 
   As I read this list of people ranging in age from 80 years to 18, it is clear that the victims of gun violence are not just those who were involved in crime in the inner city. Frankly, it involved Americans across the board; Americans--black, white, and brown--of virtually every age group. To dismiss this, as the National Rifle Association did, as something we should not care about I think is evidence of their insensitivity to this issue of gun violence.

   Mr. DURBIN. I can say to the Senator from California, as people across the Nation refuse to vote in elections and lose respect for those who are elected to public office, it is a clear indication, as far as I am concerned, that they do not believe we are responsive. They do not believe we are listening. They do not believe the problems that families face across America are problems we share. They think we are some sort of political elite that really is out of touch with the world. 
   They understand in the cities and the suburbs across Illinois that gun violence is an issue that affects so many lives. They wonder how people can be elected to the Senate and not try to do something about it. 
   I know the Senator from California agrees with me that even passing this gun safety legislation will not eliminate gun violence, but we hope it will reduce it. 
   It is a commonsense approach to reducing the ownership of guns by people who should not own them. I believe--and I am sure the Senator from California does, too--those who use guns legally and safely, such as sportsmen and hunters, should be allowed to do so, but I do not agree with the National  Rifle Association of basically giving guns to everyone, no questions asked, and hope for the best, and wants to see concealed weapons in every place. Governor Bush decided he wanted concealed weapons to be carried in churches and synagogues in the State of Texas. That strikes me as a ridiculous situation.

   Mr. DURBIN. Amusement parks. Think about the situation and wonder how in the world can we have a safer America if we have this proliferation of guns that is, obviously, supported by Governor Bush, as well as the National Rifle Association. Democrats and Republicans should be listening to families across this country. 
   To think gun violence has become so commonplace that we have accepted it is a sad testament on this great Nation. If one looks at gun violence statistics and says ``that is life,'' no, it is not. That is life in America. That is not life in any other country in the world. Virtually every civilized country in the world has basic gun safety laws and gun control laws to keep guns out of the hands of those who would misuse them and out of the hands of children. We live in a country where a disgruntled 13- or 14-year-old goes home and finds grandpa's gun, goes back to school, and kills a teacher. That is not commonplace anyplace in the world but for the United States, which I do not think we should accept, and our failure to do anything about it feeds into the cynicism of America's voters and citizenry who think we are elected to solve problems in this country. When we do not respond, it is no wonder they lose faith in the process.

   Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator from California that she has answered her own question: Why is the National Rifle Association attacking the Democratic candidate for President? They made it clear. The chairman of their organization, a gentleman from Iowa whose name I do not have handy, made this announcement--in fact, it has been videotaped and replayed--where he said: Listen, the choice for the National Rifle Association in this Presidential race is clear. If George Bush is elected President of the United States, the National Rifle Association will have its man in the White House. 
   The Senator from California does not exaggerate. That is exactly what he said. 
   What does it mean to have your person in the White House next to the President? It means gun safety legislation does not have a chance. Not a single thing is going to be passed by Congress that will not be vetoed by George W. Bush. 
   Secondly, I hope the Senator from California will also reflect on this, and that is, it is likely in the next Presidency two or three Supreme Court Justices will be nominated. The National Rifle Association is going to have its voice in that process if George Bush is elected President. They will decide whether or not the Supreme Court Justice nominee passes their litmus test, which basically says we should sell guns in this country with no questions asked. 
   That is not a decision for 4 years; it is a decision for decades because if the Supreme Court has a majority of that point of view, that is going to affect the laws that are approved virtually across the board at the State and Federal level. 
   When the National Rifle Association at their convention starts ranting and raving about their choice for President, it is because they are sick and tired of President Clinton, who has stood up for gun safety as long as he has been in the White House. They are frightened by the prospect of Vice President GORE becoming President and continuing that tradition of supporting sensible gun safety legislation. They want George W. Bush. They want their man in the White House. They want to help pick the Supreme Court. You can bet as an American, I am concerned that will increase the incidence of gun violence in 
   our country.

   Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from California. She has made a point, too, that I would like to follow up on. We have addressed this issue of the safety of American families, to make sure that we try to do everything that is reasonable to reduce gun violence. 
   There is also an issue of health not only related to gun violence but in a larger context. We have several measures that are pending on Capitol Hill that have been languishing for months: prescription drug benefits, which we support. We believe that under Medicare the elderly and the disabled should have a prescription drug benefit. To accomplish that, it is certainly going to involve bipartisan cooperation. But we have seen no leadership, none whatsoever, in this Congress. 
   What are they waiting for? We are now in the month of June. We are talking about resolving a lot of the major issues before our August recess for the conventions. In this short period of time, can we find the political will to address a prescription drug benefit? 
   Let me add another that has been languishing for months: the Patients' Bill of Rights, which basically says that each one of us, as individuals and members of a family, should be able to walk into a doctor's office and listen carefully to that medical professional, receive their diagnosis and their recommendation, and follow it and not be second-guessed by some insurance company. 
   I think that is so fundamental and so basic--that a woman who has an obstetrician following her pregnancy, who wants to stay with the person in whom she has confidence, will not lose that right because her company decides to change its health insurance carrier; that someone who wants to be involved in a clinical 
   trial of a new experimental drug for cancer, for example, that might save their life, cannot be denied that opportunity by a health insurance company; that our access to emergency rooms will not be denied because of the decisions of health insurance company clerks. 
   We had a vote on the floor of the Senate. Overwhelmingly, the American people support what I have said. We lost the vote but not because we did not have support for our position. Three hundred organizations supported the Democratic position on the Patients' Bill of Rights, every major medical group in America. The nurses supported our position. The doctors supported our position. Hospitals supported our position. Yet we lost because one special interest group on the other side prevailed--the insurance companies. They are the ones that are making the profit out of these decisions that take quality care away from families, which exalt the bottom line of profits, and ignore basic health care needs. 
   This miserable bill that passed out of the Senate is headed over to the House of Representatives. I am happy to report to you that a substantial number of House Republicans said they were not going to scrape and bow to the insurance industry; that they would stand with American families and medical professionals so we have rights, a Patients' Bill of Rights for America. 
   They passed a good bill, the Dingell-Norwood bill. JOHN DINGELL of Michigan is legendary here on Capitol Hill. Congressman CHARLIE NORWOOD is relatively new but is a Republican who has had the courage to stand up and say: I think it is only right to say no to the insurance companies and yes to American families on a Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   Let me read to you what Congressman NORWOOD said a few days ago about the situation that has occurred where the Senate passed the insurance industry bill and the House passed one that will help American families; and nothing has happened since. This is what he said on May 25:  
   I'm here today to say time's up on the conference committee. We've waited eight months for this committee to approve a compromise bill. Senate Republicans--  
   This is a Congressman who is a Republican who is saying this about his colleagues in the Senate:  
   Senate Republicans have yet to even offer a compromise liability proposal--they have only demanded that the House Conferees abandon their position.  
   He goes on to say:  
   If we don't get a bill, or at least a tentative agreement in writing by the week we come back from Memorial Day, we must move past the conference.  
   Congressman NORWOOD said:  
   Starting today, I am working as if that will be the case. I am willing to pass this measure through any means necessary.  
   I say congratulations to this Republican Congressman who is standing up to the Republican majority in the Senate, who is standing up to the insurance industry, who is standing with the Democrats and with American families. As on gun safety legislation, this health legislation, important to families across America, has been stalled and blockaded by the Senate Republican leadership. They do not want to even address the issues that families across America care about. 
   You step back and say: Why in the world do men and women 
   run to be Members of this Senate if they are not willing to at least debate the major issues, if not pass legislation to help families? But time and time and time again, the Senate majority has blockaded, stopped, and stalled every effort to deal with issues of health and safety. 
   And those are not the only ones. As to an increase in the minimum wage, this is one of the most disgraceful things that has happened to Congress in the last 10 or 12 years. It used to be when it came time for an increase in the minimum wage--under President Reagan, for example, it was done with little fanfare and little debate. It was done on a bipartisan basis. We all believed that the men and women who got up and went to work every day in America for a basic minimum wage deserved an increase periodically to reflect the cost of living. 
   But the Republican-dominated Congress refuses to allow us to increase this minimum wage. And 350,000 people in my State of Illinois got up this morning and went to work for a minimum wage--$5.15 an hour--with virtually no benefit protection. 
   I agree with Senator KENNEDY, Senator DASCHLE, and so many others, that we should increase this minimum wage as a matter of basic decency a dollar an hour--50 cents a year for 2 years--so people who are trying to keep their families together, trying to maintain their own standard of living, have a chance to do it with an increased minimum wage. Again, the Republican leadership in Congress refuses to let us bring up this issue of the minimum wage. 
   Time and time again--gun safety legislation, a prescription drug benefit under Medicare, a Patients' Bill of Rights to protect families when they have the most basic and fundamental concerns about their health, and a minimum wage--these issues have been stalled because the Republican leadership refuses to bring them up for a vote. They know the American people support it but there are special interest groups that oppose each and every one of them. 
   The National Rifle Association has told them: Put the bar on the door. We don't want any gun safety legislation. The insurance companies have told  them: We don't want a Patients' Bill of Rights. We are making a lot of money under the current system. We don't want the doctors and the nurses to make medical decisions. We want businesspeople to make them based on profits. The pharmaceutical industry has told them they don't want a prescription drug benefit to help the elderly and the disabled pay for drugs they need to survive. When it comes to the minimum wage, some people in the business community have said: We don't want to pay anything more than $5.15 an hour. And we don't care what impact it has on the employees. 
   That is the state of play that reflects the values and reflects the choice the American people will have in this coming election as to whether they want to see the Republican majority continue in Congress and stop this basic legislation so important to every American family.

   Mr. DURBIN. We have not only addressed the major legislative issues bottled up and stalled in this Republican Congress--gun safety legislation, Patients' Bill of Rights, prescription drug benefits, increasing the minimum wage. We should listen as well to the rhetoric coming from the Republican candidate for President, George W. Bush, who is suggesting a massive tax cut of over $2 trillion over 9 years. He is also now suggesting a change in Social Security that will cost over $800 billion over 9 years--$2.8 trillion that he has suggested we spend over the next 9 years, when we are told by experts in Washington that the surplus we have to deal with is about $800 billion. What the Presidential candidate on the 
   Republican side is suggesting is that he wants to return to the era of deficit spending, where we will, over 9 years, go $2 trillion more in debt. 
   We can all recall that when President Reagan was elected in 1980, we started on this course of action which led to increasing our national debt to over $6 trillion. We had more debt accumulated during the Reagan-George Herbert Walker Bush years than we had in the entire previous history of the United States. Now to carry on this fine tradition, Gov. George W. Bush is suggesting we go back to deficit spending, $2 trillion more in debt, to give tax breaks to wealthy people, to change Social Security in a risky way. 
   I think that is another fundamental issue. If we are going to deal with America's economy to keep it moving forward, if we are going to bring about the changes we need to make America a better place to live, we certainly don't need to return to deficit spending. I think that is a critical issue that affects everything we do on Capitol Hill.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to note that Senator THURMOND, who took the floor and introduced a joint resolution commending our Armed Forces, is someone who should also be commended personally today. This is the 56th anniversary of Senator THURMOND's landing in the D-Day invasion. 
   As we consider the construction of the museum in New Orleans, LA, to pay tribute to those soldiers and all those involved in the D-Day invasion, we should take a moment on the floor of the Senate to pay tribute to our colleague from South Carolina, who had such a distinguished career in the military. It is almost inconceivable to think he was there as a volunteer to fly a glider into the D-Day invasion--probably one of the more dangerous assignments of the men and women in uniform who made that invasion such a success. The fact that he is here today is a tribute to not only his longevity, but his continued dedication to this country. 
   On behalf of a generation--frankly, I wasn't born when that occurred but have been the beneficiary of that victory--I say to my colleague from South Carolina that we are in deepest debt to him for his personal service to this country, and for his courage in participating in that D-Day invasion. I commend not only him but also all of those who made that invasion such a success, and hope that on this 56th anniversary all of the people involved, and their families who waited expectantly to hear the results of that invasion, will be remembered in the thoughts and prayers of every American family.

   Mr. DURBIN. There is no doubt in the mind of any Member of the Senate that Senator THURMOND would volunteer again, as he just promised that he would. I thank the Senator again. 
   S.J. Res. 46 
   Whereas on June 14, 1775, the Second Continental Congress, representing the citizens of 13 American colonies, authorized the establishment of the Continental Army; 
   Whereas the collective expression of the pursuit of personal freedom that caused the authorization and organization of the United States Army led to our Nation's Declaration of Independence and the codification of our basic principles and values in the Constitution of the United States; 
   Whereas for the past 225 years, our Army's central purpose has been to fight and win wars that were typically fought and won on distant, foreign battlefields, while at home, the Army provided for the Nation's security; 
   Whereas whatever the mission, the Nation turns to its Army for decisive victory, regardless of whether those are measured in the defeat of foreign Army forces or the timely delivery of humanitarian assistance at home or abroad; 
   Whereas the 172 battle streamers carried on the Army's flag are testament to the valor, commitment, and sacrifice of those who have served and fought under its banner; 
   Whereas Valley Forge, New Orleans, Mexico City, Gettysburg, Verdun, Bataan, Normandy, Pusan, Ia Drang Valley, Grenada, Panama, and Kuwait are but a few of the places where American soldiers have won extraordinary distinction and respect for our Nation and our Army; 
   Whereas ``Duty, Honor, Country'' are more than mere words, they are the creed by which the American soldier lives and serves; 
   Whereas while no one can predict the cause, location, or magnitude of future battles, there is one certainty -- American soldiers of character, selflessly serving the Nation, will continue to be the credentials of our Army; 
   Whereas the Army is prepared to answer the Nation's call, and such calls have been increasing in number and disparity in recent years; 
   Whereas the threats are less distinct and less predictable than the past, but more complex and just as real and dangerous; 
   Whereas our Army, the world's most capable and respected ground force, is in the midst of an unparalleled transformation as it prepares for the new challenges of the next century and a different world; 
   Whereas future forces will be prepared to conduct quick, decisive, highly sophisticated operations anywhere, anytime; and 
   Whereas our Army will be ready to fight and win our Nation's call to service at home and abroad: Now, therefore, be it 
    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That Congress--

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, a little over a year ago in Littleton, CO, at Columbine High School, there was a shooting incident which shocked America. We saw in that high school an event which we did not believe could happen in the United States, where students could get guns through a gun  show, go into a high school filled with other students, and open fire, killing 12 or 13 students and injuring many others. It shocked America's conscience. 
   As a result, the Senate began to consider gun control legislation--frankly, more gun safety legislation--to keep guns out of the hands of those who would misuse them. We are a nation of 200 million guns. Many of us believe guns should be kept out of the hands of criminals and children. 
   So we considered legislation on the floor of the Senate to do a background check at gun shows so kids and criminals would not have access to guns through these gun shows. We know the Brady law requires a background check at gun dealers. We think the same should apply to gun shows. 
   We also thought handguns should have a trigger lock so children who were looking around for something that was unusual and different or challenging would not find a loaded gun and hurt themselves or a playmate. We read about that almost every day. A trigger lock is a way to make sure that gun is securely stored away from children. 
   In another part of the bill, we dealt with the whole question of these high-capacity ammo clips, imported into the United States from overseas, that have absolutely no value whatsoever for any legitimate sportsman or hunter. They are people killers. 
   We considered that bill on the floor of the Senate. The vote on that bill was 49-49, a tie vote. As provided under the Constitution of the United States, the Vice President came and cast the tie-breaking vote. We sent that bill over to the House in the hopes we could reduce some of the gun violence in America after Columbine High School. 
   The National Rifle Association got its hands on that bill over in the House, and that was the end of it. They stripped from that bill virtually any of the provisions I described to you and sent it to a conference where it has languished for almost 8 months. During that period of time many more people have been killed by gun violence in America. 
   Just a few weeks ago, the Million Mom March across the United States brought out mothers on Mother's Day who gave up a celebration with their family to come out and talk about the need in America for gun safety, for gun control, sensible gun control. Yet this Congress has turned a deaf ear. We have refused even to acknowledge that this gun violence is rampant in America as in no other nation on Earth. 
   Every day now, for the last week, Members of the Senate have come to the floor to memorialize those who died a year ago today, after Columbine, after Littleton, CO, after Jonesboro, AR, and all of the other cities where we saw the gun violence that captured our imagination and basically stunned America. We come to the floor each day to read the names of some of the victims. These are victims whose names were collected by the U.S. Conference of Mayors from cities large and small to remind us that a year ago today these people, whose names I am about to read, died because of gun violence--people who had otherwise normal lives and families and aspired to all the good things we do in life. They lost their lives because of gun violence. 
   Many times, issues on the floor of the Senate and the House really do not become very personal. They are statistics. We just refer to them in the abstract. This is not about statistics. It is not about abstract thought. It is about real human lives that have been lost to gun violence a year ago today and, sadly, will be lost to gun violence again today. 
   Following are the names of some of the people who were killed by gunfire 1 year ago, on May 24, 1999: Michael Calim, age 32, Houston, TX; Mark Raiffie, age 47, St. Louis, MO; Gary Ricks, age 51, Detroit, MI; 
   Bobby L. Williams, age 40, Houston, TX; Ronald Williams, age 47, Miami-Dade County, FL; an unidentified female, San Francisco, CA. 
   Today in America there will be more gun deaths. We must remember that among those gun deaths will be 12 children who will die. The National Rifle Association at their recent convention said: We know who those 12 kids are; they are the gang bangers, drug gangs, and all the rest. You can expect that. 
   They are wrong. Included among those 12 children are those who commit suicide with guns, those who play with guns, little infants killing themselves or a playmate, certainly those who are victims of gang bangers and, believe me, I have seen innocent young men and women who have been maimed. I have talked with the parents of people who have been killed on the streets of one of my cities in Illinois, Chicago. These were children waiting for a schoolbus when somebody came by and sprayed bullets from one of these weapons and injured or killed students. 
   For the National Rifle Association to say we basically should ignore these 12 children who die every day in America because they are part of drug gangs is a sad commentary on this organization and a sad commentary that they are out of touch with the reality of gun violence as it affects every family in America today. I yield the floor.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered by the Senator from Maryland. 
   First, I thank Senator BENNETT of Utah and Senator FEINSTEIN of California, the chairman and ranking member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Legislative Branch. They have important responsibilities. They have met the responsibility and have done it very well in a very difficult time. I commend both of them for their hard work in preparing this important legislation. 
   I also commend my colleague from the State of Maryland, Senator MIKULSKI. Because of the proximity of Maryland to the District of Columbia, Senator MIKULSKI has said that she oftentimes feels that she is the Senator for so many people who work on Capitol Hill who come to her with their concerns. I know that is a burden for her to carry, but it is one that she carries with grace. 
   The offering today of this sense-of-the-Senate amendment is so typical of her dedication and loyalty to the men and women who serve us here in the Capitol. 
   This Capitol Building is one of the most recognizable buildings in the world. People literally come from across the United States and from around the world to see this magnificent dome. 
   You can never forget the first time you see it. I can still remember, I guess almost 38 years ago, when I first saw it in person. It made such an impact on me as a student. Little did I realize that I might someday serve in this building. But so many millions of people come to this site on this great hill to see this building, to walk through its Halls, and to witness 
   the history that is here portrayed; to see the magnificent statues in Statutary Hall; to recall the history of this building; the Rotunda; the times that America has gathered in this place to pay homage to the greats who have served our Nation; to recall history when that same Rotunda was used as a hospital for Union soldiers who were injured in battle. 
   It is a great building and contains a great history. The dome on this building, which was built during the era when Abraham Lincoln of Springfield, IL, served as President during the Civil War, is really a beacon not just for our Nation but for the world. 
   All of the visitors who come here to be part of this great American historical moment expect the very best treatment, and they deserve it. That is why it is hard for me to understand what happened in the House of Representatives when the Republican leadership decided they would make a substantial cut--a one-third cut or more--in the number of police officers who would be in this building to protect all of us who work here and all of us who visit here. 
   It is hard to imagine how that could occur under ordinary circumstances; with the millions of people who flock to this building, that we would cut back in the security and protection of those visitors and employees. It is impossible to understand that suggestion in light of what occurred just 2 years ago in this same building--when, on a Friday afternoon, a deranged man came to this building with a gun and opened fire, sadly killing two of the very best Capitol Hill policemen, Officer Chestnut and Officer Gibson. 
   Those two men died in the line of duty protecting all of us--protecting  the visitors to this building, protecting the workers who come to this building each day, protecting many of the same Members of Congress who have sponsored on the House side this amendment to reduce the number of Capitol Hill policemen. It is an incredible thing that only 2 years later we would forget that basic lesson. 
   I remember going to the memorial service for the two officers, as so many Members of Congress did, to show our respect and our gratitude to their families--to try to express with our presence what we couldn't say in words; to thank them and their families for what they had given us. So many people were chocked up that day as they looked across at the rows of family members and saw not only the spouses but a lot of young children who would never know their fathers, who, frankly, would miss out on many of life's great moments with their fathers, because Officer Chestnut and Officer Gibson had given their lives to protect us. 
   Many of the same Members of Congress who stood choking back the tears that day are, 24 months later, offering amendments to reduce the number of Capitol Hill policemen. 
   How short is their memory? Can they not recall those moments? I certainly can. I know Senator MIKULSKI can. 
   As I come into this building each day and into the office building that we use, I see these men and women in uniform standing there doing their very best to make sure people know the right place to go and where the offices are located, but also keeping in mind that at any given moment they could have their lives on the line. 
   When Senator MIKULSKI introduces this resolution, when Senator WELLSTONE takes the floor repeatedly and talks about the security at the doorways of the entrances to the buildings on Capitol Hill, they are talking about a life and death issue for these men and women. They don't just come to work, as many of us do, and shuffle the papers and do our business. They put their lives on the line every day. The thought that the House Republicans would suggest cutting by one-third the number of police officers is incredible when you consider what is at stake here and what we lived through only 2 years ago. 
   I certainly commend my colleague, Senator MIKULSKI, for offering this amendment. I hope every Member of the Senate in a show of fidelity and support to the men and women who protect us every day will join as cosponsors. This should have a 100-0 vote because it really is an indication of what we feel about these people who mean so much to us and who go out of their way to be kind and helpful. 
   Some of my favorites--I hate to pick out a few because I know there are many who deserve recognition--Officer Charlie Coffer, who stands at the Russell door every day, is a joy in my life. There cannot be a nicer person on Capitol Hill in any spot. He brings a smile to my lips every time I walk through the door. 
   Officer Best works on the door on the Senate side. I came here at 10 o'clock one night with a group of visitors, and I asked if it would be possible to walk through Statuary Hall. He went out of his way to clear things and make sure we could bring those visitors through for the time of their lives, to be able to walk through this great building in the darkness of night, and sense the history of this building. 
   Officer Best, Officer Coffer, and so many others, go out of their way to do such a great job. If they go out of their way every day, we should go out of our way to show our gratitude and respect by passing this amendment and this important appropriations bill. 
   I close by referring to one other item which I hope this appropriations subcommittee can consider. It has come to our attention that some of the workers on the Senate side, particularly those associated with the restaurant, are technically part-time employees. When we are in session, they may work a full 40-hour week; of course, when we are out of session, they don't. Because of this part-time status, many of them do not qualify for basic employee protection life/health insurance. It is hard for me to imagine the men and women who serve food every day, who make sure this building runs smoothly, don't receive the most basic protections which we would expect for any member of our family. 
   I ask the committee, I ask Senator BENNETT and Senator FEINSTEIN, if they would be kind enough to look into this situation. I am happy to work with them and make certain we are treating all of the men and women who work here with respect in giving them the benefits which we would expect every American who comes to work every day to enjoy. I think we ought to join to try to set such an example. 
   If this is not a major problem, I apologize to the subcommittee. However, if it is one that I have been told is a concern to many of the employees, I hope we can work together to resolve it. 
   Once again, I thank the chairman and the ranking member for their fine work on this bill. 
   I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DURBIN. Thank you. I come to the floor this morning to talk about an issue which is dominating the Presidential race across the United States. It is the issue about the future of Social Security. 
   It is interesting when you ask Americans how important it is. As an issue in this Presidential campaign, 71 percent of Americans say it is very important. It is understandable, because, at least since the era of the New Deal and Franklin Roosevelt, Social Security has really been there as an insurance policy against the devastating impact of age and retirement of people before its creation. 
   There was a time in America before Social Security when, if you were lucky enough to have saved some money, or if you were among the fortunate few with a pension, retirement was kind of an easy experience. But for the vast majority of Americans who didn't have that good fortune, retirement was a very troubling and dangerous experience. 
   It is no surprise that before Franklin Roosevelt conceived of the notion of creating Social Security, one of the highest ranking groups of poor people in America was parents and grandparents who were elderly. In his era, President Franklin Roosevelt changed the thinking in America to say: we are going to create, basically, a safety net to say to everyone, if you will give the Social Security fund some money as you work during the course of your employment, we will put that aside and guarantee to you that there will be a safety net waiting for you; that you will have a nest egg; that the Federal Government will be watching; and it will be there. 
   Over the years, of course, because of medical science and other things, we have gotten to the point where we live longer and more and more people are taking advantage of Social Security. Over the years, the amount of payroll tax for Social Security went up so you could take care of those senior citizens. But Social Security in America, for 70 years, has been that basic insurance policy. 
   When political leaders of either political party--Democrats or Republicans--start talking about changing Social Security, a lot of American families start listening--not only those who are receiving it but many who are near retirement. Certainly, a lot of younger workers ask very important questions, such as: Will it ever be there when I need it? I think for the last three or four decades in America that question from younger workers has been very common. It is natural to be skeptical--when you are 20 years old or 25 years old--that the money you are putting into the payroll tax for Social Security will ever help you. 
   Yet if you take a look at the record in America, Social Security has always been there. Payments have always been made. We have kept up with the cost-of-living adjustments to try to improve and increase those payments over the years. But we have kept our promise. A program created almost 70 years ago has been an insurance policy for every American family. 
   There are warnings, of course, for people: Do not count on Social Security for a living because it is a very spartan existence. It doesn't provide a lavish lifestyle once you have retired. But you are not going to starve. You are going to have some basic health and necessities of life. Americans have built this into their thinking about their future. What will happen to us at the age of 65? We would like to think we are prepared with savings and retirement, but we always know that we have worked for a sufficient number of quarters for our lives so that we will qualify for Social Security. 
   It is interesting. In the year 2000, in this Presidential 
   campaign, there is a brand new debate, and the debate suggests that we ought to take a brand new look at Social Security. On one side, George Bush has suggested we ought to change it rather dramatically; that we ought to take at least 2 percent of the payroll savings taxes that are taken out for Social Security and put that into a private account in which individuals can invest. 
   There is some appeal to that because a lot of people say maybe that will be a better idea--maybe I can make more money by investing it personally and directing my investments than if the Federal Government buys a very conservative investment plan with the whole Social Security trust fund. It is not uncommon to think that people across America are feeling good about directing their own future. 
   I say at the outset that--I think I speak for everyone in the Senate, both Democrat and Republican--we believe in encouraging people to save for their future. We believe in giving them options for investment. That is why we have created IRAs and 401(k)s, and all sorts of vehicles under the Tax Code so people can make plans for their future. But George Bush raises a more important question, and one that I would like to address for a few minutes. 
   What would happen if George Bush had his way? If we took 2 percent of the  proceeds going into the Social Security trust fund and said they will no longer go into the trust fund but people will be allowed to invest them individually, what impact would that have? Frankly, it could have a very serious and, I think, a very negative impact. 
   Keep in mind that the money being taken out of the payroll taxes each week in America goes to pay the current benefits of Social Security retirees. There is not some huge savings account that is blossoming. But basically we are talking about a pay-as-you-go system. If you take 2 percent away, you are still going to have the retirees needing their Social Security check. You are going to have to figure out some way to plug this gap. 
   If you say that 2 percent of payroll taxes will stop going into the Social Security trust fund, who will make up the difference? How big is that difference? Some estimate that the difference is $1 trillion. If you think about that, you have to ask George Bush and others who support this: Where is that money coming from? How will we make up the difference if we start saying to people they don't have to put it all in the trust fund, keep 2 percent and invest it personally? That $1 trillion transition has to be taken in the context of George Bush's other suggestion of a $2 trillion tax cut primarily for the wealthiest people in America. 
   I will concede that we are in good times in America for most families. The economy is strong. For the first time in decades, we are seeing surpluses in the Federal accounts. You can attribute that to leadership in Washington, leadership in business, and leadership in families. It has all come together in the last 8 years. America is moving forward. We are in a surplus situation. Who would have thought we would be talking about this on the floor of Congress just a few years after we debated a balanced budget amendment? 
   But many of us believe that even in a surplus situation we should be cautious because we are not certain what is going to be around the bend. We want to make certain that the decisions we make now about investing surplus funds makes sense for ourselves, for our children, and for our grandchildren. 
   To come up with an idea for taking this surplus and putting it into a massive tax cut for wealthy people or putting it into a Social Security change that could cost us another trillion dollars, in my mind, is not fiscally conservative. Yes. That is right--fiscally conservative. 
   The conservative approach being proposed by President Clinton and Vice President GORE says take the surplus and instead of putting it into something of great risk, such as a tax cut or some privatization of Social Security, let us buy down parts of the national debt. The national debt costs taxpayers in America $1 billion a day in interest. That is right. You are paying taxes now--payroll taxes and income taxes--to the tune of $1 billion a day for interest payments on old debt. 
   If you think about it, what is a better gift to our children and their children than to reduce this debt, and to say to them that we are going to take care of our mortgage, the one that we were going to leave to you, by paying down the national debt? That is Vice President GORE's suggestion. He says, in the Social Security program, pay down the debt in the trust funds. Pay down all of the bonds that have accumulated. When you do it, incidentally, you can extend the life of Social Security and make it stronger to the year 2050. It is a twofer--reducing the national debt and reducing the interest payment on it, and at the same time strengthening Social Security. That is the Gore approach. It a conservative approach. I will concede that. But I think it is the fiscally responsible approach. 
   On the other side, George Bush has said don't worry about paying down debt; Let's talk about a tax cut of $2 trillion for wealthy people, and let's talk about a new Social Security privatization idea that will cost at least $1 trillion in transition. That is not conservative, nor do I think it is prudent. I think you can appropriately call it a risky idea. 
   I joined with Senator BYRON DORGAN of North Dakota and Senator CHARLES SCHUMER of New York and my friend and colleague Senator BOXER of California in sending a letter to George Bush saying to him: If you want to talk about one of the most important programs to America's families, Social Security, and you want to talk about dramatic changes in Social Security, then we want you to come forward with an idea about what this means. What impact will this have on families? 
   We are anxious to receive a reply because, you see, George Bush, in the last few weeks, has gone beyond the 2-percent suggestion--that we can take 2 percent and invest it in the stock market--and now he says he can envision a day when we invest all of our Social Security in the stock market. 
   I readily concede that over the last 8 years, during President Clinton's administration, the stock market has done very well. It doesn't from day-to-day for those who follow it, but over the long term it has. The Dow Jones Industrial Average of 3,000 back in 1993 is now up to 10,000. That suggests a lot of wealth has been created in America. Those that were smart enough, and could, invested in the stock market and have seen their savings grow. 
   It is naive to believe this will go on indefinitely. We have certainly seen in the last 6 months the roller coaster of the NASDAQ and the roller coaster of the New York Stock Exchange, to suggest there have been good days and bad days. To take your life savings, or take 2 percent of your payroll tax and Social Security, and put it in the stock exchange, you understand there are risks. I think most Americans appreciate that fact. 
   As I said earlier, for those who want to invest their savings, that is their business. When it comes to Social Security, we have always said this is a part of our system that should be protected. If we go forward with George Bush's plan to privatize Social Security, it would truly give to individuals some power to invest. However, it also raises questions about the future of this Social Security system. Where will we come up with the $1 trillion in transition payments? 
   There are only so many ways to achieve that: We can tax Social Security to come up with more revenue; we can reduce benefits, for those who are currently receiving Social Security; or we can raise the retirement age under Social Security. 
   Frankly, I reject all three of those. I don't think America's families who are looking forward to enjoying their retirement years and counting on Social Security will sign up for George Bush's deal when they understand it could jeopardize Social Security as we know it and as we count on it. That is truly one of the serious problems we face. 
   Second, if we accept the George Bush approach on privatizing Social Security, we don't have the money that Vice President GORE wants to invest in paying off the national debt and paying off the debt of the Social Security trust fund. So we leave that interest payment out there for future generations. We don't stabilize Social Security. We don't give it a longer life. 
   A point made earlier by my colleague from the State of California, Senator BOXER: What if George Bush guesses wrong? What if people invest some part of their Social Security into the stock market and the market goes down and they are losing money? What will the response be of the elected officials across this country? We don't know because we have never faced it. 
   History tells us it is likely that Democrats and Republicans will say: Wait a minute; we cannot let a sizable number of Americans fail. People cannot be in a position where they don't have enough money to live on in retirement. 
   We are then likely, on a political basis, to ride to the rescue. Anyone remember not too long ago we did that with the savings and loan bailout? Too many institutions had lost money across America, and a lot of people lost their savings accounts. We bailed out the savings and loans. I didn't like voting for that, but I didn't see any alternative. The economy was at stake and we did it. 
   I happen to believe if the Bush privatization scheme goes through and it doesn't work, this Congress will be called on to come up with the money to bail out the families who guessed wrong in the stock market. Think about where this leads. From the dark days of deep red ink and deficits, we are now in a surplus. George Bush is saying let's try something that is a little new and a little innovative and  hasn't been tried. He is suggesting changes which could jeopardize the strength of this economy, the strength of our recovery, and what we envision as a strong American economy for decades to come. He is taking what I consider to be a leap of faith that some scheme which someone has come up with will work. 
   Vice President GORE is urging a more conservative approach: Put the surplus into bringing down the substantial debt, into strengthening the Social Security trust fund; put the surplus into making certain that Medicare is there for years to come; reduce the national debt so our children and their children don't continue to pay $1 billion in interest a day on old debt that we have accumulated. 
   That is the fundamental choice. It is not a question of whether people should have the right to invest their savings in the stock market--that is their right in America; 50 percent of families are doing that now. Our family is one of them--but whether or not you take the Social Security system, and after 70 years, turn it upside down and say we are now going to make this a much different system. 
   In the words of George Bush: We will privatize Social Security. I think there is a great amount of risk to that. I can understand the skepticism of a lot of American families about this proposal.

   Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from California. Quoting George Bush on this issue tells me more than anything else that he has not thought this through. In the 18 years I have served on Capitol Hill, when the issue of Social Security has come up, I have had a tendency to step back and wait. I want to hear both sides. 
   This is complicated. We are literally talking about a Social Security system that benefits tens of millions of Americans today and that many more Americans are counting on for the future. When people start talking about change in Social Security, I am very cautious. I think the people of Illinois who have sent me here expect me to be cautious. 
   I recall when the Senator from California and I were serving in the House of Representatives many years ago when there was a debate on the floor about the so-called ``pickled-pepper'' amendment. Jake Pickle of Texas and Claude Pepper of Florida had a fight over the future of Social Security and whether to raise the retirement age from 65 to 67. I voted against that. I really think the retirement age is an important milestone in people's lives, particularly if they have jobs involving manual labor and physical work. So when people start talking about changing Social Security--``We will change a little bit here and a little bit there''--I am very skeptical because I don't want to see us put in a position where someone's great campaign promise in the year 2000 means someone trying to retire in just a few years from now finds out that the window is closed at Social Security: 
   ``No, you have to wait a few more years.'' 
   ``Why?'' 
   ``We wanted to try a new approach to Social Security.'' 
   The Senator from California is right. When George Bush says--and this is a quote from the Houston Chronicle--``creating private savings accounts in Social Security could be the first step toward a complete privatization of Social Security,'' that is a frightening idea. Let me explain to you why. 
   If we ever privatize Social Security, we will still have millions of Americans who worked their whole lives, paid their taxes, obeyed the laws, and counted on Social Security, who need to receive their benefits. If you are going to have that requirement out there, you have to figure out a way to keep Social Security moving while George Bush creates a brand new system, his new idea, whatever it is. That is a massive investment. When we talk about keeping America's economy moving forward, not increasing our deficit, creating more surpluses, keeping job creation online and businesses thriving, I think this is a risky venture by George Bush when it comes to Social Security. 
   Frankly, I think the American people should ask of George Bush what several Members of the Senate have asked: Sit down and explain this to us; put it on paper. Before you start messing with Social Security, explain to us what you have in mind because a lot of us--a lot of families across America--are counting on this system.

   Mr. DURBIN. I thank my friend, the Senator from California. 
   It is interesting in this debate how the roles have been switched. It used to be not that long ago the Democrats were faulted for being fiscally irresponsible, too liberal when it came to tax and spend. In this debate over the future of Social Security, the fiscally conservative and, I think, from my point of view, the prudent approach is being pushed on the Democratic side. That is, make certain before we take the surplus economy for granted, and make certain before we talk about any changes for Social Security, that we have thought them through. 
   Here we are in the middle of the Presidential campaign, with George Bush, the Republican candidate, suggesting sweeping changes in Social Security, changes which could literally affect millions of American families. 
   The concept that we would somehow privatize Social Security would have been laughable not that many years ago. Now it is being said with a straight face during the course of this Presidential campaign. Unfortunately, the candidate, George Bush, who is making these statements, refuses to come forward and explain how he would achieve it. 
   I think it is natural for those of us on the other side, those supporting Vice President GORE, to ask of him to be specific. If you are going to start talking about Social Security, start telling us in specific terms how you are going to change it and what it is going to cost us. 
   I think the plan on the other side, from Vice President GORE, is a conservative, sensible approach that does not assume this economic boom which we have seen over the last 8 or 9 years will continue indefinitely. What Vice President GORE has said is take the surplus we have coming into the Federal Government and invest it back to pay off the debt of our Nation. 
   We in Illinois, I think, represent kind of a microcosm. I represent a microcosm of this Nation--rural, urban, liberal, conservative, and you name it--across our great State. When I go back and talk to business leaders about what to do with our surplus, they universally agree with Vice President GORE's position: Be prudent, be sensible, take the surplus and invest it in such a way so if 6 months from now we are in a recession or a downturn, we will not regret decisions we have made. 
   Take a look at what has happened to us in just a short period of time. Because we have had fiscal discipline for the last several years, the Nation's debt is already $1.7 trillion lower than it would have been. In other words, if we had not made this decision a few years ago to balance the budget and to make certain that Social Security trust funds were not spent for other reasons, we could be $1.7 trillion deeper in debt, meaning we would have bondholders in the United States and around the world asking every month for their interest payment and being paid with taxes coming out of families, businesses, and individuals across America. 
   We are on the right track. I think we in Washington got the message. Under the Clinton-Gore administration, we have started bringing down this debt and the economy has flourished for most people. There are exceptions: In the farm belt, exceptions in the inner city, exceptions in small towns. But by and large, most people believe America is moving in the right direction. 
   Along comes a Presidential campaign. Really, this is a referendum on our future. I am not going to question the motives of George Bush on the Republican side, and I hope he would not question the motives of Vice President GORE. 
   The American people basically have a crucial choice this November. In a time of prosperity, what should America's future look like? What should we be doing for the young people across America to say to them: We want to create at least as good an opportunity for you as we have had in this country. 
   Frankly, the Democratic approach, Vice President GORE's approach, is the sensible one. It basically says: Don't assume prosperity forever; pay down the debt so we don't have to collect more in taxes to pay interest on this debt. Reduce the debt of the Social Security program so that it will be stronger for a long period of time. 
   In fact, under Vice President GORE's proposal, for another 50 years, it will be solvent, so we can even say to those who are just getting their driver's license this year: Social Security is going to be there when you show up at the window 50 years from now. That is a good thing to say to the future of America. 
   Also, we are saying when it comes to Medicare--this is a program often overlooked by this Congress; it is not overlooked by tens of millions of elderly and disabled who count on Medicare for their health insurance--we believe we should take part of this surplus and invest it in Medicare as well to make sure it is stronger and is affordable. This is the Gore approach. 
   The other side is a much different view of our future. What George Bush has proposed for America's future is let's try something new and untried. First, let's talk about a $2 billion tax cut, and it is a tax cut that is not targeted to families who need it. It is a tax cut that, frankly, goes to a lot of people who are already wealthy. 
   I am joined on the floor by my colleague from New York, Senator SCHUMER. Senator SCHUMER has a proposal most American families would applaud. He has suggested targeting the tax cuts where they are really needed. One of Senator SCHUMER's proposals is to allow families to deduct up to $10,000 a year in college expenses for their children. That means about $2,800 in the bank for a lot of families to help pay college education expenses. That is a smart investment. That is a targeted tax cut that does not go to the wealthiest in America but prepares the next generation of Americans to compete in a global economy.  
   This election is coming down to: Do you want the Bush tax cut for primarily wealthy people, and do you want to target the tax cuts and invest in paying down the debt? Do you want to keep Social Security strong for decades to come, or try a privatization approach which Governor Bush proposes which has never been tested and will cost us a trillion dollars and runs the risk of more red ink, more deficits, and problems in the future? 
   We are taking the Gore and Democratic side, fiscally prudent approach which says: Let's look to the future in real uncertain terms. 
   I know we only have until 11:30 for morning business. My colleague from New York is here. I yield the floor to Senator SCHUMER.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington for yielding. For those who have not followed this debate closely, it is true that we are not debating the passage of a law; we are debating the passage of a resolution which is more or less a message of the Senate expressing its opinion. 
   Why aren't we debating a law, since this is supposed to be the Senate and we pass laws? Because the law is bottled up in a committee. The gun safety law we passed in the Senate after the Columbine massacre is bottled up in a committee by the National Rifle Association. The Republicans control the Senate and the House, and they will not let the bill come out of the committee. Those who believe gun safety legislation is needed have to resort to these devices to try to at least bring the issue up for consideration by the Senate. 
   My colleague from the State of Wyoming said the sense-of-the-Senate resolution is nothing but delay, delay, delay. Yesterday when we presented this sense-of-the-Senate resolution, it was the Republican side that delayed it for 5 hours. When we said we wanted to commend the Million Mom March and we wanted to bring the gun safety bill out of committee, it took the Republicans 5 hours to come up with an alternative, a substitute, which, if you read it, is, first, a diatribe against the Clinton administration and, second, the reaffirmation of the principles of the National Rifle Association. 
   That is their right on the Republican side to offer whatever they want to offer. We believe the message that came on The Mall last Sunday and across America, in Chicago and Los Angeles, of 750,000 mothers who gave up their Mother's Day to march, is that this Senate, this Congress, should get down to the business of passing laws to make America safer. 
   It also said this sense-of-the-Senate resolution is similar to talking about the weather: It really doesn't do anything. It is funny it would take 5 hours for the Republican leadership to respond to it if it really doesn't do anything. What it does is put the Senators in this Chamber on record: Do you commend the Million Mom March? Do you want this legislation to come out of committee immediately? If so, vote ``yes''; if you share the opposing position, vote ``no.'' At least Members are on the record. 
   Senator REED of Rhode Island offered a similar question in a sense-of-the-Senate resolution a few weeks ago, and 53 Senators--more than a majority--said: Let's vote for it. Bring the bill out, and let's get on with it. It still sits in committee because the Republican leadership is blocking the effort to pass gun safety legislation. 
   The Senator from Idaho stands on the floor and reminds mothers across America that there are many things injuring children: Automobile crashes, trauma, poisoning--the list goes on and on. The Senator from Idaho is certainly right. I don't know that the mothers of America needed to be reminded of that. They understood that when they came to The Mall. They asked us to do something about guns and the fact that every day in America --today, tomorrow, and the day after--12 children will die because of guns. Kids are dying because of 
   gangbangers, accidents with guns, suicides--12 kids every single day in America. We have become so used to this, it doesn't make the headlines anymore. There is not another nation on Earth with these grizzly statistics when it comes to guns. It is right here. It is America, the country of which we are so proud. 
   Mothers march to remind Congress we can do more and we can do better to make this world safer for their children. They are right. For the Senator from Idaho to say to the mothers across America, you know, a lot of kids get hurt in automobile accidents, it is a truism; there is no doubt about it. 
   I remind the Senator from Idaho, there is ample legislation, Federal and State, establishing the safety of cars we drive, establishing requirements to wear seatbelts and airbags in the cars, use of a child safety seat and restraints, legislation all over the country to make car travel more accommodating and safer for children, but there are no laws on the books, none whatever, in Washington, DC, concerning the safety of guns. 
   Make a toy gun to sell at Christmas and we have an agency that looks over your shoulder to say that may not be safe for kids. But make a real gun, the kind used in sport, hunting, or self-defense, and there are no--underline ``no''--Federal safety standards. 
   When it comes to kids and cars, we write all kinds of laws about safety. When it comes to guns, the gun lobby says: Hands off; it is our constitutional right to produce any type of weapon we want. 
   He talked about kids who suffocate on mattress covers and plastic bags. There are warnings printed. There is a Consumer Product Safety Commission watching these products in commerce, trying to keep them safe for families, but no such standards when it comes to guns in America. 
   I think the amendment of the Senator from Idaho falls apart. If he wants safety for children from all the hazards, I agree with him completely. And we have passed laws to establish those standards of safety in every single area but one--the firearm industry. They can make any kind of gun they want, and they are not subject to any kind of control or supervision by the Federal Government to sell it. They can sell it without a child safety device such as a trigger lock. They can put it on the market. Look at what happens. Twelve kids in America every single day. Twelve mothers receive a phone call, a knock on the door, and are told their child has just been shot, maybe killed, by a gun.  
   That is why the mothers marched in Chicago. That is why they marched in Washington and in Los Angeles and across the Nation. That is why we are on the floor of the Senate today. We don't believe that march was in vain. We believe that is the best illustration of democracy in America, when people from ordinary lives come forward and say: We are giving up a special day each year for mothers to let you know how important it is that we have safety in our schools and safety in our neighborhoods. We expect the Congress, the Senate, to listen. 
   To listen--that is what a democracy is all about. The voters, the people, speak and we listen. 
   Frankly, for almost a year now, this Congress has not listened. After the Columbine High School situation in Littleton, CO--12 kids were killed and a score or more were injured--America was horrified that this could happen in a ``good neighborhood,'' a ``good school.'' It happens all over America. 
   I live in Springfield, IL. We are not safe from this. There is not a town, there is not a neighborhood, there is not a community in America that is safe from gun violence. We are a nation of 200 million guns. If you have a careless gun owner who asserts his constitutional right to own a gun but refuses to accept his moral responsibility to store it safely, you know what is going to happen. Kids are going to find it. Kids are going to play with it. They may hurt themselves or an unsuspecting playmate. They may take that gun to school, as they did in Jonesboro, AR--an 11-year-old and a 15-year-old with an arsenal of weapons from the grandfather and all the ammunition, sitting in the woods, pulling the fire alarm and watching the kids come out into the playground and firing away at the kids and their teachers. 
   Should we do something about that? Should we require safety locks? That is part of the legislation that is bottled up in committee. That is part of the legislation Republicans will not bring to the floor. 
   In Littleton, CO, the guns that were used to kill the students were purchased at gun shows without background checks. Don't we want to know if the purchaser is a criminal, has a history of violent mental illness, or is a child? I would think we would want to know that. We want to keep guns out of the hands of those who would misuse them, but the National Rifle Association says: No, it is too much of an inconvenience to have a background check at a gun show. These folks need their weapons; they need them in a hurry; and they have to get out in the street. 
   Excuse me but walk through the airports, go through the metal detectors, subject yourself to the inconvenience, if you will, because we want safety on airplanes. If you go to a gun show, you should accept the burden and the inconvenience of a background check because we know if we do not make that background check, guns will get in the wrong hands. In the wrong hands it leads to crime and killing, pain, and suffering for mothers and fathers across America. 
   It is hard to understand the position of the National Rifle Association. This organization of some 3 million people has made a mockery of democracy. When the overwhelming majority of Americans want sensible gun safety laws, when sportsmen and hunters will accept the inconvenience of a background check and say that is part of it, we understand it--and this organization stands in the way of sensible gun safety legislation time and time and time again--it is disgraceful. That is why we are on the floor of the Senate. We want Democrats and Republicans to go on the record to commend the Million Mom March and to stand up for gun safety legislation. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I join the comments made by the Senator from Minnesota. This is a historic moment in this Chamber. It is not just another procedural vote. It is a decision by the majority, the Republican majority in this Senate, to reduce the opportunities that Members in the Senate have to discuss the issues of importance to this Nation. It is being offered in the name of efficiency. It is being offered in the name of saving time. 
   It was not that long ago, only a few years ago, when the Elementary and Secondary Education Act was debated for several weeks at a time, under both Democratic and Republican leadership, with the offering of a myriad of amendments on both sides. That was considered the deliberative process. That was what the Senate was all about. It was a battle of ideas and the best side would win. We would move forward with legislation in a bipartisan fashion. 
   What the majority leader is doing today with this point of order is to basically close down debate on the floor of the Senate. I think it is worthy of note that the issue that has precipitated this is gun control. This is the bone in the throat of some of the Members who cannot stand the idea of voting on this issue. 
   We believe this is an answer to that. Bring the bill to the floor and let's vote for it up or down, bring it out of conference. The idea we are somehow paying homage to efficiency in the name of this institution, in the name of taking away our birthright as Senators to speak to issues on behalf of the American people, I believe, is, frankly, going to penalize this institution.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have worked in and around legislatures in the Congress for most of my life, over 30 years. I understand what being in the minority means. That means we usually lose. That is part of the business. 
   I also believed when I was elected to the Senate that I had an obligation beyond my obligation to the people of the State of Illinois, an obligation to this institution. This institution represents something special in the history of this Nation. Only about 1,840 men and women have had the honor to serve in the Senate. I think we all feel an obligation to our Nation, to our Constitution but, equally, we feel an obligation to the Senate. 
   I have stood by for the last 4 years and watched consistently while the Republican majority has reduced the opportunity for Members of the Senate to express their point of view, reduced the opportunity to deliberate the great issues, reduced the opportunity for people to stand up and speak from the heart on the floor of the Senate. I don't believe that is consistent with the history or tradition of the Senate. 
   What we saw happen today I hope will be noted by the press and historians. Bringing up the controversial gun issue, the Republican leadership in the Senate decided to close down for the first time in 16 years the opportunity of any Senator, Democrat or Republican, to offer a sense-of-the-Senate resolution to an appropriations bill. They have limited, once again, the opportunity for Senators of both parties to debate. I don't believe that is in the best interest of the Senate nor is it in the best interest of the country. 
   It is clear evidence that this issue of gun safety, an issue which touches the hearts of so many families across America, is one that must be debated and resolved on the floor of the Senate. Instead, every obstacle possible is thrown in our path. 
   What we are asking for is simply this: Bring the conference report out; let Members vote on it. If we pass it, send it to the President; if we don't, take it to the people in an election. That is what this business is about. 
   Senator KENNEDY, who has served for over 30 years in this body, has one of the most important pieces of legislation in his control on the Democratic side, our education bill. He is asking for a chance to debate some important amendments, some controversial amendments, bring it forward and pass it, as every Congress has done, decade after decade. And he is stopped, week after week, by the Republican majority which refuses to consider amendments they find unpopular. 
   I understand as a Member of the Senate I will have to vote for and against unpopular issues. That is the nature of this job. I understand, as well, that we are sent here to deliberate these issues. 
   I close, saying I am sorry that the majority leader felt some of the comments made earlier were personal in nature. They were not. Though I disagree with him on so many issues, I do respect him. I hope he will pause and reflect on the future of this institution and believe that beyond the issue of gun control, we all have an obligation on both sides of the aisle to preserve the history and tradition of the Senate.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from California. Every day in America, 13 mothers receive a phone call or a knock on the door, a word from a neighbor, and their lives are changed. Every day in America, 13 mothers learn that one of their children has been killed by a gun. Every day in America, 13 mothers have a pain in their heart that will be there for a lifetime. 
   This last Sunday, I went to Chicago, IL, on the banks of Lake Michigan. Our Million Mom March chapter came together, and thousands of people came out. They were inspired, of course, by the fact that it was Mother's Day and that we were addressing this issue because it is a family issue, and especially an issue that mothers take to heart because mothers, by their nature, protect their children. They came forward on the banks of Lake Michigan in Chicago and here on The Mall in Washington, DC, and in Los Angeles, and in cities across America, to say: Let us protect our children; protect our children from the gun criminals who menace our neighborhoods, our communities and our schools; protect our children from the gang bangers who spray these bullets from semiautomatic and automatic weapons across playgrounds, day care centers, and bus stops; protect our children from careless gun owners who insist on their constitutional right to own a gun but will not accept their moral responsibility to store it safely away from children; protect our children from a gun lobby in this town that has made a mockery of democracy, which owns this Chamber and owns the House of Representatives, which stops us in our tracks; protect our children from the indifference of millions of American families who know what I say is true but who didn't come to the march, who don't call a Congressman or a Senator and just shake their heads and say, ``It's politics, it's hopeless; they don't listen, they don't care.'' 
   The Million Mom March was an inspiration to so many people. It was an inspiration to me because at the end of the march in Chicago, the Bell Campaign, which sponsored it, invited the families of gun victims to come forward and literally ring a bell for their victim. They started coming slowly from the crowd, and then the numbers increased. The procession went on and on and on--black, white, brown, men, women, brothers and sisters, sons and daughters, breaking down in tears as they pealed that bell for a gun victim. 
   I stood there, as a Member of the Senate, humbled by that experience, trying to imagine for one brief moment what it must be like to receive that telephone call or that knock on the door. I vowed I would come back to this Chamber this week and begin a personal campaign, a personal crusade to make the Senate act on this issue. To think that it is 1 year after Columbine and we have done nothing--we have not passed a bill to keep guns out of the hands of criminals or kids; we have been totally stopped by this gun lobby--it is a disgrace, a disgrace to this Chamber, to the Congress, and to this country. The million moms who came forward are watching and waiting and praying that before this ends, we will do something. 
   The National Rifle Association bought a full-page ad in the Washington Post Friday criticizing the Million Mom March. Here is what they said: ``It is a political agenda masquerading as motherhood.'' 
   I have a message for the National Rifle Association. This was no masquerade; this was the real thing. These were real families who have endured the pain and suffering of gun violence. They are coming forward and challenging you, gun lobby, National Rifle Association, and challenging us in the Senate and in the House to do what is right for America, to reduce gun violence, reduce the pain, and reduce the suffering. 
   There is no excuse for the fact that, for 1 year, the Republican leadership in the House and Senate has refused to bring a bill to the floor so we could vote and send to the President a bill to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and kids. You will hear more about this issue. 
   Thank you, Mr. President.

   Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from California. 
   I salute my colleague from the State of Massachusetts. Senator KENNEDY has been the leader on so many issues throughout his political career. You can almost count on it: It is late at night--7:30 p.m. on the Senate floor. Very few Senators are still around to debate this important issue. But Senator KENNEDY, who has become legendary in his commitment to issues in the Senate, stayed for this important debate. I am honored to share the floor with him. I am honored to share the same position on this issue with my colleagues, Senator KENNEDY and Senator BOXER. 
   As Senator BOXER noted earlier, at the Million Mom March in Washington, there were several members of Senator KENNEDY's family who came and spoke about what gun violence has meant to them. America knows that story. America knows it so well. America knows of the assassination of President John Kennedy, of the assassination of Senator Robert Kennedy, and all the tragedies that have befallen that family. We know it because they are so  prominent in the American culture and the American political scene. We know, as well, that people with less prominent names, not that well known, have endured gun violence on a daily basis. 
   At the end of the Million Mom March, in Chicago, a spokesman for one of the group's sponsoring it, the Bell Campaign Fund, brought a bell near the stage and invited the families to come up and ring it if they had lost someone to gun violence in their family. 
   At first they were hesitant to come forward; and then more started to move forward. Finally, it became a long, long procession of young and old, of those who were not well 
   dressed and those who were very well dressed, of rich and poor, of black and white and brown, of children and of the elderly. They came forward--hesitated--and rang the bell. They had lost someone in their family to gun violence. 
   As you watched this procession go by, anyone observing it could not help but think there but for the grace of God go I; it can happen to any family in America. 
   A nation of 270 million people, and a nation of over 200 million guns, a nation where every day we pick up a newspaper, turn on the radio, or turn on the television, to hear of another gun death. The sad reality is that we have become inured to it. We have become used to it. We think this is what life is like in the world. It is not. It is what life is like in America-- in America, where we have failed to pass legislation for gun safety, to make the neighborhoods and the schools, the towns, and the cities across America safer places to live. 
   What calls our attention to this steady stream of information about gun violence is the most outrageous situations. For the last several years, the most outrageous gun violence has occurred in America's schools: 
   In February, 1997, in Bethel, AK, a 16-year-old boy took a shotgun and a bag of shells to school, killing the principal and a student and injuring two others. 
   On October 1, 1997, in Pearl, MS, a 16-year-old boy is sentenced to life in prison for killing his mother and then going to his high school and shooting nine students, two of them fatally. 
   On December 1, 1997, in West Paducah, KY, three students are killed, five others wounded at the high school; a 14-year-old student pleaded guilty--mentally ill--to murder. 
   On March 24, 1998, Jonesboro, AR--you will remember this one--four girls and a teacher killed and 10 people wounded at a middle school, when two boys, aged 11 and 13, fired from a nearby woods. They literally brought an arsenal of weapons and ammunition. They triggered the fire alarm bell. The kids ran out of the classroom and they opened fire. 
   America, 1998: 
   On April 24 of that year, in Edinboro, PA, a science teacher is killed in front of his students at an eighth grade dance. A 15-year-old pleaded guilty. 
   On May 19, 1998, in Fayetteville, TN, 3 days before graduation, an 18-year-old honors student opened fire at his high school, killing a classmate who was dating his ex-girlfriend. 
   On May 21, 1998, in Springfield, OR, two teenagers are killed and more than 20 hurt when a teenage boy opened fire at his high school, after killing his parents. 
   On April 20, 1999--the news story of the year in America; you may not have heard of the town before, but you know the name now--in Littleton, CO, two students at Columbine High School killed 12 of their classmates and a teacher and wounded 23 others before killing themselves. 
   That was supposed to be the gun tragedy that turned this issue around. Congress was supposed to wake up at that point and finally do something to protect America from gun violence. 
   Of course, we considered legislation on the floor of the Senate, and it was a long, painful debate. The bill finally came up before us, and on a vote of 49-49--a tie vote--Vice President GORE came to this Chamber, cast the tie-breaking vote, and we passed a gun safety bill which, under the Constitution, then went to the House of Representatives across the Rotunda. 
   Was this a radical bill? Was this something so outlandish 
    that we could not expect the House of Representatives to consider it? I do not think so. Forty-eight of my colleagues and myself believed it was a sensible gun control measure. 
   What did it say? 
   If you buy a gun at a gun show, we want to make sure you can legally own it. 
   If you have a criminal record, we do not want you to buy it. 
   If you are a child, we do not want you to buy it. 
   If you have a restraining order because of domestic violence or something else, we do not want you to buy it. 
   If you have a history of violent mental illness, we do not want you to buy a gun. 
   We want to check your background and make sure you do not have a problem where you should not own a gun. 
   Is this a radical idea, keeping guns out of the hands of people who are criminals? The Brady law, which we passed in America, has kept guns out of the hands of hundreds of thousands of people such as those I described. And you think to yourself: Come on now, somebody convicted of a murder surely is not going to walk into a Federal gun dealer and try to buy a gun. Yes, they do it--time and time again. 
   Nobody said they were rocket scientists. They are people who were criminals and want to be criminals again. They may not be very bright, but they are smart enough to know they need another gun to pull off another crime. 
   We stop them with the Brady law. But the Brady law does not apply to gun shows. Gun shows across America are a loophole; they are exempt. You buy what you want at a gun show and nobody checks. Think about that. Even the least intelligent criminal will figure that out: Go to a gun show and get your gun. Do not go to a dealer. The dealer is going to check it out, find out if you have a criminal record. 
   So we said, in this gun safety law, let's do a background check at gun shows. Let's apply this same law we apply to gun dealers. That is not a radical idea. It is common sense. 
   Senator KOHL of Wisconsin had an amendment--part of this bill--that every handgun in America would be sold with a trigger lock, a child safety device. 
   It is interesting. We have many sportsmen and hunters in my family. They are strong in the belief that this is their right to own a gun; and I do not dispute it. But they are also strong in the belief that they never want their gun to harm anyone else, any innocent victim. They certainly do not want their gun to harm a child. Now they are turning around and buying trigger locks. I am glad they are. 
   Senator KOHL says, from now on, every handgun sold in America will have a trigger lock so that the parent who puts their gun up on the top shelf of the closet, thinking their little son or daughter will never find it--they may be wrong, but the child may be safe because with the trigger lock the child will not be able to fire the gun. 
   That is not a radical idea. That is part of gun safety. In fact, if there had been trigger locks in Jonesboro, AR, maybe these kids could not have taken the guns out in the woods, with an 11-year-old kid firing away at teachers and classmates. 
   No. I think, quite honestly, we all believe that if you are going to exercise any right to own a gun, you should exercise the responsibility to store it safely, securely, and away from children. 
   That is part of the bill sent to the House, a bill which still languishes. Senator FEINSTEIN of California has a provision that says you don't need a huge ammo clip with literally hundreds of rounds of ammunition for any sport or any hunting. So as you cannot manufacture them in America, you should not be able to import them from overseas. That doesn't sound radical to me. I don't know many people who need a hundred rounds to go out and kill a deer. As I have said many times, if you need an assault weapon to kill a deer, maybe you ought to stick to fishing. But the fact is, Senator FEINSTEIN's amendment was adopted as part of the bill. 
   We had an amendment by a Republican, Senator JOHN ASHCROFT of Missouri, that would limit who could buy semiautomatic assault weapons--certainly making sure that those under age of 18 cannot--and establishing an age of 21. We had an amendment by Senator BOXER to have the FTC and  the Attorney General investigate whether gun companies were trying to attract young buyers, underage buyers, with their advertising. 
   That is it. I have just described the entire gun safety bill. Did you hear anything that is patently unconstitutional, so radical and outlandish that we should not consider it in America? I don't think so. In that amendment, we have basic, commonsense efforts to make America safer. I am not so naive as to believe that we are going to end gun violence by passing this bill, but we think it will help. We certainly have an obligation to help. We passed that bill in the Senate, sent it over to the House, and the National Rifle Association tore it to pieces, passed a weak substitute, sent it to a conference committee where it has sat for 8 months, since Columbine High School. We have had all sorts of meetings on the floor of the Senate and in the House, all sorts of debates and committee meetings, all sorts of press conferences, and we have done absolutely nothing to make America safer when it comes to gun violence. 
   What do we have to show for it? Since Columbine High School, on May 20, 1999, in Conyers, GA, a 15-old-boy opened fire in a high school with a .357 caliber handgun and a rifle wounding six students. 
   On November 19, 1999, in Deming, NM, a 13-year-old girl was shot in the head at school and died the next day. A 12-year-old boy was arrested. 
   On December 6, 1999, at Fort Gibson, OK, a 13-year-old student fired at least 15 rounds in a middle school wounding four classmates. Asked why he did it, he said, ``I don't know.'' 
   February 29, 2000, is one you won't forget. At Mount Morris Township, MI, a 6-year-old boy pulled a .32 caliber Davis Industry semiautomatic pistol out of his pocket, pointed it at a classmate, turned the gun on Kayla Rolland, a little 6-year-old girl, and fatally shot her in the neck. 
   That is America since Columbine. America, unfortunately, is very busy with gun violence but, sadly, the Congress is not busy with legislation to reduce and end gun violence. So today, Senator DASCHLE came to the floor with a suggestion, one which obviously did not set well with the Republican majority. Senator DASCHLE suggested that we pass a resolution--and I want to read the language--that it is the sense of the Senate that the organizers, sponsors, and participants of the Million Mom March should be commended for rallying to demand sensible gun safety legislation, and Congress should immediately pass the 
   conference report to accompany H.R. 1501--the bill I described, the gun safety bill--that includes all the provisions that I described, and do so as soon as possible. 
   With those two suggestions, the Republican majority stopped the Senate for 5 straight hours. They would not have this Senate vote to commend the organizers and mothers who participated in the Million Mom March, and they did not want this Congress to go on the record to pass gun safety legislation for 5 hours. They tried every parliamentary trick they could to stop this, and then when they found we were determined to bring this to a vote, they finally relented at about 3 o'clock. They said: All right, you can debate it a couple hours tonight and a couple hours tomorrow. That is why we are here. 
   I salute Senator BOXER of California. As you can tell, many Members of the Senate had other things they wanted to do. But she and I and Senator KENNEDY and so many others believe that after we have seen what those mothers went through to put together that march to come out and ask us to pass sensible legislation, we owed it to them to be here this evening and speak to it. 
   Let me talk about two or three issues that will come up in this debate. The National Rifle Association spent a substantial sum of money last week on television in preparation for the Million Mom March. They ran a lot of ads showing a member of their board of directors--a woman--who articulated their point of view, as well as their personal hero, Mr. Charlton Heston. They said during the course of these ads that what we need in America to reduce the killing of 12 or 13 children a day is more education. They use something called Eddie Eagle, which is like Joe Camel, for the NRA. It is a little symbol they use to try to attract children's attention with it. They say if we have more Eddie Eagle training in schools, we will have fewer gun deaths. 
   Well, this may surprise some, but I don't disagree with the NRA, to some extent. If they are suggesting we should teach children that guns are dangerous and they ought to stay away from them, I salute that and agree with that. In a nation of 200 million guns, we should do that. Members of my staff in Chicago and in Washington sit down with 4- and 5-year-old children and explain to them that guns are dangerous. You have to do it in America. Even if there is not a gun in your home, you don't know where your child may be playing or whether their classmate is going to find a gun. You should tell them that. It is a reality. 
   But if the National Rifle Association thinks education of children to reduce gun violence means teaching kids to shoot straight, that is where I part company with them. I don't think kids should be handling firearms. I think firearms should be in the hands of adults who understand the danger of a weapon. I go along with the National Rifle Association if they want to join us in educating children in school about the danger of firearms. That makes sense. Maybe we can find some common ground on that. 
   The second thing the NRA tells us is we have all the laws we need. All the States have laws, some of the cities have laws, and the Federal Government has all the laws it needs and, for goodness' sake, just enforce the law. This may surprise the NRA, but I don't disagree with that either. We should enforce the laws. In fact, we find that when it comes to the number of high-level firearm offenders, those sentenced to 5 or more years, Federal prosecution of those offenders has gone up 41 
   percent under this administration. The average sentence for firearm offenders in Federal court has increased by more than 2 years in that same period of time. Enforcement is taking place. Should there be more? Yes, and I will support that, too. 
   But let me tell you, there was an interesting vote on the floor. One of the Senators who opposed my motion on the floor is here this evening. When it came to enforcement, I asked those who are friends of the National Rifle Association to put their votes where their rhetoric happened to be. I asked them if they would join me in supporting President Clinton, who asked for 500 more agents at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to investigate firearms dealers who were violating the law and to make sure that we kept an eye on the people who were selling the weapons, and a thousand more prosecutors and judges and others across America to prosecute the same gun laws. I offered the amendment on the floor, and one of the Senators, who is here and is a member of the board of directors--or was--of the NRA, amended it and said take out the part on the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the 500 additional agents, and then we will vote for it. 
   So that really calls into question their sincerity when they say they want more enforcement. It turns out a very small percentage of firearms dealers in America actually sell guns used in crimes. Most of them abide by the law. We want to stop the ones who violate the law. When I tried to put more agents at work to do that, I was stopped by a Republican Senator who says he believes in the second amendment but wants enforcement but he would not vote for 500 ATF agents for more enforcement.

   Mr. DURBIN. The House Appropriations Committee, barely 2 years after two Capitol policemen were killed protecting the Members of Congress and visitors in the Capitol Building, has proposed that we cut by 400 the number of Capitol Police working at the Capitol. It is an incredible suggestion. We have doors leading into the office buildings and into the Capitol that literally hundreds, if not thousands, of people pass through but where there is one security guard. Many believe there should be two at these doors that are the busiest. 
   Instead of enhancing the Capitol Police so they can do their job and be safe in doing it, the House Republican leadership called for cutting 400 Capitol policemen. That does not sound like good law enforcement and vigorous law enforcement. Just the opposite is true. They are suggesting, for more enforcement of the law, cutting back on the police after we had the terrible tragedy right here in the Capitol not that long ago.

   Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from California. 
   I also want to tell you that I think this issue is an important national issue in this Presidential campaign because I think what you hear from two candidates is a clear difference when it comes to dealing with sensible gun laws and gun safety. 
   Vice President GORE came to the Senate floor casting the deciding vote on the gun safety bill, which I mentioned earlier. He has supported it publicly. He has spoken in favor of it. I believe it is fair to say he has supported the Brady law, he has supported the assault weapon ban, and he has supported efforts to have a waiting period so people do not in a high state of emotion go out and buy a gun and harm themselves or others. That is a matter of record. That is his position. 
   On the other side, the Governor of Texas, George W. Bush, has a much different record. In his State, he signed into law a concealed weapon law which allows people to carry guns into churches and synagogues. 
   There are people who believe we will be a safer nation if everybody carries a gun. I am not one of them. I happen to believe we are not a safer nation when the couple is arguing across the restaurant and you have to wonder whether or not someone is going to reach into their pocket or purse and pull out a gun. 
   I don't happen to believe we are a safer nation whenever a policeman who pulls a car over is doubly worried and concerned that that speeder may have a gun in the glove compartment instead of the registration they are apparently going after. 
   I don't believe we are a safer nation when people are carrying guns to public events, such as high school football games, or are taking them into churches. I don't believe that makes America safer. 
   Governor Bush signed a law in Texas so people would have a right in the State of Texas to carry guns around. That is his image of a safer America; it is not mine. I am glad my State of Illinois has not passed such a law, and I hope we never do. 
   In addition, it appears that one of the problems the Republican Party has with our gun safety bill is that we require background checks at gun shows. Which State has more gun shows than any other State in the Nation? The State of Texas. The provision in the law--the loophole in the Brady law--which said you don't do a background check at a gun show was put in by a Democratic Texas Congressman. It is an important industry, I take it, in the State of Texas to preserve these gun laws. It may be the reason Governor Bush will not come out and support the gun safety law which passed in the Senate with Vice President GORE'S tie-breaking vote. 
   Finally, the day before the Million Mom March weekend, Governor Bush came on television and said: I tell you what we are going to do in Texas. We are going to make a lot of trigger locks available. We are going to buy a lot of them and give them away. 
   I am glad he is doing it. I think it is a nice thing to do. It is certainly not a comprehensive attitude toward dealing with gun violence. I would like to see more communities and States do that. But certainly I would like to see Senator KOHL's amendment which requires a trigger lock with every gun as part of a law of the land, so that when you buy a handgun, it has a trigger lock and it has a child safety device. A once-in-a-lifetime or once-in-a-decade effort by a Governor in any State won't make any difference unless it is in a comprehensive approach, 
    as Senator KOHL has suggested. 
   It is interesting to note that when the Republican leadership is asked why they have failed in over 8 months to bring this gun safety legislation to the floor, they in the majority and in control of the House and Senate say it is the Democrats' fault. That is a little hard to understand. In fact, it is impossible to believe. 
   I have been appointed to conference committees in the Senate in name only where my name will be read by the President and only the conference committee of Republicans goes off and meets, adopts a conference committee report, signs it, and sends it back to the floor without even inviting me to attend a session. The Republican leadership majority could do that at any moment in time. To suggest that somehow the Democrats are stopping them from bringing a gun safety bill out of committee and to the floor just defies common sense. They are in control. They have to accept responsibility for their actions. 
   Senator ORRIN HATCH, a Republican of Utah, is the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. He is the head conferee on the Senate side for the Republicans on this conference on gun safety. My colleague from the State of Illinois, Congressman HENRY HYDE, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, shares that responsibility with him. And the two of them have a majority of votes in this conference committee. If they wanted to bring a gun safety bill forward, there is nothing the Democrats could do to stop them from doing such. Yet they haven't done it. Eight months have passed, and more people have been shot and killed. 
   Stories come out suggesting to us there is much more to it. Unless and until Governor Bush decides this is an important issue in his Presidential campaign, unless and until Governor Bush decides he is for gun safety, that bill is going to stay in that conference committee. That is a simple political fact of life. 
   The Republicans on Capitol Hill don't want to embarrass their candidate for President by bringing out a bill he opposes. So the bill sits in this conference committee. And 750,000 mothers across America rallied in 65 different cities saying to Members of Congress, Members of the House and the Senate: For goodness' sake, can you put party aside for a moment and think about the safety of our children in schools? Can you put party aside for a moment and think about the safety of our neighborhoods so that we believe kids can stand at the bus stop without worrying about a gang banger coming by and spraying bullets? Can you put partisanship aside and decide that we can all agree we want to have background checks at gun shows, and trigger locks on handguns, and these huge ammo clips kept out of the country? Isn't it time Congress came together and agreed on  those basic simple things? The fact of the matter is, we have not, and apparently under this leadership we cannot. 
   The National Rifle Association is boasting that their membership is higher than ever. They love this, they say, because the more attention to this issue, the more people sign up for the National Rifle Association. More power to them. But I will tell you that if I had to put my political future with a group, it would be with the mothers who are marching and not with Wayne LaPierre and Charlton Heston. They represent the real feelings of families across America who understand that gun safety is important and that it includes not just the passage of laws to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and kids, but it also includes enforcement and it also includes education. All of it comes together. 
   The folks who listen to the NRA and believe them think that you stop once you talk about education and enforcement--that there is no reason to go beyond it. Yet we know better. We know those kids at Columbine High School got their guns from a gun show by a straw purchaser. We know it could have been more difficult if we had passed a law in the Senate and if it had been signed by President Clinton. 
    We know that some of those lives might have been saved. Sadly, that didn't occur. 
   Now we are faced with the reality of a legislative session that is moving to the spending bills. It appears that the Republican leadership is not going to have its own agenda it wants passed but instead will move to appropriations bills, and in so doing, give us a chance, at least with sense-of-the-Senate resolutions, to continue to remind the Members of the Senate and people across America that we have not done anything to make this a safer nation when it comes to guns. 
   I understand, I think, the feelings of some gun owners. They feel put upon, that all this debate somehow involves them. Some of them have what I think is a naive, if not a wrong, point of view that they should not be inconvenienced in the ownership of their guns. 
   Let me suggest that we inconvenience a lot of people for a lot of good reasons in America. I was inconvenienced this morning when I went through the airport. I had to go through a metal detector. It is an inconvenience. I expect, because I want to sit on the plane with peace of mind, to know that every effort has been made to keep those who would create some terrorist environment off the plane. I am inconvenienced when I drive my car by the rules of the road of Illinois--thank goodness for the inconveniences--which require brakes on my car and require me to stay on the right-hand side of the road and abide by the speed limit. It is an inconvenience I accept because I want to bring my family home safely. 
   I think most gun owners are prepared to accept some inconvenience in life if they know it means they can continue to use their guns legally and safely. In my home State of Illinois, it is a firearms identification card; you have to apply to the Illinois State Police. They do a background check on you. They give you a little card. You can't buy a gun or ammunition in Illinois without that card with your picture on it. 
   I don't own a gun, but I applied for one of these cards. I wanted to know how tough it was. It wasn't too tough: Fill out a questionnaire, give them a little photo, they do a background check, send me my card, and I send them a few bucks every year to renew it. That is a device that could be used on a national basis. It has been an inconvenience for the gun owners of Illinois for 40 years now but not such a serious inconvenience that they cannot go out and enjoy sports that involve guns. 
   We are talking about minor inconveniences with major dividends for America. Background checks to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and fugitives and stalkers and kids so we don't have the sad situations that I recounted earlier in the schools and other places across America, these are things of common sense. These are things which, frankly, both parties should agree. 
   It is interesting to note that the Republican substitute to our amendment commending the Million Mom March spends a full page or so blasting the Clinton administration for the inadequate prosecution for gun crimes. As I read earlier, the statistics don't back up some of the claims they have made. Instead of commending the million moms who stood up saying, ``Make America safer,'' the Republicans have replied by blasting the first family. That is their idea--go after President Clinton; don't stand up for the families across America who came 
    together last Sunday. 
   Then they say they want a juvenile crime conference committee report that has a lot more than guns in it. Quite frankly, there are some things they want with which I can agree. It is interesting they don't call for the gun safety amendments which were adopted by the Senate. Of course, they close by repeating their belief that it is a right of each law-abiding citizen to own a firearm for any legitimate purpose, including self-defense or recreation, and that should not be infringed. I don't think it is an infringement to put a basic requirement to try to keep guns in the hands of those who will use them safely, rather than those who would misuse them. 
   I thank my colleague from the State of California for her leadership on this particular debate. I was happy to join her this evening. I look forward to joining her tomorrow when at least we will have a sense-of-the-Senate resolution and an opportunity for a vote as to whether or not we should finally tell this conference committee to get down to business.

   Mr. DURBIN. I say to my friend from California, I understand the sentiments expressed. Even in my own family, I have a sister-in-law who is interested in politics. We talk about it from time to time. She is the mother of 10 children and I think 20-plus grandchildren--I lost count. She decided when she heard about this Million Mom March that she was going to be here in Washington on The Mall last Sunday. She called every woman in the family and said: We are all going down on Metro together. They did. 
   The same thing happened with other people in my Chicago office. There was a feeling of mothers across America that this was a special moment and  that they were going to take time away from their families, away from what was their day, Mother's Day, and come down and be with so many others. 
   I was in Chicago. I know the Senator from California was here in Washington and was touched by what occurred on The Mall gathering. 
   That is a sentiment growing in America. My Republican colleagues should think twice about criticizing this resolution where we commend these mothers who had the courage to come forward because they believe so passionately on this issue. 
   When it comes to the question raised by the other person who e-mailed or contacted your office about the accessibility of guns, they are easily acceptable. The District of Columbia has strong, strong, anti-gun laws in terms of ownership possession. Yet you go right across the bridge into Virginia or over the line into Maryland and you can purchase guns that end up coming right in to crime scenes here in Washington, DC. 
   It is naive to believe that State laws are going to control this traffic in guns. In fact, when they did a survey in Illinois of guns confiscated in crimes and their origin, where they were from--they traced them with the gun numbers and such--they found the No. 1 State for sending crime guns to the State of Illinois was the home State of the majority leader of the Senate, the State of Mississippi. Of all places, Mississippi. Why? It is easier to buy guns there. They buy them, they throw them in the backs of trucks and trunks of cars and take off for Chicago or Boston or wherever it happens to be. 
   This steady trafficking, in many cases illegal trafficking of these guns, needs to be better policed, and we need to ensure we understand that these guns move across borders at will. I would say to the Senator from California, the experience of the second lady who contacted you, when a person who was not supposed to have a gun had easy access, really speaks to the issue of the proliferation of guns in America, and their easy access not only to the violent and the criminal but also kids.

   Mr. DURBIN. April 20, 1999. And if I am not mistaken, 12 or 13 high school students were killed, and more were injured during the course of that time. America was fixed on this event as no other event, despite all the gun violence, when we consider it could happen at a high school such as Columbine. 
   Is the Senator from New Jersey able to tell me what the response was of the Senate to that tragedy?

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from Missouri, Senator BOND, in introducing the Clean Air and Water Preservation Act of 2000, a bill that will ban the gasoline additive MTBE and promote the use of renewable ethanol fuel. 
   By now, many of us are aware of the dangers methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) poses to our environment, our water supply, and our communities. Although this additive has only been widely used for about five years, it is now one of the most frequently detected volatile organic chemicals in drinking water supplies across the nation. In fact, MTBE contamination has affected communities in my home state of Illinois raising many public health concerns. 
   This legislation addresses these problems by banning MTBE within three years and urging refiners to replace it with ethanol. The bill also increases consumer protection by requiring gasoline stations to label pumps that still sell MTBE. And the Environmental Protection Agency is directed to assist states in getting the chemical out of their groundwater. 
   Furthermore, the Clean Air and Water Preservation Act of 2000 includes strict anti-backsliding provisions to ensure we do not lose the air quality benefits that we have already achieved. Protection from toxic chemicals and environmentally sound emission levels will not be compromised. 
   Most important, this legislation upholds the air quality benefits of the reformulated gasoline (RFG) program by maintaining the oxygenate standard. Adding oxygen to our gasoline has helped clean the air in many cities across the nation. With the use of ethanol, the Chicago RFG program has proven highly successful in improving the air quality in Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin. 
   I am proud to say that Illinois is the nation's largest ethanol producer and that one in every six rows of Illinois corn--280 million bushels--goes to ethanol production. But, an expanded role for this renewable fuel is more than a boost to industry; it is jobs to rural America, and it is energy security. As we look for solutions to high oil prices, we must remember that ethanol is a viable alternative fuel--domestically produced and environmentally friendly. In fact, every 23 gallons of ethanol displaces a barrel of foreign oil. 
   I commend the Clinton administration and Senators DASCHLE and LUGAR for their efforts aimed at solving the problems associated with MTBE and opening a dialogue on renewable fuel content standards. However, I strongly feel we need to maintain our commitment to preserving the oxygenate standard, which has proven to be integral to achieving the goals of the Clean Air Act. 
   The Clean Air and Water Preservation Act of 2000 is good for our environment and public health and a boost for rural economies. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this legislation.

    Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today marks the 10th anniversary of the declaration of independence of Latvia from the domination of the Soviet Union. Latvia's resolution on May 4th, 1990 followed closely after Lithuania's declaration in March. These courageous Baltic countries led the way to throw off the yoke of Soviet Communist imperialism, resulting in the disintegration of the Soviet Union. 
   The courage of the peaceful crowd that surrounded the parliament building in Riga to prevent a Soviet attack should be remembered and commended. The Latvians showed the power of peaceful resistance and risked their lives doing so. 
   Latvia has now become a vibrant democracy. It has established a free-market economy and the rule of law. Latvia wants to be fully integrated into Europe, and is seeking membership in the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). 
   This year we also celebrate the 60th anniversary of the refusal of the United States to recognize Soviet domination of the Baltic states. The logic then and the logic now is that the United States will only recognize free and independent Baltic states. What we celebrate this year is what we must help preserve next year and the year after that. We must carry on that principle today by being sure that Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia are admitted into NATO as an unequivocal statement that we will never tolerate domination of the Baltic states again. 
   I support admitting the Baltic states into NATO and I hope my colleagues here in the Senate will support their entry also in the next round of NATO expansion. 
   That debate we will save for another day, but I am sure all my colleagues can agree on the importance of the Baltic states' contribution to the freedom and independence of the former Soviet Republics and will join me in congratulating Latvia in celebrating 10 years of that precious freedom and independence.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the issue of nuclear waste is an important one in my home state of Illinois. More than half the electricity generated in our state comes from nuclear power plants. We have an extraordinarily large amount of nuclear waste in our state. We would like to see it moved, once and for all, to a safe facility away from population centers in Illinois and virtually in every other state. 
   In that respect, I admire the Senator from Alaska for his tenacity in trying to come forward with a nuclear waste bill that will put to rest an issue that literally will challenge us for centuries to come. 
   This nuclear waste, once transported, is still dangerous. We have to find a politically and scientifically acceptable way to move it to a safe spot in America where we can not only store it for the future generations that we can think of, but also for the generations in centuries to come who could still be exposed to this hazard. 
   Having said that, the nuclear waste bill supported by the majority, and vetoed by President Clinton, fails the most important test. This bill, S. 1287, the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2000, is not environmentally responsible. 
   First, it prevents the Federal Government from taking ownership and legal responsibility for the nuclear waste in Illinois and around the nation. The omission of this provision undermines the U.S. Department of Energy's efforts to resolve lawsuits with utilities and to focus on the development of a permanent repository for this waste. 
   In addition, this bill establishes unrealistic deadlines for the completion of a repository and the transportation of waste to that facility. The bill sets deadlines for the Department of Energy under terms that the Department of Energy says they cannot meet. They are physically impossible. Failure to set realistic deadlines threatens public health and safety and the environment, and will only lead to further lawsuits in the future. 
   Finally--I believe this is the most telling point--this bill purposely bars the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency from establishing a radiation safety standard for the national waste site until after the Presidential election. The science will not change after the Presidential election, but many writing this bill hope the President will change and that they will be able to elect a President who has a different environmental point of view. 
   When it comes to the safety of future generations from radiation hazards, it should not be determined by the outcome of an election. It should be determined by scientists who take into account public health and safety. 
   I refuse to be part of this deal that plays politics with the health and safety of Illinoisans and millions of Americans. I want the nuclear waste safely removed from my state and stored safely so it will never endanger future generations. The President was right to veto this bill. I support his position.

    Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the great people of Goreville, IL, during their centennial celebration. Although Goreville was not officially incorporated until 1900, it has been a busy settlement since before the Civil War. A post office was established as early as 1886, after the Gore family migrated from Georgia to settle on the land they had purchased from the government in 1854. When the Civil War broke out, General John A. Logan visited the community to recruit volunteers for his 31st Illinois Volunteer Infantry, which rendezvoused at Camp Dunlap in Jacksonville, IL, before moving on to Fort Defiance in Cairo, IL. 
   When the Chicago and Eastern Illinois railroad went through Johnson County in 1889, the village moved its businesses down the road. This flexibility proved beneficial to Goreville as the small village prospered. 
   In April 1900, the village was incorporated, and was formally recognized by the State of Illinois in a small ceremony on July 5, 1900. While Goreville's population has never been extremely large, it has gradually grown to 900 people. Goreville is nestled next to Ferne Clyffe State Park. In 1923, the State Park was declared ``the most beautiful spot in Illinois.''  
   The week of May 7-13 has been designated as the Goreville Centennial Celebration. As the people of Goreville hold a series of events to celebrate the 100th birthday of the village, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the centennial celebration of Goreville, IL.

   Mr. DURBIN. One of the issues pending is a Tax Code issue called the marriage tax penalty. What it boils down to is that a number of people in this country, when they go to get married, their combined incomes on a joint return puts them in a higher tax bracket, so they are, in fact, penalized by the Tax Code because of their decision to get married. 
   The debate on the floor of the Senate now is whether we will change the Tax Code to eliminate that penalty. It makes common sense, really. We want to encourage people to get married. The idea that we would penalize them under the Tax Code for getting married makes no sense at all. There is common agreement on that. Democrats and Republicans believe we should eliminate that penalty. The difference, of course, comes down to how you do it and what the bill says as part of the tax relief. 
   I have to say, parenthetically, that I don't know too many young couples who, when they are making plans to get engaged and to get married, say, well, before we finalize this and buy a wedding ring, we better stop off at the accountant's office to figure out the tax consequences. I am sure some do that, but my wife and I sure didn't, and most people don't do that. 
   Notwithstanding that observation, it is right for us to consider changing the Tax Code to eliminate this penalty. Interestingly enough, though, there are almost an equal number of couples who get married and get a tax bonus because their combined income lowers their joint tax rate to the point where they pay a lower tax rate married than they did as single, individual filers. So, in a way, there is a marriage tax penalty under the Tax Code that I described, but there is also a marriage bonus. So what we have said on the Democratic side is let's deal with the penalty and make sure nobody pays a price under the Tax Code for the decision to get married. 
   When you make these Tax Code decisions, they cost money, because it means fewer dollars are flowing from taxpayers and from the economy into the Treasury. Whenever you are going to propose a bill such as this to eliminate a Tax Code penalty to reduce a tax obligation, you have to come up with some money to pay for it and offset the loss of revenue to the Federal Government. 
   We are in a position to discuss that possibility because, frankly, we are enjoying the most prosperous economy in the history of the United States of America. We have seen the longest period of economic expansion ever. It has been I think close to 109 months--for over 9 years--that we have seen a continued expansion of the economy without a recession, which means more people are going to work and buying homes or cars; businesses are getting started; inflation is in check; people are making more money. 
   If you happen to have a retirement plan, if you take away the last few weeks, which have been a little rocky, you know that over the last several years you have done pretty well. There has been a growth in value in the stock market. When President Clinton was sworn in as President, the Dow Jones average was around 3,000. Now it is in the 10,000 category. 
   A tripling in the value of this stock market means half the American families who own mutual funds or other investments have generally seen their pensions and savings growing over this period of time. This is a very good thing. But because of that strengthening economy, we have also seen people making more money and paying more in taxes. Considering the fact that folks are doing better, most of them have said: Keep it coming. We are willing to pay our fair share of taxes as long as we are getting more in income and we see our retirement plans growing. 
   This increase in tax receipts because of a prosperous economy has generated a surplus. Where the Senate just a few years ago was embroiled in a controversy about the deficit we faced year in and year out, we are now talking about how to spend the surplus. The marriage tax penalty bill takes a part of this surplus and says, let's cure this problem in the Tax Code. I don't think that is unreasonable. But I thought we ought to step back for a second and say what our long-term goals are. 
   The long-term goal enunciated by President Clinton--which I support and the Democratic side supports--is that we should take this surplus and invest it wisely, do things with it that make sense in the long term. 
   One thing that makes sense is to eliminate the national debt. The deficit each year piles up into an account called the national debt. The national debt is our mortgage as a nation. We have to raise taxes every year to pay interest on our Nation's mortgage--the national debt. In fact, we have to raise $1 billion in taxes every single day from families, businesses, and individuals just to pay interest on old debt. 
   Those of us on the Democratic side think our surplus should first be dedicated to reducing this national debt so that the mortgage left to our children and grandchildren is smaller. We will leave them a great nation. Of course, we are proud of the role we played in helping that to happen. But we shouldn't leave them a great debt for the things we enjoyed during our lifetime. 
   We believe, on the Democratic side, that the fiscally sound thing to do is to reduce the national debt. I am afraid our 
   friends on the Republican side of the aisle would rather spend this money on tax cuts that go way beyond the marriage tax penalty--the problem I discussed earlier. 
   The leader in tax cuts is the Republican candidate for President, Governor Bush. He has proposed a tax cut package larger even than the Republican package that is being brought to the floor. 
   We had a vote just a couple of weeks ago on an amendment I offered. By a vote of 99-0, the Senate rejected the  George Bush tax cut. They said it wasn't wise policy. I think that was a wise vote. We basically said, let's take care to spend this surplus wisely so that if the economy has a downturn, or we are asked in later years to account for our actions, we can explain, yes, we put the money into reducing the national debt, strengthening Social Security, strengthening Medicare for years to come, and making wise investments in our future--and targeted tax cuts. 
   One of the wisest investments and the first stop on most people's agenda would be education--figure out a way to strengthen education so young people across America in the 21st century have a better chance for a good job and a better chance to compete. 
   How else could we make a wise investment? Do something about health care in this country. Expand the coverage of health insurance so that more and more Americans have that protection and peace of mind. Deal with the whole issue of prescription drug benefits for the elderly and disabled. We think, on the Democratic side, that is a wise investment of the surplus as well. 
   Then targeted tax cuts: Make sure you target them where they are needed and don't go overboard. 
   The marriage penalty I discussed: We agree on the Democratic side to eliminate it, but let's not go overboard in eliminating it and reduce the possibility of bringing down the national debt and strengthening Social Security and Medicare. Therein lies the heart of the debate on the floor of the Senate. 
   For several weeks now, the Republican leadership has come to us and said: We want to bring our marriage tax penalty bill up for consideration. This marriage tax penalty bill they have proposed goes way beyond what is necessary to cure the penalty. In fact, when you take a close look at the provisions, you find, unfortunately, a large part of the money that is being spent there is not really going to help the people who are penalized by the decision to get married. 
   Only 15 percent of the benefits under the Republican proposal, for example, go to low- and middle-income married couples with incomes below $50,000 a year; 15 percent to couples making less than $50,000 a year. Yet these couples represent 45 percent of all married couples. They are not getting the tax benefit. 
   Take a look at the winners. Fewer than a third of married couples have incomes exceeding $75,000. Under the Republican bill, one-third of those couples who are getting married and earning over $75,000 a year receive two-thirds of this bill's tax benefit. 
   There is no fairness here. 
   If we are trying to encourage marriage at all levels of income, why would we hype the benefits on the wealthiest people in America and basically ignore those in lower-income categories 
   struggling to buy a home and start a family? That is exactly what the Republican bill does. Many of us don't believe that is fair. 
   In addition, only 40 percent of the tax relief under the Senate Republican plan would go towards the marriage tax penalty. That is less than half of it. Sixty percent of it provides tax breaks for people who are not suffering the marriage tax penalty. Those of us on the Democratic side think that is not a wise investment. Instead, we should target the tax cuts to people who need them. 
   Let me give you two examples of what we think we can do with targeted tax cuts that families across America really need. For example, do you have a child attending college? Do you know how much it costs? Most families do. They start worrying about college education expenses as soon as the baby is born. They start putting away a little in a savings account thinking: how in the heck will their son or daughter ever get to a college unless they think ahead and plan ahead. 
   One of the things the Democrats want to do, sponsored by Senator SCHUMER of New York, is to give a deduction for college education expenses up to $10,000. What does it mean? If you spent $10,000 on your son's or daughter's college education, the targeted tax cut on the Democratic side would give you $2,800--over a fourth of it--in a tax deduction. I wish it could be more, but it is a helping hand. I think most families would say: I like this; this is a sensible thing. It reduces the burden of debt many young people would face coming out of college. It helps families who are trying to help their sons and daughters go through college. 
   Let me tell you something else we would do. We would create a tax credit for people who are paying for long-term care. 
   If you have an elderly parent or a disabled person in your household, you know that the cost of long-term care could be very expensive--to bring in visiting nurses, to provide for some sort of convalescent care, or long-term nursing home care. The President has proposed a targeted tax cut for families to give them a helping hand to pay for that elderly parent, or elderly relative, or someone disabled in your household. 
   That is the Democratic proposal. 
   The Republicans, in contrast, think that 60 percent of the tax cuts should go to people in higher income categories instead of targeting them to family needs that I have just described, like college education expenses and long-term care. That is what the debate boils down to, in substance. The procedural part of the debate is as dry as dust, but it is important because we will decide on a vote in just about an hour and a half as to whether or not we are going to close down the debate on the Republican marriage tax penalty bill or leave it open so we can allow for amendments to be offered. 
   The Republicans oppose the suggestion that we Democrats could offer our targeted tax cuts on the floor of the Senate. They want to give us a take-it-or-leave-it vote: Either take our tax break, our marriage tax penalty break, or vote against it. We think this should be done in truly a deliberative process, where we come to the floor and debate the merits of our different positions. This Senate is supposed to be the greatest deliberative body in the world. For 200 years, it has enjoyed this reputation. 
   Yesterday, one of my colleagues, one of the most respected Members of the Senate, Senator ROBERT BYRD of West Virginia, came to the floor, and in his fashion gave us another history lesson about the Senate and how it came to be. If you have not heard a Senator BYRD speech on the history of the Senate, you have missed a good time. This man has dedicated a lifetime to reminding us that this is a historic institution. It is not just another creature of politics. He reminds us, time and again, our responsibility is to come to this floor and debate the great ideas in America. Yet the Republican majority would close us down, stop us from this debate, stop us from bringing these amendments to the floor. 
   I say to those following the course of my remarks, this Senate is not overworked. Take a look at the floor. With the exception of the fine Senator from Kentucky, who is presiding, I am the only one on the floor. Over the course of this week, few Members have come to the floor. We have not worked late at night or early in the morning debating issues that American families care about. We have kind of been in neutral for a long period of time. 
   When I go home to my home State of Illinois, the people I talk to and the families I meet with ask some very basic and important questions: What have you done lately to improve the quality of life for families across America? The unfortunate answer is: Very little, if anything. This Senate and the House of Representatives cannot seem to get into gear. 
   When I ran for the Senate, it was for the opportunity to represent 12 million people in Illinois but also to come to this floor and engage in a real debate. I want the Republicans to come forward with their best arguments on the issues of the day. I want the Democrats to do the same. Then let's vote--that is what it is all about--and be held accountable by the people who sent us here as to whether or not we have voted the right way. That is the democratic process. 
   But that is not the way it works in the Senate today. What we have here is an effort by the Republican majority to stop the debate, to close it down, to give you one take-it-or-leave-it vote each week and then go home. We come in and punch our time cards, check off the box that says I now qualify for another day on my pension, and a lot of people head home. That is not why I 
   ran for the Senate, and I do not think that is why this body was created by our Founding Fathers.  
   Let us consider some of the things we could address. Senator EVAN BAYH, my new Democratic colleague from Indiana, an extraordinarily talented man who served as Governor of that State, has come forward with a very responsible suggestion on the marriage tax penalty. Senator BAYH has said: Let us help those who are penalized and let us save the resulting money from the Republican bill to reduce our national debt, to preserve and strengthen Social Security and Medicare, to provide the targeted tax cuts. That is one of the amendments we want to offer. Take it or leave it, up or down, limited debate. Our leader, Senator DASCHLE, came to the floor and said this is not a filibuster. We will agree to a limitation, 1 hour on a side on this important issue, and then let's vote on it. 
   But, no: Rejected. The Republican leadership said we do not want to debate Senator BAYH's amendment. We do not want to debate Senator BAYH's substitute. We want to give you one vote, up or down, take it or leave it. I don't think it is fair. I don't think it is fair to the Senator from Indiana, nor is it fair to this body. Certainly we have the time on our hands to spend 2 hours debating that important issue. 
   Senator ROBB of Virginia wants to offer an amendment to this which addresses an issue that is probably one of the most important issues that faces us in this election year. It is a question of whether we will create a prescription drug benefit under Medicare. Senator ROBB of Virginia wants a chance to offer that amendment and to debate it, a limited debate, 1 hour on each side, and take a vote as to whether or not we will change Medicare to provide a prescription drug benefit. 
   I invite all the Senators who are trying to stop this debate to take a moment and go home, pick any constituency in your State, and ask them about a prescription drug benefit. I found in Illinois that there are seniors across my State, disabled people across my State, and their families, who understand the critical need for a prescription drug benefit. 
   In the 1960s, when President Lyndon Johnson and Congress created the Medicare program, they provided health insurance for the elderly and disabled that had never been there before. It has worked beautifully. For 40 years, Medicare has provided quality health care for seniors and the disabled. The net result of it is seniors live longer. There is no better test of the success of Medicare than the fact that seniors can live longer and can be more independent in their lives. 
   My mother always used to say, for so many years, ``I just don't want to be a burden.'' How many parents say that to their kids? Medicare helped my mom not be a burden to our family. She was able to have her own health insurance protection because of Medicare. 
   But there was a problem with Medicare and we know it now. Medicare has no prescription drug benefit. So many seniors in my State tell stories of going to the doctor, feeling bad. The doctor says: I think there is a prescription that can help you. The doctor hands the senior citizen the prescription. The senior citizen puts it in his or her pocket and says little, goes off to the pharmacy and says: How much will it cost? Many of these seniors, on fixed incomes, find they cannot afford to buy the medicines they need to stay healthy. They have to make choices between the food they need to survive and the medicine which the doctors have prescribed and recommended. 
   That should change. We have the power to change it. That is what Congress is all about. The President supports this change to create a prescription drug benefit so seniors across America will have some protection when it comes to buying prescription drugs. 
   About a third of the seniors in our country already have some protection. I think of the UAW retirees in Illinois and other union families that have great retirement plans. They may spend $15 a month, as example, maximum, to get total drug coverage under their retirement plan. Those are the lucky people, one-third of the seniors. 
   Another third go out and try to buy supplemental health insurance that has prescription drug benefits. Some of it is good, some of it is just plain awful. They pay a very high premium for it. These are the people in the middle who have a little bit of coverage. 
   But a third of the seniors have no protection whatsoever. What they pay for in prescription drugs comes right out of their pockets, right from their fixed income. 
   Senator ROBB wants to offer an amendment this week on the floor of the Senate for us to vote on a prescription drug benefit. Should the Senate not go on record on this issue? If you oppose it, vote against it. I support it and I want to vote for it. I want to be able to go back home to say to seniors: We have changed the Medicare program for the better. We want to keep you healthy and keep you strong. We want you to be able to pay for the drugs that your doctor recommends for your good health. 
   That is one of the amendments the Republicans do not want us to vote on. Why? They say they favor prescription drug benefits. Senator ROBB gives them a chance to support one approach. I think it is within their power to offer their alternative to it. But they do not want to bring that into the debate. They want to close down this debate so we do not go after them. I think, frankly, that is a serious shortcoming. 
   When you take a look at the prices of prescription drugs that are used by seniors, you will find these prices are spiraling out of control. In 1999, a recent analysis by Families USA found that prices of prescription drugs most commonly used by seniors increased at almost twice the rate of inflation. The report looked at the 50 prescription drugs most commonly used by the elderly and found that their prices had gone up more than twice the rate of inflation. 
   On average, the prices of these drugs increased by 3.9 percent between January 1999 and January 2000; 2.2 percent was the general inflationary increase. That is the average for the 50 drugs. Some of them went up much more quickly. Their prices are out of control, beyond the means of seniors who could not afford to pay for them. Moreover, these increases are part of a trend, according to Families USA. Over the past 6 years, the prices of prescription drugs most commonly used by seniors also increased by twice the rate of inflation. 
   I have met with pharmacists in Illinois who tell me the prices of drugs used to go up once a year. Now they go up once a month. They understand seniors cannot keep up with it. 
   When we talk about a prescription drug benefit, it is not only to provide protection under Medicare to pay for prescription drugs, it is also to address the issue of pricing. 
   When I talk about the issue of price control in my State of Illinois, a lot of people tense up: Wait a minute, the Government is going to get involved in price control? I am not sure I like that idea. 
   There is a natural skepticism, but I ask them to bear with me for a minute while I explain pricing mechanisms for drugs. 
   Right now in the United States of America, the drug companies that make these prescription drugs bargain with insurance companies. The insurance companies come to them and say: If you want the doctors in our insurance plan to prescribe these drugs, then you have to agree to pricing controls so that your prices do not go up out of hand. That is being done today. That bargaining is taking place. 
   The Veterans Administration has said to the same drug companies: If you want us to use your drugs in veterans' hospitals across America, agree to price controls so we can afford to pay for them, and the drug companies agree. 
   The Indian Health Service and the Public Health Service are the same. 
   We find the only group in America that does not have this bargaining power to say to drug companies, ``We want to have reasonable pricing,'' turns out to be the elderly and disabled people covered by Medicare. People on fixed incomes in tough situations lack the same bargaining power. 
   On the Democratic side, we are saying give to all Americans this bargaining power. 
   Let me tell my colleagues who else has bargaining power. If one happens to live in a border State such as Montana or North Dakota, once a month a lot of senior centers rent a bus. What do they do with that bus? They load it up with seniors and the prescriptions from their doctors and drive over the border  into Canada. Why? Because the exact same prescription drug sold in the United States, made by the same company, is sold in Canada for half the cost as in the United States. Why? Why are the prices lower? Because the Canadian Government is bargaining with the same American drug companies. They tell them: You cannot sell your drugs in the Canadian health care system unless you keep the prices under control. And the drug companies said: So be it, that is what we will do. Mexico is the same. Europe is the same. 
   If one looks at all these groups around the world, they come to realize that only Medicare recipients in America are paying the very highest prices for drugs. Everybody else gets a bargain. 
   Do my colleagues know who else gets a bargain when it comes to drugs? Your dog and your cat. Exactly the same drug sold for human usage is sold at a fraction of the cost to veterinarians--10 percent of the cost. I am a lot more concerned about a grandmother than I am about a great dane. 
   I would like to see us have a pricing policy that gives seniors a break instead of looking to overseas leaders and people in other countries who come up with a way to keep the prices of drugs under control. 
   What I have described in the last few minutes is a contour of a debate that should take place on the floor of the Senate. Those Senators who disagree with me ought to have a chance to stand up and explain their position. Senator ROBB of Virginia, who believes, as I do, that we need a prescription drug benefit, should be allowed to make his position known. We ought to debate it and vote on it. The Republican majority says no. 
   When it comes to changes in the Tax Code, take it or leave it; marriage tax penalty or else. 
   The final point I will make, as I see my colleagues come to the floor to join me in speaking--Senator AKAKA from Hawaii will be speaking this morning--is the fact that the amendment by Senator SCHUMER of New York goes to the issue of expenses of college education. As I said earlier, the President is right. I believe we should give families trying to put kids through college a helping hand. 
   Senator SCHUMER, who occupies the desk to my left, wants to offer that amendment. He wants the Senate to go on record for or against the proposition that we ought to be giving a tax deduction for college education expenses. Quite honestly, that is a good idea for America to prepare the next generation to compete in the global economy so that working families have a chance to send their kids to the best schools, get the best education, and realize the American dream. 
   Is this worth a debate on the floor of the Senate? Is this worth a few minutes of our time? As I look across this empty Chamber, I ask: What is it Senators could be doing that is more important than considering the college education expenses of our family members? It is worth the time, and it is worth the debate. I believe the Republican majority is wrong when they say we cannot and should not debate these amendments because we are too darn busy. I do not buy it. We are not too busy to focus on the problems about which American families really care. 
   I hope this cloture vote at noon is a vote that repudiates the Republican position and opens up this debate so we can deal with prescription drugs, so we can deal with reducing the national debt and strengthening Social Security and Medicare, and so we can provide a deduction for college education expenses. I hope we will have that opportunity this afternoon and for the remainder of the week. I yield the floor.

    Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation along with Senator LAUTENBERG to help communities voluntarily reduce the number of guns in their homes and on their streets. There are over 200 million guns in America today. Alarmingly, that is almost one for every man, woman, and child in this country. Of those 200 million guns, 66 million are hand guns and the number of assault weapons is increasing. Although statistics show a 4.7% decrease in the rate of firearm-related injuries from 1996 to 1997, the rate of a firearm-related injuries is still unacceptably high. 
   More than 600,000 gun crimes are committed in the United States each year. On average, approximately 200 people are wounded by guns and approximately 88 people are killed by guns everyday. Twelve American children, under the age of 19, are killed by guns everyday. The rate of accidental shooting deaths for children under the age of 15 in the United States is nine times higher than the rate of the other 25 industrialized nations combined. Firearm homicides are the second leading cause of death for youth 15-24. Firearm suicide is the third leading cause of death in this age group. Handguns account for nearly 70% of firearm suicides among all age groups. Guns kept in the home for self-protection are three times more likely to kill a friend or a relative than an intruder. 
   The human cost of gun violence is great. Saving families from senseless deaths caused by gun violence is long over due. Reducing the number of guns in our homes and in our streets is essential to curbing gun violence in this country. 
   In economic terms, it is estimated that the lifetime medical costs of the 134,445 gunshot injuries in the United States in 1994 was $2.3 billion. The average medical cost per injury was about $17,000. The medical cost of gunshot injuries due to assaults was about $1.7 billion. Taxpayers paid 49% or $1.1 billion of these medical costs. The estimated indirect costs of gunshot injuries, the value of lost productivity due to fatal and non-fatal injuries, was about $19.7 billion in 1994. 
   There are also non-economic costs which include pain and suffering of the survivors, the fear which inevitably permeates all strata of society, the societal and emotional stress on both adults and children, and the influence gun related violence can have on a community. 
   The multiple costs of gun-related injuries--the human cost, the economic cost, and the non-economic cost--amount to an exceedingly costly epidemic and make finding a solution to 
   gun violence a top priority. Unfortunately, there is no single cure for this disease. However, voluntary gun reduction programs that provide a means to reducing the number of weapons on the streets and in children's homes are an important step to creating safe and healthy environments. 
   That is why I have introduced the Safe Homes-Safe Streets Act of 2000. The purpose of this Act is to voluntarily reduce the number of guns in circulation by aiding State and local law enforcement departments that wish to conduct gun reduction programs to create safer homes and safer streets. 
   Under the Safe Homes-Safe Streets Act, law enforcement officials would be permitted to--

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New Jersey for raising this important issue of gun safety. 
   One of the most important powers of the leadership on Capitol Hill is the power to schedule a hearing, the power to bring a bill to the floor, the power to tell a committee to bring a bill forward so it can be considered. 
   Currently, the Republicans are in control of the Senate as well as the House of Representatives, and they have this awesome congressional power and responsibility. Over the last several days, there have been calls from the leadership, the Speaker of the House as well as the majority leader of the Senate, that this Senate and House basically drop what they are doing and start gathering information and documentation for an emergency hearing on the question of what occurred in Miami, FL, last Saturday morning. That is to the exclusion of a lot of other things that could be considered by the Congress of the United States. 
   The Hill newspaper and others have talked about this Republican fervor over investigating Attorney General Janet Reno and others about the Elian Gonzalez controversy. This is an important issue. It has certainly captured the imagination of many Americans and the attention of the press and a lot of politicians. I think it is worth looking into to consider the procedures that have been used and could be used. But would we step back and say, when we look at the state of America today, that this is the single most important thing that we should be doing right here on Capitol Hill? My guess is, in my home State of Illinois, the State of Ohio, as well as many other States, families might suggest: Before you get into that, could you take a look at education? Could you take a look at reducing violent crime in our country? Could you consider a Patients' Bill of Rights so if someone gets sick in my family, the doctor can make the medical decision instead of the insurance company? And while you are at it, my mother or grandmother is on Medicare and can't pay for her prescription drugs. Could you take a look at that incidentally? Is that something you could put on your priority list? 
   Quite honestly, those things will come out in polls across America as things about which people are concerned. They would like us to drop, perhaps, our focus on a 6-year-old boy from Cuba for just a few minutes and think about education, think about reducing gun violence in America, a Patients' Bill of Rights, a prescription drug benefit. Sadly, those items are not on the agenda. They don't capture the attention of the Republican leadership. Their attention is on this 6-year-old boy. 
   I hope we can focus the attention of Congress on some other issues. I hope we can earn our pay for a change and consider some bills and some laws that just might improve the quality of life of families across America. I kind of thought that was part of our job. We were elected from 50 different States to come here to show some leadership and respond to the people back home to make America a better place to live. 
   Senator TORRICELLI of New Jersey talked about gun safety. We are just a few days away from the first anniversary, the sad anniversary of the tragedy at Columbine High School. That focused America's attention. It shocked us to believe that a 
   high school in the suburbs of Denver could end up having this tragedy visited upon it and 12 children who got up and went to school never came home. 
   We saw that the two students who started this rampage got their guns from gun shows. We decided in Congress we had to do something. So we brought a bill forward, a gun safety bill, that had three basic provisions in it. The bill said, if you buy a gun at a gun show, we want to know whether you are legally disqualified from owning a gun. Of course, if you buy it from a gun dealer, we already make that inquiry. We want to know if you have a criminal record. We want to know if you happen to be a fugitive, a stalker, a wife beater, someone who is ineligible because they are too young, someone who has a history of violent mental illness. If we are going to preserve the second amendment right to own and bear arms, many of us believe we want to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and children.

   Mr. DURBIN. The sportsmen and hunters in the State of Illinois and those I speak to around the country tend to agree. They want to use their guns legally and safely. They want to keep them away from criminals and children. 
   We put in the provision of this law a background check at gun shows. How frequent are gun shows? Come to downstate Illinois; they are pretty frequent. They have them at civic centers, all sorts of different places. We are not the leading State for gun shows. The leading State for gun shows is Texas. I will return to that in a moment. 
   Secondly, we said, let's have trigger locks sold with guns. As Senator TORRICELLI said earlier, 43 percent of guns are sitting around residences within easy access of children. How many times do you pick up the paper and read about a kid playing with a gun, shooting himself or a playmate? How many parents say, we don't have guns in our house because we think it is dangerous. But do you know whether your playmate's family has guns lying around. Who is so naive to believe that children never find Christmas gifts or guns? They go looking and they find them. Sometimes tragedy results. 
   We want trigger locks so the guns are secure, so a child who picks up that gun can't harm himself or others. Is this a radical idea? I think it is as sensible an idea as putting brakes on a car. 
   Finally, Senator FEINSTEIN added an amendment which said we don't want to import high-capacity ammo clips from overseas that can only be used for the semiautomatic and automatic weapons to sweep bullets in every direction. I have said that if you need a semiautomatic weapon or an assault weapon to shoot a deer, you ought to stick to fishing. 
   Far too many people in this country think this is an invasion of second amendment rights. Too many people argue that we shouldn't even have these reasonable regulations in gun ownership. 
   We passed this bill that I am talking about on the floor of the Senate by one vote. Vice President Gore, as is his right under the Constitution, came to this Chair and voted. We passed the bill and sent it to the House. That was over 10 months ago. The bill, of course, was then subject to the National Rifle Association and all of the gun lobby beating up on it. They passed a terrible alternative to it. It has now been sitting in a conference committee month after weary month. We cannot summon the political will or courage to bring a gun safety bill out here to try to make the streets, the schools, and, yes, the zoos of America safe for families and children. No. We want to have an emergency hearing on a 6-year-old boy from Cuba. We want to drop everything. We want to subpoena all of the documents. This summons is more important. I think they are wrong. 
   When it comes to education, we have tried to focus on smaller class sizes so teachers can spend more time with kids who need help. We have tried to focus on afterschool programs so during that period of time when the school let's out before mom and dad get home kids have a chance to stay in a supervised situation at school so they can be tutored; if they are falling behind, enrichment classes if they are kids who are doing well; play a little sports but do something under supervision; summer school for the same reason--so that education starts reflecting the reality of family life. 
   We think we can focus as well on a Patients' Bill of Rights so we can say that doctors will make medical decisions and not insurance company clerks. Every medical group in America, nurses and doctors--all of them--support us. We would like to see the decisions on the future of each family's health made by health care professionals and not by people looking at the bottom line of an insurance company. We believe a prescription drug benefit is a high priority. 
   I had hearings across Illinois, and I have seen it across the Nation. There are people who are literally deciding between food and medicine. Elderly and disabled people can't afford the  medicine their doctors prescribe. So they do not fill the prescriptions. They cut the pills in half. They do things they shouldn't do, and they get sick. When they get sick, what happens? They end up in a hospital. If they end up in a hospital, guess what. Medicare will pay the bills now. We wouldn't pay for the pills to keep them out of the hospital but we will pay for the pills when they get sick and go to a hospital. 
   We think a prescription drug benefit makes sense. We think that is what we should be debating on the floor of the Senate. But we do not. Another week passes by. We consider a lot of other things, and families across America return to ask us: Where are your priorities? What are you thinking about?

   Mr. DURBIN. I first commend the Senator from Vermont for his leadership on the Senate Judiciary Committee and the fact that he has taken this debate over this proposed constitutional amendment so seriously. Senator LEAHY has been a leader not just in terms of the Democratic side but in terms of the Senate, to make certain that although a handful of Members have come to the floor to consider a matter of this gravity, he has been here day in and day out. 
   My question to him goes to a point he has made so eloquently today in his statement and before. It is about the nature of this amendment. Is it true that this proposed constitutional amendment before us is longer in length, has more words in it, than the entire first 10 amendments to the Constitution known as the Bill of Rights?

Word has it that draft No. 64 is on the way, which we might get a chance to see before we vote on it. My question to the Senator is, in terms of victims' rights, does this not suggest that it would be better for us to have a statute rather than to amend the Constitution of the United States, if it takes so many pages of wording to address the concerns of the sponsors of this amendment?

Despite the length of this amendment, the fact that it has been through 63 or 64 different versions, it is characterized as a constitutional amendment to protect the rights of crime victims.

   Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator from Vermont also give me his thinking about section 1 of this proposed constitutional amendment which outlines and specifies the constitutional right to ``consideration of the interest of the victim that any trial be free from unreasonable delay''? 
   People such as George Will, a conservative commentator, have asked what in the world this could mean, to give to a victim ``consideration.'' My question is, if you are going to add wording to amend the Constitution, if I am not mistaken, since the passage of the Bill of Rights, which would be the 18th or 19th amendment we have enacted in Congress, whether such vague wording as ``consideration'' of victims is adequate to stand the test of time and trial before the Federal court system.

   Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Vermont. Most people, when they think of a crime victim, can obviously identify the victim of an assault or battery or robbery, of course. In a murder situation, does the victim of the crime include the family of the murder victim? You might think it would. But if it is going to include family and relatives of the actual victims of crimes, how large of a net is being cast here to require the Government to give notice of trial to accommodate the scheduling of trials and hearings for this group, that may be rather large if you consider everyone affected by a crime?

If we are going to amend the Constitution of the United States to take on this awesome responsibility, a document which all of us have sworn to uphold and defend, should we not be in a situation where there is no other recourse, where we have a situation where State statutes are being stricken, where there is some controversy at hand as to whether or not crime victims across the United States are being accommodated? The test of necessity seems to me to be the threshold test which we should meet before we come together on the floor of the Senate to consider an amendment to the Constitution of the United States.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we just heard a statement from the Senator from Pennsylvania which echoes the statements of many Republicans since the reuniting of Elian Gonzalez with his father. This was a very sad situation. The Attorney General's comments indicate she made extraordinary efforts on a personal basis and through the Department of Justice to resolve the differences between the members of this family involving this 6-year-old boy. 
   I am sorry it came to the process that it did in the early hours of the morning on Saturday. I understand up until the very last moment, negotiations were underway with the family, with the very basic goal of reuniting this little boy with his father. 
   I will never know what took place in those conversations, but I can certainly understand that when the decision was made to enforce the law, to enforce the subpoena, and to move forward, those agents who went into that home were entitled to protect themselves. They did not know, going into that home, whether there was any danger inside. The fact that they were armed, of course, is troublesome in the presence of a 6-year-old boy, but I do not believe a single one of us would ask any law enforcement agent in America--Federal, State, or local--to endanger their own lives by walking into a building without adequate protection and show of force. 
   I hope we will put this in perspective. I have been absolutely fascinated by the Republican response to this. To consider some of the statements that have been made by Republican leaders on Capitol Hill since this event in Miami tells us a great deal about their priorities. There is a passion, there is a commitment, there is a sense of urgency to drop everything we are doing on Capitol Hill and move into a thorough investigation of this episode which occurred in the early morning hours of Saturday to decide whether or not Attorney General Reno was doing the appropriate thing in the way she approached it. 
   My question to the Republican majority in the Senate and the House is: Where is your passion, where is your sense of urgency, where is your commitment when it comes to the gun violence which is occurring on the streets of America every single day? 
   Yesterday, here in our Nation's Capital, families who gathered at the National Zoo for an annual holiday witnessed gun violence which claimed some seven victims, one of whom is now on life support and may not survive. Yet for a year--one solid year--the Republican leadership on Capitol Hill has refused to bring forward any gun safety legislation. Overnight they can call for an investigation of Attorney General Reno. Overnight they can bring her to Capitol Hill because of this question of what occurred in Miami. But for one solid year, they have been unwilling and unable to step up and do anything about gun safety to protect children and families across America.

   Mr. DURBIN. No one was injured in the house of Elian Gonzalez's relatives in Miami. Thank God. But kids are injured every day across America. Twelve children are killed every day across America because of gun violence, and this Republican majority, which has this passion to investigate, ought to have the passion to legislate, to pass laws to make America safer. I would like to see some proportionality in the way they respond to the real issues facing American families.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I commend my colleague from New York on the statement he has made on the floor of the Senate. It is interesting that when Members of the Senate are brought into this Chamber and asked to become official Members of this body, we are asked to take an oath. It is an oath which in one part--and perhaps the most important part--is to preserve and defend the Constitution of the United States. When you consider all of the great documents that have been produced in the history of this great country, it is clear that when it comes to our service in the Senate, the one document that we are asked to hold above all others, to preserve and defend, is the Constitution of the United States. 
   Of course, it is understandable because those who created the Senate and its counterpart, the House of Representatives, did it in this document, this Constitution, a copy of which I carry. They believed that future Senates and future Members of the House of Representatives, if they preserved this document, would preserve this union. 
   The job of preserving this Constitution of the United States is not often easy nor popular. Some say 11,000 different times in the last 100 years Members of the Senate have come to the floor in an attempt to change this document. It is interesting that in the course of the history of this Nation, after the adoption of the first ten amendments to the Constitution, the so-called Bill of Rights, we have only amended this Constitution 17 times--the Bill of Rights and 17 additional amendments. Today, we are being asked to amend the Constitution for the 18th time since the adoption of the Bill of Rights. 
   It is curious that in the history of our politics, the Republican Party, which so often claims to be the conservative party--and to take that literally, I assume that means to conserve the values and principles of this country--has so often been in the leadership not to conserve but to overturn and change the most basic document, the Constitution of the United States. 
   I am told in the last 4 weeks there have been four proposals--one in the House and three in the Senate; this is the third in the Senate--to change the Constitution of the United States. This document has endured for over 200 years. It appears many of our colleagues want to change it as quickly as possible in a variety of ways. Some want to change it when it comes to balancing the budget. Others want to change it when it comes to flag burning. Now today there is a suggestion that we want to change it when it comes to the rights of the victims of crime. 
   With all due respect to the wisdom and intelligence of all of my colleagues in the Senate, frankly, I think they are anxious to take a roller to a Rembrandt. They want to make their mark on the Constitution believing that what they suggest matches up to the stature of the words of Thomas Jefferson, Madison, and the Founding Fathers of this country. 
   With all due respect to my colleagues, Senate Joint Resolution No. 3 before the Senate now pales in comparison. This resolution has been around a while. It is shop worn. One of the sponsors of the resolution, Senator KYL, came to the floor today and said with some pride that this was the 63rd draft of this constitutional amendment, and as we stand today and debate, the 64th draft is being written in a back room. At some point it will pop out of that room and on to the Senate floor and we will be told: Here it is; this is the next amendment to the Constitution of the United States. 
   Forgive me if I am skeptical, but I believe on reflection we would regret passing this proposed constitutional amendment. If the authors of this amendment who have been working on it for years--and I give them credit for all of their effort, but they still haven't gotten it right. As the matter comes to the floor of the Senate, do we honestly believe the words in this document will endure as our Constitution has endured for over 200 years? No, I think we are in haste producing a product which we will come to regret. 
   Now to the merits of the issue. It is one which, frankly, cannot help but touch your heart. Far too many people are victims of violent crime. These victims are frightened, they are fed up, and they are determined. They are rightfully frightened because they and others have far too great a chance of falling victim to a violent crime. These victims have endured needless and unjustified physical and emotional suffering. Just last night at 6 p.m., in the Nation's Capital, at the National Zoo, one of the real attractions in this city for visitors from across this region, around the Nation, and even around the world, seven children were shot while visiting the zoo. One of the seven, an 11-year-old boy, was shot in the back of the head and is in grave condition. 
   The statistics on violent crime and gun violence are staggering in the United States of America. Twelve children die 
   every day in America as a result of gun violence. 
   Many crime victims are justifiably fed up. They feel as if the criminal justice system has wronged them. These people were innocent victims, but they feel deprived of the fundamental need to participate in the process of bringing the accused to justice. Victims of crime are understandably determined to ensure that other victims of violent crime have the right to an active and meaningful involvement in the criminal justice system. I believe every effort to ensure that crime victims are not victimized a second time by the criminal justice system should be taken. Today, we are here to begin the hard task of determining how best we can achieve this shared goal. 
   I don't think many will ever be able to appreciate fully the impact of crime on a person. In my family's history, we have had a home burglarized and felt violated, as most people would when they come home to find someone has been through your belongings and taken something away. This is an eerie feeling as one walks through the house. 
   I have had one of my children assaulted. Thank goodness she wasn't hurt seriously. As a parent, I felt rage at the thought that somebody would do this to my daughter. Thank God she survived it. They never caught the person responsible for it. I felt in a way that she was not the only victim. All of us who loved her were also victims of this violence. 
   A violent crime irreparably alters the texture of life for the victim, that victim's family, and many of their friends. The awareness and memory of that crime pervades and alters the victim's very being. I don't think a victim ever totally gets over it. 
   We know a criminal justice system at its best cannot undo a crime. We surely also realize the way to fully address the effect of crime is not just through the criminal justice system. If we are serious about dealing with the impact of crime upon an individual victim, a family, or a community, we must act systematically and consciously--not just with symbolism and political effort. I believe one of the worst things we can do is to pass a constitutional amendment that contains illusory or unenforceable promises regarding crime victims. In order to genuinely address this issue, we must understand the way crime rewrites a victim's life. Then we must do what we can to ensure that the rewrite is not inevitably tragic. 
   I support crime victims' rights. I confess to concerns about amending this Constitution. I view the Constitution, and in particular the Bill of Rights, as one of the most enlightened, intelligent, and necessary documents ever created. I believe any efforts to amend it must be reserved for the most serious circumstances. 
   I cannot help but remember as I stand on this floor, as I often do, debating constitutional amendments which seem to be the order of the day, how many leaders of newly emerged democracies come to the United States of  America as one of their first stops. These men and women who have seen their countries liberated from totalitarian rule, Communist rule, come to the United States and make their stop right here on this Hill, in this city, in this building. 
   They believe, as I do, that the validation of democracy lies right here within the corners of the walls of this great building, because this generation of leadership in the Senate and in the House tries to carry on a tradition, a tradition of freedom and democracy, a tradition that is not embodied in a flag but is embodied in a book--the Constitution of the United States. 
   When you look at the political atmosphere surrounding this debate on this constitutional amendment, you will see that it is different from any other debate we have had on an amendment to this Constitution. A constitutional amendment is really only necessary when there is a concern that the rights of the minority may not be respected by the majority. When there was first a suggestion of a Bill of Rights, it was opposed by James Madison. He said: It is not necessary. The original Constitution, as written, defines what the Federal Government can do, and therefore all of our rights as individuals, as State governments, and as local governments, are certainly ours and preserved. We do not need to add any language preserving them, it is assumed that they will be preserved. 
   But as the Constitution was submitted to the various States for ratification, more and more delegates came back and said: We disagree. We want explicit protection. We want the Bill of Rights to explicitly protect the rights of American citizens, and we want to spell it out. 
   One of the primary arguments used for the validity of the Bill of Rights is that the first amendment, so often quoted for freedom of speech and press and assembly and religion, is often heralded as the first amendment because it was so important. A little reading of history shows us it was not the first amendment in the Bill of Rights. The first two amendments submitted to the States in the Bill of Rights were rejected. The third amendment, which is now our first amendment, moved up. The first two that were rejected related to the question of reapportionment of the Congress and the ability to be compensated or receive additional compensation during the course of a congressional term. 
   That little footnote in history notwithstanding, we value these 10 amendments in the Bill of Rights as special. 
   Then, beyond that Bill of Rights, concerns about the rights of the minority rose again in the 13th and 14th amendments, when we repealed slavery, or in regard to the 19th amendment and the provision of suffrage to women. 
   This amendment, however, does not fit in that description. All but a very small number of American politicians and organizations emphatically support victims rights. Every State in the Union has at least statutory protection of victims of crime when it comes to the procedure of criminal prosecution. Some 33 States have amended their State constitutions to provide similar protection, including my own home State of Illinois in 1992. I fully support that. I think the State was right to pass a crime victims protection in our State constitution. 
   Second, any amendment to the Constitution should be more than just a symbolic gesture. I want to grant crime victims real and concrete rights. The proposed amendment, however, has certain provisions which are illusory and unenforceable. Indeed, the amendment lacks definable language and does not address its implementation. What is the most important single word in a crime victims protection amendment? Let me suggest it is ``victim,'' the word ``victim.'' That is the group they seek to protect and honor and empower. Yet search, if you will, S.J. Res. 3, you will not find a definition of the word ``victim.'' 
   For those who are listening to the debate, who say, ``How can that be a problem? We know who the victim of the crime is''--are you sure? My daughter was assaulted. She was certainly the victim of a crime. As her father, was I victimized? 
   Some say: That is a stretch, we just mean the person who was actually assaulted. 
   Let's try this from a different angle. Let's assume someone is a victim of a crime and is murdered. Are they the only victim of the crime? Is the spouse of the murdered victim also a victim? I could certainly argue that. I could argue a lot of other members of the family could be victims. 
   Let's consider this possibility. If you are going to empower victims to change the prosecution and the procedure in a criminal case, think about a battered wife. A battered wife, who has been the victim of domestic violence for a long period of time and who finally strikes back and assaults the spouse who has battered her, she is then brought in on criminal charges of assault and battery, and the abusing spouse becomes a victim, too. According to this amendment, the abusing spouse now has crime victim's rights, even though he was the one who battered his wife, giving rise to her response and retribution. It gets a little complicated, doesn't it? 
   We know who a crime victim was--someone who was hurt. When you start playing this thing out, you understand why the authors of this proposed constitutional amendment, despite 63 different drafts of this amendment, have never defined the word ``victim.'' Because if you empower that victim to slow down court proceedings or speed them up, to be notified, to be part of the process, you had better take care to understand who is going to receive these rights and how these rights will be exercised, because if you are not careful, you can have a lot of unfortunate consequences. 
   The amendment lacks this definable language. It does not direct the law enforcement court personnel, who are supposed to enforce the newly created victims' rights, on how to do so. 
   Finally, the important goal of establishing victims' rights can be achieved through legislation. A constitutional amendment is simply not necessary. Due to the respect I have for the Constitution, I am extremely reluctant to amend it unless there is no other means by which the victims of crime can be protected. Every state in the United States have a state statute to protect the rights of victims. Thirty-three States have constitutional amendments to protect the rights of victims. Frankly, there appears to be across the United States, in every State of the Nation, a protection of crime victims. 
   The obvious question of those who bring this amendment to the floor, then, is, why is this necessary? Why do we need to amend the Constitution of the United States if existing State law and State constitutional provisions already protect the victims of crime? There may be flaws in these State amendments, State constitutional amendments, State laws, but these flaws can be corrected on a State basis, as needed. 
   In addition, a statutory alternative to this constitutional amendment can reach all of the goals it seeks to achieve. Indeed, there is legislation that has been proposed by the Senator from Vermont, Mr. LEAHY, which I enthusiastically support, which would put in statute these crime victim protections. I think this is the best way, the most effective way, to deal with this. 
   Let me give a few illustrations of how complicated this situation can become. Some of them are real-life stories that give evidence of problems prosecutors have run into in States where individuals have the right to come forward and to assert their rights as victims of crime. Let me give you two of them. 
   In Florida, a Miami defense lawyer tells of representing a murder defendant who accepted a plea from the prosecution. Of course, the acceptance of a plea is a decision that you will plead guilty under certain circumstances and waive the right to a trial. The judge refused to accept the offer after the victim's mother spoke out against it. The victim's mother insisted that the criminal defendant go to trial, despite the agreement by the Government and the defense that he would accept a plea. The client went to trial, was acquitted, and released. 
   In the second case, in California, relatives of a homicide victim complained to a judge that a plea bargain between the prosecution and the defense was too lenient. They got what they wanted, withdrawal of the plea and prosecution of the man on murder charges. At  the close of the trial, the defendant was acquitted and went free. 
   In each of these instances, in each State, the victim or victim's family asserted their rights to overturn a decision by the prosecutor based on that prosecutor's evaluation of the evidence and the likely outcome of a trial, and the net result of it was that the wrongdoer ended up walking out of the courthouse door without a penalty. 
   The suggestion that the victim's involvement or intervention is always going to lead to a stiffer penalty is, frankly, shown in these two cases not to apply. 
   I also make note of the fact that, during the course of this debate, those who support the constitutional amendment, the Senator from Arizona, Mr. KYL, and the Senator from California, Mrs. FEINSTEIN, have said on occasion that this would in no way jeopardize the rights of the accused; in other words, that empowering and giving new rights to crime victims will not be at the expense of the accused defendant. Our Constitution is very clear when it comes to criminal defendants, that there are certain rights which shall be protected. We, of course, know the right to trial by jury, the right to confront your accuser, and all of the rights which have been cataloged over the years. 
   When this constitutional amendment came before the Senate Judiciary Committee 2 years ago, I was a member of that committee. I offered an amendment to this legislation in committee which said nothing in this proposed constitutional amendment shall diminish or deny the rights of the accused as guaranteed under the Constitution. It was said over and over that is the case of this language and this proposal. Yet my attempt to put it into the amendment was refused. I understand Senator FEINGOLD of Wisconsin offered the same amendment in committee this time when it was being considered, and it, again, was refused. 
   As I stand here today, I suggest to my colleagues that we are considering a constitutional amendment which, though it is important, is not necessary. Before we amend the Bill of Rights in the United States of America, it should be something that we all believe, or at least the vast majority believes, is necessary. The existing State constitutional protections of crime victims, the existing State statutes all provide protection to the victims of crime. The suggestion that we can pass a Federal statute which can be modified if we find it is not perfect gives us an option to do something responsible without invading the sanctity and province of the Constitution of the United States. 
   In addition, I suggest that protecting the rights of victims, as important as it is, must be taken into consideration with base constitutional rights and protections for the accused as well in this free society, recalling the premise of criminal justice in America: innocence until guilt is proven. That is something which is painful to stand by at times, but it is as American as the Constitution which guarantees it. 
   I suggest to my colleagues in the Senate and to my friend, the Senator from New York, who I see is on the floor, that we should think twice before proceeding with this amendment to the Constitution. I will join my colleagues during the course of this debate in further discussion of the merits of this proposal. I yield the floor.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to draw attention to the critical issue of organ and tissue donation, particularly with the upcoming National Organ and Tissue Donor Awareness Week (April 16th-22nd) upon us. Although many of us will be back in our home states next week, we must remember to spread the word about the need for donation whenever we have the chance. 
   National Organ and Tissue Donor Awareness Week was first designated by Congress in 1983 and proclaimed by the President annually since then to raise awareness of the significant need for organ and tissue donation and to encourage all Americans to share their decision to donate with their families so their wishes can be honored. Last year, for example, the Transplant Recipients International Organization's Chicago chapter reached thousands of people through its donation displays at City Hall and other public buildings. In addition, many groups sponsored donor recognition ceremonies, remembrance services, and other events to honor the generous and caring individuals and families who have given the gift of life. 
   Today, nearly 70,000 men, women, and children are waiting for an organ transplant and the list is growing longer. Each day about 57 people are given the gift of life through the generosity of organ and tissue donations, but another 16 people on the waiting list die because the need for donations greatly exceeds the supply available. Additionally, the need for a more diverse donor pool, including a variety of racial and ethnic minorities, will also continue to grow in the coming years. All anyone needs to do is this: say yes to organ and tissue donation on a donor card or driver's license and discuss your decision with your family members so they know your wishes. Transplantation does save lives, but only if all of us help as we strive toward a fair, equitable and accountable system of organ and tissue donation and transplantation. 
   Last session, the Give Thanks, Give Life resolution that I sponsored with my distinguished colleagues, Senator FRIST, Senator DEWINE, Senator KENNEDY and Senator LEVIN and others was passed in the Senate. This legislation, which has the support of numerous national organ and tissue donation organizations, designates Thanksgiving of 2000 as a day for families to discuss organ and tissue donation with each other since the final decision to share the gift of life is almost always made by a loved one's family. This week, I also introduced the Comprehensive Immunosuppressive Drug Coverage for Transplant Patients Act of 2000, which sets up a new policy stating that all Medicare beneficiaries who have received a transplant and need immunosuppressive drugs to prevent rejection of their transplant will be covered for as long as anti-rejection drugs are needed. 
   There are many stories that touch the heart on this compelling issue, but I'll share just one. Kelly Therese Nachreiner was a bright, artistic teenager in the class of 2002. At 16, she went with her mother, Mary, to get her temporary driver's license. At that time, Mary pointed out the donation question on the form for her license to Kelly, having no idea how her daughter would respond to this serious issue. Kelly quickly responded, ``Well, of course, Mom, I mean if somebody can live after me.......if I'm dead why does it matter? Why do I want to keep those organs? If I can save somebody else's life, why wouldn't I?'' Just one month later, her unselfish decision would save the lives of three people after she died as the result of an automobile accident. Kelly not only saved those three lives, she also brought a spotlight to the issue of organ and tissue donation awareness, which can potentially save thousands more. 
   Mr. President, all of us would want to save somebody else's life if we could. Let us continue to work together throughout National Organ and Tissue Donor Awareness Week and beyond, to promote organ and tissue donation wherever we can.

    Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation with Senators FEINSTEIN, DODD, WELLSTONE, and BINGAMAN to include full-time public defense attorneys in the Federal Perkins Loan forgiveness program for law enforcement officers. This amendment will provide parity to public defense attorneys and uphold the goals set forth by the Supreme Court to equalize access to legal resources. Representative TOM CAMPBELL of California will be introducing a similar bill in the House. 
   Under section 465(a)(2)(F) of the Higher Education Act of 1965, a borrower with a loan made under the Federal Perkins Loan Program is eligible to have the loan canceled for serving full-time as a law enforcement officer or corrections officer in a local, State, or Federal law enforcement or corrections agency. While the rules governing borrower eligibility for law enforcement cancellation have been interpreted by the Department of Education to include prosecuting attorneys, public defenders have been excluded from the loan forgiveness program. This policy must be amended. 
   Like prosecutors, public defense attorneys play an integral role in our adversarial process. This judicial process is the most effective means of getting at truth and rendering justice. The United States Supreme Court in a series of cases has recognized the importance of the right to counsel in implementing the Sixth Amendment's guarantee of a fair trial and the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause requiring counsel to be appointed for all persons accused of offenses in which there is a possibility of a jail term being imposed. 
   Absent adequate counsel for all parties, there is a danger that the outcome may be determined not by who has the most convincing case but by who has the most resources. The Court rightly addressed this possible miscarriage of justice by requiring counsel to be appointed for the accused. Public defenders fill this Court mandated role by representing the interests of criminally accused indigent persons. They give indigent defendants sufficient resources to present an adequate defense, so that the public goal of truth and justice will govern the outcome. 
   The Department of Education's interpretation of the statue to exclude public defenders from the loan forgiveness program undermines the goals set forth by the Supreme Court to equalize access to legal resources. It creates an obvious disparity of resources between public defenders and prosecutors by encouraging talented individuals to pursue public service as prosecutors but not as defenders. The criminal justice system works best when both sides are adequately represented. The public interest is served when indigent defendants have access to talented defenders. One of the ways to facilitate this goal is by granting loan cancellation benefits to defense attorneys. 
   Moreover, public defense attorneys meet all the eligibility requirements of the loan forgiveness program as set forth in current federal regulations. They belong to publicly funded public defender agencies and they are sworn officers of the court whose principal responsibilities are unique to the criminal justice system and are essential in the performance of the agencies' primary mission. In addition, like prosecuting attorneys, public defenders are law enforcement officers dedicated to upholding, protecting, and enforcing our laws. Without public defense attorneys, the adversarial process of our criminal justice system could not operate. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me, Senator FEINSTEIN, Senator DODD, Senator WELLSTONE, Senator BINGAMAN, and Representative CAMPBELL in supporting the goal of equalized access to legal resources, as set forth in the Constitution and elucidated by the Supreme Court, by providing parity to public defenders and allowing them to join prosecutors in receiving loan cancellation benefits.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, as National Immunization Week approaches, I rise today to introduce legislation addressing childhood immunizations. National Immunization Week (April 17-21) recognizes one of the most powerful health care and public health achievements in this century. Remarkable advances in the science of vaccine development and widespread immunization efforts have led to a substantial reduction in the incidence of infectious disease. Today, vaccination coverage is at record high levels. Smallpox has been eradicated; polio has been eliminated from the Western Hemisphere; and measles and Hib invasive disease, the leading cause of childhood meningitis and postnatal retardation, have been reduced to record lows. 
   The two bills I introduce today build on these successes. One proposal, ``The State Immunization Funding and Infrastructure Act of 2000,'' ensures that state and local health departments are adequately funded to continue successful efforts to immunize children and improve their ability to reach pockets of underimmunized populations. The other, ``The Comprehensive Insurance Coverage of Childhood Immunization Act of 2000,'' requires all health plans to cover recommended childhood and adolescent immunizations. 
   In spite of our successes, we must remain vigilant. Every day, nearly 11,000 infants are born and each baby will need up to 19 doses of vaccine by age two. New vaccines continue to enter the market. Although a significant proportion of the general population may be fully immunized at a given time, coverage rates in the United States are uneven and life-threatening disease outbreaks do occur. In fact, in many of the Nation's urban and rural areas, rates are unacceptably low and are actually declining. 
   Unfortunately, one of the areas most in need of attention is in my own home State of Illinois. Childhood immunization coverage rates in Chicago have dropped each year since 1996 when they peaked at 76 percent. The most recent National Immunization Survey indicates that Chicago's coverage rate is now 66.7 percent--one of the lowest rates in the United States. Coverage rates for African American children in Chicago are the worst in the Nation. 
   It is notable, however, that during this same period when Chicago has struggled to improve vaccination rates, Federal financial assistance to state and local health departments for immunization outreach activities has been significantly reduced. In 1999, Chicago received a 38 percent reduction in Federal funds for the operation of their immunization program. In 2000, Chicago suffered another 37.5 percent reduction. The State of Illinois suffered a 58 percent reduction in 1999 and a further 16 percent reduction in the year 2000. And the story in my State is not that different from other areas of the country. Federal support for vaccine delivery activities has declined by more than 30 percent since 1995. 
   Purchasing vaccines is not enough. The Section 317 immunization program administered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides grants to state and local public health departments for ``operations and infrastructure'' activities. These grants are a critical source of support, indeed the sole source of Federal support, for essential efforts to get children immunized. They fund immunization registries, provider education programs, outreach initiatives to parents, outbreak control, and linkages with other public health and welfare services. These grants get the vaccine from the warehouse to our children. 
   The State Immunization Funding And Infrastructure Act of 2000 authorizes an increase in Federal support for Section 317 grants to states by $75 million for a total of $214 in FY2001. This restores funding to the levels States and localities received in the mid-1990's and will help to stabilize many of the key functions that have been cut back in the face of steep funding reductions. In the past few years, many states have already had to reduce clinic hours, cancel contracts with providers, suspend registry development and implementation, limit outreach efforts and discontinue performance monitoring. The bill also provides a $20 million increase over last year's funding level ($10 million over the President's budget) for vaccine purchase. This will ensure that States are able to purchase adequate amounts of all currently licensed and recommended vaccines. 
   The other proposal I am introducing today, The Comprehensive Insurance Coverage of Childhood Immunization Act of 2000, will require that all health plans cover all immunizations in accordance with the most recent version of the Recommended Childhood Immunization Schedule issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. These vaccinations must be provided without deductibles, coinsurance or other cost-sharing for all children and adolescents under the age of 19. 
   I was shocked to learn that, according to a recent survey of employer-sponsored health plans conducted by William M. Mercer, Inc. and Partnership for Prevention, one out of five employer-sponsored plans do not cover childhood immunizations and one out of four fail to cover adolescent immunizations. Not only is this a significant gap in our health system, but it is simply financially illogical. Childhood and adolescent immunizations have been proven to save money. They decrease the direct medical costs due to vaccine-preventable illnesses and reduce the time parents spend off the job, tending sick children. 
   I invite my colleagues to join me in these efforts to maintain and improve our nation's national immunization record and to ensure that all areas of the country and all populations benefit from the advances we have made over the last century. Despite remarkable progress, many challenges still face the U.S. vaccine delivery system. Approximately one million children are still not adequately immunized. Our infrastructure must be capable of successfully implementing an increasingly complex vaccination schedule. Pockets  of underserved children still leave us vulnerable to deadly disease outbreaks.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, what an interesting world we live in that a Republican Senator and a Democratic  Senator can look at a similar issue and see it in so many different ways. I sit here incredulous at times when I hear Republicans on the floor describe their view of the world. They live in a world where a young man and young woman fall in love and contemplate marriage and start to make plans for their future but stop cold in their tracks and say: Before we go a step further, we better go see an accountant. 
   I can barely remember my courtship with my wife. It was a long time ago. But it never crossed my mind to go see a bookkeeper or accountant before I decided to propose marriage. We thought there was something more to it. We knew there would be good times and bad, and we were prepared to make whatever sacrifice it took to live a life together. When I listen to my Republican colleagues, it sounds as if they want to change the marriage vows from ``love, honor and obey, in sickness and in health'' to ``love, honor and obey, in sickness and in health, so long as there is no income tax disadvantage.'' 
   I do not think that is the real world of real people. Nor do I think we can amend the Tax Code in a way that is going to create a great incentive for people to run out and get married. I think there are more basic human emotions at stake. I think it trivializes a very sacred decision by two people making an important decision in their lives to suggest this is all about money and it is all about how many tax dollars you have to pay. 
   I will readily concede there is unfairness in the Tax Code. Yes, I will concede it is fundamentally unfair for us to increase the taxes on two people because they are being married. But if you would listen to the Republican logic, they grab this hook and take off and run out of town with it. 
   Their proposal on the marriage tax penalty is so far afield from the argument you have heard on the floor, you just cannot recognize it. In fact, let's describe the situation. If two people are about to be married and their combined income, when they file a joint return, puts them in a higher tax bracket, that is called a marriage tax penalty. However, if two people are married and their combined income puts them in a lower tax bracket, some would call that a marriage bonus. How does that happen? Perhaps one person in the marriage is not working and the other one is; the combined income on a joint return merits a lower tax rate. If both of them are working, their combined income raises them to a higher tax rate, a penalty. 
   We, on the Democratic side, believe we should eliminate the penalty, eliminate the unfairness, eliminate the discrimination against married people under the Tax Code. You would think from their arguments on the floor that is where the Republicans are. But that is not what their bill says, not at all. In fact, when you look closely at their bill, you find two amazing things: First, on the whole question of the marriage tax penalty, there are about 65 provisions in the Tax Code that could be associated with a marriage tax penalty. The Republicans, who have given speeches all morning about the marriage tax penalty, address how many of the 65 provisions? In the most generous definition: three, leaving some 62 discriminations in the Tax Code against married people untouched in the Republican bill. 
   The Democratic alternative addresses all 65. 
   So after all these pronouncements about ending Tax Code 
   discrimination, the Republican bill falls flat on its face when it comes to addressing the 65 different provisions in the Tax Code that apply. The Democratic bill applies it to all 65. 
   The second thing that strikes you right off the bat is that the Republican bill goes further than eliminating the marriage tax penalty. It, in fact, creates an additional tax bonus for those not suffering the penalty. We are not talking about couples who are calculating how many days they have to wait to avoid paying taxes before they decide to get married. We are talking about couples who really benefit from marriage, and their taxes go down--the Republicans add more tax cuts for them. 
   Everybody loves a tax cut. If we could give a tax cut to every American, that would be the dream of every politician. But the voting public in America, the people watching this debate, have the right to step back and say: How many of these tax cuts can we afford, as a nation, to give away? I think that is a legitimate point. The Finance Committee in the Senate writes the tax laws, the committee that sent us this bill that is pending. If you look at the minority views, from the Democratic side, you find many Democratic Members believe the best thing we can do with our surplus is to pay down the Federal debt. That is my position. That is the position of the President and most Democrats. Why is that important? Because today in America we will collect $1 billion in taxes from individuals, families, and businesses, and that money will be used not to educate a child, to pay a soldier, or to build a highway; it will be used to pay interest on old debt of the United States. 
   If we do not change that, it means my grandchild, who is now about 4 years old, will continue to pay taxes, to pay interest on debt incurred by my generation to build our roads and educate our kids. 
   Some of us think the fairest thing we can do for future generations is to reduce the public debt with our surplus so that perhaps that $1 billion tax bill each day will be reduced for future generations. Relieving this burden is a good gift to give our children and grandchildren. 
   If one listens to the other side of the aisle, they do not want to take the surplus and pay down the debt. They want to dream up more and more tax cuts. The George W. Bush tax cut is so big, so massive, and so risky that last week not a single Republican would vote for it on the Senate floor when I called for a vote. 
   He wants to spend--I hope I get these figures right--$1.3 trillion. I believe it was $400 billion or $500 billion more than the surplus. He obviously wants to reach deep into the Social Security trust funds to pay for his tax cuts or to cut spending on basic services for education, protection of the environment, and defense. Not a single Republican would stand up for that, and I am glad they did not. Most Americans know better. 
   The Senate Republicans now have a George W. Bush tax cut; they want to come in and keep hacking away at the surplus instead of putting it to reducing the national debt, which on the Democratic side we consider to be the highest priority. 
   The expected 10-year budget surplus, according to the Finance Committee, is $893 billion. It is amazing that in a short period of time, we can talk about those surpluses. 
   If this bill passes, the Republicans will have already spent over half that in this session on tax cuts. Instead of lowering the national debt, reducing the tax burden on future generations, preserving Social Security and Medicare, they would have us continue on with tax cuts. 
   Take a close look at the Republican marriage tax penalty bill. First, the tax cuts they offer are piecemeal rather than comprehensive. They are not fiscally responsible because we are not putting money away for reducing the national debt. More than half the taxpayer benefits in their bill go to people already receiving a tax bonus. These are not people discriminated against; these are people doing well under the Tax Code, and they want to give them an additional tax cut. 
   They do not eliminate the marriage penalty, some 65 provisions; at best, they only address 3. Here is the kicker about which they do not want to talk. They have drawn their bill up in a way so that 5 million Americans will actually pay higher taxes. Their intent was to reduce the tax burden for married people. They went further than they had to. On the bottom, the last page, take a look around the corner. Five million Americans end up paying higher taxes under the alternative minimum tax. 
   Isn't that something? Take a look at this on a pie chart to get an idea, from the Republican plan, how much is being spent on the actual marriage tax penalty relief: 40 percent. Of the amount of money they have put on the table--$248 billion roughly over 10 years in tax cuts--40 percent of it goes to marriage penalty relief; 60 percent goes to people already receiving a bonus under the Tax Code for being married; and, of course, they raise taxes on 5 million Americans by increasing the alternative minimum tax.  
   On the Democratic side, we think there is a better alternative. In the Finance Committee proposal, the one that will be before us, married couples will be allowed to file separately or jointly, whatever benefits them from a tax point of view. We fully eliminate all marriage penalties in the Tax Code --all of the 65 provisions. It is fiscally responsible. The price tag is about $150 billion over 10 years, a little over half of what the Republican proposal costs. It does not expand marriage bonuses, and it does not exacerbate the singles penalty. 
   Why do we want to reduce this idea of tax cuts? First, we think we should be reducing the national debt, paying it down, which is good for the economy, as Chairman Alan Greenspan of the Federal Reserve tells us. In so doing, we strengthen Social Security; most Americans agree that is a pretty high priority for all families, married or not. 
   We also believe strengthening Medicare, which is something the Republicans never want to talk about, is good for the future of this country, for the elderly and disabled. It is an absolute lifeline. We believe if we are careful and target tax cuts, there are some things we can achieve which are good for this Nation. 
   One is a proposal which, in my State of Illinois, is very popular, which is the idea of the deductibility of college education expenses up to $10,000. It means if parents are helping their son or daughter through college and pay $10,000 of the tuition bill, they can deduct it, which means a $2,800 benefit to the family paying college expenses. That is going to help a lot of families in my home State. I certainly think that 
   makes more sense than the Republican approach in the marriage tax penalty bill which provides a bonus to people already receiving the tax bonus. 
   The other item we think should be the prime focus when we talk about targeting tax benefits relates to the prescription drug benefit which has been talked about for years on Capitol Hill. The Medicare plan, conceived by President Lyndon Johnson and passed in the early sixties, was a health insurance plan for the elderly and disabled which made a significant difference in America. Seniors live longer; they are healthier; they have better and more independent lives. I have seen it in my family; most have seen it in theirs. We want it to continue. 
   There is a noted gap in that Medicare policy, and that noted gap is prescription drug coverage. Virtually every health insurance policy in America now covers prescription drugs but not Medicare. The Republicans have come in with all sorts of ideas for tax cuts, but they cannot come up with the money to pay for a prescription drug benefit under Medicare. 
   We on the Democratic side think this should be the first priority, not the last. In fact, we put a provision in our budget resolution, with a contentious vote, I might add, to raise that to $40 billion to pay for it. It has already been cut in half in the budget conference committee. There is no will on the Republican side for a prescription drug benefit. 
   They want to talk about a marriage penalty benefit for those who are not suffering a penalty. We want to talk about a prescription drug benefit for the elderly and disabled who are penalized every day when they cannot afford to pay for their prescriptions. 
   Perhaps my friends on the other side of the aisle do not understand the depth of this problem. We have seniors in some States who are literally getting on buses and riding to Canada to buy prescription drugs because they cost half as much in Canada as they do in border States such as North Dakota, Minnesota, and Montana. They understand this. They want us to do something about it, but the first tax cut bill that comes before us since we passed our budget resolution is not about prescription drugs, it is about a marriage penalty bonus for people who are not facing a marriage penalty. 
   I will tell you how bad this drug crisis is for seniors. Their coverage is going down. About a third of seniors have great coverage on prescription drugs, a third mediocre, and a third none at all. At the same time, the cost of these drugs is going up. There was a time when drug prices went up once a year. Then the drug companies realized they could hike their prices twice a year, then once a month, and then every other week. If my colleagues talk with pharmacists or doctors or seniors themselves, they will tell you exactly what I am talking about: Prescription drug costs are going up; coverage is going down. 
   Take a look at the type of bills seniors are facing. Prescription drugs are a burden on moderate income beneficiaries: typical drug costs versus income. For a patient with heart trouble and osteoporosis, typical drugs cost $2,400, 20 percent of pretax income--20 percent if they are living at 150 percent of poverty. That is an income of about $12,000 a year. 
   High blood pressure--one can see the percentages go up: 20 percent, 26 percent; arthritis and osteoporosis, 31 percent; high blood pressure, heart disease, 40 percent. Heart disease and severe anemia, more than a person's income. 
   In the city of Chicago, we had a hearing on prescription drug benefits. Some of the stories that were told were memorable. I can recall several organ recipients, transplant recipients, who came to us facing monthly prescription bills of $1,000 or $2,000. These people, on a fixed income, could not handle it. Medicare only covered it for 3 years. They knew what the cost of prescription drugs meant because for them it was a matter of life or death. Without their drugs, after transplant surgery, they could not survive. 
   There were some who were not in a serious condition but they could tell me about $200, $400, and $500 a month in prescription drug costs. Many times, seniors then make a choice: Will they take the medicine or not? Will they take half the prescription or the full prescription? Will they choose between food or medicine? That is a real world choice. 
   We on the Democratic side think a prescription drug benefit should be the first priority out of the box. We believe we can pass marriage penalty relief that addresses the problem, solves it for the vast majority of couples affected by it, and leaves enough money for a prescription drug benefit. That is our alternative to the Republican proposal. 
   The Republicans want it all to be on the side of marriage tax penalty relief and marriage bonus. We think prescription drug benefits should be part of it. That will be the choice on the floor for Democrats and Republicans. 
   Let's hear your priorities, whether or not you think a prescription drug benefit should be a high priority. We certainly do. 
   Look at how drug costs are growing each year. I mentioned earlier, they go up almost on a weekly basis: 9.7 percent in 1995; continuing to grow to 16 percent in 1999. 
   Of course, drug companies are in business to make a profit. They need to make a profit for research to find new drugs. That is a given. I accept that. A company such as Schering-Plough, that sells Claritin, that spends a third of its revenue on advertising--how many times have you seen the Claritin ads on television, in magazines, in newspapers?--Spends only 11 percent of their revenue on research. We realize the costs are going up for the advertising more than for the research. 
   We believe that as these costs continue to rise, seniors will continue to be disadvantaged. As I have mentioned, seniors --most of them--are on a fixed income and really have nowhere to turn to pay for these drugs. 
   Mr. President, 57 percent of seniors make under $15,000 a year; 21 percent make above that but under $25,000. You get to the categories of seniors who make over $25,000, and that is about one out of five seniors; four out of five make less. So as the prescription drug costs go up, their ability to pay is being stretched. 
   We think this prescription drug benefit then will have a great advantage for seniors. It will give them some peace of mind. The doctors who prescribe these drugs will understand that their patients will be able to afford them and take them. 
   What is the alternative? If an elderly person goes to see a doctor, and the doctor prescribes a drug, and the elderly person goes to the pharmacy and finds out they cannot afford the drug, and they then do not take the drug, and they get sick enough to go to the hospital, who pays for the hospitalization under Medicare? Raise your hands, taxpayers. We all do.  
   When someone gets sick and goes to the hospital, under 
   Medicare, taxpayers pay for it. Yet we do not pay for the prescription drugs to keep people well and out of the hospital. That does not make any sense. It does not make sense medically. No doctor, no senior, would believe that is the best way to deal with this. 
   So we are talking about changing this system for the prevention of illness and disease, for the prevention of hospital stays, and for reductions in the costs to the Medicare program. It is a real cost savings. 
   It isn't just enough, as I have shown from these charts, for us to provide the benefit for seniors so they can pay for prescription drugs. We have to deal with the whole question of pricing, the cost of these drugs. 
   How will we keep these costs under control? People in my part of the world, probably all across the United States, get a little nervous when you talk about the Government being involved in pricing. They say: I am not quite sure the Government should be doing that. 
   They have a right to be skeptical. But let's step back and take an honest look at this. Is there price fixing now when it comes to the cost of drugs? Yes. 
   Insurance companies contact drug companies and say: If you want the doctors under our insurance policy to prescribe your drugs, we will pay you no more than the following cost. That is a fact of life. The bargaining is going on. 
   If these same drug companies take their drugs up to Canada to sell them, the Canadian Government says: You cannot sell them in Canada unless we can establish the ceiling for your prices. 
   That is why the same prescription drugs--made by American companies, in American laboratories, by American technicians, approved by the Food and Drug Administration of the United States of America--when they cross that border, in a matter of minutes, they become a Canadian product sold at half the cost. That is why American seniors get on buses and go up there, to buy those drugs at half the cost. 
   The Canadians speak out when it comes to the price of drugs, as do the Mexicans and the Europeans and every other industrialized country in the world. 
   Oh, the Veterans' Administration here in the United States bargains for drugs, too. We want to get the best deal for our veterans. We tell the pharmaceutical companies: This is the maximum we will pay. They sell it to us. 
   The only group that does not have bargaining power is the seniors and disabled under Medicare. They are the ones who pay top dollar for the drugs in America. Is that fair? Is it fair that the people of moderate income, of limited resources, are the ones who pay the highest price? 
   That is why we on the Democratic side believe a prescription drug benefit should be the first tax cut that we consider, if you want to call it that, because it affects a program such as Medicare. 
   But on the Republican side, no, it isn't a high priority. It isn't in this bill. There is no money set aside for it. There isn't a sufficient amount of money set aside for it in the budget resolution presently in conference. 
   That is the difference. It is a significant difference. 
   If you take a look at the prescription drug coverage by income level, here is what you find. Those who are below the poverty level, 35 percent of them have no prescription drug coverage. 
   For those barely at poverty and above, it is 44 percent. You will see that as you make more and more money, you have more and more likelihood that you will have drug coverage. 
   The lower income Americans, the lower income seniors, and the disabled are the ones who do not have prescription drugs protection. 
   We think the prescription drug benefit should really hit several principles. Any plan that does not is a phony plan. The plan should cover all. There should be universal coverage. Do not pick and choose. Every American should be allowed to be covered under this plan. No. 2, it should have basic and catastrophic coverage. No. 3, it should be affordable. 
   We think if you put these together, you can come up with a prescription drug benefit the President has asked for, which the Democrats in Congress support, and which the Republican bill before us does not even consider. 
   We will come back with an alternative, a Democratic substitute, to give this Chamber a choice. You can take the Republican approach and give tax cuts to those who do not need them or you can take the Democratic approach and eliminate the marriage tax penalty for the vast majority of young people who want to be married--all 65 provisions in the Tax Code--and have enough money remaining to deal with a valid prescription drug benefit. 
   The difference is this. We buy the premise of what the President said in his State of the Union Address, that we happen to be living in good times but we should be careful about our future. If we are going to have surpluses, let us invest them in things that count. Let us pay down the national debt. Let us strengthen Social Security. Let us strengthen Medicare and target the tax cuts where they are needed the most. 
   Some of the Republicans are running around Capitol Hill like folks with hot credit cards. They cannot wait to come up with a new tax cut--needed or not needed. We think we have to be more careful. If we are more careful, if we show some fiscal discipline, we can not only avoid the deficits of the past, heaping them on the national debt, but we can be prepared for any downturn in this economy as well. 
   I think that is fiscally conservative--a term Democrats aren't usually allowed to use but certainly applies in this situation--and it is fiscally prudent. It is the way a family deals with its situation. Before you run out and pay for that big vacation, you might think about paying off some of the credit card debt. I think a lot of families think that way. The Republican leadership in the Senate does not. 
   Instead of paying down the debt of this country, they want to give away the tax revenues in a surplus, give it back to the people. They can give it back, but still we will collect $1 billion a day in interest on old debt. 
   The provision we will be bringing before the Senate during the course of this debate will offer those who are truly fiscally conservative on both sides of the aisle a viable option. We are going to address all 65 provisions in the Tax Code that have a marriage tax penalty effect. The Republican bill goes after the standard deduction and partially addresses two others: Rate brackets and earned-income tax credits. 
   Among the 62 provisions the Republican bill does not address on the marriage tax penalty but the Democratic optional, single-filing alternative does are adoption expenses. Doesn't that make sense, that we wouldn't want to discriminate against couples who may want to adopt? 
   Child tax credits, think about that for a second. A couple wants to get married. They may have some children. We want to give them the child care tax credit. The Republican bill doesn't protect them against the discrimination that might be part of it. 
   Taxation of Social Security benefits, savings bonds for education, none of these is covered by the Republican bill; IRA deductions, student loan interest deductions, elderly credits--the list goes on. 
   After their pronouncements and speeches about what a serious problem this is, their bill really comes up short. It doesn't address the basic problem. It provides tax cuts that are not asked for or needed. It shortchanges the opportunity to put money into a prescription drug benefit. 
   We think it is far better to take an approach which is fiscally prudent, conservative, sensible, and straightforward. 
   We also believe that during the course of this session we will be considering other targeted tax benefits. We can only have limited amounts and still bring down this national debt, so let's spend the money where it will be the most effective: A prescription drug benefit, No. 1; the deductibility of college education expenses, No. 2. If you send a son or daughter to college, you will have a helping hand from the Tax Code to pay for those growing expenses. 
   A third, which the President has proposed and which I think makes sense, is a long-term care credit. How many  people have parents and grandparents who are growing older and need additional care? We know it is expensive. Because of that additional expense, we want to provide a tax credit to help defray some of those costs. Those are very real and serious family challenges. 
   As much has been said on the floor about the marriage penalty and the reverence for families, which I agree is the backbone of this country, let's take a look at families in a little different context, not just on wedding day but when those families are raising their children and sending them to college, when those families are caring about their parents and grandparents who meant so much to them. Our targeted tax cuts go after all of those elements because, on the Republican side, they heap tax cuts on those who, frankly, do not need them, those who are not facing a marriage penalty. They cannot have enough money left to pay down our debt and have the resources for a targeted tax cut along the lines I have suggested. 
   I see my colleague from Wisconsin has come to the floor. I know my time is limited. I ask the Chair how much time I have remaining.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this week is the last week the Senate will be in session before we take a break for the Easter holiday. During the period of that break, on April 20, we will remember an anniversary. It is a sad remembrance. It is the 1-year anniversary of the shooting at Columbine High School in Colorado. 
   Most of us can remember the scenes from television played and replayed so often. The scenes of children, not unlike our own children, racing out of the school away from other kids who were shooting away with weapons. You can remember, I am sure--I will always remember--a young man who dragged himself, having already been shot, out of a window, trying to fall to the ground and get away from danger. We saw that terrible scene on television. 
   We watched as the funerals unfolded one after another; 12 innocent students were killed and 23 were injured. 
   We finally came to realize as a nation that the tragedy which struck in Colorado could touch any one of us anywhere and at any school. Columbine was not the most predictable place for this to occur. Columbine was a place where you would have thought that would never occur. But sadly, this is the reality of America where too many guns are used in crimes of violence. 
   If you look through the chronology of school shootings since 1997, Bethel in the State of Alaska; Pearl, MI; West Paducah, KY; Jonesboro, AK; Edinboro, PA; Fayetteville, TN; Springfield, OR; Littleton, CO; Conyers, GA; Deming, NM; Fort Gibson, OK; Mount Morris Township, MI--you will remember that episode in Michigan. It wasn't that long ago. On February 29, a 6-year-old boy went to his first-grade classroom, pulled out a 32-caliber Davis Industries  semiautomatic pistol, pointed it at his classmates, and then turned the gun on Kayla Rolland, 6 years old, and fatally shot her in the neck. 
   This sad reality is on the minds of American families. The obvious question of the Senate and the Congress is: Is there anything you can do? What can you do? What will you do? 
   The first anniversary of Columbine will come and go next week, and sadly Congress will have done nothing--absolutely nothing. 
   We passed a bill last year on the floor of the Senate which at least moved us closer to the possibility of keeping guns out of the hands of criminals and children. 
   There was an idea behind this law that was not an unreasonable or radical idea, which was the suggestion that if a person bought a gun at a gun show, that person would be subject to the same background checks as a person who bought one from a licensed gun dealer. We don't want to sell guns to criminals. We don't want to sell them to people with a history of violent mental illness. We certainly don't want to sell guns to children. Why wouldn't we check at a gun show to make certain that we are keeping guns away from those people? That is what the law said. That was what was passed here in the Senate. 
   The background check has become automated and computerized. Within 2 hours after the name is submitted, some 95 percent of all of the names submitted--they run them through--95 percent of the people who buy a gun at a gun show would be delayed 2 hours from buying a gun. For the 5 percent where questions are raised and they can't give them an immediate answer, that 5 percent is 20 times more likely to be in a prohibited category; that is, they are 20 times more likely to be criminals, people with a history of violent mental illness, or those who should otherwise be disqualified. 
   The law we proposed was not a radical idea. It said: Can you wait 2 hours at a gun show so we can do a background check and make sure that people who should not buy guns, don't buy them? It is an inconvenience. But you know, we put up with inconvenience every day for the security of ourselves and our families. 
   When I flew through O'Hare Airport yesterday to come to Washington, I went through a metal detector. They stopped me: Take the change out of your pockets and go back through. That is an inconvenience. That is a delay. 
   I am prepared to accept that. If it means there will be fewer terrorist attacks and fewer threats on people traveling, I accept it. 
   That is what this law says; it is an inconvenience. At a gun show, wait for the background check to be completed before you are allowed to get your gun. That is what we proposed. 
   Second, we said if you are going to own a gun, you have a legal responsibility to store it safely. You exercise your constitutional right under the second amendment to buy a gun, but then when you take it home, for goodness' sake, put it in a place so children can't get their hands on it. 
   We called for trigger locks, and that is becoming a popular, common suggestion--it is not an unreasonable suggestion, certainly--so children don't get their hands on guns. Every day in America, we lose just as many kids to guns as we lost on April 20, 1999, at that one high school in Colorado--12 kids a day die because of guns. Some are suicides, some are drive-by gangbanger shootings, and others are just accidents where curious kids play with guns and shoot themselves or their playmates. 
   Our bill said let's require trigger locks on guns, let's make sure they are stored safely and the kids, such as this fellow in Michigan, do not end up with a .32-caliber Davis industries semiautomatic pistol in the first grade where he killed Kayla Rowland. That was the second part of this bill. 
   The third part said you don't need these high-capacity Ammo clips with hundreds of bullets in them if you are going out to shoot a deer. If you need a semiautomatic weapon to shoot a deer, maybe you ought to stick to fishing. We are saying we don't need to make these clips in the United States nor do we need to import them. These are people killers. These are not guns used in sporting or hunting enterprises. That was the third part of the bill. 
   We almost lost the gun shows provision I have just described on the Senate floor. The gun shows amendment passed by one vote, the vote of Vice President GORE, who under the Constitution can break a tie. He showed up that day and cast the deciding vote. We passed the gun shows amendment by one vote after Columbine, after this national tragedy. We passed it by one vote. We sent it across the Rotunda to the House of Representatives. Now it is their responsibility. We gave them 2 or 3 weeks to prepare to debate the bill. But we obviously gave the gun lobby at least the same period of time to prepare their campaign against it. And they were successful. They watered down the gun shows amendment. They took the viable parts out of it. They passed a shadow of what we passed in the Senate. 
   At that point, it goes to the conference committee and the House and Senate sit together and try to work out a compromise. Here we sit, almost a year after Columbine, and we have done absolutely nothing. Families across America who expect this Congress to do the most basic things for gun safety have a right to be angry that this Congress is so insensitive and unwilling to address this critical issue of gun safety, of safety in the classrooms, keeping guns out of the hands of criminals, violently mental ill people, and children. 
   The other side says, of course, it isn't about new laws. We hear the gun lobby say we have plenty of laws, it is about enforcing the laws on the books. How many times have we heard Charlton Heston and those folks come up with that argument? I don't disagree with them. I think enforcement is critical and existing laws should be enforced. 
   So last week while we were debating the budget resolution, I brought a proposal on the floor of the Senate. Many Members, frankly, subscribe to the NRA position that we need more enforcement. I said let's put more agents and inspectors in the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms so they can find the gun 
   dealers who are breaking the law and selling their guns to criminals; let's put 1,000 more prosecutors across America to enforce those laws, prosecute those laws, and put people in jail who violate those laws. 
   Unfortunately, I couldn't succeed and I didn't prevail. A Senator came to the floor and offered an alternative which took out all the money for the ATF agents and inspectors. He didn't want to put more enforcement in the gun laws of America. And he prevailed. The argument that this is about enforcement doesn't square with the vote that took place last week. 
   There are 102,000 gun dealers across America, about 80,000 who actively sell weapons that are used in sport and hunting. When we did a survey, out of those 80,000 federally licensed gun dealers, we found if we narrowed it down to those gun dealers who sell guns that end up being used in crime, traceable guns used in crime, only 1,000 of the 80,000 gun dealers are the culprits, the ones selling guns to people that are ultimately used in crime. Over half the guns used in crime in America come from 1,000 of the gun dealers out of 80,000. 
   It makes sense to me to go after these 1,000, and it makes sense to me to give resources to the ATF and the Department of the Treasury to go after these gun dealers, close them down if we have to, but enforce the law. Don't let people--whether they are in Illinois, my home State, or any other State--sell guns that are going to be used in a crime. 
   When I put the amendment on the floor, the other side couldn't accept that. They didn't want to put more enforcement in the gun laws. So they came up with a much weaker alternative. 
   Here we are at the traditional and historic standoff. This Congress failed to act for 1 year after Columbine. The images are still fresh in our mind of those kids running for their lives out of their own high school; those caskets, one after the other, at funerals; grieving parents, grieving communities, and a grieving nation; and this Congress, unable and unwilling to respond or act. It is shameful. It is disgraceful. And it continues. The school violence, the gun violence that struck Columbine, continues. Look beyond the schools. We see it in the streets and the neighborhoods, and more children will die today  in America, 12 more, the same number killed at Columbine--12 more--because we will not take the initiative for gun safety. 
   Has this Congress reached such a point that we are under the thumb of the National Rifle Association and the gun lobby? That we would let those well dressed lobbyists down on K Street rule our agenda to the point where American families are being ignored? I hope not. 
   I hope when we remember in just a few days the anniversary of Columbine, families across America will take just a few minutes, get on the phone, and call their Congressman and their Senator and ask them one simple question: I just heard about Columbine; what have you done with your vote to make my kids safer in school since this tragedy? If citizens will call and ask that question, perhaps we will see a change of sentiment here on Capitol Hill. 
   I yield back the remainder of my time.

    Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Reasonable Search Standards Act. This act prohibits racial or other discriminatory profiling by Customs Service personnel. Representative JOHN LEWIS from Georgia has introduced similar legislation in the House. 
   Two years ago, I requested a GAO study of the U.S. Customs Service's procedures for conducting inspections of airport passengers. The need for this study grew out of an investigation report by Renee Ferguson of WMAQ-TV in Chicago and several complaints from African-American women in my home state of Illinois who were strip-searched at O'Hare Airport for suspicion of carrying drugs. No drugs were found and the women felt that they had been singled out for these highly intrusive searches because of their race. These women, approximately 100 of them, have filed a class action suit in Chicago. 
   The purpose of the GAO study was to review Customs' policies and procedures for conducting personal searches of airport passengers and to determine the internal controls in place to ensure that airline passengers are not inappropriately targeted or subjected to personal searches. 
   Approximately 140 million passengers entered the United States on international flights during fiscal years 1997 and 1998. Because there is no data available on the gender, race and citizenship of this traveling population, GAO was not able to determine whether specific groups of passengers are disproportionately selected to be searched. 
   However, once passengers are selected for searches, GAO was able to evaluate the likelihood that people with various race and gender characteristics would be subjected to searches that are more personally intrusive, such as strip-searches and x-rays, rather than simply being frisked or patted down. 
   The GAO study revealed some very troubling patterns in the searches conducted by U.S. Customs Service inspectors. 
   GAO found disturbing disparities in the likelihood that passengers from certain populations groups, having been selected for some form of search, would be subjected to the more intrusive searches including strip-searches or x-ray searches. Moreover, that increased likelihood of being intrusively searched did not always correspond to an increased likelihood of actual carrying contraband. 
   Because of the intrusive nature of strip-searches and x-ray searches, it is important that the Customs Service avoid any discriminatory bias in forcing passengers to undergo these searches. 
   GAO found that African-American women were much more likely to be strip-searched than most other passengers. This disproportionate treatment was not justified by the rate at which these women were found to be carrying contraband. Certain other groups also experienced a greater likelihood of being strip-searched relative to their likelihood of being found carrying contraband. 
   Specifically, African-American women were nearly 3 times as likely as African-American men to be strip-searched, even though they were only half as likely to be found carrying contraband. Hispanic-American and Asian-American women were also nearly 3 times as likely as Hispanic-American and Asian-American men to be strip-searched, even though they were 20 percent less likely to be found carrying contraband. 
   In addition, African-American women were 73 percent more likely than White-American women to be strip-searched in 1998 and nearly 3 times as likely to be strip-searched in 1997, despite only a 42 percent higher likelihood of being found carrying contraband. Moreover, among non-citizens, White men and women were more likely to be strip-searched than Black and Hispanic men and women, despite lower rates of being found carrying contraband. 
   As with strip-searches, x-rays are personally intrusive and it is of particular concern that the Customs Service avoid any discriminatory bias in requiring x-ray searches of passengers suspected of carrying contraband. 
   GAO found that African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans were much more likely to be x-rayed than other passengers. This disproportionate treatment was not justified by the rate at which these passengers were found to be carrying contraband. 
   Specifically, GAO found that African-American women were nearly 9 times as likely as White-American women to be x-rayed even though they were half as likely to be carrying contraband. African-American men were nearly 9 times as likely as White-American men to be x-rayed, even though they were no more likely than White-American men to be carrying contraband. Moreover, Hispanic-American women and men were nearly 4 times as likely as White-American women and men to be x-rayed, even though they were only a little more than half as likely to be carrying contraband. And among non-citizens, Black women and men were more than 4 times as likely as White women and men to be x-rayed, even though Black women were only half as likely and Black men were no more likely to be found carrying contraband. 
   For these reasons, I am introducing the Reasonable Search Standards Act. This bill is a direct response to the concerns raised by the GAO report. The bill prohibits Customs Service personnel from selecting passengers for searches based in whole or in part on the passenger's actual or perceived race, religion, gender, national origin, or sexual orientation. 
   To ensure that a sound reason exists for selecting someone to be searched, the bill requires Customs Service personnel to document the reasons for searching a passenger before the passenger is searched. The only exception to this requirement is when the Customs official suspects that the passenger is carrying a weapon. 
   The bill also requires all Customs Service personnel to undergo periodic training on the procedures for searching passengers, with a particular emphasis on the prohibition on profiling. The training shall include a review of the reasons given for searches, the results of the searches and the effectiveness of the criteria used by Customs to select passengers for searches. 
   Finally, the bill calls for an annual study and report on detentions and searches of individuals by Customs Service personnel. The report shall include the number of searches conducted by Customs Service personnel, the race and gender of travelers subjected to the searches, the type of searches conducted--including pat down searches and intrusive non-routine searches--and the results of these searches. 
   With this proposed legislation, I call on the Congress of the United States to act, to make a commitment giving all persons entering and leaving our borders, regardless of gender, race, color,  religion, or ethnic background, the right to be treated fairly. 
   Lyndon B. Johnson once said, ``I am a free man, an American, a United States Senator, and a Democrat, in that order.'' I am also all of these, in that order. 
   As a man, I am saddened that, in this new millennium, women and minorities are disproportionately selected for intrusive searches at our nation's borders. 
   As an American, I am deeply troubled by the thought that any citizen, or non-citizen, might be detained and stripped or x-rayed because of their gender or the color of their skin. 
   As a United States Senator, I am proposing legislation to prohibit racial or other inappropriate profiling and establish statutory procedures to track and prevent disproportionate search rates. This approval reflects our nation's basic posture of common sense and common justice. 
   I implore my colleagues to examine this issue from the viewpoint of the nation and its entire people. In the immortal words of John F. Kennedy, ``The rights of every man are diminished when the rights of one man are threatened.'' 
   (By Mr. MOYNIHAN (for himself, Mr. KENNEDY, Mr. SCHUMER, Mr. HELMS, Mr. KERREY, Mrs. BOXER, Mr. INOUYE, Mr. SANTORUM, Mr. TORRICELLI, Mr. JOHNSON, Mrs. FEINSTEIN, Mr. SMITH of Oregon, Mr. KERRY, Mr. DEWINE, Mr. EDWARDS, Mr. CLELAND, Mr. LIEBERMAN, Mr. LEVIN, Mr. SARBANES, Mr. WELLSTONE, Mr. REED, Mrs. MURRAY, Ms. MIKULSKI, and Mr. SPECTER):

    Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks concerning this bill I am introducing today, which will help many Medicare beneficiaries who have had organ transplants. 
   Every year, over 4,000 people die waiting for an organ transplant. Currently, over 62,000 Americans are waiting for a donor organ. It is this scarcity that has fueled the current controversy over organ allocation. 
   Given that organs are extremely scarce, Federal law should not compromise the success of organ transplantation. Yet that is exactly what current Medicare policy does, because Medicare denies certain transplant patients coverage for the drugs needed to prevent rejection. 
   Medicare does this in three different ways. Firstly, Medicare has time limits on coverage of immunosuppressive drugs. Permanent Medicare law only provides immunosuppressive drug coverage for 3 years with expanded coverage totaling 3 years and 8 months between 2000 and 2004. However, 61 percent of patients receiving a kidney transplant after someone has died still have the graft intact 5 years after transplantation. 76.6 percent of patients receiving a kidney from a live donor still have their transplant intact after 5 years post transplantation. For livers, the graft survival rate after 5 years is 62 percent. For hearts, the 5 year graft survival rate is 67.7 percent. So many Medicare beneficiaries lose coverage of the essential drugs that are needed to maintain their transplant. 
   Secondly, Medicare does not pay for anti-rejection drugs for Medicare beneficiaries, who received their transplants prior to becoming a Medicare beneficiary. So for instance, if a person received a transplant at age 64 through their health insurance plan, when they retire and rely on Medicare for their health care they will no longer have immunosuppressive drug coverage. 
   Thirdly, Medicare only pays for anti-rejection drugs for transplants performed in a Medicare approved transplant facility. However, many beneficiaries are completely unaware of this fact and how it can jeopardize their future coverage of immunosuppressive drugs. To receive an organ transplant, a person must be very ill and many are far too ill at the time of transplantation to be researching the intricate nuances of Medicare coverage policy. 
   The bill that I am introducing today, the ``Comprehensive Immunosuppressive Drug Coverage for Transplant Patients of 2000 Act'' would remove these short-sighted limitations. The bill sets up a new, easy to follow policy: All Medicare beneficiaries who have had a transplant and need immunosuppressive drugs to prevent rejection of their transplant, would be covered as long as such anti-rejection drugs were needed. 
   I am introducing this bill on behalf of some of the constituents that I have met who are unfortunately very adversely affected by the current gaps in Medicare coverage. 
   Richard Hevrdejs was a Chicago attorney in private practice until 1993. Unfortunately, he suffered a debilitating heart attack that year, which left him unable to work and on disability. In 1997, suffering from congestive heart failure, he was placed on a Heart-Mate machine at the University of Illinois Medical Center (UIC). In April of 1998, he received a heart transplant at UIC but because UIC was not at the time a Medicare approved facility for heart transplants, Medicare will not cover his immunosuppressive drugs. Richard was near death when he had his transplant and was in no condition to research the intricacies of Medicare coverage policies. His drug costs are now around $25,000 per year. He gets some assistance from the drug company medical assistance plans and he has a Medigap policy that provides a little assistance. But for the most part, he is forced to watch all his savings dwindle because of Medicare's coverage gaps. 
   Anita Milton is from Morris, Illinois. In 1995, she became so disabled that she was no longer able to work and was forced onto disability. The following year, her lungs gave up and 
    she had to have a bilateral lung transplant. Because Medicare s not available for 2 years after a person becomes eligible for disability, Anita was not on Medicare when she had the transplant. Today, the huge bills for the transplant remain at collection agencies. Because Anita was not on Medicare when she received her transplant, she does not receive Medicare coverage for the antirejection drugs that she needs. She receives $940 in disability payments per month. She is now on Medicaid but due to the spend down requirements in Illinois, she must spend $689 on drug costs to get Medicaid converge for her drugs. In effect, she gets coverage every month. Anita cannot afford her anti-rejection drugs and she tried to scale back on them. This caused her to nearly reject the transplant. Consequently, she has lost a third of her lung capacity permanently. As Anita said at a Town Hall meeting in Chicago in January ``these Medicare and Medicaid rules make no sense.'' 
   I am introducing this bill on the same day that another bill the ``Organ Transplant Act of 2000'', which I am an original cosponsor is also being introduced. The ``Organ Transplant Fairness Act'' also seeks to change another aspect of Federal law to improve the Nation's organ allocation system. The two bills are good companions. It makes little sense to improve the organ allocation system to maximize the success of organ transplantation and increase the number of lives saved, if we do not at the same time reduce the ways that Medicare jeopardizes transplants by denying transplant patients the anti-rejection drugs they need to maintain their transplant.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I urge Members of the Senate to oppose this amendment. We have debated gun safety back and forth and one side says we need more enforcement. The second-degree amendment before us provides no new ATF agents. If we are going to enforce the laws to find the 1,000 Federal gun dealers responsible for selling 57 percent of the guns traced in crime, we need more ATF agents. If we are going to stop interstate gunrunning, we need more ATF agents. This second-degree amendment provides no new ATF agents. If my colleagues say enforcement is the key to gun safety, they have to oppose this amendment and support the underlying amendment which provides new ATF investigators, as well as new prosecutors, across America. I hope my colleagues will oppose the second-degree amendment.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator REID and Senator LAUTENBERG for yielding me this time. 
   The amendment I have offered is a straightforward opportunity for Members of the Senate to go on record in reference to the proposed tax cut by George W. Bush, the nominal candidate for President on the Republican side. 
   The reason I am offering this amendment is I believe it offers a clear choice to the Members of the Senate and certainly to the people of this Nation. Every one of us understands we have been going through a period of unprecedented prosperity in America. In fact, I believe we have set records in terms of the period of economic growth without recession. This is not an accident. It is by design of an administration that has been determined to continue to bring Federal spending under control, to keep interest rates manageable, and to encourage growth in the economy. This policy of the administration is complemented by the policies of the Federal Reserve Board under Chairman Alan Greenspan. 
   We are now at an unusual point in our history where we are considering the possibility of surpluses. That is something that would have been unthinkable a few years ago in Washington when we were drowning in red ink with deficit after deficit piling on to our national debt. It reached such a point of desperation that a proposal was made in the Congress to amend the Constitution of the United States and give to the Federal judiciary the power to rein in the spending of Congress. 
   It was an unprecedented transfer of power to the judiciary away from the legislative branch of Government. Some people were so despondent and so desperate, they were prepared to back such a constitutional amendment for a balanced budget. It is hard to imagine that was only about 4 years ago. 
   Today in the course of debating the budget resolution, our focus is the use of the surplus, the revenues we will generate from our economy far and above what is necessary for the needs of Government and current programs. There is a difference of opinion about what to do with this surplus. 
   On the Democratic side, we believe the first priority should be the reduction of our national debt. We collect each day in America $1 billion in taxes from individuals, businesses, and families, and that money is used for the sole purpose of paying interest on our national debt. That $1 billion does not educate a child; it does not build a road; it does not make America any safer. It pays interest on debt, a debt primarily held by foreign bond holders. 
   We believe on the Democratic side that our first priority should be to  bring down this debt and reduce these interest costs so we can say to our children: You are not going to inherit our mortgage, a mortgage which we incurred for our needs in our generation. We are going to give you a better chance to build your America in the vision of your future instead of being saddled with our old debt. 
   That is the highest priority on the Democratic side, and my colleagues will hear it expounded by the Democratic leader, Senator LAUTENBERG, when he offers his Democratic alternative to the budget. 
   The way we reduce this debt is by investing money in Social Security so that system will be available for seniors and the disabled for decades to come and also, of course, and by investing in Medicare. Medicare is a word which many people in this Chamber fear to use. They are afraid on the 
   other side of the aisle to even make reference to Medicare and its future. But for 40 million-plus Americans, Medicare is an important word in their everyday life. That Medicare system provides health insurance for the elderly and disabled of America. It has been, frankly, one of the most successful programs in the modern era because it represents a commitment by the Federal Government that no one, when they have reached a certain age, will go wanting when it comes to quality health care, and it has worked. 
   In the 40 years since the institution of Medicare, our seniors have lived longer; they have had a better life; they are more independent; they are healthier; they are stronger, and Medicare has a lot to do with it. We on the Democratic side believe that part of the surplus generated in this economy should be dedicated to Medicare's future to make sure this health insurance is around for many years to come. 
   We also believe we should target tax cuts. We think we can take an appropriate amount of this surplus and convert it into tax cuts which families really need. I will give two specific examples. We on the Democratic side believe that we should have a targeted tax cut so families can deduct college education expenses. How many families do we know that have sent a son or daughter off to college and then worried about how much debt that child incurred in the course of their higher education? 
   By providing the deductibility of college education expenses as a targeted tax cut on the Democratic side, we will provide some relief to these families, up to, say, $2,800, for example, each year which will defray the cost of college education expenses. I hope it will be more in the future, but that depends, of course, on the economy and how it is moving and whether the surpluses continue. 
   Secondly, the largest growing group of Americans are those over the age of 85. People who have parents and grandparents who are now reaching their golden years find they need additional care, in many instances. Whether it is in the nature of a visiting nurse or in a nursing home, this additional care can be costly. We have proposed on the Democratic side a targeted tax cut that will allow families to defray some expenses of long-term care for a parent or aging relative. We believe this is sensible and reflects what modern families have to deal with and struggle with on a daily basis. So our targeted tax cuts come right behind our plan for debt reduction. 
   Finally, the last piece in our proposal on the Democratic side is our investment in our future. We understand, and most historians will agree, the 20th century had a lot to do with education. We want to make certain the 21st century is an American century as well, and that means investing in our children to make certain they have the very best education, the very best teachers, and the schools are modernized so they can accommodate the new technology. 
   Along with the President, we invest money for education, as well as for an important program I have found to be immensely popular across Illinois and around the Nation. That program is a prescription drug benefit. The idea behind it, of course, is we will find a way under Medicare to provide a prescription drug benefit for the elderly and disabled that will help them pay for their drugs and also keep them in a position, if they have an expensive pharmaceutical bill, of not having to choose between food or medicine. 
   We also believe the cost element is important in this 
   debate on a prescription drug benefit. We believe prescription drugs in America should be fairly priced. Pharmaceutical companies are entitled to a profit--they need it for future research--but when we hear stories about exactly the same drug made in America costing half as much in Canada and costing less if one buys it for their dog than if they buy it for their aunt, people are saying this is an outrage. We ought to have prescription drugs fairly priced so this benefit under Medicare will work. 
   That is a condensation of the Democratic approach to our surplus, our future, and our budget priorities. 
   On the other side, George W. Bush, the Governor of Texas running for President of the United States, has a much different view of America. He believes we should change dramatically and radically the path we have followed over the past 7 1/2 years. 
   He has proposed, instead of reducing debt, investing in Social Security, investing in Medicare, targeted tax cuts, education, and health care, that we should have a massive tax cut, a tax cut primarily for the wealthiest people in America. 
   Take a look at the first year of this tax cut and one can understand this graphic. This graphic shows the American economy moving forward, steaming into the ocean. Look at this tiny little $168 billion cap of an iceberg. This is the first year of the George W. Bush tax cut. Look what comes and follows. This tax cut grows in size and eventually, I believe, could endanger the economy and its growth. 
   My position on that is not unique nor is it partisan. Chairman Alan Greenspan has said: Tax cuts are not our highest priority in America. Our highest priority is debt reduction. That is the Democratic alternative. I think Chairman Greenspan is right. I think George W. Bush is wrong. 
   The amendment which I offer is an up-or-down vote by the Members of the Senate about whether they want to follow the course that has led to such economic progress or whether they want to sign up for the George W. Bush tax cut. 
   Let me tell you what this tax cut would cost America. It would cost us, in the first 5 years, $483 billion; then, over a 10-year period of time, more than $1.2 trillion. It is a substantial investment in tax cuts. 
   As I have said many times on the floor, every politician likes to stand up and call for a tax cut. It is one of the most popular speeches we can make. But it may not be the most responsible thing to do. The American people are thinking twice about this promise by George W. Bush of a tax cut of this magnitude because they understand that every proposal has its cost. 
   Let me show you a chart. 
   The impact of the Bush tax plan is to not only spend the surplus that we have discussed but to reach beyond the surplus, which we are generating in our Government, and to call on spending the Social Security trust fund for the George Bush tax cut. 
   Those on the Senate floor who want to vote in favor of the 
   Bush tax plan are really saying we should reach into the Social Security trust fund surplus and take the money out of Social Security to fund this George W. Bush tax plan. 
   This chart shows that in the first 5 years of the George Bush tax cut, we have a non-Social Security surplus of $171 billion. George Bush would spend not only that but another $312 billion to fund this tax cut. Where does he find the additional money? He has to take it from the Social Security trust fund. In raiding the Social Security trust fund, I believe he breaks faith with a promise made, on a bipartisan basis, by Congress that we would make certain the fund is protected. 
   Let's take a closer look at what it means in terms of the Republican budget resolution, as well. 
   Recalling again the $171 billion non-Social Security surplus, on the Republican side, in their budget resolution, they call for a tax cut in the neighborhood of $168 billion to $223 billion over a 5-year period. You will note, this is perilously close and in many instances exceeds, again, the non-Social Security surplus.  
   In order to fund this plan, they will either have to reach deep into the Social Security trust fund or, as an alternative, will have to make cuts in spending. 
   Cuts in spending may sound harmless today, but when we put them on the spot and ask, ``Where will you cut,'' they refuse to point to it. Many of us believe that investments in education, in our infrastructure, and in our Nation's defense are too important to be left in this uncertainty. 
   Looking again at the Bush tax cut--the original figure of $483 billion that he proposed, plus an additional $60 billion in interest--it shows you the disparity between the non-Social Security surplus and the Bush tax cut. This is the tax cut I am asking my colleagues in the Senate to vote on yes or no today. I will be voting no. I will be voting against a tax cut which threatens the Social Security trust fund. I hope my colleagues will stand up and be counted as to whether they believe the Bush tax cut is good policy for the future of America. 
   Let's take a closer look at what this tax cut means to American families. Most families who I represent could certainly use a tax cut. I think, in many instances, it would be helpful to them to meet their expenses and to provide for their future. 
   Take a close look at the Bush tax cut and the winners and the losers. Families making over $301,000 a year, under the George Bush tax cut, would see an annual tax break of over $50,000. Think of it--a family already making $300,000 a year, plus a $50,000 tax break under the George Bush tax cut. Sixty percent of working families in America, with incomes below $39,300, would see an annual tax break, under the Bush tax cut, of $249. 
   My colleagues in the Senate will have their choice. Do they want to support the Bush tax cut, which threatens Social Security by raiding the Social Security trust fund, and provides virtually no tax relief to 60 percent of America's working families, at the same time providing a generous $50,000-plus tax cut for those making over $300,000 a year? 
   Many on the Republican side have already appeared with George W. Bush, put their arms around him and endorsed him. If they endorse his tax cut, they have a chance to vote for it today. 
   Twice in the Senate Budget Committee they ran away from this decision. They refused to face a vote, up or down, on the Bush tax cut. Today they will have another clear choice, a choice as to whether or not they believe America is moving in the right direction--whether we should take the Democratic alternative of reducing debt, investing in Social Security and Medicare, with targeted tax cuts for families, with investments in education--or whether they will take what I consider to be a risky and dangerous course and follow the suggestion of the Presidential candidate of the Republican Party, George W. Bush. 
   This morning's Roll Call newspaper spelled out that the George Bush tax plan makes it virtually impossible for him to meet the needs of America's future--to fund the prescription drug benefit, to fund additional medical research, things that Americans understand to be an important part of our future. 
   George W. Bush has made his choice. He has decided this tax cut is more important than those other things. It is time for the Senate to make its choice. It is time for the Senate to stand up and be counted. 
   I hope, unlike in the Senate Budget Committee, my colleagues in the Senate--whether they are for or against this tax cut--will stand up and be counted. If they believe, as I do, that America is moving in the right direction and that taking this risky strategy could imperil our future, I hope they will join me in voting no on this tax cut. 
   I yield back the remainder of my time.

   Mr. DURBIN. I conclude that a Presidential candidate can assume anything he or she wants to assume. In fairness, if somebody is going to make the cornerstone of their campaign a tax cut, it should make sense and should hold up when anyone analyzes it. With the figures I brought to the floor today, I suggest that Bush's proposed tax cut would invade the Social Security surplus by virtually any estimation.

   Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from Texas would not yield for a question. But I would like to ask him a question. I hope I am not inviting a speech. It is a very simple question. 
   I am holding Vice President GORE's book, ``Earth in the Balance'' in my hand. Can the Senator from Texas tell me which page he refers to when he says that Vice President GORE has called for a $3 gasoline tax increase? I want to turn to that page immediately. Can the Senator give me the number of the page?

   Mr. DURBIN. I reclaim my time, Mr. President. 
   If you have been around politics for about 5 minutes 30 seconds, you know  that when you do not have an answer, you answer a question with a question. That is what has happened. 
   Vice President GORE does not propose a $3 gasoline tax increase. He never has. The Senator from Texas knows it. He is coming to the floor trying to suggest a tax increase that he has dreamed up of $3 a gallon because he does not want to face the music when it comes to the real tax increases and cuts 
   proposed by the Republican candidate for President, his Governor from the State of Texas, George W. Bush. 
   That is for real. That is the cornerstone of his campaign. You cannot stand it, Senator, but it is a fact. You make up taxes and put it in the mouth of AL GORE. We take the words spoken by George Bush. 
   When I ask the Senate to vote on George W. Bush's tax cut--the mainstay of his campaign--you would think the Republicans would rally behind George W. Bush. This is their man. This is the one they want to see elected to the White House. But they run, in the words of our former Senator Dale Bumpers, like the devil runs from holy water, when it comes to a vote on the George W. Bush tax cut. They cannot stand the thought of going on record for what the Senator from Texas says he is so very proud of. He is so very proud of George W. Bush's tax cut, he has offered a substitute to it. He does not want to be on the record. He does not want to go back to Texas and try to explain that tax cut. I do not blame him. It is a bad idea. It is bad policy. 
   I make no apology for bringing to the floor of the Senate the major issues in the Presidential campaign. For goodness sakes, what would the world think if the Senate stopped talking to itself and talking about issues that are being debated in America? This is the No. 1 issue in the campaign. I make no apology for bringing it to the floor, asking Democrats on this side and Republicans on the other, to go on record: Do you support it or don't you? 
   I make no apology for the progress we have made in this Nation over the last 7 1/2 years under the Clinton-Gore administration. I tell the Senator from Texas and anyone following this debate, I would gladly run on the record of this administration and our economy. I would take it to every State in the Union because we know what has happened: Unemployment is down, housing starts are up, business creation is up, inflation is under control. We have seen America prosper in a way that has never happened in our history. 
   It bothers my Republican friends to acknowledge this fact. They think it dropped out of Heaven. They do not think the President had anything to do with it. We know better. We know that on the floor of this Senate, and in the House of Representatives, President Clinton's budget plan, that started reducing the deficits and moving us in the right direction, was passed without a single--not one--Republican vote in support. It kills them. 
   Senator GRAMM was just quoted on the floor. He said it would be the end of--I have forgotten his exact words--but the end of civilization as we know it if the Clinton plan passed. 
   Well, guess what. It did pass, and America got a lot better. American families know we are moving in the right direction. It is interesting to me that my Republican friend from Texas just loves this Bush tax cut to pieces, but he can't bring himself to go on record to vote for it. He doesn't want to have to go back home and explain it--even in Texas, Governor Bush's own State. 
   I am offering the Bush tax cut as he has proposed it in his own words. Senator GRAMM is offering a figment of his imagination about what Al Gore might have said. When I ask him for a specific page in this book, where there is a $3 gas tax increase, I get a question back to me. Well, if you have been through the first grade, you know how to open a book and go to the right page. That is what the teacher teaches you. Senator GRAMM can't take us to the right page in Vice President Gore's book referring to a $3 gas tax because it isn't there. He is making it up. 
   Look at what the so-called fair Bush tax cut means to American families. If you happen to have an income of $31,100 a year, it means a $500-per-year tax break under the Bush tax cut. But, boy, if you are in an income category over $300,000, there is a $50,000-a-year tax cut coming from the Bush proposal, the one for which I want the Senate to go on record. 
   Is this fair? It isn't fair whether you drive a pickup truck or walk along the shoulder of the highway. It isn't fair to working families who have to drive pickup trucks to survive. I think we ought to vote, and I think the Senator from Texas ought to withdraw his amendment so we can vote up or down on something of which he is so proud. 
   Look at what happened to the deficits under various Presidents. I think the record is clear. I am sure it hurts my Republican colleagues to acknowledge the obvious. We have seen the deficits grow under Presidents Reagan and Bush. But look at what has happened under President Clinton. The deficits have come down.

I can't believe the Senator from Texas, who is in close touch with his State, hasn't noticed that, and that with the Clinton-Gore approach on our economy, 
   with the help of the Federal Reserve, America is moving in the right direction. Even Texas may be moving in the right direction. I don't want to speak for that State.

   Mr. DURBIN. Well, of course, President Clinton was reelected in a rather decisive victory over former Senator Bob Dole. The American people like the way America is moving forward. I am sure it has been painful for Senator GRAMM and others who opposed the President's suggested policy to get America back on track to realize they were wrong. The facts have shown them to be wrong. In fact, we have had the longest period of growth and prosperity in America's economic history. 
   They want to change that, I say to the Senator from Nevada. Their Presidential candidate, George W. Bush, doesn't like the way things have been going. He thinks that instead of the policies that have brought America forward, we ought to change it all--a dramatic, radical, and risky tax cut that would go to the wealthiest people in America. 
   When I asked the Republicans in the Senate to vote up or down on whether they want to stand by Governor Bush, they came in with a substitute. They want to change the subject and invent a tax that they cannot even identify with Vice President AL GORE. Vice President GORE has not called for a $3 gas tax increase. 
   I think the Vice President is right to heighten our awareness of the need to do something to improve air quality in America. I might say to the Senator from Texas--he may not know this--  about 6 years ago, the Vice President, along with President Clinton, went to the major automobile makers of the United States and challenged them to come up with a more fuel-efficient engine, and it is possible, even in my lifetime, that what we know as the internal combustion engine will be gone, and we will have something that is cheaper to operate and safer for the environment. Whether you are from Texas or Illinois, that would be a good change. 
   When I listen to the critics of Vice President GORE on the environment, I find it hard to believe. I can't believe that even in the State of Texas you aren't at least sensitive to air and water quality. But to say that anybody who brings up the environment is some pinheaded professor that parks his bicycle straight overstates the case. The American people, particularly younger people in this country, want a cleaner nation, with air that is safe to breathe and water that is safe to drink. If the Vice President is heightening our awareness of environmental issues, so about be it. All political leaders should do that.

   Mr. DURBIN. I think the Senator from Nevada is exactly right. It is about time America gets serious about an energy policy. I can recall that in previous administrations we had statements of fuel efficiency on vehicles and on appliances, and, frankly, some people on the other side of the aisle thought that was a heavyhanded move by the Government. They have been fighting off that information at a time when we should have it. We ought to be looking to alternative sources, not only alternative sources for fuel, responsible sources in the United States, but also alternative fuels. This is not radical thinking. It is sensible that we would look for alternatives to our dependence on foreign fuel. I think when Vice President GORE raises environmental concerns, those are concerns most Americans share. 
   Let me go on to another point raised by the Senator from Texas. He raised the marriage tax penalty, which is imposed on people who, because their combined incomes bring them to a higher tax rate, pay more after they are married than before. I say to the Senator from Texas--he probably knows this--the Democrats, the Republicans, and the President agree that this should be changed. There is no controversy here. For him to raise it in the debate baffles me. 
   Second, when it comes to the estate tax, do you know what percentage of Americans pay the estate tax? I will answer this question. It is 1.3 percent of the estates that pay the estate tax. 
   Now, yesterday, I had a chance to meet a gentleman by the name of Bill Gates, who runs Microsoft Corporation. He has had a bad month. His net worth went down from $70 billion to $52 billion. When he passes away, I don't believe it is unreasonable that he would pay some taxes back to the America, which has given him a chance to succeed, to pay for education and opportunities for the next generation. 
   Obviously, the Senator from Texas thinks that is unfair and unjust. I do not. I do concur with his belief that we ought to change the estate tax law so that family farmers and family businesses can pass their enterprises on without penalty, under most circumstances. 
   I already introduced a resolution to that effect in the Senate last year. I hope we can do that. But to eliminate the estate tax on Bill Gates doesn't strike me as the progressive thinking of the Senator from Texas. He is entitled to his point of view. 
   Let me talk to you about his conjecture that President Clinton in his budget is going to dramatically increase spending. 
   The Senator from Texas will never tell you on what specifics President Clinton wants to spend money. You would think it is a wasteful expenditure here, there, and the other place. My guess is, if you take a close look at the specific areas of spending, you will find that most American families agree. There are areas where we should spend more taxpayer dollars. 
   Let me give you a couple of illustrations. 
   Can we start with education? Is there anyone who couldn't believe we should invest in education, hold the teachers and the establishment of education accountable for what comes out of the classroom but give them the resources to do a good job; pay teachers a decent salary; put the computers and technology in the classroom so they can teach adequately; and make sure schools are modernized for the 21st century? 
   I think that is one of the ``wasteful'' programs the Senator from Texas would have us eliminate so we can give a tax cut to the wealthiest people in American. 
   Look at some of the proposals by President Clinton for spending. I guess the Senator from Texas should have taken a look at this list. It appears he wants to spend some more money on additional defense for America. I don't think that is altogether a bad idea. I think that is part of the preamble of the Constitution--that the United States wants to provide for the common defense. And I am glad President Clinton has shown leadership there. 
   When it comes to foreign assistance, he, for example, wants to invest money to make America's embassies overseas safe from terrorism. Is that a wasteful expenditure we should do away with in the name of a $50,000-a-year tax cut that George W. Bush proposes for people making over $300,000 a year? 
   The list goes on and on. 
   Environmental toxic cleanup: The President wants to spend more on that. So do I. I don't want those toxic chemicals in the soil leeching into ground water and contaminating water supplies across America. 
   The President is right, and the American people know it. 
   In the area of agriculture, we had an effort to help our farmers across America struggling through the most difficult times. Yes. That is President Clinton's proposal for spending. Is it a valid one? You bet it is. For 2 straight years, we have passed emergency appropriations for farmers. 
   I take it the Senator from Texas doesn't believe we should do that; instead, we should take the George W. Bush tax cut and give a $50,000-a-year tax break to some of the wealthiest people in this country. 
   The list goes on and on. 
   Investments in transportation: So that the FAA can have modern equipment; so that when we get on an airplane with our family we have peace of mind that the best technology is available. 
   Yes, President Clinton wants to spend money on that, and apparently the Senator from Texas thinks that is wasteful. 
   I don't know how he gets back and forth to Texas. When I travel to Illinois, it is on an airplane. I want it safe for me and my family and for all of the other people who use it. 
   In the education area, the President's proposal would not only modernize our classrooms but increase the number of teachers so we have smaller class sizes. 
   A national literacy program that both Presidential candidates agree on so kids by the third grade can read and write: Is that a good proposal and a goal for the 21st century? I think so. But the Senator from Texas, obviously, takes exception. He thinks that is another wasteful Government expenditure. 
   He would rather give a tax cut to the wealthiest people in America. I think that is wrong. That is what elections are about.

   Mr. DURBIN. I am glad the Senator asked. As Senator BYRD carries the  Constitution in his pocket, I carry with me a card which has a record of what is happening under the Clinton-Gore administration. Record budget deficits have been erased. 
   In 1992, the deficit was a record $292 billion. The Congressional Budget Office said it was going to grow to $455 billion by the year 2000, this year. Instead, we have a projected $167 billion surplus, the third one in a row. That is $622 billion in savings not drained by the Government in 1 year alone. And we have had the largest paydown of debt in the history of the United States--$297 billion. 
   All the deficit hawks on the other side of the aisle hate to hear these numbers, but they are the facts. 
   Under the Clinton-Gore administration, we have addressed the deficit situation. We are no longer talking about a constitutional amendment to balance the budget but are moving in the right direction. The American people want us to continue doing that. 
   We have people who visit this Capitol at this time of year, usually classrooms from across America. These young men and women who come to watch this Senate and visit our offices deserve an America with a reduced national debt. That is the goal of the President's proposal and his budget. It is one not shared by George W. Bush. He believes we should give a massive and risky tax cut across the board. We believe targeted tax cuts make more sense and deficit and debt reduction are absolute priorities.

   Mr. DURBIN. I think the Senator from Nevada can remember that we accumulated more debt in the history of the United States with the election in 1980 of President Reagan until President Clinton, and about 1994 or 1995 started to turn the corner, than we had accumulated in the entire history of the United States, more debt than we had accumulated in our entire history. 
   We collect $1 billion in taxes every day to pay interest on the debt that we accumulated during the Reagan-Bush era. President Clinton has finally moved away from that. We are starting to reduce that debt, and we think that is the highest priority. But it isn't the highest priority of Gov. George W. Bush. He believes the highest priority is a tax cut--a tax cut for some of wealthiest people in this country. 
   We believe we should target the tax cut to the families who need it. For example, a lot of families send their kids to college. They know it is a very expensive undertaking. 
   We propose on the Democratic side that you be able to deduct from your taxes college education expenses. This gives a helping hand to middle-income families across America so that the kids will finish school with less debt, and maybe no debt. 
   I think that is a targeted tax cut that makes sense. It makes a lot more sense than a $50,000-a-year tax cut for somebody making $300,000 a year. That is the George W. Bush tax cut. 
   We also want to target the tax cut to help pay for long-term care. Families know when their parents and grandparents are elderly that it is expensive to care for them. They want to give them the best. It takes a lot from their savings. We give a tax cut for that purpose--a targeted tax cut to help pay for long-term care. That is a sensible approach. 
   We think the highest priority should be debt reduction. We are not the only ones who suggest it. For anyone who believes this is a partisan proposal, take a look at this particular article that appeared in the Washington Post. This is from the business section. Alan Greenspan, not known to be a Democrat, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board: ``Pay down the debt first.'' 
   That newspaper was obviously not delivered in Texas because neither the Senator who is speaking today on behalf of his amendment nor the Presidential candidate on the Republican side heard the news. Greenspan said debt reduction should be the highest priority--not in their book. From their point of view, the highest priority is making sure the wealthiest people in this country pay less in taxes. That to me doesn't make sense. Let us pay down this awful debt that has been accumulated during the Reagan-Bush years. 
   Let us try to put this behind us so future generations have more flexibility in their own lives; so that we have less demand for capital; and interest rates coming down. 
   So those who are following the debate understand where we are, I put forward on the floor the Bush tax cut asking the Democrats and Republicans to go on the record one way or the other. The Senator from Texas says: No. Let's try a substitute. He dreams up a gas tax increase and cannot point to one page in Vice President GORE's book that enumerates that increase, and he wants us to vote on that. 
   I encourage my friends on the floor to turn down the Gramm gas tax increase. 
   We don't need a $3 increase. Nobody on this side of the aisle called for it. 
   I think Senator GRAMM should understand at this point in time it would be devastating. That is what he wants to vote on because he doesn't want to vote on the Bush tax cut, which is well documented. That is painful, I am sure, but I think it is important we do it. 
   Back to the estate tax for a second. In 1995, approximately 2.3 million people died in America; 31,000 out of 2.3 million ended up paying the Federal estate tax, 1.37 percent. The vast majority of our Nation's citizens simply do not leave estates valued at $600,000 or more, which is the present annual tax threshold, which is going to increase to $1 million, which I support. 
   The Senator from Texas would have us believe everyone passing away has as their last act, before the undertaker wheels them out, filing a Federal tax form for the Federal estate tax. It doesn't happen. The vast majority, over 98 percent of the American people, don't pay this tax. Some of the wealthiest people in this country do. He thinks we should wage this Presidential campaign over the 1.37 percent of the population. I think that is a mistake. 
   I think, honestly, those who have done well in America and prospered and made millions of dollars and left huge estates owe something back to America. That is part of the cost of living and prospering in this country, as far as I am concerned. We see that differently. 
   The Senator wants to preserve and protect those in the highest income categories, give them the Bush tax cut, and turn his back on things such as education spending--which he thinks is wasteful government spending. I disagree. 
   There are some radicals on his side of the aisle who want to eliminate the Department of Education. That is a serious mistake. I am not going to put those words in the mouth of any single Senator, but we have heard it over and over from the other side of the aisle. They would take away the authority of the Department of Education to provide for the 5, 6, or 7 percent of Federal aid to education across America. I think that is a mistake, too. 
   The President understands, as most American families do, that education is critical for our future. If the Senator from Texas wants to walk away from this commitment to education, I think he is walking away from a commitment which is important for our children to make sure they have the skills and education not only to prosper in this Nation but to be able to compete in a global economy. He may think a tax cut for wealthy people is more important than making certain that our kids are well educated, but I disagree with that. I think most American families understand they get one chance to educate their kids, and they want to do it right.

   Mr. DURBIN. Yes, the Senator from Nevada is correct. Despite all the statements to the contrary, Federal taxes have been going down on American families and they have been held to the 1970 level. We have been making real progress in that regard. 
   What we have tried to do when the Democrats had a voice in the process is make sure that tax cuts went to working families. Those are the folks who need a helping hand. If there is an increased tax burden in this country, it comes primarily from State and local sources and from payroll taxes associated with the Medicare and Social Security programs which, quite honestly, we have to sustain until we address meaningful reform. 
   On that subject, let me add, President Clinton and Vice President GORE are talking about investing this surplus back into Social Security and back into Medicare to reduce their debt and to make certain those programs will be here for decades to come. The Republican side of the aisle does not want to address those issues, and they should. Instead, they want the George W. Bush tax cut. Instead of putting this money into debt reduction and strengthening Social Security and Medicare, providing for prescription drug benefits under Medicare, they would give a tax cut to the wealthiest people in our country. That is the clear choice in the Presidential campaign. 
   The Senator from Texas does not believe I should raise this issue on the floor of the Senate. He says since I have, it is open season for debate on it. I welcome the debate. For goodness sakes, if we cannot come to this floor and debate the issues that are central to the most important choice Americans will make in the year 2000 in the Presidential election, then this great deliberative body has lost its way. I think it is important that all Members come to the floor and be recorded on this vote. 
   I invite the Senator from Texas to withdraw his substitute amendment so he can have an up-or-down vote on the Bush tax cut. Surely GRAMM wants to go back to Texas and see your Governor and say: I stood by you. I was with you to the bitter end. I defended you against your critics. I am for the Bush tax cut. 
   Certainly you don't want to go back and say to your Governor: I didn't want to vote on your tax cut so I put up a substitute. I dreamed up an Al GORE gas tax. I did my darnedest to avoid being on the record. 
   I am certain Texas pride demands standing by your Governor, as many on your side of the aisle, I am sure, want to do. In order to do that, you have to take away the substitute amendment. You have to face the music. You have to understand that if you are going to buy this tax cut from George W. Bush, you have to go on the record and do it and not just make speeches when you are off the Senate floor. 
   I yield back the time offered to me by Senator REID under the resolution.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I offer this amendment and urge the Senate to go on record opposing the George W. Bush tax cut. It is a risky proposal. It threatens our economy. It raids the Social Security trust fund. It provides no funding protection for Social Security or Medicare. It eliminates needed investments in education. Sadly, the tax cuts go primarily to the wealthiest people in America. The Bush tax cut is a $50,000 tax cut if you make over $300,000 a year. For 60 percent of American families, it is a tax cut of $249. 
   Some of my Republican colleagues who say they have endorsed George W. Bush and his plan have a chance to follow the admonition of that noted political philosopher, Tammy Wynette, who said: ``Stand by your man.'' But for those who want this economy to continue to prosper, and America to continue to be strong, vote ``no'' on the George W. Bush tax cut.

   Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to make my statement. 
   Senator GRAMM came to the floor and waved Vice President GORE's book, saying it calls for a $3 tax increase but could not point out the page. It is not in there, nor is there a statement made by the Vice President to that effect. 
   Because of the political pain my Republican colleagues have experienced in just voting against the tax program which Governor George W. Bush proposed, they are asking Members to vote against a tax program which Vice President GORE has never proposed. 
   This is easy. Vote yes; save a copy of the last roll call.

   Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Nevada. April 20, 1999, is a day we will remember for a long time in America. That was the day of the Columbine High School shooting. Remember when you first heard about it? You remember the first time you saw the scenes on television, with the high school kids running away from the school? There was one poor young man who had been shot, dragging himself out of a window, trying to escape the shooting taking place. 
   America was stunned. Colorado was stunned. This Congress was stunned. We responded by passing legislation, with the help of Vice President GORE, which did three things to try to reduce gun violence in America. 
   First, a background check at gun shows so that the people who buy guns at those shows would be subject to the same questions and inquiries as those who go to gun dealers. We don't want to sell guns to criminals. We don't want to sell them to kids. We certainly don't want to see gun shows as a loophole for selling guns to those who shouldn't own them. 
   Second, trigger locks so if guns are going to be stored they are stored safely and securely so a young child can't pick it up and hurt himself or others. 
   Third, the prohibition against those high capacity ammo clips that were being brought in from overseas that turn an ordinary gun into a dangerous, murderous weapon. 
   Three very sensible changes for gun safety in America. It only passed because Vice President GORE showed up on the floor to break the tie. But we thought the Congress had learned a lesson from Columbine, not just for the Members of Congress and families across America, but for the students who go to school across America and want to be in safe buildings. 
   That bill passed the Senate, and it has been sitting over in the House of Representatives in a conference committee that refuses to call it for consideration. My colleague, Senator JACK REED of Rhode Island, believes that on the anniversary of Columbine we owe it, not only to the families in Colorado but across the Nation, to consider this important legislation. I support him completely. Close the loopholes, keep guns out of the hands of criminals and kids. 
   Second, tomorrow I will be offering an amendment which addresses the gun issue from a different perspective. There are some who say: Oh, you don't need to close the loopholes. I disagree with them. I think we need to close them. They say, instead, we need more enforcement. Let's have people who are going to investigate and prosecute gun criminals. Put them in jail. 
   Do you know what? I agree with them. But I think we need both. Close the loopholes and make sure we have the resources for enforcement of gun laws. The amendment I will offer tomorrow, with Senator SCHUMER of New York, my seatmate here on the floor of the Senate, provides the President's initiative: 500 new ATF investigators to look after the gun dealers across America, to make certain they are not selling guns to the wrong people. 
   Are they? You bet they are. Out of 80,000 gun dealers across America, we have traced gun crimes and found that the guns for 57 percent of the criminals in America come from 1,000 gun dealers out of 80,000. What it tells us is the overwhelming percentage of gun dealers across America are obeying the law. But there are bad people out there who are licensed gun dealers who are breaking the law and giving guns to criminals who commit crimes with those guns and harass us in our neighborhoods and our schools. My amendment creates more enforcement authority to keep those gun dealers from breaking the law. 
   Next, more prosecutors. It is not enough to arrest somebody. You need a prosecuting attorney at the State, local, or Federal level, who is going to put that person behind bars. I say to the National Rifle Association and all the people who speak for them, if we are going to have enforcement, vote for the Durbin amendment so you have the resources at ATF and across the Nation to make sure gun laws are enforced. 
   It is a complementary approach: Close the loopholes, increase the enforcement, and let us hope in the near term, in the near future, we can say this Congress responded in a way that answers to American families that we heard the cries of the parents and the families at Columbine and we responded to them. We should not leave ourselves in a position where we back off from our responsibility because of any special interest group. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator for yielding. I stand in complete support of his amendment, an amendment very similar to the one offered by my colleague, the Senator from California, in the Budget Committee. 
   It should be kept in context that this budget resolution, without the Roth amendment, assumes $1.2 billion in royalties from the sale of oil from drilling in the Arctic Wildlife National Refuge. 
   I want to say to Members of the Senate that the reason we are debating this is because the price of gasoline is increasing in the United States. People are more sensitized to the cost of fuel and energy and the impact it has on businesses, families, and individuals. 
   Those who have been salivating for decades for an opportunity to drill in this wildlife refuge in Alaska have jumped at the chance to assume that we are so consumed by the increase in energy prices that we will cast aside any concern for the environment and the legacy which we should leave to future generations. 
   Senator ROTH is right. We should not be drilling in ANWR. We have to consider the fact that on the North Slope, 95 percent is already open to exploration. The 5 percent on the Coastal Plain that we have set aside is to protect what we have identified as a legitimate, important wildlife refuge. 
   Oil companies and their supporters can't wait to drill in that wildlife refuge. I think it is wrong. I think Senator ROTH is right, as Senator BOXER was in committee. 
   We should say unequivocally in a bipartisan fashion on the floor of the Senate that we need an energy policy, but we do not need to walk in and desecrate a wildlife refuge designed to be preserved for future generations. 
   This last Saturday in Belleville, IL, I paid $1.39 a gallon for regular gasoline. I then drove 100 miles to Springfield, IL, and paid $1.49. Yes, prices have increased. Yes, I am sure for families of limited means and some businesses there is sacrifice attached to it. But we shouldn't use this as a catalyst or a reason to run headlong into this effort to desecrate this important environmental refuge. 
   We need to face the reality that America needs an energy policy, and we shouldn't wait for a gasoline price crisis to drive us to the point to develop one. Such an energy policy is going to include a lot of things, such as looking for responsible areas for oil exploration and development; also, of course, energy efficiency not only in our automobiles but in virtually everything that we use involving energy. Of course, it will lessen our dependence on foreign oil sources. We need to look for alternative fuels. 
   This is an important, complicated but a necessary national debate. 
   This quick fix of drilling in ANWR in the belief that it is going to bring down gasoline prices is wrong on two counts. 
   First, it is not likely to bring them down, if at all, until years from now. 
   Second, it really avoids the obvious responsibility we have to preserve this important refuge. 
   Senator ROTH is offering an amendment which is consistent 
   with a member of his party who served in the United States as President many years ago by the name of Theodore Roosevelt, who said in his efforts to preserve the environment:  
   We must ask ourselves if we are leaving for future generations an environment that is as good or better than what we found.  
   Senator ROTH's amendment says this Senate will go on record leaving a legacy for future generations in the name and in the memory of Theodore Roosevelt, ``as good or better than what we found,'' that we will not allow this exploitation and exploration of this valuable and fragile natural resource. 
   I stand in complete support of this amendment. 
   I yield the remainder of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the hour is late and I have a special sensitivity to the fact that many of the staff people have been here for a long time, and I know we will return to this amendment and debate first thing in the morning. I will make my remarks mercifully brief and just alert the Members of the Senate and those who follow this debate of the nature of the amendment I am offering. 
   I think this amendment goes to the heart of politics, the best part of politics. It goes to a clash of ideas, a difference of opinion, a true choice for the Members of the Senate and for the people of the United States because the amendment I offer has become the cornerstone of the Presidential debate for the year 2000. 
   The two candidates who are the likely nominees of their party, George W. Bush and Vice President AL GORE, have one marked difference. Governor Bush has proposed a substantial--some would say massive and risky--tax cut. Vice President GORE believes that, as do many of the Members of the Senate and the House, with this surplus we anticipate in the coming years, our first priority should be the reduction of the national debt so that our children don't bear that burden, and that we don't have to generate in taxes every day of every year the interest payments on old debt. 
   Furthermore, Vice President GORE and many of us believe that we should take our surplus and dedicate it to preserving Social Security, making certain that Medicare will be there for many years to come. He believes, as many of us do, that we should have targeted tax cuts well within our means, consistent with our goal of reducing the national debt, and that we should then have specific spending priorities for education and health care. 
   On the other side of the coin, there is quite a different proposal. Governor Bush has suggested perhaps the largest tax cut that has been proposed in recent memory. Every politician applauds a tax cut, and most of us like to offer one. But certainly we don't want to do something that is unrealistic. I suggest to my colleagues that the Bush tax cut being offered in the Presidential campaign is not only unrealistic; it is risky. And if we are not careful, if we follow his campaign pledge and his advice, we could jeopardize the economic growth that we have seen over the past 7 years. 
   Twice in the Senate Budget Committee, I allowed my colleagues--both Republicans and Democrats--to go on record in reference to the Bush tax cut. I thought it was only fair that the Republican members of the Senate Budget Committee would have that opportunity to stand by their Presidential candidate and the cornerstone of his campaign, the Bush tax cut because, you see, the Senate budget resolution we are considering today, proposed by Senate Republican leaders, doesn't include Governor Bush's tax cut. 
   I think this is a terrible oversight and omission that the standard bearer of the Republican Party would come forward with a vision of America that includes a tax cut, and for some reason the Senate Republicans don't want to include it in their proposal for the course of action in America for the next 5 or 10 years. 
   So twice in the Senate Budget Committee I offered the Bush tax cut for an up-or-down vote, take it or leave it, stand by your man, the Republicans with the Democrats, make it clear you disagree. 
   I was disappointed to find that my Republican colleagues in the Senate Budget Committee did not want to go on record when it came to the tax cut proposed by the standard bearer of the Republican Party, the possible Presidential nominee, Governor George W. Bush. I think there is good reason for that. I will explain it in a minute. 
   But I said in the committee that if the Senate Republicans in the Budget Committee didn't want to vote for Bush's tax cut in the committee, I would feel duty bound to offer that same opportunity to all of the Members of the Senate here on the floor. After all, as we debate important policy questions such as funding and education and whether we are going to drill in ANWR, these are policy questions on which we go on record. We establish our positions by our votes. 
   I am hoping by offering this amendment that the Senate will go on record. The Republican Members have their chance with this amendment to stand up for the tax cut proposed by their Presidential candidate. I think they should vote no. Above all, I hope they don't continue to duck this vote. They cannot duck this vote any more than Governor Bush can duck the responsibility to explain his tax cut and what it means to America. 
   Take a look at where we have been in this Nation over the past 7 years and the progress we have made. Record budget deficits have been erased. We have had the largest paydown of debt in the history of the United States with $297 billion in debt reduction. We are on the right track. We have seen the smallest Government in over three decades while we have increased key investments in education and in training for the people of this country. The typical family has seen their tax burden lowered to a level where you would have to reach back to the 1970s to find a comparison. Investment has boomed. 
   Take a look at the investment that is mirrored by our stock exchanges and our investments across America and you will see that people have been putting money into companies for growth. It has paid off. Unemployment is the lowest in decades, the welfare rolls the lowest in decades, inflation under control, housing starts at record levels, and business creation at record levels. 
   Frankly, everything you like to see that is positive in our economy has been moving forward under the Clinton-Gore administration. Of course,  they can't take complete credit for that, but they can take some credit for it. They would certainly be blamed if we were back in the recessions of previous Presidents. 
   We have to say as well that some credit should go to the Federal Reserve because they have tried to quell the flames and forces of inflation, and they have been very effective in doing so. The Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, deserves credit for his leadership. I was happy recently to vote to reconfirm him for another term as Chairman of that 
   important body. 
   But, on balance, most Americans believe we are headed in the right direction. 
   One American who apparently does not believe that is the Republican candidate for President because George W. Bush has proposed a dramatic change and a drastic shift in America's economic policy. He said we should take the surplus we see coming because of a strong economy and dedicate it to a massive and risky tax cut primarily for the wealthiest people in America. 
   If you take a close look at what this means, this chart shows our economy moving forward as a great ocean liner and a $168 billion proposed tax cut from the Presidential candidate, George W. Bush, that masks an iceberg of a tax cut that is so large, it would exceed the available surplus and force us to move into the Social Security trust fund to pay for it. 
   Our fear, and the fear of Chairman Greenspan and many others, is that such a tax cut at this moment in history would fire up an economy, create inflation, force increases in interest rates, and, frankly, doom the economic expansion we have seen for over 108 months, a record in the history of the United States. 
   Take a look at what the Bush tax cut would cost over a 5-year period of time based on research by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. It would be a $483 billion tax cut, and over 10 years it would be a $1.3 trillion tax cut. 
   What would be the impact of a $1.3 trillion tax cut on the Social Security surplus? As you can see, the non-Social Security surplus is $171 billion. That is what we can consider using for such things as debt reduction, targeted tax cuts, and expenditures on education. But George W. Bush would take $483 billion out for his tax cut. You may note that is far in excess of the amount that is available outside of the non-Social Security surplus. 
   The obvious conclusion is, to pay for the George W. Bush tax cut, you would have to raid Social Security. I find we have decided on a bipartisan basis that won't happen, that we will protect the Social Security trust fund. 
   That is why I believe the Republican Members of the Senate, if they share that belief, as I do, that Social Security should be protected, should vote against the George W. Bush tax cut. My amendment gives them a chance to go on record against this tax cut to make it clear that they want to protect Social Security and avoid a raid on the Social Security trust fund to make up the $312 billion difference in the first 5 years we would see if we followed George W. Bush's plan. 
   The obvious question is whether this Bush tax cut is fair and whether it would help American families. As I said earlier, all of us would like to see tax cuts. We would certainly like to go back to families in Illinois and across America and say to them, We can give you a break to help pay for your bills. Most of them would welcome it. But if you take a close look at the proposal from George W. Bush for his tax cut, you will see that most working families and middle-income families in America won't even notice a change. 
   If you notice, the bottom 60 percent of wage earners in America, those making below $39,300 a year, will see an average tax cut of about $249 a year, a little over $20 a month. That comes down to 75 cents a day they might see by way of George W. Bush's tax cut--60 percent of American families. But in the 
   top 1 percent, the people who are making over $300,000 a year already, the George W. Bush tax cut is worth over $50,000 a year. Not only does this tax cut raid Social Security but the beneficiaries of it turn out to be wealthiest people in this country. Frankly, that isn't fair. 
   If we are going to jeopardize our economic growth, if we are going to in some way avoid the debt reduction, which most economists agree is important for the growth of America, you would think a tax cut on the table would at least benefit most American families. Honestly, it doesn't or, if it does, it is so small, they wouldn't notice it. Twenty dollars a month? That is what 60 percent of the working families of America would see. As I mentioned earlier, it would be at great expense and peril to the Social Security trust fund and others. 
   As I offer this amendment, I am hoping we can have a bipartisan consensus to tell Governor George Bush to go back to the drawing board, to come forward with a proposal, if you will, that is consistent with continuing the economic growth in this country and that in fact identifies as the highest priority the reduction of our national debt and doesn't jeopardize Social Security. Frankly, his tax cut does. That is why I think this Senate should go on record in opposition to it on a bipartisan basis. 
   There is a lot of criticism of current political campaigns across America: They are too long; they are too nasty; they are too negative. And virtually all of those criticisms are true. But if our political campaigns in this democracy are of any value, they are because we have a true clash of ideas, a difference of opinions, and a real choice for voters. 
   When it comes to the George W. Bush tax cut, there couldn't be a clearer choice. 
   I hope my colleagues in the Senate will accept their responsibility, step up, and say whether they endorse the proposal of the Presidential candidate on the Republican side for this tax cut or whether they believe, as Chairman Greenspan does, Vice President GORE, and most American people do, that it is an unwise course of action. 
   I understand, as most people do, that there are a lot of differences of opinion in the course of a campaign. But Governor Bush has been very specific in spelling out his tax cut. In order to achieve his tax cut, you not only have to raid Social Security, but when you go in the outyears beyond 5 years, to achieve it you have to cut dramatically in spending on very important programs for America. 
   If that is something which the Republican side of the aisle wants to embrace, so be it. I, frankly, think it is shortsighted to take over $3.7 million low-income women and children off the WIC Program, a nutrition program for children and pregnant women so their babies are born healthy and get off to a good start. 
   If you follow through on the George W. Bush tax plan, you see massive spending cuts in key programs such as WIC. There is a $4.8 billion cutback in the Pell Grant Program, meaning 784,000 college students who receive grants--not loans, because they are low income--would see those disappear. 
   Mr. President, 400,000 kids, $2.9 billion cuts in Head Start--does it make sense to offer a tax cut of $50,000 a year to some of the wealthiest people in America and at the same time cut back and eliminate 400,000 kids from the Head Start Program? 
   The community development block grant programs and so many other job training assistance and support programs would be decimated by the proposal of the Presidential candidate on the Republican side, Governor Bush. 
   I believe if we are to stand on the record for this Bush tax cut plan, we have to answer to the voters in Illinois and across the Nation why we are prepared to threaten the future of Social Security and Medicare; why would we make deep cuts in Medicare spending; why would we fail to invest in debt reduction and help these important programs to provide the largest tax cuts in history to the richest people in our Nation. 
   Eliminating the estate tax primarily benefits millionaires. I asked a group who came to my office recently who said they wanted to see the estate tax eliminated: What percentage of estates in America pay the tax? They didn't know. The answer is 1.3 percent. It is a very small percentage. It comes down to the fact that if we are going to eliminate those taxes on the richest people in America, we should only do it if we can justify it. I don't believe Governor Bush can justify it in terms of the benefits that it would mean for the rest of the people who live in this country. 
   I hope we will not jeopardize our economic prosperity. I hope we will follow  the model that has been suggested by Vice President GORE. I sincerely hope my colleagues in the Senate will not duck this opportunity to vote on the George W. Bush tax cut plan. If they are proud of their candidate, if they believe in his platform, if they share his vision, for goodness sake, have the courage to stand up and vote yes; if you disagree with his position, at least have the courage to go on the record and say so. 
   I hope, as in the Budget Committee, we don't run into the same experience on the floor where the Republican majority refuses to go on the record when it comes to the cornerstone of the campaign of the Republican Presidential candidate George W. Bush. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, very much. 
   Mr. President, I thank Senator LAUTENBERG of New Jersey, who is on the Budget Committee. This will be the last budget resolution he will manage on the floor. He is retiring from the Senate. We will miss him. He has been a leader on so many issues. I have worked with him on issues over the years such as gun control. He has certainly been a leader for his State and the Nation, and he has taken on a tough job in working on the Budget Committee. 
   We all acknowledge that the chairman of the committee, Senator DOMENICI, is a man we respect very much. We may disagree on political issues. We find him as a colleague to be a real professional and a man truly dedicated to reducing the budget deficit and keeping the fiscal house in order. We may see the world a little differently, but we have a high respect for Senator DOMENICI. 
   I will miss Senator LAUTENBERG. He is a great friend and has been a great colleague over the years. I am happy he is here for this important and vital battle. 
   The budget resolution that we debate may be one of the toughest to sell to the American people because it is a dry subject. We are talking about percentages--billions of dollars in appropriations, and money in the outyears. Pretty soon, you are lost in the sauce trying to figure out what in the world these people are talking about. 
   Does this have any relevance or importance to the lives of ordinary people across America? Should families even pay attention to it? If they are watching on C-SPAN, they are probably clicking away now. As Billy Crystal said the other day, he liked the movie ``The Sixth Sense.'' He said: I see dead 
   people too. I see them on C-SPAN. 
   I think people who watch C-SPAN will understand that we are very much alive. They understand the issues we are debating today are very important to them. 
   Take a look at this little graphic prepared on the Democratic side. We have a great ship of state, the ``U.S. Economy.'' 
   Take a look at the U.S. economy over the past 8 or 9 years. You will see that an amazing thing has occurred. 
   We have seen the greatest economic growth in the history of America, with terrific employment, new housing, new businesses, and inflation under control. We have seen our debt coming down at a time when many people have given up, thinking that the national debt was just going to increase. 
   These are all positive things--a stock market which was at 3,000 with the Dow Jones average when President Clinton took office. It is now over 10,000. It may be over 11,000, I haven't checked. All of these things are good news about the American economy. 
   This great ship of state sails on with the U.S. economy stronger than it has ever been in recorded history. This is not political hyperbole. This is a fact, and America's families know it. They know we are moving in the right direction in this country. Above all, they want Congress to get out of the way. Don't stop this economy from moving forward. 
   Let me tell you that this budget resolution we are debating on the floor of the Senate today is going to get in the way of that economy. It is going to be an obstacle to our economic progress. 
   Look at this looming iceberg. Does this remind you of a movie? Here you see the tip of the iceberg--a $168 billion Republican tax cut. But look below the surface. This Republican tax scheme is much larger. 
   Why would politicians be for tax cuts? Every American family would applaud a tax cut. We would all like to have one. It helps you get by. But if you ask what that tax cut will cost, a lot of people in America back off and say: Wait a minute. It doesn't make a lot of sense for us to be giving tax breaks to the wealthiest people in America and jeopardizing the growth in our economy. You see, what the Republicans do in their budget resolution is couple it with a tax cut plan over the next 5 years that literally gobbles up every single dollar of surplus that we have so there is no money available for us to spend on other things that America knows we need. 
   Does America know we need better schools and better education? You bet we do. Every parent, every grandparent, and every family knows that. The Republican plan shortchanges that. They take the money away from the cut. They say: No, we would rather give it as a tax cut to wealthy people than put it in education. 
   Let's ask another question. Would American families want to see a prescription drug benefit under the Medicare program for our parents and grandparents? You bet we would. We understand that a lot of senior citizens are choosing between food and medicine. They can't afford to buy the drugs to keep themselves healthy and strong, out of the hospital, and out of the nursing home. 
   We believe on the Democratic side--and the President agrees--that we should take a part of our surplus and put it into a prescription drug benefit so that the elderly and disabled across America have that peace of mind. Yet if you look at the Republican budget proposal, the money is not there for this prescription drug benefit. Instead, it is there for this tax scheme that can derail the economy. 
   Not only that, you have to ask yourself whether or not we are dedicating the resources we need for the growth of our country for investment in infrastructure and people. That really counts. 
   This Republican tax scheme, which is the cornerstone of this budget resolution we are debating, is bad policy for this country. Don't take my word for it. Don't take the word of any Democrat for it. Take the word of the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan. He tells us the No. 1 priority for the good of America and its economy is reducing our national debt--not a tax cut for the wealthiest people. 
   This tax cut from the Senate Republicans is a mere shadow of the tax cut proposed by Governor George W. Bush in his Presidential campaign. It is a tax cut that, frankly, goes to the wealthiest people in America. It is worse than the one proposed by the Senate Republicans in this budget resolution. This is the George W. Bush tax cut to the top 1 percent of wage earners in America. The George W. Bush tax cut will provide a $50,000 a year tax cut. If one happens to be in the lower 60 percent of wage earners, the tax cut is $249 a year--20 bucks a month. 
   I gave the Senate Republicans on the Budget Committee two opportunities to vote for George W. Bush's tax cut in committee. They say they want him for President. He says it is the most important thing in his campaign. One would think the Senate Republicans would rush to be in his corner when it comes to standing for this tax cut. Do you know what. On two different occasions they tried to avoid, and did avoid, even having a recorded vote on their standard bearer's tax cut. They don't want to be on record in favor of that tax cut. They know it eats up all of our surplus that goes into the Social Security trust fund. 
   At this moment in time, the Senate Budget Republicans have denied George W. Bush twice. I will give him another chance on the Senate floor in the next few days. Will the Senate Budget Republicans deny George W. Bush thrice? We will find out. I hope they come to their senses and understand they should go on record in opposition to it. 
   America wants to spend money on things important for our future, such  as education, health care, training the next generation of workers, making certain this economy keeps moving along. A lot of people have prospered under this economy, but a lot of working families are just starting to believe things are getting better for them. They do not want to derail the economic progress we have seen under the Clinton-Gore administration. They want America to continue to move forward. They want America to continue to grow. I believe that is the right track to follow. 
   I yield the floor to my colleague from Oregon. I hope to get another chance to address the budget resolution which should be defeated by the Senate so we can continue the economic progress we have seen in America.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak today about the dramatically deteriorating situation in Belarus. As of Sunday, March 26, more than 100 opposition activists remained in custody after a rally on Saturday that turned from a peaceful event into a demonstration that saw police clubbing protesters with nightsticks, hitting journalists covering the event and sending armored cars into Central Minsk. More than 500 people were detained, most of whom were not formally charged until Monday. This is only one of the examples of how, in Belarus, the Lukashenka regime continues to try to suppress the will of the people. 
   In November, Senator CAMPBELL and I introduced a resolution condemning the Lukashenka regime and its actions towards the country. The sad reality is that Belarus is being left behind while the rest of Europe is building a foundation of democratic governance, respect for human rights, and the rule of law. 
   Since 1996, President Lukashenka has been responsible for numerous unconstitutional steps. He unilaterally extended his term until 2001 after he promised to hold democratic elections in 1999. He replaced the 13th Supreme Soviet with a rubberstamp parliament and he rewrote the country's constitution. 
   Belarus has turned into a country where those who choose to participate in civil society by speaking truth to power must do so at great risk to their freedom, and even their lives, under Lukashenka's rule. Two prominent opposition figures--General Yuri Zakharenko and Viktor Gonchar--as well as another associate, Anatoly Krasovsky, have disappeared. Many of the people arrested on March 25 as well as other peaceful protesters were members of the opposition. 
   Belarus' economy is apparently imploding and neighboring countries, Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia, are concerned about regional instability. 
   Our resolution condemns the arrest of opposition figures and the disappearance of others; calls for a dialogue between Lukashenka and the opposition; calls for the restoration of a democratically-elected government and democratic institutions; calls on the U.S. President to fund travel by Belarusian opposition figures and non-governmental organizations in Belarus; and supports information flows into Belarus. 
   Belarus is not making progress. We must do what we can to sustain the remarkable progress of the other countries that have transformed themselves into fully democratic market democracies, and encourage the development of a democracy in Belarus.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I came to the floor to address an issue which is  pending before the Senate today, and that is the decision to write a budget resolution for the next fiscal year, a blueprint for our spending. 
   Just a little over a week ago, Billy Crystal, the comedian, did the Oscars presentation show, the Academy Awards. He was referring to a movie called ``The Sixth Sense,'' where there was a little boy who had some supernatural power to see dead people. Billy Crystal, in one of the best jokes of the evening, said: I see dead people all the time. I watch C-SPAN. 
   Of course, it was a joke at our expense, serving in the Congress. But it must be true for a lot of people that when they tune in and listen to our debates and, of course, watch the committee deliberations, they have to wonder: Isn't it more exciting? Don't these people do something that might be more entertaining? 
   It may not hit a high entertainment level, but I think the debate currently underway on the budget resolution is exciting in terms of spelling out America's priorities for its future because in a room just a block or two away from here, there will be a decision made on spending for America that can literally affect every family in the country. It is an important decision. 
   Part of that decision comes down to the major issue in the Presidential campaign. Governor George W. Bush, who appears to be the likely candidate on the Republican side, has made the cornerstone of his campaign a massive tax cut. In my estimation, it is a very risky tax cut. He believes the surplus we are generating now, because of a strong economy and a decision to cut back on the deficit, should go into a massive tax cut. 
   On the other side of the equation, President Clinton and Vice President GORE believe, as I do, that is foolish and reckless and it could endanger the economic growth we have seen over the last 7 years. Don't just take our word for it. Our colleague, Republican Senator JOHN MCCAIN, a candidate in that same Republican Presidential primary, said of George W. Bush's tax cut that it was not the thing to do; it was, in fact, bad policy. He said it more artfully, but that was his conclusion. 
   Chairman Alan Greenspan--no partisan, a man who has led the Federal Reserve and helped this economy to develop and prosper--has said it is the wrong thing to do. 
   The George W. Bush tax cut approach really overlooks the most important thing, which is debt reduction in America. Two-thirds of the American people agree with Mr. Greenspan, Senator MCCAIN, and the Democratic Party, that we should take our surplus and dedicate it to debt reduction, strengthening Social Security and Medicare, have targeted tax cuts--limited, but targeted where they are really needed--and then spend money on health care and education for the families across America. 
   Well, the Budget Committee is now debating this. In an hour or two, when I return there as a member, I will allow my colleagues on the committee an opportunity to decide whether or not they want to vote for the George W. Bush tax cut or they believe there is a better way. Now it may put some of my Republican colleagues on the spot. But politics is about choices. We make choices every day in the well when we cast votes, when we announce whether we are for or against a bill or whether we will sponsor it or vote for it. My colleagues on the Budget Committee will have a choice. 
   I think, frankly, they ought to reflect for a moment on some realities. Take a look at what has happened in America since 1992. From the election of President Clinton up to the year 1999, in virtually every income category in America, we have seen rising incomes. This economy is moving forward. Take a look at unemployment. In 1992, it was 7.5 percent. In America today, it is 4.2 percent. The No. 1 complaint of businesses across Illinois is: We can't find skilled workers. I am sorry for that situation; we are trying to address it. But what a welcome change from the days when we had double-digit unemployment. 
   We have taken, under the Clinton-Gore administration, a step forward in putting Americans to work. Record home ownership: 64 percent of Americans owned homes at the end of 1992. The number is up to 67 percent now. I don't have the chart to show 
   it, but business creation is hitting record levels as well. Inflation is down. The economy is moving forward. 
   Now the obvious question is: Shall we change things? 
   We believe the tax cuts that should be enacted are limited and targeted, not massive tax cuts that would go to wealthy people. If we are going to have tax cuts, let's help families with an elderly parent. The President proposed that. Let's expand education so if you have a child in college, you can deduct all your college education expenses up to $10,000. That is going to help some families pay for the college education expenses the kids face. A bipartisan proposal to eliminate the marriage penalty--we need that. Let's help people prepare for retirement with new accounts for saving. Let's expand the earned-income tax credit. These things are consistent with bringing down the debt and strengthening Social Security and Medicare. 
   Look at what the other side proposes in the George W. Bush tax cut, which is the cornerstone of his campaign; it goes to the wealthiest people in America. 
   Fairness is an important question when it comes to Government policy. If you happen to be earning over $300,000 a year--and you know who you are out there--George W. Bush thinks you need a $50,000-a-year tax cut. I think you can get by without it if you are making more than $300,000 a year. Frankly, it troubles me that the bottom 60 percent of wage earners in America, people making less than $39,300 a year, get a measly $249 from the George W. Bush tax cut. 
   When you take a look at that, you have to ask yourself, why would we jeopardize our economic growth, forswear an opportunity to bring down our debt and reduce the burden of paying interest on that debt for our children, why would we jeopardize our economy--in the estimation of Chairman Greenspan--for a tax cut for the wealthiest people in this country? 
   This is a further illustration of people making incomes of $31,000 a year--$501 in tax cuts, and 60 percent of the people are going to see very little tax relief. Those with higher income figures will see dramatic increases. 
   When you look at the tax cut and what it means, the sad reality is that you cannot reach the tax cuts proposed by the Republicans without raiding the Social Security trust fund. Oh, they say, of course you can. All you have to do is freeze spending. 
   Does anyone really believe we will freeze spending on the military, that we won't give the men and women in uniform a pay raise? Does anybody believe we should deny to everyone who works for the Federal Government any kind of cost-of-living adjustment for the next 5 or 10 years in order to pay for a tax cut that gives $30,000 or $50,000 in tax breaks to wealthy Americans? That is not going to happen. 
   Even under Republican Congresses, we have increased spending in budgets by about 3 percent a year. It reflects inflation plus a little bit. But now they would have us believe that is no longer the case, that we can somehow, in the next 5 or 10 years, not provide any additional spending in a lot of key areas to pay for what I consider to be a very risky tax plan. 
   It will, in fact, raid Social Security. Take a look at this chart, for example. The Bush tax cut would raid Social Security trust funds to the tune over 5 years of $483 billion; the Republican budget plan, $150 billion. I thought we kind of reached an agreement around here, a bipartisan agreement, that the Social Security trust fund was off limits, that we weren't going to get into it, we were going to protect it for future generations, and we were going to keep Social Security strong. Sadly, that is not the case. 
   Mr. President, one last issue I want to raise, which I will offer as an amendment, is the question about violent crime and gun crime in this country. There is a breakdown in the debate. Some people believe, as I do, that we should close loopholes so criminals, convicts, and children cannot get their hands on guns through gun shows and other means; that we should have trigger locks to keep guns safe; that we should close the loopholes. Others argue we should have more enforcement; that we have plenty of laws, let's enforce them. I, frankly, believe we need both--close the loopholes and better enforcement.  
   Look at the Republican budget now being presented to the Senate. Hard as it may be to believe, this Republican budget is going to cut the 900 FBI agents proposed by President Clinton. It is going to reduce, as well, the number of personnel in the Drug Enforcement Agency. It is going to reduce by over 400 the proposal by the President to put more guards at the borders to stop drugs. It completely eliminates the President's proposal for 500 new ATF agents to keep an eye on gun dealers who are selling to criminals. The President proposes 1,000 new prosecutors for enforcement, the same enforcement you heard Charlton Heston, Wayne LaPierre, and other folks on that side talk about. We need more enforcement, and the Republican bill doesn't provide a penny for this Presidential initiative for more enforcement. 
   You can't have it both ways. Your rhetoric has to catch up with reality. The Budget Committee room is a dance studio where we have the Republican majority side-stepping the George W. Bush tax cut, saying, we are not sure we want to go with that--a Texas two-step if I have ever seen one--and waltzing away from a commitment for more enforcement to stop gun crime in America. 
   That isn't going to wash, folks. People across America will look at this and say that is not a recipe for America's future, it is a recipe for disaster--on the economic front and when it comes to bringing peace to our neighborhoods and schools. 
   So I certainly hope those who watch C-SPAN will not be lulled to sleep, as Billy Crystal suggested, but will, rather, see there are some pretty important issues being developed and debated. I hope before this all ends, we will stick with the economic plan that moves America forward, that provides opportunity for more and more Americans, for businesses and for home ownership, that we will dedicate ourselves to a sensible reduction in our debt rather than a risky, dangerous, and massive tax cut, as Governor Bush has proposed. 
   I hope we will follow Chairman Greenspan's advice and keep this economy moving in such a way that we create opportunity for everybody. 
   When it comes to gun safety, let's do both. Let's close the gun show loophole. Let's have trigger locks for the safety of guns. Let's not let the Sunday morning talk show rhetoric about enforcement die by Sunday evening. On Monday through Friday when we are in session, that rhetoric should be very much alive. I sincerely hope that during the course of this debate we can put together a bipartisan majority to achieve it. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the annual March 25th celebration of Greek Independence Day commemorates the independence of Greece from 400 years of oppression under the Ottoman Empire. Greeks have made great contributions to the world in literature, philosophy, mathematics and government. The names of Homer, Socrates, Euclid and Alexander echo through the pages of world history. It was the Greek people who started the Olympic Games saying there was more honor in peaceful competition than in wars of conquest. The greatest gift Greek people have given the world, though, is a simple yet powerful idea that was born over 2,000 years ago. It is the idea that a nation's power lies in the hands of its people. The Athenian republic was the world's first democracy, a fact that all free nations must respect. 
   The bonds that join the United States and Greece are deep and long lasting. Our fore-fathers recognized the spirit and idealism of ancient Greece when drafting our Constitution. Forty-five years after our own revolution for independence, Greece freed itself with its own revolutionary struggle. 
   In every major international conflict of this century, Greece has been a proud ally of the United States. Honoring this day will pay special tribute to those Greek men and women who gave their lives for the common cause of freedom. Greek-Americans can especially take pride in their ancestors' sacrifice. The many Greek sons and daughters who have come to the United States have worked honorably in all areas of American life, including public service. Greek culture flourishes in American cities, adding to our country's rich diversity. 
   I hope Greece will resolve its differences with its Turkish neighbors over Cyprus. I hope all people in the region share in America's belief that this can be achieved through diplomacy instead of violence. Let us be mindful of the olive tree and the Olympic flame, the great symbols of Greece, and remember, too, that they are also symbols of peace.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to comment on the remarks made by my friend and colleague from North Dakota, Senator DORGAN. I know his feelings are heartfelt about this issue. I know he speaks from the heart when he tells us about these terrible tragedies to which many families in America have been subjected. I hope he feels, as I do, that when it comes to violent crime, crimes involving guns and weapons, sexual assault, and the like, we should have no tolerance for that conduct. And when it comes to sentencing those responsible for the crimes, we should do it in a manner to protect American citizens and families across the board. I agree with him on that score. I think if we are ever going to stop the plague of violent crime in this country, we have to deal with enforcement of the law in a realistic way to protect families. 
   Two weeks ago, I was stuck in an airport in our State capital, my hometown of Springfield, which tends to be part of the job description of being a Senator. The director of the Department of Corrections, Don Snyder, came up and said hello, and we had a chance to chat about incarceration in my home State of Illinois. 
   There are currently, if I remember the figures off the top of my head, about 45,000 people incarcerated in the State prison system in Illinois. He told me a couple of things that were interesting. Each year, we release from the Illinois prison system over 20,000 inmates. We have this false notion that once a person is incarcerated, they are there forever. 
   As the Senator from North Dakota has indicated, even for the most violent criminals, that is not the case. About half of them come out each year. When you consider all the crimes for 
   which people are incarcerated, they are back on the street. The question we obviously have to ask is whether they will commit another crime. Unfortunately, about half of them do. Those crimes, when repeated, test our resolve to not only have a system that involves punishment but, where appropriate, rehabilitation. 
   This director of our Department of Corrections gave me an illustration. He said, if you consider a crime involving drugs to be the possession of a thimbleful of cocaine, in 1987, the Illinois prison system had 400 people incarcerated for the possession of a thimbleful of cocaine. In the year 2000, we have 9,100 inmates incarcerated for the possession of a thimbleful of cocaine. He said: Conceding the fact that we want to end the drug scourge in our country and we want to be effective in doing it, the average drug criminal in Illinois is incarcerated for 7 1/2 months. It is hard to believe that we are going to teach many lessons in 7 1/2 months, but that is the average. 
   Here is the thing that is troubling. During the period of that incarceration in prison for the commission of the drug crime, there is virtually nothing done to deal with the underlying addiction of the inmate. So when they are released in 7 1/2 months or a little longer, they are back on the streets, still addicted, likely to run back into the same drug culture and be exposed to the same forces that put them in prison in the first place. 
   He asked me a valid question: Why aren't we doing something, while we have these people who have been convicted and incarcerated, to try to get them off drugs? 
   I think that is a reasonable suggestion. I am not for letting violent criminals out early, but for those who are in for drug crimes, we ought to have a policy nationwide that deals with some effort to stop their addiction, to end their addiction, to try, when they are released, to give them a chance to lead a normal life that doesn't include another victim at some later point. I hope we address that. 
   He also indicated to me that over 80 percent of the women in the Illinois prison system have children. And while they are in prison separated from those children, oftentimes those children are in terrible circumstances. We saw in the State of Michigan a few weeks ago when a 6-year-old boy took a gun to school and killed a little classmate. Then we find his father was in prison. His mother is addicted. He was stuck in a home where he slept on a couch. No one paid attention to him. Frankly, a gun was left on a table where he could get his hands on it and take it to school. 
   That kind of neglect occurs too often in America. It is invited in a situation where mothers are incarcerated and no one is there to care for their kids. 
   This Director of Corrections said: Can we keep the link between the mother and child alive? We find that the women who are inmates really want to turn their lives around when they think their family can stay together and has a future. We know that the kids would like to keep a relationship with the mother who may turn her life around. 
   These are troubling questions. In a nation where we incarcerate more per capita than any other country in the world, we have to face these realities. People are coming out of prison. When they come out, we have to wonder whether there has been a part of their experience in prison that will lead to a 
   better life for them and a safer America and less recidivism.

   Mr. DURBIN. I thank my friend and colleague from the State of Utah for yielding. I am aware of the fact we disagree on this issue. We have been friends and are adversaries only on issues without any personal basis. 
   Mr. President, this has become a perennial issue before the Senate--the question of whether we will amend the Constitution of the United States to, in fact, somehow ban the desecration of the American flag. 
   Make no mistake about it, flag burning is an insensitive and shameful act. But the issue before us is not whether we support flag burning but whether we should amend the Constitution, whether we should amend the Bill of Rights for the first time in the history of the United States of America, whether we should narrow the precious freedoms ensured by the first amendment for the very first time in our Nation's history. 
   When we trace back the origin of this flag burning amendment, we find that it came about as a result of an act by an individual during the 1984 Presidential election campaign in the State of Texas during the Republican National Convention. A person went down there and ignited an American flag, and ignited the passions of many people who feel very strongly about that symbol of our Nation. It gave rise to an effort on the floor of the Congress to pass a law which would ban this sort of activity. Efforts were made, overturned by the Supreme Court, and then finally a constitutional amendment was offered. 
   It is interesting, to me, to put this in some context because we are talking about first amendment rights--rights of expression, rights of speech--which, in fact, are envied around the world. 
   As nations came out from under the yoke of communism and were finally given an opportunity to write their own future, they looked to the United States, not to our flag--they had their own flag--but to our values. They said: The United States is different. The United States respects the rights of individuals to express themselves, even when it is unpopular. 
   In many of these same countries, it had been against the law, punishable by imprisonment, to even question the Government, let alone to burn the flag of the country. But they said: We are going to walk away from that totalitarian view of the world. We are going to stand for freedom, just like the United States of America. 
   One after another, the leaders of these new democracies came here to the U.S. Capitol to appear before a joint session of Congress and really said, in so many words, their model, their ideal, their goal, was to follow our 200-plus year history of the Bill of Rights. 
   Those of us who want to stand in defense of the Bill of Rights understand that sometimes our positions are unpopular and sometimes uncomfortable. I think back a year ago. Remember, it was just a year ago the Columbine High School massacre shocked America. It stunned us to believe this could happen in a school, that innocent children could be mowed down with guns. 
   If the epicenter of this shock was at Columbine, it was certainly in the State of Colorado, as well, as they reflected on this violence. 
   Do you recall a few days after the Columbine shootings, the National Rifle Association held its convention in Denver, CO? Those in the surrounding areas came out to peacefully protest and demonstrate against the National Rifle Association and its agenda and its insensitivity to the Columbine High School shootings. 
   As much as I might disagree with the agenda of the National Rifle Association, I will have to stand here and say they had a right to meet. They had a right to meet in Denver, CO, and to express their points of view. As reprehensible and shameful as some might have found it, that is a right guaranteed by the first amendment to the Constitution. 
   In 1998, in Idaho, white supremacists obtained a permit for a ``100-man flag parade,'' and they marched, carrying American flags alongside Nazi banners. The owner of a local bookstore in Coeur D'Alene made a point of keeping his store opened. He observed: ``Nazis were burning books in the 1930s, and I don't want them closing stores in the 90s.'' 
   To think of it--Old Glory side by side with the Nazi banner. 
   I am not certain this amendment would even touch that activity. I find that reprehensible; I find that disgusting. Yet I understand it. That is what America is all about. The real test of our belief in the Bill of Rights, the real test of our belief in freedom of expression is we stand back and say, as much as we disagree and despise every word you are saying, you have a right as an American to say it. That is a core principle of this democracy. That is a principle that is at issue with the offering of this amendment, this amendment which says: We will separate out one group of Americans who engage in this despised conduct of burning flags, and we will say, we will amend the Bill of Rights for the first time in our history to stop that activity. 
   Senator HATCH, last year, before the Senate Judiciary Committee, invited a man I respect very much, Tommy Lasorda, who was a former manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers, who came and talked about his strong feelings in support of this amendment. He talked about a day in the baseball park when someone jumped out of the stands, started to burn a flag, and one of the other players raced over to grab the flag and put out the fire, how proud he was that this player--Rick Monday--would put out the fire of this flag. 
   I asked Mr. Lasorda a question when it came my turn. I said: As I understand it, most of the people who jump out of the stands and run onto the field are not televised. A decision is made by the television stations and the management not to put the television cameras on these people who race around the field whenever they do. He said: That is correct. I said: Why is that? He said: Because if you give them attention, it just encourages that kind of activity. I said to Mr. Lasorda--and say today in debate--what more attention could we give to these dim-witted clods who would burn the flag but to amend the Bill of Rights for the first time in history? How seldom this occurs, how reprehensible it is, how awful it would be for us to respond to this terrible conduct by saying: You have our attention. We are going to amend the Bill of Rights. We will show you. Then we will see a flood of this kind of activity, I am afraid. 
   Some of the people I respect from both sides of the aisle have been quoted during the course of this debate. Gen. Colin Powell, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, no one would question his patriotism, whether they belong to the American Legion or the VFW, AMVETS, or any veterans group. He opposes this amendment. He wrote a letter to Senator LEAHY in 1999 and said:  
   We are rightfully outraged when anyone attacks or desecrates our flag. Few Americans do such things and when they do they are subject to the rightful condemnation of their fellow citizens. They may be destroying a piece of cloth, but they do no damage to our system of freedom which tolerates such desecration. * * * I would not amend that great shield of democracy to hammer a few miscreants. The flag will still be flying proudly long after they have slunk away.  
   General Powell got it right, a man who has served our country, has put his life on the line in combat like so many other veterans who are quoted in the minority views and who understand they were fighting for something more than a piece of cloth. They were fighting for a piece of history, a piece of history that goes back over 200 years, when men--and they were all men--came forward to write this document, the Constitution of the United States and said: We will make certain that no matter what any State or Federal Government should try to do, we will hold sacred the rights of an individual for freedom of expression and freedom of speech no matter how unpopular it may be. 
   I ask my colleagues in the Senate to join us in condemning the action but not in desecrating our Bill of Rights. It is a document which has been a source of pride for many generations. It will continue to be. 
   Some people say even the word ``desecration'' in this amendment is a little hard to follow. What is a physical desecration of the flag? Well, burning it is one illustration, but is it the only one? For example, I raised this in committee about 2 years ago. Would we  consider it a desecration of the flag for someone to use an American flag as a seat cover in their automobile? Some might say that is a desecration, sitting on the flag. I would ask them to think twice. Take a trip down to the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, DC. Get up close and see Abraham Lincoln, that son of Illinois of whom we are so proud. Look very closely at what he is sitting on. He is sitting on an American flag. I don't think that is a desecration. I think we understand the context is trying to indicate the importance of this President. 
   I urge my colleagues in the Senate to oppose this amendment and yield the floor.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, hardly a day goes by that we do not hear of another tragic shooting across America. The latest news from Texas is still sketchy, but the results are horrible: Four people who apparently were injured by gunfire in a church and the assailant taking his own life with a gun. It is a constant reminder. Only 2 or 3 weeks ago, a Michigan first grader took a loaded handgun to school and killed his little classmate. That is America today, a nation of some 300 million weapons. 
   On Capitol Hill, the debate over guns and their future really gets pretty heated and inflammatory on both sides, and the parties are at it. Frankly, as I travel across the State of Illinois and I talk with people from other States, I believe the families in this country get it. They understand what this is all about. They appreciate what we can and cannot do to make things better. 
   They do not believe for a second that we can pass a law that will end gun violence in America. That is beyond us. I wish we could. I do believe there are things we can do to make America a safer place. 
   Some want to argue between the possibilities of increased enforcement of current laws and closing loopholes which allow people to get guns who should not have them. That is a false choice. This Senator wants both. The people who misuse guns should be prosecuted and imprisoned, no questions asked. By the same token, we should do everything in our power to keep guns out of the hands of criminals, people with a history of violent mental illness, and children. I think we need both--zero tolerance and zero loopholes. I do not think it is a choice. We need both. If we go after both in an aggressive bipartisan approach, we can start to see the numbers come down on gun violence; we can have a little more peace of mind about our kids going to school and coming home safe and sound at the end of the day. 
   Last year, we had a bill on the floor of the Senate after the Columbine massacre which focused on two major points: If you buy a gun at a gun store in America, they do a background check. They will figure out whether or not you can legally own a gun. That is the Brady law. The Brady law has been successful. 
   It is hard to believe, but true, that people with a history of committing crimes and felonies, people who have outstanding arrest warrants--not very bright, I might add--show up at gun stores trying to buy guns. We do not want that to happen. We want to stop them. 
   There is a role there for the Federal Government in having this law. There is a bigger role for State and local law enforcement in making sure those people who have outstanding arrest warrants, for example, are prosecuted. That is what happens when you go to a gun store. 
   We also know in America one can buy guns at gun shows. There is a loophole there: There is no background check. If you happen to have a problem under the law--let's say a felony record or perhaps a history of mental illness or you are too young--you do not go to the gun store where they enforce the law, you go to the gun show where they do not. That is the loophole we want to close. That was in the law that was passed last year in the Senate. The vote was 49-49, incidentally. Vice President GORE cast the deciding vote. We sent the bill 
   over to the House where it has languished for almost a year. Nothing has happened. 
   The second thing that was in that law, which I think most Americans would agree is common sense, was: Is  there a way for those who own guns to store them safely? The answer is obviously yes. It involves trigger locks. You may have heard that Smith & Wesson, the largest handgun manufacturer in the United States, suggested they will start selling trigger locks automatically with their handguns. It is common sense they will give to the gun owner the wherewithal to make their gun childproof. 
   Some people say: It is the middle of the night and a burglar comes to the door; I am fumbling around trying to find the key--you can decide what you do at night. When you go off to work and leave the gun behind with children in the house or when other kids visit, don't you want to lock it up so a kid cannot get his hands on it and shoot himself or a playmate? 
   That is what trigger locks are all about. That was the second major part of the bill that passed the Senate last year and still languishes in the House of Representatives. 
   What is so radical about those two suggestions: That a gun show will try to find out whether or not you are legally eligible to own a gun before they sell it to you; that if you are going to sell a gun in America, it is with a trigger lock so it can be safer? 
   It is time for us to cool down the political rhetoric around here--and let me be the first to volunteer because I feel very strongly about this--and try to see if maybe there is some common ground. If the people on one side want more enforcement, such as Operation Exile, which is working in some cities across America, I will support it, I will vote for it. 
   I want more enforcement, too. In fact, I am going to offer an amendment in the Budget Committee which is going to say to my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans: Let's put some money into this. Let's show that we believe in enforcement and prosecution on a bipartisan basis. This is not a partisan issue. I do not want criminals roaming the streets, gang bangers shooting up the streets of Chicago or my hometown of Springfield. I am ready to push for more prosecution and enforcement, without question. Let's put the money into more ATF agents and more prosecutors to get that job done. 
   I will concede to the other side that prosecution and enforcement are important. Let's do it. This Democrat will stand with Republicans to get that done. 
   I ask in return that Republican Senators take a look at what we passed last year. Some, including the Presiding Officer, voted for it, and I am very proud that he did. We need more. We need to have Senators on both sides of the aisle to come forward and say, yes, trigger locks make sense; let's make them part of America's landscape to protect children; and those who will also say that gun shows should not be exempt from the basic laws of this country. 
   There are other things we can talk about in terms of sensible, commonsense gun control. I do not know if we will get them accomplished this year, but certainly I hope that before the first anniversary of the Columbine tragedy, this Congress will end its gridlock on the gun control issue. The people of this country expect more. They do not want to see this historic Chamber grind to a halt because of a special interest group in this town. They want to see goodwill on both sides of the 
   aisle. 
   I will say this: If we fail, if we do nothing, if another day, another week, and another month go by with the tragic headlines we see so often about killings in churches and schools and day-care centers, if that happens, the American people will be justifiably angry in this election. They should hold all candidates accountable. 
   Members of the House of Representatives, Members of the Senate, and the two men who are likely to be the leading candidates for President of the United States--all of us, I should say--should be held accountable to answer the basic question: When you had the chance serving in the U.S. Congress, what did you do? Did you try to do anything to make this country safer, to make certain that when I walk out on the streets of my town or send my little boy or girl to school, I have a little more peace of mind? 
   We have the ability; we have the opportunity. The question is whether we can summon the political will. One cannot turn on the television in this town, and probably in others, without seeing ads from one special interest group or the other that wants to get us tangled up in some theoretical debate about the second amendment and the future of gun control. 
   I hope this Congress, and particularly this Senate, can get beyond the theory into the reality. The reality is: Over 40 percent of Americans own guns; there are over 300 million guns now in our Nation of some 275 million people; and even the gun owners believe intensely in sensible and responsible gun control. They believe guns should be stored safely, that those who own them should know how to use them, and they should be kept out of the hands of the wrong people. That is a consensus among gun owners, not to mention those who do not own guns who feel even more strongly about the same issues. 
   I hope this Congress, which tends to lurch back and forth from minor but somewhat important issues, will focus on a major and very important issue: Making America a safer place. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon to address an issue which is paramount now at this moment in time in this congressional session. Each year, we have certain things we have to do before we can go home. The first of those things is to pass a budget resolution. 
   The President comes to Capitol Hill in January. He gives his State of the Union Address and suggests a legislative agenda, as Presidents have done, I believe, since President Woodrow Wilson. Then, shortly after that speech, the President's wishes are translated into a budget proposal submitted by the President to Congress.  
   Of course, we have coequal branches of Government. We are very proud of our responsibility. We look at the President's budget as an indicator of where the country might be headed. Then we add our own priorities. We decide, if we agree with the President, that we will go forward with some of his spending plans. If we disagree, we come up with our own proposal. That proposal is known as the budget resolution. It is a resolution passed by the House, passed by the Senate, one we hope we can agree on, but it isn't signed by the President. It is really the Congress' view of how we should spend the money the people of America give us to supervise and maintain. 
   The budget process is one where Congress has the burden on its shoulders. The President has met his responsibility. Now it is our turn. We usually try to make certain that before April 1 that budget resolution will be enacted so that then we can get to work on the Appropriations Committees. 
   The budget resolution is like a blueprint. The Appropriations Committees take 13 different appropriations and spell out, in fine detail, what the budget resolution has instructed them to do. 
   There are large-scheme things we consider and smaller things, as well. On the larger scheme, we want to continue to bring down the deficit that we have faced in this country for so long, and the national debt which we have accumulated. On a smaller scheme basis--certainly not small in terms of importance, but in spending, we consider everything from the Federal prison system, education, the defense of the country, foreign aid--you name it--each of the appropriations bills takes that into account. 
   The first step is the budget resolution. 
   I am a member of the Budget Committee. I kind of jokingly say that I served a 6-year sentence on the House Budget Committee, and now I am back in the role of the Senate's Budget Committee serving my time as well. It is not as tough an assignment as that might lead one to believe. We have a wonderful chairman in Senator PETE DOMENICI of New Mexico; we have a great minority spokesman in FRANK LAUTENBERG of New Jersey. But we do have differences of opinion. 
   It appears this Presidential election year has made the budget process more difficult than ever. I think the majority party, the Republican Party, has a tough job on their hands. They now have a candidate for President, Governor George W. Bush, who has said his vision of America involves a substantial tax cut that goes primarily to the wealthiest people in America. Virtually every Republican Senator and Member of the House has closed ranks and said he or she supports Governor Bush, and that is the cornerstone of the Bush campaign, this large tax cut for upper-income Americans. 
   It has become difficult to convert the Republican Presidential primary rhetoric into budget realities; in other words, to take the promises from the campaign stump by Governor Bush of a massive tax cut and turn it into a budget reality on Capitol Hill. I think that is why our budget process this week broke down. The Republicans canceled today's hearing to discuss the budget resolution. I am afraid the Republican majority can't quite get it together. 
   I think they ought to think twice. I hope they do not include in their budget resolution Governor Bush's tax cut because, frankly, it is a tax cut America cannot afford. It is one thing for us to say it is only some $223 billion. In fact, it is much more over a 5-year period of time. If Leonardo DiCaprio and others will forgive me, we think the U.S. economy is doing very well, sailing along. In this Republican tax scheme, we see $223 billion up here that might be its cost over the first 5 years, but take a look at this iceberg below, which could sink this ship, the U.S. economy. Once you have played out the cost of the Bush tax scheme, it approximates $2 trillion; $2 trillion in an economy that seems to be doing quite well as is. 
   Take a look last year at what was proposed by the Republicans as part of their tax relief. Over 5 years, it was $156 billion. Then as it grew over 10 years, it went to $792 billion. In this year's debate, the Congressional Republican budget plan is over $200 billion in the first 5 years, and over 10 years, it just mushrooms and explodes in size. 
   One might say: Well, frankly, I would like to have a tax cut. Wouldn't everybody, an individual, a family, a business? Of course. But we have to ask a harder question. Would we risk endangering the current economic growth in this country in order to pass a large and expanding tax cut that goes primarily to wealthy people? Would we be in favor of such a tax cut plan as opposed to paying down the national debt, a debt which, frankly, we have to raise tax money for every single day to pay interest? Wouldn't it be better--incidentally, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan thinks so and I agree with him--to reduce the national debt as opposed to giving tax breaks to wealthy people? 
   As that debt comes down, we are saying to our children: Here is an America that is strong, a great democracy, a leader in the world, a nation unencumbered by debt that has been accumulated over the last several decades. 
   President Clinton's plan suggests that our first priority should be bringing down America's national debt before we start talking about massive, risky tax schemes. I think the President is correct because in bringing down that national debt, we invest money in Social Security, meaning that it is stronger longer, and we invest money into Medicare, the health insurance plan for the 
   elderly and disabled in America, a plan which needs our assistance. That, I think, is the responsible course. 
   As I have gone across my State of Illinois and met not just with my friends on the Democratic side but independent voters and Republican businessmen and businesswomen, they agree. The most conservative, the most disciplined approach is not a massive tax cut but rather bringing down America's national debt so that our children are not burdened with paying interest on that. That is why my friends on the Budget Committee on the Republican side are really having a tough time of it. They are trying to sell something to America it is not buying. This Governor George W. Bush tax cut is one that, frankly, could jeopardize our economic growth, could take money away from reducing our national debt. I think the American people understand that is just not a good thing to do. 
   The President's proposal is to focus on bringing down that debt--in fact, at three or four times the rate of what has been proposed by the House Republican Budget Committee--and at the same time, the President says, with the surplus, without raiding Social Security, but with the surplus, let's try to deal with some of the priorities of our Nation. 
   Take a look at our priorities: Save Social Security first; paying down the debt; protecting Medicare. Here is one I found across Illinois that is extremely important to people--providing a prescription drug benefit for elderly people. Medicare doesn't include it. A third of the seniors do quite well and have coverage. Another third have some coverage. But a third have none at all. 
   I have met these people. These are men and women who have prescription drug bills of $200 a month and more, living on fixed incomes. Many of us believe Medicare should include a prescription drug benefit and some of the surplus should be dedicated for that. Sadly, some of the proposals coming from the Republican side provide not a penny for a prescription drug benefit. 
   Then, from the same surplus, invest in education. I think we all agree and understand America is strong because we have a good educational system and a well-trained and well-educated workforce that can compete in the world in the 21st century. We want to be able to say this, too, can be an American century, and it means investing in education. 
   What will we put the money into? Well, certainly to upgrade the skills of teachers so they can teach the latest in terms of science and math and the best approaches to learning; in addition, modernizing our schools, and making sure they are safe. We can bring computer technology to our schools for every kid in America. We talk about afterschool programs so kids don't have those idle hours without supervision. They have a chance to stay  after school, under supervision, to be tutored if they are falling behind, enrichment courses if they are good students, counseling if they are troubled. Those things are all helpful and move us in the right direction. 
   President Clinton has suggested that we should reduce class sizes so that in the lower grades, when kids need more attention, we will have fewer kids in the classroom. I think that makes sense. I support the President on that. Those are investments in education with which most American families would agree. 
   Then we think we can still have some money left for targeted tax cuts, not for the wealthiest people in the country but for working families. 
   To give some examples, wouldn't it be great in America if working families, in sending their sons and daughters to college, could fully deduct their college education expenses? I think it would. I meet too many families and young people who graduate from college with massive debt. Sparing these young people and their parents this debt is a very worthy goal, indeed. I think the 
   President's proposal of a tax cut for the deductibility of college education expenses is a good one. 
   Let me share another example. The largest and fastest growing group in America's population are people over the age of 85. People are living longer. As our parents and grandparents live longer, they run into problems. Sometimes they need long-term care, and that can be expensive. Many people don't have insurance to cover it. The President wants to give a targeted tax cut for working families to pay for this long-term care for that parent or grandparent we love, that is the kind of targeted tax cut that makes sense. It doesn't jeopardize our economic growth. It says let's help the families who are really struggling to get by. 
   When we take a look at the tax cut that comes from the Republican side of the aisle, we can see that because it is so large, because it explodes in the outyears, it is going to raid the Social Security trust fund. Take a look at this. Congressional Republican plans really could include a Bush tax cut that would raid Social Security to the tune of over $372 billion over a 5-year period. I thought that was something we all agreed, not too long ago, that we would not do again. We would protect the Social Security trust fund. Yet this Bush tax cut plan endangers that trust fund--another reason I am sure the Republican-controlled Budget Committee is having a tough time getting started. 
   Take a look at the tax cut. I have said it helps the wealthiest of Americans. Let's show this chart which proves it. When you take a look at the George W. Bush tax cut plan and the people who benefit from it, if you happen to have an income over $300,000 a year--and you don't have to hold up your hand--you are going to see a tax cut of $50,000 a year under Governor Bush's tax cut plan. 
   If you are a family with an income below $39,000 a year, it comes out to $249. That is about $20 a month. That is the Bush tax cut plan--$249 for working families and $50,000 for the folks who are making over $300,000 a year. 
   So the Republican Presidential candidate would have us jeopardize our economic growth, and would reach into the Social Security trust fund to create a tax cut for the wealthiest people in America of $50,000 a year. 
   I have to tell you, quite honestly, if you are making $300,000 a year, I am sure you can figure out what to do with another $50,000; but you are probably pretty well off. If you have invested in the stock market during the Clinton-Gore administration, you have probably done pretty well with your investments. I can't understand why George W. Bush is focusing his tax cut on the wealthiest people in America. 
   Look at the prescription drug benefit plan. We understand what it will cost. We understand under the House Republican budget what they think it will cost for us to have a prescription drug benefit plan. The problem is, in the House Republican budget no money is available for that. Once you have dedicated yourself to the George W. Bush tax cut, you lose the resources to provide for prescription drug benefits for the elderly people in America. 
   For a moment, let me go back to education because I think this is worth repeating. What we are talking about under the President's plan is investing money in education. It is no surprise to me that everybody asked in national polls about the top issue facing Government will answer that it is education. That is the No. 1 area that should be funded and the No. 1 area we should pay attention to in Washington and in the State capitals. Now we are talking about making good on the promise to America that we elected officials will help out with education. 
   Look at the President's plan: increasing education funding by 12 percent; making certain we prepare young children for school by expanding the Head Start Program, one of my favorites; reducing class size and training teachers. 
   As I go around in my State, I find this is something teachers want to have--help and assistance to make sure they understand the technology, which changes almost on a weekly basis. Building up-to-date schools or modernizing them is part of the President's investment for education plan; money invested in education technology so there is no digital divide, so whether you are in a poor district, wealthy district, rural or urban, you will have the same access to technology. Kids coming out of the classroom will be part of our national workforce and they should all have the needed skills. Other priorities: helping the disabled, promoting afterschool learning, and improving college access and affordability by improving Pell grants, which help lower-income students complete their education, as well as the deductibility of college education expenses. 
   Let me say that the targeted tax cuts proposed by the Clinton-Gore Administration and the Democrats, as I mentioned before, include helping families care for elderly parents; targeting the surplus so it goes to expanding educational opportunities; providing marriage penalty relief, which both parties support; helping people prepare for retirement with new basic pension plans; and expanding the earned-income tax credit, a benefit we give to a lot of working families who otherwise might not be able to succeed. We want them to succeed. 
   The basic question we have to ask and answer during this budget debate is whether America is headed in the right direction. You would expect me, on the Democratic side and being proud of the record of the last 7 years in terms of where our economy has come, to say, yes, I think America is moving in the right direction. But as we ask American families across the Nation, they agree; they know the Dow Jones Average, which we follow now on a regular basis, 
   has risen from some 3,000 to over 10,000 in the last 7 years. They understand, as well, that we have been able to see more businesses created across America, particularly businesses owned by women. More people are building and owning homes than ever in the United States. Inflation is under control. We see reductions in unemployment, reductions in the welfare rolls. We have the smallest welfare rolls in America in 30 years and the lowest overall crime rate in 25 years. There are 20.4 million new jobs under this administration. 
   Frankly, we are enjoying the first back-to-back budget surpluses in 43 years. Not long ago, we were debating on the floor of the Senate about amending the Constitution, a balanced budget amendment, so Federal courts could force Congress to stop spending into red ink and deficits. Now we are talking about what to do with the surplus. Seven years ago, in the era of spiralling budget deficits, who in the world would have believed we would be talking about budget surpluses today? Amazing. And this has all occurred under the watch of the Clinton-Gore administration. Most of us believe our country is moving in the right direction and we should not launch some untried, unproven, new approach that may jeopardize that economy. 
   I think the proposal by Gov. George W. Bush for massive, risky tax cuts for wealthy people does just that. You expect to hear that from a Democrat. But go to somebody who might be dispassionate in this debate, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan. He has basically said it is the wrong thing to do to give a massive tax cut. You could jeopardize this economic growth. We don't want to see that happen. 
   Is America perfect? No. We don't like the cost of gasoline and heating oil today. We know we can do better in  education. We know we can help families pay for some of their basic expenses, take care of their parents and grandparents. So we continue to look for ways to provide that assistance to families. But we do believe we have made great progress over the last 7 years. 
   Now, the Budget Committee in the Senate has to try to calculate a way to put together a budget resolution, and they are in a dilemma. Are they going to stand by their Presidential candidate, George W. Bush, and support a tax cut that risks the economic progress we have made? Or will they turn their backs on their candidate and say, no, let's keep going on the right course and keep America moving forward? 
   I understand why they postponed this week's hearing, and I hope they can resolve it in their own caucus. Let's bring this issue to the floor and let every Member of the Senate vote on the George W. Bush massive, risky tax cut scheme. If they want to go on record supporting it, so be it, then they stand by their candidate. But they can step back and explain how we are going to pay for it and why people making over $300,000 a year need a $50,000 tax cut. I don't think they will. 
   I think this country is moving in the right direction. I certainly hope Members of the Senate and the House, perhaps even on a bipartisan basis, will say that continuing this economic progress in America is more important than a ringing endorsement for any Presidential candidate. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

    Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in my hometown of Springfield, IL, we have extraordinary people who have made noteworthy contributions in service to others. 
   Julie Cellini, a freelance writer and community activist, has written many profiles which highlight the lives of these fine neighbors in our state capital. 
   Recently, Julie shared the life story of such a person: Sister Agnes Clare, O.P. 
   At 103 years of age with a sharp mind, an enduring will to savor each day of her life and an irresistible Irish charm, Sister Agnes Clare is more than a living legend. She is an eyewitness to a century of history in Springfield; a young observer of Washington, D.C., as the daughter of a U.S. Congressman; and most of all, a vivid illustration of the legacy of a life of giving as a member of the Dominican Sisters of Springfield. 
   In this week before the celebration of St. Patrick's birthday, I would like to share with the Senate Julie Cellini's recent feature story on Sister Agnes Clare from the Springfield State Journal-Register. As you read it, you will learn of the Grahams, a great Irish-American family, and a woman who has touched so many lives with so much goodness. 
   Mr. President, I ask that this article be printed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.  
   Golden Opportunities--Sister Agnes Clare  
   Agnes Graham was 11 years old when the race riot of 1908 broke out in Springfield. 
   ``I remember the smashed dishes and glass from the windows of Loper's Restaurant strewn across South Fifth Street,'' she says. ``My mother tried to keep me from reading the newspapers so I wouldn't know all that happened. She always thought children should be trouble free, but it wasn't possible to avoid what was going on.'' 
   Now at 103 years old, Agnes Graham has been Sister Agnes Clare O.P. of the Cominican Sisters of Springfield for 80 years. She has lived during three centuries of Springfield history, but her voice still carries a hint of the same incredulousness she might have felt some 92 years ago when she watched her hometown erupt into violence that culminated in the lynching of two black men. 
   ``There was a mob. They became very angry when they couldn't get to the black prisoners in the county jail. They said a black man raped a white woman, but it wasn't true. The town was just torn apart.'' 
   By the time the two-day upheaval ended, seven people, blacks and whites, were dead,  and 40 black homes and 15 black-owned businesses were destroyed. 
   Whether the race riot is her worst memory from more than a century of living, Sister Agnes Clare won't say. Her voice is steady, but she moves quickly to other events, often telling stories about her childhood in the leafy confines of what once was called ``Aristocracy Hill.'' 
   Born in 1987 in a handsome, Lincoln-era house that sill stands at 413 S. Seventh St., Agnes Graham was the youngest of seven children--three girls and four boys. She grew up in an adoring, achieving family headed by James M. Graham, an Irish immigrant who co-founded the family law firm of Graham & Graham. James M. Graham served in the Illinois General Assembly and as Sangamon County state's attorney before being elected to Congress, where he served from 1908 to 1914. 
   Sister Agnes Clare's earliest memories are of life in the Victorian-style, painted-brick house, where water came from a backyard pump and transportation meant hitching up a horse and buggy. She frames them from the perspective of a much loved child who appears to have been the favorite of her older siblings. 
   She recalls the Christmas she was 5 years old (``about the age when I started doubting Santa Clause'') and too sick with the flu to walk downstairs to open gifts. Her brother Hugh, a law student at the University of Illinois, wrapped her in a blanket and carried her in his arms down the long, curved staircase with its polished walnut banister. 
   ``My father had given me a big dollar bill to buy eight presents, she says, ``I spent 30 cents for three bottles of perfume for my mother and sisters, and the place smelled to high heaven. I bought my father two bow ties for 10 cents. I think they were made of paper, and they fastened with safety pins. When I got downstairs, I saw a cup of tea for Santa Claus. 
   ``When I was very young, my father went on a ship to Ireland to visit. I asked him to bring me back a leprechaun, but he said he didn't want me to be disappointed if the leprechauns were too fast for him to catch. What he did bring back was a leprechaun doll in a box, with gray socks and a pipe and bat. He told me it was a dead leprechaun, and that the salt water had killed him. I think I half-believed him, and I went around the neighborhood showing my dead leprechaun to my friends. One of their mother told my mother, `Agnes' imagination is growing up faster than she is.'' 
   ``The leprechaun went back into a box,'' she says, ``but he'd get to come out on my birthdays and special occasions.'' 
   Now a family heirloom, the doll resides with her great-niece, Sallie Graham. 
   Sister Agnes Clare says he Springfield she grew up in wasn't a small town. There were 50,000 people living here at the beginning of the 20th century. Downtown was populated with family-owned businesses, and people tended to stay at the same job all of their lives. 
   The streets were paved with bricks that popped up without warning. People waited all year for the biggest event on the calendar: the Illinois State Fair. 
   ``My mother baked hams and fried chickens so we had safe food to take to the fair. Lots of people got sick from eating at the fairgrounds because there was no refrigeration. At night, the area around the Old Capitol would be filled with fair performers who put on shows. Acrobats, singers and actors would perform on one side of the square. Then we would rush to the other side to get a front row seat on the ground. Everyone in town seemed to come out, and all the stores stayed open late so people could ship.'' 
   A rare treat was a little cash for ice cream, usually provided by big brother Hugh because there was an ice cream shop across from the Graham law office. 
   A change meeting with Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis was a highlight of the years Sister Agnes Clare spent in Washington as the young daughter of an Illinois congressman. She tells how Brandeis and her father worked together to investigate and remove corrupt agents who were swindling the residents of Indian reservations. 
   ``Justice Brandeis came to our home because he was leaving Washington and he wanted to tell my father goodbye. I happened to be hanging on the fence in the front yard, so he gave me his business card and told me to give it to my father. He said my father was a great man.'' 
   ``Indians would show up at my father's office in full native dress. My father spent a lot of time away from Washington inspecting the reservations. He told me stories of Indians so badly cared for (that) their feet left bloody footprints in the snow. One agent my father got removed gave an Indian a broken sewing machine for land that had oil and timber on it. The Indians were so grateful, a tribe in South Dakota made my father an honorary member with the title Chief Stand Up Straight.'' 
   Years later, when the Graham family home in Springfield was sold, she says, relatives donated her father's papers from that period to Brandeis University in Waltham, Mass. 
   In adulthood, Sister Agnes Clare attended college and was a librarian and a founding teacher at a mission and school in Duluth, Minn. However, her long lifetime often has been attached to a small geographic area bounded by the neighborhood where she was born and extending a few blocks west to the places where she attended school, spent much of her working career and retired to the Sacred Heart Convent in 1983. 
   Within those confines, she has lived most of a full, rich life that shows few signs of diminishing. 
   ``Sister Agnes' bones don't support her, so she moves around in a wheel chair,'' says Sister Beth Murphy, communication coordinator for the Springfield Dominican order. 
   ``Other than that, she has no illnesses, and her mind is sharp and clear.'' 
   The order has had other nuns who lived to be 100, but Sister Agnes Clare holds the longevity record. 
   ``She's amazing,'' says Sister Murphy. ``She continues to live every day with interest and curiosity. She listens to classical music and follows politics and current events on public radio. She reads the large-print edition of The New York Times every day. Recently I dropped by her room to visit and couldn't find her. She had wheeled herself off to art appreciation class.'' 
   Sister Agnes Clare's gaze is steady and assured and her face is remarkably unlined. She occupies a sunny room filled with photos and religious keepsakes. Less than a block away is the former Sacred Heart Academy (now Sacred Heart-Griffin High School), where she worked as a librarian for nearly 60 years. 
   ``No, I didn't plan on becoming a nun,'' she says matter-of-factly. ``I always thought I'd have a lot of children and live in a fairy-tale house. No one lives that way, of course. 
   ``I always loved books, so when I graduated I went across the street from my family's home and got a job at Lincoln Library. The librarians were patient and put up with me while I learned how to do the work. One day I was alone when a man with a gruff voice and a face that looked like leather came in and asked to see the books written by Jack London. Of course, we had `Sea Wolf' and `Call of the Wild' and all the popular London books. I showed him, and then I asked who he was. 
   ``He said he was Jack London. I was so astonished, I forgot to ask for his autograph.'' 
   Sister Agnes Clare brushes aside any suggestion that she was a writer, despite her essays published in Catholic Digest and other publications. She once sold an article to The Atlantic Monthly. The piece was a rebuttal to one written by a nun critical of convent life. The editors asked for more of Sister Agnes Clare's work but World War II intervened and life became too busy for writing articles. 
   She has been a prolific letter writer to four generations of Grahams. Carolyn Graham, another grand-niece says each of her four adult children treasures letters from their Aunt Agnes. 
   ``Whenever my kids come home,'' she says, ``they always check in with her. They think she's extraordinary and she is.'' 
   After a lifetime that has seen wars and sweeping societal changes and the invention of everything from airplanes to the Internet, Sister Agnes Clare isn't offering any advice on how to live longer than 100 years. 
   An academically engaged life with good health habits probably has helped, and so has genetics. She comes from a long-lived family. Her father lived to age 93 and her brother Huge died at 95. A nephew, Dr. James Graham, continues to practice medicine at age 91. 
   There are, she admits, perks attached to being among the rare triple-digit individuals called centenarians. 
   ``People ask you questions when you get to be my age,'' she says, smiling. ``They even listen to my answers.''

   Mr. DURBIN. First, I congratulate my colleague for the introduction of this legislation. I am happy to cosponsor it. It is truly bipartisan legislation which is of benefit not only to the farmers in our State of Illinois but to our Nation. 
   We understand, as most people do in Washington, the benefits of ethanol when it comes to reducing air pollution. We also understand the dangers of MTBE. Where it is used in other States, it has contaminated water supplies. 
   We are in the process of working with the Environmental Protection Agency to discuss the future of ethanol and hope it will remain strong. 
   I ask my colleague from Illinois--and I again congratulate him for his leadership in this area--if he can tell me whether his legislation on the elimination of MTBE is done on a phaseout basis or whether it is done to a date certain?

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the FAA/AIP reauthorization conference report, H.R. 1000. I commend Senators HOLLINGS, ROCKEFELLER, GORTON, and MCCAIN for their efforts. 
   This measure would lift the High Density Rule at several of the nation's slot controlled airports, including Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. I support this conference report with the understanding that it puts safety above  all other issues and keeps a watchful eye on noise levels and the environment around these airports. 
   This conference report also significantly increases funding for the Essential Air Service and Airport Improvement Programs, ensuring that Illinois airports will be able to complete important infrastructure projects as well as gain greater access to valuable markets. 
   I fully understand that some opponents are attempting to portray a High Density Rule lift as a safety issue. I agree that safety must be paramount. The FAA is and always should be the final arbiter of safety. And no matter what Congress does today, the FAA will continue to have the authority to regulate air traffic and ensure that passenger and community safety is never at risk. 
   Last fall, I received a letter from FAA Administrator Garvey, which says in part, ``Let me assure you that if the High Density Rule is lifted at Chicago or any other airport, safety will not be compromised.'' The Administrator goes on to say, ``The FAA does not control aircraft at high density airports any differently than at any other commercial airport. We will continue to operate these airports using all appropriate procedures and traffic management initiatives for the safe and expeditious handling of air traffic. Safety is always our highest priority.'' 
   The National Air Traffic Controllers Association and specifically the Chicago controllers support lifting the slot restrictions at O'Hare. NATCA believes that O'Hare can handle the increased traffic without sacrificing safety. I have had the opportunity to meet with the controllers about this issue, and I believe they bring a unique and important perspective to this debate. 
   It also should be noted that a 1995 U.S. Department of Transportation (U.S. DoT) study concluded that lifting the High Density Rule would have no impact on safety because air traffic control is implemented independently of the slot restrictions. 
   Thus, the claim that this would undermine safety is unfounded. 
   I also take exception to the notion that Congress is getting ahead of the FAA. Federal transportation officials have believed for some time that the High Density Rule is outdated and inefficient and not an appropriate safety mechanism. And our colleagues in the House voted overwhelmingly last year to lift the slot restrictions, with the support of the FAA. 
   Government reports tell us that O'Hare has been surpassed by Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport as the world's busiest. This raises the obvious question: if airports such as Atlanta and Dallas/Ft. Worth and LAX in Los Angeles can operate safely and efficiently without slot restrictions, why can't O'Hare? 
   The High Density Rule or slot restrictions were developed in the late 
   1960s, to mitigate delays. However, with the dawn of state-of-the-art air traffic control systems and improved flow control procedures, the High Density Rule has outlived its usefulness. 
   Instead, the High Density Rule artificially limits access to O'Hare and adversely affects smaller communities. In Illinois, three downstate communities have totally lost service to O'Hare--Decatur, Mt. Vernon, and Quincy--and one city, Moline, has already experienced a carrier leaving solely because of the slot restrictions. 
   In my hometown of Springfield, Capital Airport has been battling for years to attract and retain adequate service to O'Hare. Today, there are more Chicago passengers than seats available. 
   When we look for this reason, all runways lead to the same place--the High Density Rule. Carriers choose to move commuter operations to Denver and Dallas/Ft. Worth rather than deal with the slot restrictions at O'Hare. Communities pay the price through loss of access to key domestic and international markets, lost jobs, diminished tourism and stagnant economic development. 
   Bob O'Brien, the Capital Airport Executive Director of Aviation, writes, ``The inability for the Springfield community to adequately access Chicago and connect to other locations in the country or the world impacts the movements of goods and services and, consequently, is a major detriment to the retention and attraction of businesses. The growth and viability of the local Springfield community is at risk. *.*.* While our country's aviation system is among the best in the world, it is compromised by an artificial `choke point' known as the High Density Rule.'' 
   I would like to ask, why is it that we should maintain a ``choke point'' at a city which serves as the transportation hub of the nation? 
   Mark Hanna, Director of Aeronautics at Quincy's Baldwin Field, writes, ``*.*.* Quincy community leaders believe the removal of the current slot restrictions at O'Hare is critical in continuing this vital service between Quincy and Chicago. *.*.* With your support of providing relief from the current `High Density Slot Rule' at O'Hare, we can maintain this valuable air service and increase its marketability.'' 
   Julie Moore, President of the Metro Decatur Chamber of Commerce says, ``That (O'Hare) air service is essential to the economic growth and stability of our area.'' 
   I understand the frustration that passengers have with flight delays. As a frequent flier, going into or through O'Hare twice a week, I experience it often. Will lifting the High Density Rule make the planes run on time? Of course not. But will it worsen the delays? Not necessarily. The FAA is working with its air traffic controllers and the airlines to implement both short-term and long-term ways to reduce delays in the air and on the ground including giving more authority to a nationwide Command Center to control flow of aircraft and attempting to decrease so-called ground-stops. 
   With regard to noise, according to data reported in U.S. DOT's 1995 study, the increase in population around O'Hare affected by noise due to lifting the High Density Rule is very small when compared to the decrease due to the transition to an all Stage 3 fleet in 2005. After lifting the High Density Rule and shifting to a Stage 3 fleet, the population exposed to very high noise levels should decrease. Elimination of the High Density Rule also will provide scheduling flexibility to the airlines and in so doing could reduce nighttime noise. 
   At my insistence, the conferees have included several provisions that will study the noise levels at the nation's slot-controlled airports and compare 
   them to pre-Stage 3 aircraft noise levels around these same airports. The Secretary of Transportation also is required to study noise, the environment, access to underserved communities, and competition at O'Hare. Finally, O'Hare and the other slot-controlled airports will receive priority consideration for Airport Improvement Program funds for noise abatement and mitigation. This will help improve and expand soundproofing efforts and noise monitoring. 
   Both U.S. DoT's 1995 study and a 1999 GAO review found that the High Density Rule creates a barrier to entry and restricts airline competition at the affected airports. According to GAO, fares are higher at airports under the High Density Rule than at unrestricted airports. U.S. DoT concluded that lifting the high density rule would result in lower air fares and more competition. 
   According to a report conducted by Booz-Allen-Hamilton, allowing O'Hare to fully develop would contribute $26 billion annually to the greater Chicago economy. On the other hand, artificial constraints on O'Hare's capacity could cost the region $7 billion to $8 billion. 
   Mr. President, the High Density Rule has had more than 30 years to produce results. However, the only tangible results I've experienced are artificial barriers to access and competition. I don't take lightly the arguments raised by opponents of this amendment. In the past, I have supported compromise language that would offer some limited expansion of O'Hare. However, opponents have rejected even the introduction of one new flight at O'Hare. I believe this position is unrealistic and unfair to downstate Illinois communities that desperately need Chicago O'Hare access. I will hold the FAA, the airlines and these airports accountable to improve safety, reduce delays and achieve greater access for underserved markets while striving to protect the environment and limit airport noise.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the Senate is about to engage in a debate about our Nation's budget for the next fiscal year which begins in October. When one tries to measure the values of politicians and political parties, the first place to look is how they spend money. Speeches are one thing, but the way we spend our money really explains who we are and what we value. 
   There is a real difference of opinion now between Democrats and Republicans about how we are going to spend our money in the next budget. On the  Democratic side, we happen to believe we have a strong story to tell the American people about the progress that has been made in America under the Clinton-Gore administration for the last 7 years. In fact, a month or so ago, we completed the longest economic expansion in the history of the United States of America. 
   It is every political party's dream to be able to stand in this Chamber and say what I just said. Under the leadership of President Clinton and Vice President GORE, America is moving in the right direction. We are creating more jobs, and we are solving problems that people thought were intractable and insolvable not that long ago. 
   Take a look at the record from 1993 to the year 2000. We turned a record deficit of $290 billion in 1992 into a surplus of $176 billion in the year 2000. We have seen a paydown in our national debt. We have had 107 consecutive months of economic growth, and many new jobs and new houses and new businesses have been created. 
   Take a look at what they said was going to happen. These are the experts who tell us what we can expect. They said in 1993 that we were going to have a debt increase. They projected it at $761 billion over the last 2 years. In other words, more red ink, more need for us to borrow money and pay interest on it. 
   What happened instead under the leadership of this President? We ended up with a surplus. We actually paid down the debt of this country by $140 billion. 
   There are a lot of young people who come to Washington, DC, to visit this Capitol and to see their Government in action. I say to these young people, the best thing we can do for you is to continue on this course. Once this debt starts to go away, the need to pay interest on it goes away as well. 
   We collect $1 billion a day in taxes from families and individuals and businesses just to pay interest on old debt. We are moving in the right direction. America should not change course. We must keep expanding this economy and creating opportunity. 
   Take a look at what has happened between the end of 1992 and 1999. More Americans owned homes. This is the American dream, and the dream has gotten better for millions of Americans because the economy is strong and interest rates are under control and inflation is in check. 
   Take a look, as well, at the incomes of Americans across many groups. Those at the lowest income level all the way to those at the highest income level have seen a steady increase in inflation-adjusted income during the period of the Clinton-Gore Presidency. More people are buying homes, and income levels are going up for virtually every group across America. 
   Take a look at the tax burden, too, because many people on the Republican side will say taxes have gone up. They have not. Take a look at the median income for a four-person family and 
   the percent of taxes they are paying: 16.8 percent in 1992, 15.1 percent in 1999. The tax burden for the typical family in America has gone down. 
   Of course, it is good news when it comes to employment. We have the lowest unemployment rate in 30 years: 7.5 percent when the President came to office, now down to 4.2 percent. 
   The problem most American businesses tell me about when I visit them is: We need to find skilled workers; we have job opportunities; we need the workers to fill them. 
   Now what are we going to do? We are going to debate a budget resolution in the Senate and the House where the Republicans will come forward and say we need to change all this; we need to try a different approach; things are not working as well as they could. 
   I think we ought to let history be our guide, and it is suggesting to us that we are on the right path, we are in the right direction, and we do not want to change course and go out on a risky venture. 
   The real question now is whether the Republican leadership in the Senate will come forward with a budget that has a tax cut proposed by their likely candidate for President, George W. Bush from Texas. It is a substantial tax cut and one, from my point of view, which goes too far and threatens the viability of the Social Security trust fund. 
   Take a look at what the tax cut means. The Bush tax cut which was proposed during the course of his campaign--and I am sure it will be the centerpiece of his campaign from this point forward--says that if you happen to be in the top 1 percent of American earners with an income above $300,000 a year, your cut is $50,000 each year. Not bad. In the 60-percent range, with income below $39,000, the George W. Bush tax cut is worth about $29 a month. 
   Does it make sense that we would jeopardize the growth of our economy, keeping our debt under control, paying it down, creating jobs, new businesses, and home ownership to give a tax cut of $50,000 a year to the richest people in America? The Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan, said: Don't do it; it doesn't make sense; it is risky; it is dangerous. 
   I hope we do not. But the Senate and House Republicans will present their budget, and they will tell us whether they stand behind Governor George W. Bush and their tax cut proposal or they want to stand behind the plan that has brought the economic prosperity we enjoy today. 
   The President has come forward with a responsible budget. It pays down our national debt, it creates targeted tax cuts, and if we are going to take some of our surplus and give it to American families, it provides we do it for things they need: A $3,000 long-term care tax credit for the fastest growing group of Americans, those over the age of 85, to help the sons and daughters of those who are in older age situations to pay for their long-term care; expanded educational opportunity--we need a new college opportunity tax cut. This is going to help people across the board, regardless of income; A deduction of college expenses so that young people can go to school, improve their skills, and add to our economy and their lives. 
   Marriage penalty relief is something I think should be done on a bipartisan basis. The President proposes it; 
   money for new accounts, retirement, and expanding the earned income tax credit. 
   This is the bottom line: In a matter of a few hours, the Senate Budget Committee, under the leadership of Senator DOMENICI, will come forward with a budget, and we will be able to see for the first time whether or not the Republicans on Capitol Hill support George W. Bush's call for a tax cut, a tax cut that has been branded unwise by Chairman Greenspan and one that, by any modest projection, is going to invade the Social Security trust fund. 
   It will be a test to see what the real issue of this campaign will be: Whether the congressional Republicans back Mr. Bush's idea and want to venture out on some risky and perhaps dangerous venture that could jeopardize the growth in our economy or they want to stay the course on a responsible, fiscally disciplined approach that has come forward in the last 7 years. 
   The American people are going to have a clear choice. If every election is a pocketbook election, we on the Democratic side welcome it. America's pocketbooks are better now than they were 7 years ago. We believe Americans want to continue this progress and move forward, addressing those people in America who have not benefited from this economic expansion, addressing serious challenges such as expanding education and health care, and doing it in a fiscally sensible way so that at the bottom line, on the last day, in the final chapter, we can say to the next generation of Americans: We paid down this debt, we gave you a strong America moving forward, and now it is your chance to take over. 
   That is the best thing we can do, and we do not want to jeopardize that by giving tax cuts to wealthy people, spending money we do not have, and ignoring the reality of the progress we have made over the last 7 years. 
   I can recall when President Clinton came forward with his budget proposal in 1993 that started us on this path of economic expansion. 
   We could not get a single Republican vote to support it--not one in the House or the Senate. In fact, Vice President GORE cast the deciding vote for the President's budget plan. Not a single Republican Senator would support it. Thank goodness the Vice President was there to do it. 
   When he cast that vote, we not only won on that issue, the American people won. We embarked on a course which has really given America a great opportunity. This is an optimistic and forward-looking Nation now.  
   This Presidential campaign, and all of those who are candidates in congressional elections, will now put to the test the question as to whether or not we are going to continue this course of moving forward with the progress in our economy. 
   To the naysayers who claim to have a better idea, I suggest that historically there has never been a period of greater economic expansion in this country. We want it to continue. We will see this Republican budget tomorrow and find out whether the leaders, the congressional leaders on Capitol Hill, want to continue this course that really moves America forward or if they want some risky new venture that includes the Bush tax cut. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today, as we celebrate National Women's History Month, I rise to pay tribute to the extraordinary women, past and present, who have broken down barriers and continue to shape our nation's future. 
   First, I would like to thank my distinguished colleague, Senator BARBARA MIKULSKI, who herself has succeeded in redefining the role of women in politics by becoming the most senior woman in the Senate today. Twenty years ago, when Senator MIKULSKI was in the House, she and another one of my notable colleagues, Senator ORRIN HATCH, co-sponsored the first Joint Congressional Resolution declaring National Women's History Week, now a month long celebration acknowledging the accomplishments of women. I applaud my colleagues for their leadership in bringing forth this important celebration of women. 
   This year's national theme is ``An Extraordinary Century for Women--Now, Imagine the Future!'' Given the extraordinary accomplishments of women this last century and the bright future of women in this new millennium, a more appropriate theme for this month's celebration of women could not have been chosen. 
   This month, we pay tribute to the founders of the first Women's Rights Convention 150 years ago. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucretia Mott, and Susan B. Anthony were visionaries who championed women's rights. We also celebrate the historic achievements of Amelia Earhart, Ida B. Wells, Eleanor Roosevelt, Jacqueline Kennedy, Sally Ride, and other legendaries who redefined the role of women and are role models, not only for today's young women, but for all. 
   My home state of Illinois is filled with such legendary women. Jane Addams was a socially conscious community leader who founded Hull House, a neighborhood center for immigrants in Chicago and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1931. Minnie Saltzman-Stevens was an internationally known Wagnerian soprano who received her first voice training from the O.R. Skinner Music School in Illinois. Content Johnson was an artist who gained considerable reputation as a portrait and still life painter in oils. Elizabeth Irons Folsom was an author and winner of the 1923 O'Henry Prize for short stories. Margaret Illington, born Maud Light, was a renowned actress who so loved Bloomington, Illinois, that she changed her name to Illington, forever bearing the proof of her love. These women paved the way for today's talented female Illinoisans. 
   Today's prominent Illinoisans include my friend and former colleague Carol Moseley-Braun, the first African American elected to the Senate and now the US Ambassador to New Zealand; Karen Nussbaum, Director of the Women's Bureau in the US Department of Labor; Marlee Matlin, the only hearing impaired person ever to win an Academy Award for Best Actress; Hillary Rodham Clinton, American first lady, attorney, and leader on education and children's issues; and Caribel Washington, an 86 year old civil rights activist who continues to use her strength and fortitude to inspire all people. 
   The struggles and triumphs of these women will guide those who follow. One such follower is Winifred Alves, who I had the pleasure of meeting the other day. Winifred is this year's recipient of the Girl Scout Gold Award. 
   Winifred's future is as bright as her Gold Award. 
   Despite opposition, many of us in this Congress are fighting to ensure fair pay for women and close the wage gap. We are working to open the doors of college to all Americans by providing quality education at the elementary and secondary level and college tuition assistance to make higher education more affordable. We are working to improve our nation's health by bringing the issues of affordable prescription drugs and a Patient's Bill of Rights to the forefront. 
   Although Winifred's future is bright, the lives of many of our children remain in jeopardy until we pass tougher gun laws. Last week, six year old Kayla Rolland was tragically shot to death by her fellow kindergarten classmate with a stolen gun. Kayla never had an opportunity to become a Girl Scout. She died senselessly because another six year old child was able to gain access to an illegal firearm. How many more of our children must die before we, as a Congress, band together on a bipartisan basis to pass comprehensive gun legislation? 
   In this month of March, let us not only pay tribute to those women who have pioneered and inspired all of us, let us remember the young lives we have failed to protect by failing to pass commonsense gun control legislation. Let us also remember, their mothers, teachers, neighbors and friends, who helped shape these young lives but will never know the full potential of their joyous labor. And let us also remember our own mothers, sisters, and aunts who, although unknown to most, continue to shape our lives and our nation's future.

   Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I rise to express my disappointment that the Congress has been unable to move forward on a bipartisan basis on the prescription drug benefit under Medicare. There is a lot of talk with our surplus about potential tax breaks for businesses and families and individuals. In fact, it appears one of the proposals is going to be virtually unanimous, and that is the suggestion we take the cap off income for those who are under Social Security so people between the ages of 65 and 70 can work without penalty. That is encouraging. We should move on that and move quickly. 
   Another element of some debate but some agreement as well is the so-called marriage penalty. This is a feature of our Tax Code that was probably not there by design, but it reads that if two individuals making a certain amount of money should get married and their combined income puts them in a different and higher income tax category, they face a penalty. 
   Some have argued, with very little evidence, that many people do not get married because of this. I have my doubts about it. I do not know how many people visit their accountant before they buy the engagement ring, but I suppose it happens. 
   I do believe we can, on a bipartisan basis, come to an agreement that we will remove the so-called marriage penalty and do it in a way that is not unreasonable so we benefit those who would otherwise be disadvantaged. 
   There is an irony to this as well, of course, in that when many people get married, their combined income puts them in a lower tax bracket. This is, I guess, a marriage bonus, if you want to use the term. We certainly believe that should continue and that it should not be changed. I hope we can move in that direction. 
   Unfortunately, the House of Representatives recently passed a package on the marriage penalty that was really quite different than what I have described. First of all, as with so many other tax bills that have come from the other party over the years, the vast majority--two-thirds of the benefits of this so-called marriage penalty tax bill coming from the House--goes to higher-income couples; that is, couples making over $75,000 a year. These higher-income couples get an average tax cut of close to $1,000. Couples who earn less than $50,000 receive an average of $149. That is a very small percentage of the amount that goes to those in higher-income categories. 
   The price tag for the Republican marriage penalty bill coming out of the House--well, it's a whopping $182 million, and almost half the benefits go to couples who do not face the marriage penalty in their taxes. In this process, this huge expense, mostly going to high-income families, crowds out a lot of very important priorities. 
   I hope we all can agree that if our goal is to eliminate the marriage penalty, it can be done for a fraction of what the House of Representatives did in their tax relief bill. There are other deserving tax benefit suggestions we should consider. At the top of these priorities is a prescription drug benefit for senior citizens. 
   On the Democratic side, our party believes we can address both the marriage penalty and the prescription drug benefit. The prescription drug coverage for our seniors is a lifeline. One of the leaders in the House of Representatives on the other side of the aisle said if we put the prescription drug benefit 
   in his bill, he will consider it a ``legislative poison pill.'' 
   For the seniors with whom I speak in Illinois and from across the Nation, prescription drug coverage is a lifeline, not a poison pill. House Majority Leader DICK ARMEY and other House Republicans who called it a poison pill illustrate the flaws in their priorities. 
   I hope we can come together. I hope my friends on the Republican side, particularly in the House of Representatives, will learn, as I have, about the skyrocketing costs of prescription drugs. 
   Prescription drug prices have been rising at an almost double-digit rate for the last 20 years. A Families USA study shows these prices rising at four times the rate of inflation. Medicare beneficiaries' annual out-of-pocket drug costs tell the story: 38 percent of Medicare beneficiaries are spending more than $1,000 a year on their prescription drugs. Many of them are on tight, fixed incomes. Eighteen percent of Medicare beneficiaries spend between $500 and $1,000, and 31 percent are paying out up to $500. 
   For some people stepping back and saying $1,000 a year should not mean much, I can tell them that for a person on a fixed income of $600 or $800 a month under Social Security, $100 a month can mean a real sacrifice, and many senior citizens have to face those sacrifices on a regular basis. 
   When we held a hearing in Chicago on the prescription drug situation, there were seniors who told us that when they visited large supermarkets in the Chicagoland area that had prescription drug counters, first they would have to find out what their drugs would cost and then calculate what was left over for the groceries they needed to buy to fill their refrigerators and feed themselves in the days ahead. 
   That is a tough sacrifice and choice for anyone to make, certainly for one to decide between health and the basic necessities of life. One study showed fully 1 in 8 seniors faces this choice between food and medicine. That is unacceptable. 
   Addressing this problem is certainly not a poison pill, in Mr. ARMEY's words. Time and again, in each of my town meetings around the State, I heard how much money seniors have to spend to remain healthy. It was not unusual in any senior citizen setting to find someone spending $200, $300, $400 a month or even more. 
   In Illinois, my constituents tell me they are having a tough time paying for their own drugs. Many are worried about whether their parents can afford the drugs they need to stay healthy. 
   I had a town meeting in Chicago recently. Julie Garcia told me of her concerns about her mother's health care needs. This was not an uncommon story. Many children are concerned about a parent who has been ill. They want to make certain their parents have access to prescription drugs to stay healthy. 
   Julie Garcia's mother was diagnosed with cancer 11 years ago and must still see her oncologist for routine visits every 2 or 3 months. Because of her cancer, Julie Garcia's mother was unable to buy individual insurance. When she was going through her cancer treatment, she was on what is known as a spend-down program through Medicaid. This paid for a large portion of her hospital bill, but she still incurred thousands of dollars in bills for which she was held liable. A great many of those thousands of dollars were for the cost of prescription drugs she needed. 
   So many seniors who are concerned about their health are often faced with  these terrible choices. I have run into seniors who do not fill prescriptions given to them by doctors. Some fill the prescription and take it every other day. Some will try to stretch the prescription out in other ways. Little do they know they may be losing all of the beneficial impact of the prescription drug itself. 
   One lady in particular had a double lung transplant. She found it was going to cost $2,500 a month for her to deal with the antirejection drugs and other things necessary to stay healthy after this transplant surgery. She came to the conclusion she could not afford it. She decided, on her own, to cut back on the prescription drugs she would take. As a result of that decision--a monetary decision--she lost one-third of her lung capacity permanently, irreparable harm which could damage her for years to come--a money decision that resulted in a health disaster. 
   Those are the choices people are making every single day. It is not just the seniors, of course. Under Medicare, many who are disabled find themselves in the same predicament: Cutting back, mainly on drugs, sometimes because of large price increases. Over the last couple of years, it has gone from bad to worse. As I mentioned before, one study shows that one senior in eight is forced to choose between food and medicine. 
   What kind of drug price increases are we talking about? 
   In 1992, the average cost of a prescription drug was $30. Six years later, in 1998, it had more than doubled to an average of $78. Drug prices are increasing much more quickly than the pace of inflation. 
   A study by Families USA, a national health care consumer group, examined the prices of 50 drugs most often used by seniors. They tested the period between January 1, 1998, and January 1, 1999. Here is what they found. 
   For the 50 most popular drugs used by seniors, 36 out of those 50 drugs increased two or more times faster than the rate of inflation. More than a third of these drugs--17 out of 50--increased four times the rate of inflation. 
   Pharmacists in my State tell me that in the past they used to get a price increase once or twice a year. Now many of them face price increases on drugs on a weekly or monthly basis. The curiosity about this is the relative expense of these drugs. 
   We understand the pharmaceutical companies are in business 
   to make a profit. If they did not, their shareholders would turn on the management and oust them and find someone who could make a profit. That happens all the time. That is the nature of capitalism, the nature of our free market, and the nature of business. 
   We also understand that pharmaceutical companies need to make enough money so they can invest in future research, to find the next cure, the next drug on which they can make a profit. We want them to do that. Of course, success in doing that moves us closer to the day when we start eradicating many of the worrisome diseases Americans face. 
   Having said that--that we are going to concede the profit motive, we are going to concede the amount of money needed for research--I think there are still serious questions to be raised about the pharmaceutical industry, particularly when you compare the cost of these drugs in the United States to the cost of these drugs in other places. 
   There are several people now who live in the border States in the northern part of our United States who take buses, on a regular basis, into Canada. Senior citizens get on these buses for a daily excursion and make a trip across the border to buy prescription drugs. 
   Why would somebody want to leave the United States to go to Canada to buy drugs? Frankly, because the drugs are cheaper. For every dollar Americans spend on prescription drugs, that same drug costs 64 cents across the border--64 percent of what it costs in the United States--in England, 65 percent; in Italy, 51 percent; in Germany, 71 percent. 
   You ask yourself, are they different drugs? The answer is no; they are exactly the same drugs. Exactly the same thing sold in the United States--made by an American company, inspected by the Food and Drug Administration, approved for sale here--when it crosses that invisible border between the United States and Canada becomes a bargain. 
   A lot of these seniors from the northern States in our country have decided to go to Canada to fill their prescriptions to save money. 
   Why in the world would these same drugs cost less in Canada? Frankly, because the Canadian Government has said to the drug companies that if they want to sell the drugs in Canada, in the national health care system, they have to reduce the price. They take an average of the price increases around the world and say to the drug companies: This is as far as you can go. The same thing happens in Mexico. The same thing happens in virtually every other industrialized country in the world. 
   American drugs--developed in this country, sold to Americans--are sold at a fraction of the cost in other countries. 
   Let me say, that is not the only case where the American drug companies sell at a discount. They sell at a discount to the Federal Government for the Veterans' Administration, for example, and for the Indian Health Service. They bargain with them. The Veterans' Administration, at our hospitals, says to drug companies: If you want to sell these drugs, we demand that you give a discount for the veterans and thereby save the Federal taxpayers a few dollars. The same thing is true with the Indian Health Service. 
   It is also true that insurance companies, HMOs, and managed care companies bargain, as well. They will go to a drug company 
   and say: If you want your drug to be on the formulary, the list of drugs that can be prescribed by the doctors in our plan, then you have to sell at a discount to this insurance company and these doctors. Of course, the insurance company makes out well in that decision, and the patient still gets the drugs, and the discount is there. 
   There is only one group who cannot bargain. It is the largest group in America when it comes to buying drugs--the Medicare beneficiaries. For what is supposed to be a free market system, the only place where it is a so-called ``free market'' is when it comes to seniors in America. 
   Isn't it ironic that these American drug companies charge the highest prices, for the drugs that they sell, to the elderly and disabled in our own country? We are a country which, through the National Institutes of Health, has generated research which has led to the discovery of these drugs. We are a country which, through its Federal agencies, such as the FDA, inspects and approves the manufacturing of these drugs to make sure they are of the highest quality. And with all of the benefits given to pharmaceutical companies under our Tax Code to reduce their tax burden and to increase the profitability of these companies in America, the one group they target to charge the highest prices turns out to be our seniors and our disabled in America. I do not think that is fair. I think it should change. 
   For example, Ciperal is a drug that is used to treat infections. The exact same bottle, the exact same pill, the same amount, made in the same manufacturing plant, costs $171 in Canada but costs $399 in the United States--more than twice as much. 
   What about the drug called Claritin? It is the same company, Schering-Plough. The shape of the bottle in which the pills are sold is different in Canada as compared to the United States, but it is still the same pill, made in the same facility, subject to the same Federal inspection. For a bottle of this pill, Claritin, in Canada, they charge $61; in the United States, at your local pharmacy, $218--more than three times the cost of the drug in Canada. 
   The bottom line is this. The rest of the world gets better deals, and Americans pay far more. This is keeping Medicare beneficiaries from being able to afford prescription drugs. It is just plain unacceptable. 
   If we were to decide this year in Congress to pass a prescription drug benefit under Medicare, I am sure we could devise a system that might work to provide benefits and access to drugs for a lot of seniors and disabled people across our country. 
   If we were to create this benefit package and not address the underlying challenge of the increase in prices each year, each month, sometimes each week, and the  differential in prices between the United States and Canada, any prescription drug benefit program we devise would be bankrupted in no time flat. 
   The Medicare program, as we know, does not include a prescription drug benefit. The reason for this is, of course, when it was enacted in 1965, prescription drugs just didn't play that large a role in health care. But the world has changed. There are so many drugs now that maintain quality of life for people across America that we couldn't have dreamed up 35 years ago. Isn't it ironic that we don't pay for prescription drugs but if a person doesn't take his medicine and gets sick and goes into a hospital, Medicare will pay for the hospitalization. Wouldn't we want to invest a few pennies in prevention rather than spend hundreds of dollars in a cure that might involve some hospitalization? It seems obvious to me. 
   Too many seniors find it virtually impossible to comply with their doctor's orders. As we know, they have to make tough choices between what their doctor tells them is good for them and what they can afford, a choice no one should have to make. According to a report prepared for the Department of Health and Human Services, three out of four Medicare beneficiaries do not have dependable private drug coverage. Some folks on Capitol Hill, in the House and Senate, have suggested this isn't really a problem; they believe that many people have prescription drug coverage. They ought to get out of this Capitol Building into the real world. 
   I think what they will find is this: About a third of the people in the United States have exceptionally good drug coverage in their retirement. I found a lot of them in Illinois. Some of them are retired union workers and their families. Others have benefited from a great plan that takes care of their prescription drugs. They are the exception rather than the rule. 
   A third of the people have prescription drug coverage which is anemic at best; it barely pays the most basic bills and, of course, with large expenses, provides no relief to the seniors who turn to them. 
   Then a third are on their own. Those are the sorriest stories of all, where people are faced with actually paying out of pocket for every single thing they need when it comes to prescription drugs. That tells you, if we rely on the current system without looking to a new benefit, we will leave two-thirds of America behind. Those are the underinsured, when it comes to prescription drugs, and those who are basically uninsured. 
   Incidentally, those who have some sort of prescription drug benefit under HMOs in Illinois tell me over and over again that the copays and deductibles keep going up. Their coverage is virtually evaporating. 
   I met a woman in Chicago, Anita Milton of Morris, IL, who became disabled in 1995 and, in 1996, had a bilateral lung transplant. Her prescription drug costs are $2,500 a month. Now on Medicaid, she has to pay a certain amount each month out of pocket on drugs before she gets the first dollar in coverage. She has an income of $960 a month. That is her only income. She pays up to $638 a month out of pocket for the drugs she needs. Somehow she is supposed to survive on $251 a month. 
   For many elderly people in that circumstance, they have 
   little or no recourse but to move in with their children and try to survive. On a month when her drugs aren't covered, she doesn't meet her spending requirement, so she loses coverage for a full month. In other words, she only receives coverage every other month. 
   This story sounds bizarre, but it is not. It is virtually commonplace to see in America people who have lived a good life, raised their families, contributed so much to this country, paid their taxes, obeyed the laws, and now find themselves captives of a situation they cannot control. A pharmacist in Illinois told me what they are faced with--telling seniors the problems of prescription drug costs is really difficult to deal with. A pharmacist, Linda Esposito, came to my meeting in Chicago and said:  
   Virtually every day pharmacists are faced with older Americans who have assumed that their medications, the prescription that their physician has written for them, is covered by their supplemental Medicare benefits or Medicare itself. All too often they find the insurance isn't there when they really need it to be there.  
   Men and women who want to stay healthy, who want to stay independent, and want to stay out of the hospital find they cannot afford the medications to make that happen. That is why it is important we move forward with a comprehensive drug benefit to the Medicare program for all beneficiaries. America's seniors shouldn't have to pay more than everyone else for prescription drugs. As I have heard from Illinois senior citizens, prescription drug coverage offers a lifeline to them and not a poison bill. Congress must work to offer our seniors this lifeline this year. 
   The record of this Congress over the last several years has been scant, to say the least. There is just very little we even take seriously around here and consider by way of addressing problems that American families face. 
   It has been a frustration to me, as a Senator from the State of Illinois, to go home repeatedly and hear the people I represent raise issues they are concerned with, issues about education, what are we going to do in Washington to help improve schools in America. A bill we passed last week will have virtually no impact whatsoever on education in this country. We have not addressed the most basic requirements to make sure our teachers are well trained and qualified to teach, held accountable for their own standards in their classroom; that kids are held accountable to make certain when they graduate, they can be promoted to another grade and succeed rather than just be pushed along; to try to upgrade and modernize the schools our kids attend so they can deal with modern technology. Has this Congress done anything to address that over the last 3 years? Sadly, the answer is no. 
   The President has proposed these things. This Congress has ignored them. 
   On the issue of health care, whether it is prescription drugs or a Patient's Bill of Rights, I am afraid the drug companies and the insurance companies have really ruled the agenda. We are trying our best to move this issue to the forefront, and those forces are trying their best to keep it out. 
   On the issue of peace and tranquility in our communities, we find people asking whether this Congress can respond with sensible gun control. The honest answer is, it is not likely. 
   The President is holding a summit this week--I am glad he is--bringing in the leaders from Congress and challenging them to look anew at this issue of gun control. 
   When we have reached the point in America where first graders are killing other first graders with guns, we are dealing with a gun crisis. For those who blithely say we have all the laws we need, there is not an idea we should consider, we have everything taken care of, pick up any morning paper and tell me we have everything taken care of. I don't believe that is the case at all. 
   On issue after issue, whether it is education, health care, or sensible gun control, this Congress sits on its hands. The people across America ask of us, the world's so-called greatest deliberative body, when are you going to deliberate? What are you going to do? Sadly, the answer for the last 3 years is little or nothing. 
   I think that is what elections are all about. This coming election in November, the people across America can really issue their own report card on this do-nothing Congress. They can take a look back and see at the end of our work this calendar year what we have achieved. If we leave town without addressing the needs of education, if we leave town without creating a prescription drug benefit under Medicare, if we leave town without increasing the minimum wage from $5.15 an hour to something that is more humane and more livable, if we don't do anything to cope with the health care crisis that has been generated because of HMOs and managed care, if we don't do something about sensible gun control, this Congress will rightly deserve a failing grade. 
   I think it is important we try to come together. For those who say there is no intention on this side of the aisle, the Democratic side, to really find solutions, I think the challenge is on the table to come forward and try  on a bipartisan basis. I will be there, and I think many on my side will as well, to make certain this Congress adjourns this year with not only a record of accomplishment but a record of response for American families. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I totally support this resolution. 
   Could one imagine the Senate today debating education and ignoring the obvious? When the front-page headlines, news story after news story, remind us that mere infants now have access to handguns, that a 6-year-old can take a handgun to school and kill your son, your daughter, grandson, and granddaughter, is this America? Is this the best we can do? I think we can do a lot better. 
   Senator BOXER challenges this Senate to go on record when it comes to school safety. I support her completely. It is important to talk about how you pay for schools. It is important to talk about the qualifications of teachers and how many kids are in a classroom and whether you have access to the Internet. But the most important question is whether you can send that little child you love to school in the morning and expect them to come home safely at night. That is why this resolution is important. Before we start talking about the finer points of improving education, let us first dedicate ourselves to safety in classrooms across America. 
   I will support her resolution. It should receive a unanimous vote. Who in the world can stand here and say we should not be on record against the school violence we find taking place more and more every single day? A little later on in this debate, I will offer a specific grant program through the Department of Education to deal with school violence and gun violence. 
   Make no mistake about it, that 6-year-old didn't go out and purchase that handgun. Some adult failed in their responsibility. I don't know the circumstances; maybe we will never know the circumstances. But time and again, children are getting access to guns with tragic results. Many times, they take them down from the top shelf in the closet and play with them, either harming themselves or another classmate or another one of their friends who ordinarily visits the home. Then the sad stories when they take them to school. What we saw in Michigan is not an exception; it is happening more and more. 
   My wife and I decided early on never to have a firearm in the house as long as our kids were small. We just thought it was too dangerous. That was our family decision. But even though we made that decision, it didn't cross my mind until much later to really wonder what the parents of my kids' friends had decided. That happens, too. Your little boy or girl goes to the house next door to play, and you don't know what those kids are doing. How many times do you pick up the newspaper and read about kids playing with guns and one kid being injured? It happens too often. 
   In this case, we are finding more and more that kids are picking up these guns and carrying them to school, where they find victims in their classmates and teachers. This isn't an isolated situation. Those who want to dismiss it and say, come on, you are just responding to a single headline, ignore the obvious.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I hope the Senate goes on record unanimously, on a bipartisan basis. If it doesn't, I hope families across America who are worried about the safety of their kids ask each and every Senator how we can vote against a resolution saying we are going to make it a national priority in the sense of the Senate to make schools safe and implement policies that reduce the threat of gun violence. 
   I yield for a question.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is a sad reality that with the proliferation of over 200 million guns in America, more and more children who, in my generation, would be the schoolyard bullies are now the kids bringing guns to school, and other children know it. They know about the easy access to these weapons. The kid who used to go out in the schoolyard and punch somebody in the nose now turns out to be the kid who brings the gun to school. It is a sad reality, one that every family in America faces. 
   I don't care if you live in California, Illinois, or Michigan; there is not a school district or a child we can be sure is safe today until we take measures to restore sanity to the classrooms across America, to protect not only the kids but the teachers and all of the parents who share, as we do, the love for these children. 
   I thank the Senator from California for her leadership.

   Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from California is absolutely right. It is totally voluntary. There is no Federal mandate involved. If a school district says they are concerned enough about this problem that they want to put together a program that is going to try to educate children about the danger of guns, that is going to try to educate parents about the safe storage of guns, public service announcements to encourage trigger locks, then they can apply for these funds. It is only $7 million, which by Federal standards is a very small amount of money. 
   I hope it will give some school districts the resources they need to step forward and protect children from needless tragedies which we read about every day.

   Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from California who earlier offered a sense-of-the-Senate amendment as to whether we are going to make a concerted and dedicated effort to reduce violence in the schools. Her leadership on this issue in her State and across the Nation has been a model for all of us. This program I am suggesting is a very modest approach as well. It is a $7 million grant that is available, and when you consider these headlines which I went through earlier about children coming to day care with a gun, a 4-year-old caught a second time bringing a loaded handgun to day care in Cleveland, OH.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the headlines in the morning paper tell the story: America is facing a national gun crisis. Firearms are easy to come by for 6-year-olds and psychotics. 
   The violence is not confined to just the main streets. It is in our homes, our fast-food restaurants, and in our schools. 
   This amendment gives to school districts across America an opportunity to apply for help from the Department of Education for grants so they can educate the children in the school, and their parents, about how dangerous guns can be and how they should be stored safely. 
   It provides money for public service announcements so we can try to reduce the gun violence we read about, sadly, every single day. We know, as sure as we are here this evening, there will be another story in the newspaper in the not-too-distant future of more gun violence in schools. With the Durbin amendment, we at least start to move forward toward reducing that violence by helping schools.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, March 11 will mark the 10th anniversary of the declaration of independence of Lithuania from the domination of the Soviet Union. Lithuania led the way for other Soviet Republics to throw off the yolk of Soviet Communist imperialism, resulting in the disintegration of the Soviet Union. 
   This declaration was not without cost--in January 1991, Soviet paratroopers stormed the Press House in Vilnius, injuring four people. Barricades were set up in front of the Lithuanian Parliament, the Seimas. Soviet forces attacked the television station and tower in Vilnius, killing 13 Lithuanians. One woman was killed when she tried to block a Soviet armored personnel carrier. 
   But these courageous Lithuanians did not suffer and die in vain. Lithuania has now become a vibrant democracy. It has established a free-market economy and the rule of law. Lithuania wants to be fully integrated into Europe, and is seeking membership in the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO. 
   This year we also celebrate the 60th anniversary of the U.S. Congress' insistence that Soviet domination of the Baltic states would not be recognized by the United States. The logic then and the logic now is that the United States will only recognize a free and independent Lithuania. What we celebrate this year is what we must help preserve next year and the year after that. We must carry on that principle today by being sure that Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia are admitted into NATO as an unequivocal statement that we will never tolerate domination of the Baltic states again. 
   I support admitting the Baltic states into NATO and I hope my colleagues here in the Senate will support their entry also in the next round of NATO expansion. 
   That debate we will save for another day, but I am sure all my colleagues can agree on the importance of Lithuania's contribution to freedom and independence for the former Soviet Republics and will join me in congratulating Lithuania in celebrating ten years of that precious freedom and independence. 
   I am honored that my mother was born in a tiny Lithuanian village many years ago; that she came to this country proud of her heritage, but determined to be an American citizen. This Senator, the son of that proud Lithuanian mother, now serves in this great body and takes pride in being able to rise and salute the courageous people of Lithuania on this the occasion of the tenth anniversary of their independence from Soviet domination.

    Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the heroism and sacrifices of the sailors and marines who served in the U.S. Navy's Asiatic Fleet. 
   The Asiatic Fleet established itself as one of the premier assets of the United States Navy during its years of operation. Officially commissioned by the Navy in 1910, The Asiatic Fleet's origins can be traced back to 1845, when the United States first established a naval presence in the Far East. The United States established the Asiatic Fleet to protect American interests in the western Pacific. The sailors and marines of the Asiatic Fleet ensured the safety of United States citizens and foreign nationals and provided humanitarian assistance in that region during the Chinese civil war, the Yangtze Flood of 1931, and the outbreak of Sino-Japanese hostilities. The increasing risks faced by U.S. military personnel serving in this region were highlighted by the accidental bombings and sinking of a U.S. Navy gunboat belonging to the Asiatic Fleet, the U.S.S. Panay, in international waters by Japanese aircraft in 1937--four years before the U.S. entered World War II.  
   Following the declaration of war against Japan, the warships, submarines, and aircraft of the Asiatic Fleet singly or in task forces courageously fought many naval battles against a superior Japanese armada. General Douglas MacArthur evacuated most U.S. military personnel and equipment from the region to prevent them from being destroyed by Japan's military forces, leaving the Asiatic Fleet alone, without reinforcement, to do what it could to obstruct the Japanese advance. During these battles, the men of the Fleet discovered that much of their equipment was defective. It has been estimated that one in three of the Asiatic Fleet's torpedoes, and one fifth of its anti-aircraft ammunition, were duds. Forced to rely on World War I-era equipment, the Asiatic Fleet directly suffered the loss of 22 ships, 1,826 men killed or missing in action, and 518 men captured and imprisoned under the worst of conditions. Many of those who survived later died while being held as prisoners of war. The Asiatic Fleet ceased to exist as a cohesive fighting force on March 1, 1942, when its flagship, the U.S.S. Houston, was sunk by the Japanese near Indonesia. 
   Unfortunately, the heroism of the sailors and marines of the Asiatic Fleet are largely unknown to the American public. Today, March 1, 2000, the 58th anniversary of the Houston's sinking, I want to commend the bravery, resourcefulness and sacrifices of all who served in the United States Navy Asiatic Fleet from 1910 to 1942, especially those sailors and marines who put their lives in harm's way during the first few months of America's participation in World War II. No words can adequately express our nation's debt to its veterans, and it is essential that we provide them with the thanks and recognition they have earned. The American people should always remember the courage and determination displayed by the personnel of the Asiatic Fleet, honoring the sacrifices they made in defense of the United States.

   Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator, though we certainly disagree on approach, I commend him for his interest in education. One thing I found interesting in the analysis of my colleague's bill is the suggestion that most of the benefits for education will go to the wealthiest people in this country. 
   Will the Senator comment on that and tell me whether he believes, as I do, that though we want every family to have an opportunity, if we are going to have limited resources applied for incentives in education, we should look to working families and middle-income families--and lower income families, for that matter, who otherwise may not ever be able to send their kids off to college--as our highest priority, as opposed to the approach of the Senator, which apparently takes the wealthiest families as the highest priority.

   Mr. DURBIN. My argument or observation was we want all families to consider higher education and educational opportunities, regardless of what they are earning. I will just concede for the sake of this debate that the Senator from Georgia is correct, and the $500 IRA that was proposed by the administration, supported by all of us, probably does benefit those who can save. Generally, those are people in higher income categories. 
   My question to the Senator from Georgia is, if he is proposing a new program in addition to this, would it not be better now to focus on those who were not served by that $500 IRA and really focus on those families who may not have the benefit of it if we are going to expand our investment in education? 
   The Treasury Department estimates that under the Senator's bill, the wealthiest 20 percent, the upper one-fifth of families in America, will receive nearly 70 percent of the benefits. Wouldn't it be more fair, since the initial IRA, as my colleague noted, really helps those families, that additional money spent should go to working families and those who maybe have been overlooked by both the administration and the Senate to this point? Why do we want to continue this path of subsidizing families who are the wealthiest in our country?

   Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator, my guess is when we are talking about the upper 20 percent of America, we are not talking about those of 75,000 or less; we are probably talking about $75,000 annual income or more.

   Mr. DURBIN. I will make one final comment and then I will yield the floor because I see the Senator from Massachusetts waiting. I do not disagree with the Senator from Georgia in his intent on helping families pay for education. That, too, is a concern of my colleague, Senator SCHUMER from New York, who supports the President's plan of deductibility of college expenses on your tax returns. I think that is an excellent way of increasing opportunity in education. 
   I do believe, if we are going to take our money and our surplus and invest it in education, we should look to those who, frankly, need the most help. I think it would be the working families. I am afraid the Senator's approach, according to the Treasury Department analysis, gives 70 percent of the benefits to families in the upper 20 percent of America. It tips the scales heavily to the wealthiest families. I agree with the Senator's comments, and I hope his  bill will reflect we should direct more help to working families struggling to put their kids through college. I am afraid, as I see it, his bill does not do that.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his presentation this morning and his leadership throughout his career in the Senate on issues of education. There is no Senator on the floor who can hold a candle to Senator KENNEDY when it comes to issues of education. He not only understands them in a better way than most of us, but he is more articulate, forceful, and committed than any Member of the Senate. It is a pleasure to join him in this debate this morning. 
   I think he has very convincingly laid out the case of the difference between the two parties. Our Republican friends on the opposite side of the aisle have a different view of education than Democrats do. There have been those on the Republican side who have called for abolishing the Department of Education in Washington. There have been those, as well, who have suggested that if the Federal Government has a role, it should be in supporting private schools with the so-called voucher system. 
   There have been those who have opposed suggestions from the President and others that if the Federal Government is to have a role, albeit a small role, it should be focused on things that are so important for every school district across America, whether it is modernizing our school buildings so the kids who presently are enrolled have an opportunity and access to the best technology to prepare them for the future, whether it means teacher training so the teachers we respect so much today can continue to develop their skills, so the children coming in the classroom really are, in many cases, taught by teachers who understand the new technology as well or better than the children. 
   There is a standing joke in my office that if you can't understand how the computer works, look for a teenager. I think most of us understand that young people because they have been raised in this culture and have no fear of this machinery, many times eclipse the skills and talents of even the teachers in the classroom. 
   Democrats believe on focusing some money on teacher training. A better trained teacher is going to do a better job in the classroom. Of course, the reduction of class size is part of this as well. I have seen school districts in my home State of Illinois and the city of Chicago, in a more Republican area in general, Du Page County, a wealthier area, where teachers tell me, with a smaller class size they can pick out the kids who need special help and make sure they keep up with the class. They can also identify the gifted kids and give them better and tougher assignments so they can improve, too. These  are the issues on which Democrats have said time and again we should focus. 
   Our colleague, Senator DODD from Connecticut, has joined us. I am happy he is here because he has a very critical amendment. Where Senator COVERDELL's bill suggests we will focus half of the assistance in this new program on private schools where only 10 percent of our kids attend school and where he has said the vast majority of the resources in his bill will go to the wealthiest families in our country, those in the upper 20 percent, Senator DODD comes in with a much more practical and grounded alternative. 
   I will leave it to the Senator to explain it in detail, the idea that we would provide school districts across America, rich and poor, wherever they are located, assistance in helping to educate kids with special needs. Meet with any school board member, any school superintendent, or many teachers for that matter, and ask them about the challenges of today. They will tell you that kids with special needs, disabled kids, need special attention so they can develop their highest potential. It costs money to do it. It takes extra resources. We have made the commitment in theory. What Senator DODD suggests is we should put our money where our commitment is and say to these school districts that we will help you with these kids. We believe it is worth the investment. 
   At this point I see Senator DODD is on the floor and prepared to discuss his amendment. I am happy to yield to my colleague from the State of Connecticut.

    Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today in honor and acknowledgment of African American History Month, a great tradition honoring and celebrating African Americans. This 74 year tradition, proposed by Dr. Carter G. Woodson, a son of former slaves, seeks to broaden our vision of the world, the legacy of African Americans in our nation's history, and their role in our nation's future.  
   When Dr. Woodson, the Father of Black History, was earning his bachelor's and master's degrees at the University of Chicago, this country had only the slightest respect for people of color. Dr. Wilson's devotion to ensuring that Blacks would escape ``the awful fate of becoming a negligible factor in world thought'' was ridiculed and attacked. However, in the end he prevailed and pioneered the celebration of Negro History Week, now Black History Month. The theme for this year's celebration is ``Heritage and Horizons: The African American Legacy and the Challenge of the 21st Century.'' 
   The African American legacy in my home state of Illinois is great. Illinois is the birthplace of prominent African American writers such as Ellis Cose, Charles Johnson and Lorraine Hansberry. Illinois' native sons, James Cleveland and Miles Davis, are two of the world's greatest musical composers who transcend racial lines. And beloved daughter of Illinois, Katherine Dunham, dancer and choreographer, continues to bring the tradition of great African dance to a wide audience. 
   In addition to a rich history in the arts, African American Illinoisans also have played a significant role in state, local and federal government. Consider, for example, John Jones, the first African American elected to any public office in Cook County; Floy Clements, the first woman elected to the Illinois legislature; Harold Washington, former mayor of Chicago; and Carol Moseley-Braun, the first African American woman elected to the United States Senate. These African Americans, like those who have come before them, continue to shape our nation's history and inspire new generations of African Americans. 
   Today's African Americans have made great strides and overcome a variety of color barriers. The unemployment rate for African Americans has fallen from 14.2% in 1992 to 8.3% in 1999, the lowest annual level on record. The real wages of African Americans have risen rapidly, over 5% in the past two years. Moreover, while the African American child poverty rate is still too high, it fell to 36.7% in 1998, the lowest level on record. However, as these data suggest, there is still more work to be done. 
   The rate of firearm-related injuries is still unacceptably high. Racial profiling on our highways and in our airports and housing developments continues to be a serious problem. The rising cost of tuition continues to place ethnic minorities at an academic and economic disadvantage. The poor conditions and quality of too many of our schools keep children from low socioeconomic households from breeching the digital divide. Racial disparities in mental health and health care are pervasive in our society. And in the Chicago metropolitan area, after a two year decline, the number of reported AIDS cases has jumped 24 percent. Although African Americans represent 13% of the US population, they account for more than half of new HIV infections. 
   AIDS knows no boundaries. This month, as we examine and reflect on the legacy and challenges of African Americans, we must not forget our brothers and sisters in Africa. Approximately 23.3 million adults and children are infected with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa, which has about 10% of the world's population but nearly 70% of the world's infected people. I recently witnessed the devastation of this deadly virus first hand--isolation, prejudice, and a multitude of new orphans. This month, as we celebrate the heritage and horizons of African Americans, we must ask ourselves, what is on the horizon for our African brothers and sisters? 
   These are just some of the problems which require our attention if we are to fulfill the dreams of visionaries like Dr. Woodson, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and other African Americans who continue to serve as role models for all Americans. Dr. Woodson believed in looking back in order to look forward. In this special month that seeks to learn from the past and shape our future, we need to examine how to build on the legacy of hope left to us from those who have gone before us. 
   As we move forward into this new millennium, let us extend Dr. Woodson's mission past the month of February and make it part of the fabric of our lives. Let us look to our forefathers, no matter what their race, creed, or color, and unite in our diversity to build one America and to build a world where every child has hope for the future.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today on the floor of the Senate to pay tribute to a great friend who passed away on Sunday. Her name was Jeanne Simon, the wife of my friend and former colleague in the House, my predecessor in the Senate, Senator Paul Simon of Illinois. Jeanne Simon passed away in the early morning hours on Sunday in her home in Makanda, IL, in the southern part of our State. 
   She had been suffering for several months from a brain tumor, and the end was obvious when I last saw her a few weeks ago. As Paul Simon told me when I called and asked if we could get together: Her spirits are good. He was certainly right. We laughed over dinner and reminisced over old political experiences and had a great time, as we did for over 30 years in similar meetings and dinners. 
   Jeanne Simon was an extraordinary person. She was one of the first women to serve in the Illinois House of Representatives. She was a graduate of Northwestern Law School and served as an assistant State's attorney when very few women were involved in the profession, let alone as prosecutors. 
   She met another young legislator when she served in Springfield, IL, a State representative named Paul Simon. The two hit it off and decided to get married in 1960. Jeanne Simon put her legislative and professional career aside to become a wife and a mother and to become a help mate, not just at home but in the political career of her husband, Paul Simon. 
   President Clinton was wont to say when he was elected: America got two--buy one, get one free--in terms of the 
   First Lady and her contribution to the Nation. We felt the same in the State of Illinois. Whenever we looked at the Simon package, it was Paul and Jeanne Simon and the kids wrapped up in a very attractive package with a polka dot bow tie. Time after time, election after election, the people in Illinois turned to Paul Simon as Congressman, as Lieutenant Governor, and finally as Senator and bought the package. 
   Politics is a game of individual statistics. We talk about who won, who lost. In sports we talk about team statistics, but when it came to the Simons, we were dealing with a team statistic. We knew that whenever Paul Simon was there fighting for Illinois and the causes in which he believed, Jeanne Simon was right at his side. 
   She had special passions and commitments to literacy and to education. She served as chair of the National Commission on Libraries, and one of the last things I ever heard from her was a call late in the session last year: Check on that appropriation for libraries. She was committed to it. 
   Jeanne Simon was the kind of person, too, whom I trusted in terms of her judgment. She was honest and forthright and you knew when she stood up for a cause it was because she really believed in it. 
   How many people, men and women, in Illinois political life were inspired and encouraged by Jeanne Simon over the years. She has left a great legacy. I consider myself to be one of the beneficiaries of that legacy. Now that she has passed away, we can reflect on the fact that even as a wife and mother of a great politician like Paul Simon, she left an enduring contribution to the State of Illinois and to the Nation. 
   Jeanne Simon will be missed, and many in this Chamber who knew her and worked with her on so many important issues will appreciate, as I have, what a great and enduring legacy she left with her life. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Several Senators addressed the Chair.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, before addressing the President's budget, I wish to address an issue that is more personal and a lot closer to home. Chicago lost a great friend yesterday, and I lost a great friend as well. Bob Collins, top-rated radio personality in the city of Chicago, died in an airplane crash that was reported around the Nation. 
   Bob Collins was an extraordinary person. When you think of what creates a community, it is a person such as Bob Collins. His voice every morning in Chicago was a blend of wisdom and humor that really set people off on a good day. I can recall visiting his studios so many times and feeling right at home. 
   Bob was a typical Chicagoan, a typical Midwesterner, and I think that is the reason for his success. Our thoughts, of course, today are with his family and his wife Christine, but we should reflect for a moment on the great contribution which this man made in over 25 years at radio station WGN. 
   Great cities are made up of great people and Chicago is no exception. Bob Collins, at WGN Radio since 1974, was a combination of town crier, court jester, wise counselor, and fellow common man. A Shakespeare quote comes to mind: ``He was wont to speak plain and to the purpose.'' 
   He started at age 13 at a radio station in Lakeland, FL. When he was 14, he had his own show, and radio was still at that time everyone's link to the world. Until the day he died, he remained Chicago residents' link to each other and to a wider community.  
   What was it about Bob Collins that made hundreds of thousands of Chicagoans tune in virtually every weekday morning? What was it about Bob Collins that enabled him not only to follow his fabled predecessor Wally Phillips, but to create his own following? 
   Well, like Bob, it is fairly simple. In an age of political extremes and shock radio, we found in Bob Collins an observant, thoughtful, plain spoken but fair and common man who never lost touch with the community he loved. He connected with us and with the families across Illinois and Chicago who were his loyal fans. Shaving in the morning, drinking coffee, fighting the daily commute, Bob was there at our side. 
   In addition to winning our ears and hearts, Bob's unparalleled ability to mix humor, human interest stories, and intelligent, thoughtful news won him award after award. His commitment to Chicago did not end when the microphone was turned off. He was always the champion of the little guy. He received the Salvation Army award known as ``The Other Award'' because of his spirit and his dedication. 
   His hobbies included motorcycling and flying. He was a man who enjoyed life and every minute of it. WGN's Spike O'Dell signed on this morning and announced: WGN Radio, Chicago. This is the Bob Collins Show.'' These words remind us that mornings in Chicago will always belong to Bob Collins, and he will continue to ride and fly and laugh through all of our memories. 
   Thank you, Uncle Bobby. Chicago is going to miss you.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the topic this morning for our morning business is the President's budget, a budget released by the President several days ago that is a continuation of a strategy of the past 7 years, a strategy which has paid off for America. There are those who have rejected this budget. There are those who have said it is a disaster. There are those who have used the timeworn cliche that the President's budget is dead on arrival. For those who want to use this medical analogy, let me remind them of another medical admonition: First, do no harm. Those who would criticize the President's budget should come up with their alternative. Let them see if they can match the performance of the Clinton administration over the last 7 years. Let them come up with a formula that is sensible, that will move this country forward as quickly and as positively as President Clinton's plans have during the course of his administration. 
   His budget says we have a strategy based on fiscal discipline, a strategy which will bring down the national debt and say to our children: We will not saddle you or burden you with debt that we incurred during our lifetime for our purpose. 
   That is the linchpin and pillar of the President's budget, and it is sound. It is sound for our future. 
   The President says that as we bring down this national debt, we will preserve Social Security so it is there not only for the current retirees, but the baby boomers and beyond. We will invest in Medicare, an issue which many Republicans do not even want to discuss. We will make certain that the health insurance plan for the elderly and disabled in America is adequately funded and the doctors, hospitals, and health care providers across America know that Medicare has a bright future. 
   The Nation is witnessing the first back-to-back budget surpluses in 43 years, the smallest welfare rolls in 30 years, the lowest overall crime rate in 25 years, the lowest unemployment rate in 30 years. The statistics go on and on. 
   Whether it is a Presidential candidate or a Member of Congress who is critical of President Clinton's budget and approach, my challenge to them is: How would you do it better? What can we look to in history to point to a better model than what we have seen over the past 7 years? We reached a milestone in America's economic history. Our economic expansion is the longest, a remarkable 107 months of consecutive growth. In fact, it was reported yesterday that we have had productivity growth of 5 percent. America is on a roll, and those who would derail it for their own political purposes had best step back and think twice. 
   There are clearly differences which I will have with the President on specifics in the budget. There are differences which will come out during the course of the congressional debate, but whether they come from the Democratic side or Republican side, let us not lose sight of our goal. 
   Alan Greenspan, as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, last year spoke to several committees in Congress--and he continues to do that--and admonished us to keep in mind the basic things we need to do as a nation to continue to progress. Bringing down the national debt is his highest priority. 
   President Clinton's budget invests money in those things that will keep this economy moving forward--in the people of America. He has not given up on the families and people who have made this economic recovery such a reality. 
   He is investing in education so the next generation of skilled workers and leaders will be there. He is investing in health care to take away one of the major concerns of every family in America: affordability of quality health care. 
   Yes, the President does have a tax cut plan, but it is a targeted, specific tax cut plan--not the broad-based, overwhelming plan which we hear from Presidential candidate George W. Bush or some leaders in Congress, but one that is more sensible, more targeted, more consistent with maintaining our economic growth. 
   The President says families worry about paying for college education; let's help them; let's give them a deduction for college education expenses. In doing that, we will start to enable more and more young people to realize their dream of a college education and pass it along to their children. Is there anything more important for the future of our country? 
   The President says as well there should be a tax credit for long-term care for the fastest growing segment of the American population--people over the age of 85, our parents and our grandparents, many of whom will need help in their advancing years. Their sons and daughters care about them, and we need to help them with the long-term care tax credit. 
   The earned-income tax credit is a term with which many people 
    are not familiar, but it is a tax credit for working families who are not making much money. We want to encourage work and help families, and the President, focusing on the earned-income tax credit, leads us in the right direction. 
   Of course, there are those who say if we are going to have a surplus over the next 10 years, then the first thing we should do is give a massive tax cut primarily to wealthy people. Yet we know quite honestly that is irresponsible. The American people know that intuitively. First, the surplus is not in hand and, second, to take whatever surplus we have and give it away as a permanent tax cut is to say to people across America that we do not need to pay down our national debt, we do not need to invest in America's children and families. We do not need to create tax cuts that are more targeted. 
   The President has it right. The President has said to the American people: Let us not ruin a good thing; let us move forward. 
   There are many things with which we need to deal in this time of prosperity which we may never have another chance to consider. If we cannot at this moment in time reach out to the American society and help those who are struggling with day-to-day problems in their family and life, when will we ever do it? 
   If we cannot extend the protection of health insurance, as the President has proposed, to children and families across America at this moment in time, when will we do it? Those who are 55 years of age who, frankly, may face retirement and loss of health insurance need to have the option of buying into the Medicare plan. 
   Those who are already retired and the disabled who rely on Medicare need to have the protection of a prescription drug plan, a benefit which is common to almost every health insurance plan. The President has said we can do that, consistent with reducing the national debt and protecting Social Security as well as Medicare. There are certain  things at this moment in time which we can do. 
   If we do not invest at this moment in time in education for future generations, how shortsighted we are. My friends on the Republican side of the aisle do not view the educational issue as many of us do. Their idea of education is a voucher plan to help those who would send their children to private schools. 
   I certainly can sympathize with these families struggling to do that. My wife and I sent our kids to Catholic schools and I attended Catholic schools. But our first obligation as a government is to the 90 to 95 percent of the students in public education, the kids in Minneapolis or Chicago or Los Angeles or New York who want to have the very best schools and the very best teachers. 
   The President has proposed money for teacher training to improve their skills so they can continue to bring the next generation forward well versed and well trained in the technology with which we are dealing. 
   There were statistics given to us yesterday about some of the things that have happened during the Clinton administration which are often overlooked by the critics of the President's budget. Let me tell you two or three which I think are amazing. 
   Record budget deficits have been erased. Do my colleagues know the Congressional Budget Office suggested that this year we were going to have a deficit of $455 billion? That was their projection when President Clinton came to office. President Clinton came to Congress and said: I have a plan that is going to turn this around. Instead of deficits, we can move America forward. 
   Some of us believed the President was right. In fact, I voted for the President's 1993 plan. There were Members of Congress running around hollering, ``The sky is falling if the President's plan passes; it will be nothing but a disaster.'' I invite those Members of Congress to look out the window at the bright blue sky 
    of our economic prosperity because of the President's leadership in 1993, because Members of Congress, all Democrats, and Vice President GORE, who cast the tie-breaking vote, made a courageous decision. Some of my colleagues in the House of Representatives lost their next election because of that vote. If it is any comfort to them, they did the right thing for America, and history has proven them right because instead of the anticipated $455 billion deficit this year, we are anticipating instead a surplus of over $100 billion. What an amazing turnaround. 
   We have had the largest paydown of debt in the history of the United States. Those who argue the Democrats are not fiscally responsible cannot really say it at this moment because President Clinton's leadership and the following of Members of Congress have led to the paydown of more than $290 billion in debt over the last 2 years, and we can continue to do that. 
   The President is right, this should be our highest priority. We collect every single day in America $1 billion in taxes from individuals and businesses and families to pay interest on our debt. If we follow the President's lead and eliminate the publicly held debt, it will dramatically reduce those interest payments, and that is good for this country. That is money that can be spent on good programs for education and health care and given back to families in the form of tax cuts. 
   We have seen Government reduced and diminished in size. We have seen as a percentage of the gross domestic product the percentage spent on Government coming down. This is what America asked for; this is what they received. 
   Of course, with the President's budget, there will be a great amount of debate. The Congress will get its chance. The Republican leadership in the House and Senate can come up with its work product and put it next to the President's, and we can make our choice. 
   I will tell you this. It should be measured by one standard: Does it meet the test of common sense? Will the proposals coming out of this Republican Congress keep America moving forward? Can they explain to families across America that we should break with a policy that has done so much for so many in this country? I think they are going to be hard pressed to do it. But it is the nature of our deliberative process that they will have that opportunity. 
   Mr. President, at this time I am prepared to yield the floor and the remainder of our morning business time to my colleague from the State of Minnesota.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, yesterday, the President of the United States announced his budget message, which is also the last budget message of the Clinton administration. When you consider the history of this administration, beginning with deep deficits, and we are now at a point in our history where we have had the longest economic expansion in the history of the United States, it is an entirely different budget message. 
   I still recall when only a few years ago one of our colleagues, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, ORRIN HATCH, came to the floor to say to the assembled Senators that we had reached such a desperate point in American history that we had to amend the Constitution of the United States to put in place what was known as the balanced budget amendment, so that Federal courts would have the authority to stop Congress from spending. It was a desperate move, supported by Democrats and Republicans alike. We had so many years of red ink and so many deficits that many people thought there was no way it was going to get better, short of creating a new constitutional force--the force of the Federal judiciary--to stop the Congress from spending and to require the kind of fiscal discipline for which American families were asking. 
   What a difference 3 years later. We have debated, over the last year or so, what we are going to do with the surplus, not with the deficit. We are no longer walking around in sack cloth and ashes through the Halls of Congress saying another torrent of red ink is about to hit us. We are talking about an economy that continues to grow, with employment growing--unemployment, I think, last year was the lowest in 30 years in our Nation. 
   People are buying businesses, building homes, and inflation is being held in check. It is a great period in our history for most families across the Nation. The President's budget message now says to us, since we have turned that corner, since we are no longer talking about deep deficits but, rather, a different era in Government spending, as well as our economy, let us look at it in a more positive fashion.

   Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from New York. 
   Of course, we have our images--the Republican image and the Democratic image. We try to paint each other's image. In this situation, though, the Senator from New York makes the point: Just look at the facts. Don't look at the rhetoric or listen to the rhetoric. Don't look at all the things that are said in political campaigns but look at the facts. The facts show we are bringing down the debt at a faster rate than at anytime in our history. 
   I think more Americans--and particularly business people--are interested in seeing the debt of this Nation reduced than some grandiose plan for a tax cut that benefits the wealthiest people in this country. They would rather see us take the fiscally responsible, disciplined approach of bringing down their debt because they know that reduces the burden on our children. 
   Let me speak for a second about the tax burden for typical families in America. That is another thing that is often said. Of course, taxes are out of hand. But listen to this. At the same time all of these good things are happening to our fiscal house, the typical American family will shoulder the lowest Federal tax burden since 1978. It is amazing to them that their tax revenues are increasing because, frankly, people are making more money. You see it all the time for the middle-income and lower-income families--the lowest tax burden in over 20 years. That is something that is important to maintain. 
   I think it is responsible for the President to come forward and say: if we are  going to have tax cuts, let us target them to these middle- and lower-income families. Let's look at things such as a long-term care tax credit because the largest growing segment of our population in America is those over the age of 85. Roughly half of them will need some specialized medical assistance for problems they are going to face. Their children and grandchildren need help in paying for that. The President's long-term care tax credit is a step in that direction. 
   I would like to ask my colleague from New York if he would yield. He has a proposal embodied in the President's budget that tries to help families pay for college education expenses, another one of the President's targeted tax cuts. 
   Would the Senator from New York be willing to explain that?

   Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from New York, because I think when we talk about tax cuts, most Americans will, of course, applaud the idea of tax cuts, but they want to have responsible, targeted tax cuts to address specific problems, as the Senator from New York addressed with his suggestion about deducting college education expenses and the long-term care concerns of virtually every family across America. 
   We are also talking about increasing the earned-income tax credit under the President's budget. What is that all about? If you are a working person in a low-income situation with a family, we want to give you a helping hand. We want to reward work. We want to strengthen families. That is what the earned-income tax credit is about. 
   Let me mention two or three other points, and then I will yield the floor to my colleague from Washington, who is also here to speak on the President's budget. 
   The benefits of fiscal discipline for our economy have been enormous. This budget continues the idea of fiscal discipline leading to a stronger economy with targeted investments and the things Americans hold dear--targeted tax cuts to help families in difficult circumstances. 
   Interest rates are lower than they would have been otherwise because we have reduced the debt of this Nation, helping to fuel 7 consecutive years of double-digit investment growth for the first time in our Nation's history. 
   When I first came to Congress under President Reagan in 1982 and 1983, virtually every problem in America was blamed on Jimmy Carter. It was said that the Carter administration had left such a terrible legacy that America was just deep in the mire and would never be able to get out. I thought that was a reasonable thing to say for a while. But the Republicans continued to say it year after year. Pretty soon we were 5 or 6 years into the Reagan administration, and they were still blaming Jimmy Carter. I wonder what the Republican Party will say now about the record under the Clinton administration. 
   This President can't take credit, nor does he try, for all of the economic goodness in this country. But certainly his leadership has provided a role, with the Congress, with the Federal Reserve, and brought us to this position in our history. 
   We have seen this dramatic increase in our Nation's economic growth of a 4.7 annual growth rate from 1981 to 1992, and now a 12.1 percent real annual increase in investment in business equipment and software since 1993. Unemployment is the lowest in a generation--4.0 percent. We are also seeing the longest economic expansion in our Nation's history. 
   The bottom line is this. We believe the President's budget--the one he comes forward with now, this positive message of continued economic growth--says keep the fiscal discipline for a strong economy and make strategic investments, not in big government but smart government. 
   Take a look at the President's budget over a 10-year period of time. You will find that he is slightly below the funding for current services. That means, if you apply the rate of inflation for every single year to last year's budget, just keeping up with inflation at the end of 10 years, the President's proposal for defense and nondefense spending is less than the increase for the rate of inflation. He is asking for not big government but smart government investments in education, health care--things families hold dear--and attractive, targeted tax cuts that American families applaud 
   from Illinois and across the Nation.

   Mr. DURBIN. That is exactly right. The Senator from South Dakota, the minority leader, has made the point. I think it is one that bears repeating. Those who argue that we are ``growing'' the Government at the expense of family needs across America just don't have the facts straight. 
   Our gross domestic product, the sum total of goods and services in this country, continues to show a decline in the percentage spent on Government.

   Mr. DURBIN. The Senate minority leader is correct. I think it is a sharp contrast to some of the rhetoric we hear on the Presidential campaign trail from the Republican candidates. Some have suggested again this theory of massive tax cuts that go way beyond our ability to pay without raiding the  Social Security trust fund. I think that has become an accepted premise for all budgets on Capitol Hill, Republican and Democrat alike: We are going to say the Social Security trust fund is not going to be raided; we will set it aside. We hear candidates on the campaign trail calling for tax cuts that require raiding the Social Security trust fund. 
   The President does not. He says we will hold to that basic principle. I think in so doing, he is standing for principles Americans believe in: Protect Social Security and make certain we bring down the debt incurred by Social Security as a way of forcing fiscal discipline in the process.

   Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from South Dakota has been on Capitol Hill a few years longer than I have. I cannot recall a budget such as this budget, one that is so positive, that looks to the future with such optimism, a budget based on reality and on fiscal discipline. 
   Many politicians on Capitol Hill throw charges around about irresponsible people, favoring increased taxes, big government spending and new programs. This budget says to America, we can continue this economic expansion if we are careful, if we make sure we bring down this debt and do it in a responsible way, with a targeted investment, so America can grow, so our families are healthy, so our children are educated. 
   I believe the Senator from South Dakota has made that point again. I hope during the course of this debate on the budget our friends across the aisle will be as honest with this side as we will be with their side. We should accept the premise that we are not going to raid Social Security, that we are going to reduce the publicly held debt of this Nation to zero by 2015 while making sure Social Security and Medicare are strong for years to come. 
   Often our friends on the Republican side of the aisle do not want to mention the word ``Medicare.'' Yet for tens of millions of Americans, Medicare is crucial. We need to make it part of this debate as well.

   Mr. DURBIN. I close by saying the old cliche, ``If it ain't broke, don't fix it,'' applies to this situation. Our economy isn't broken; it is strong. This budget will continue our economic growth as a nation. In this budget I can say to my children and grandchildren: We are doing the right thing. We are reducing the debt of the Nation so that your burden is reduced as well. We are providing for Social Security so that this Senator and many others, when it comes time for retirement, will have Social Security to turn to. A strong Medicare will be there as well. We are going to invest in our future in terms of education, health care, the things Americans value, and provide tax cuts targeted for middle- and low-income families to deal with long-term care expenses as well as college education expenses and the other burdens they face. 
   I challenge my friends on the other side of the aisle, in the true spirit of this deliberative body, to come forward with a better budget. Let's debate it on the floor. I am prepared to say at this moment that the principles behind the President's budget are principles I endorse. They are principles I think most of the American families endorse. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, Senators FEINSTEIN and FEINGOLD, for joining me to speak about AIDS today. I might add there are others who were not able to be here because of scheduling problems. 
   I, too, have just returned from a trip to Africa. Let me say at the outset there are some who question the value of Congressional travel. I wish they would look at it from a different perspective. I think the Senators who spoke on the floor on this issue, Senator FEINGOLD included, have benefited greatly from traveling to Africa, not just because we have seen firsthand  this epidemic and its devastation, but frankly because it is energizing. Seeing people, real people and their travails, their hardships because of this epidemic, causes many of us to dedicate ourselves to do something. 
   In an epidemic of such Biblical proportions as the AIDS epidemic in Africa, many of us are humbled, as we should be. I came back and met up with Senator FEINGOLD, whom I know had a similar interest, and Senator FEINSTEIN, who helped introduce the amendment which was discussed earlier, and I spoke with Senator ORRIN HATCH, a Senator from Utah, who has a similar passion on this issue. I have spoken to Senator BILL FRIST, a Senator from Tennessee, chairman of the Foreign Relations Subcommittee on African Affairs. I sincerely believe on this issue, more than any other issue, we should put party labels aside. I think we are dealing with not merely another political issue, and certainly not any political agenda; when we speak of AIDS in Africa we are dealing with a Holocaust without a Hitler. We are dealing with the greatest moral challenge of our time. Those are large statements, I understand. But as you listen to the statistics that have been noted in earlier debate about the epidemic, I do not believe I am overstating it at all. 
   Sub-Saharan Africa has been far more severely affected by AIDS than any other part of the world. Approximately 23 million adults and children are infected with HIV in that part of the world. They have about 10 percent of the world's population, 70 percent of the world's HIV-infected people. Though an estimated 13.7 million Africans have already lost their lives to AIDS, including 2.2 million who died in 1998, we are going to see these numbers increase dramatically. 
   This was my first trip to Africa. I tried to make an earlier trip with a Congressional delegation 10 years ago, and I was denied a visa by the South African Government. Those were the days of apartheid, and as a Congressman I had voted consistently against apartheid. They obviously had read my voting record and said they wanted me to stay home; they did not want me to visit their country. 
   Things have changed. Apartheid is over. There is majority rule in South Africa. Under the inspired leadership of Nelson Mandela and now President Mbeki, this country has a great future. They offered a visa and an invitation to come visit, and I did. I visited Kenya and Uganda as well. 
   I started out this trip thinking I would focus on issues I am familiar with such as food aid. I have been involved in agriculture and food assistance for as long as I have been in the House of Representatives and the Senate. I think these programs are so essential, where America takes its bounty and shares it with people who are hungry, people who are starving, around the world. 
   I also wanted to focus on microcredit. Ten years ago in Bangladesh, I learned of the Grameen Bank and similar microcredits that were producing miraculous results. These are small loans, $50, $100, $200, primarily to women to give them a chance to buy a cow or some chickens or some goats or some tools or to expand their stall at the marketplace. Mr. President, 98 percent of these microcredit loans are repaid. It is a wonderful program, and it elevates people to a much higher level in terms of their living standards. 
   So I went looking for food and microcredit programs, realizing I would be discussing the AIDS issue as part of it. I quickly came to the realization that AIDS is an issue which is overwhelming the continent of Africa. Every other issue takes second tier to the AIDS issue. That became the focal point of the trip. 
   The three countries we visited, South Africa, Kenya, and Uganda, represent such different attitudes and different approaches when it comes to the AIDS epidemic. 
   South Africa: I have a photo I took and have blown up. This is a rural health clinic in Ndwedwe, which is right outside of Durban, South Africa. This was a lovely young mother and her beautiful little boy who sat in the front row of this clinic which I visited. 
   Americans help this clinic stay open. Americans help this clinic have a nurse come in each day and have a doctor come in once a month. These villagers walk sometimes hours to bring their children and members of their families in for medical care. 
   This beautiful little boy, as you can see--maybe you cannot see on the television--has the traditional Zulu bracelet made out of hair. His mother has the scarring on the cheeks, which is part of the ceremony of the Zulu tribes. They invited me to this clinic to meet some of the people being served. 
   There was a lady sitting right behind this mother and child, and she came up to speak. When she stood up, you could tell she was nervous. She had on a T-shirt and, over that, a long-sleeved shirt. This was a few weeks ago, and it was very warm in South Africa at that time. 
   As she came forward, she was clearly nervous about speaking with us. She very calmly buttoned every button on her shirt all the way up to her neck. She stood in front of this assembled group, and she was very quiet. Then she said in Zulu: Unity, unity, unity, unity; in unity there is strength. Every time she said the word, the crowd answered her. Then she summoned her courage and told her story about how 2 years ago she was diagnosed with tuberculosis and has heart problems and may need surgery and how important this clinic is to her. 
   At the very end of her talk, she said: And I have AIDS, and I don't know what will happen to my children. And she started crying. 
   The man who was the master of ceremonies at this little gathering asked her to sit down on a bench next to me as she was crying. I reached up and put my arm on her shoulder, and this audience, wide-eyed, gasped that I would touch her. A doctor who traveled with us stood up and said to the people assembled on this porch: Do you see this? Do you see this American politician? He is touching her. You will not get this AIDS epidemic if you just touch someone. 
   That reflects the level of ignorance, the level of denial in South Africa about an epidemic that has reached and touched 4 million people out of some 40 million. They do not understand the basics. 
   In 1998 on World AIDS Day, a South African woman stood up and said: I have AIDS. She returned to her village that evening and was beaten to death because they believed that was how you could end the scourge. 
   The Chicago Tribune did an amazing series about the AIDS epidemic, one that I took out of the paper recently. They talked about another town in South Africa, Esidubwini, and they told a story about a lady, Thandiwe Mwandla, who was diagnosed with AIDS, and after the diagnosis, no one would buy her sugarcane, her bananas, her peaches. They would not buy anything she touched. She said at one point that her neighbors walked a broad circle around her. She had the stigma of AIDS. She said: We get sick, and we get poor, and we die lying to ourselves. 
   The Tribune wrote in this story what I consider to be a very inspiring paragraph:  
   Staring into the abyss of an incomprehensibly brutal epidemic, it is plain how the 23 million people who live with HIV in Africa can drift easily into numbing fatalism, or a fierce, hardening shell of denial.  
   We saw that shell of denial in South Africa, a country which looks more like Europe than any other part of Africa, a country which accounts for 30 percent of the economy of sub-Saharan Africa, a country where many people are pinning their hopes that they see 
   the rebirth of Africa in the 21st century. Yet, devastated by this disease, it has been unwilling to face it. 
   From there we went to Kenya. In Kenya, there is a different circumstance--some positive, some not so positive. First, this is a photo we took of this little fellow in a slum in Nairobi, Kenya. It is called Kibera. It is a squatters slum in the middle of the city. People from the rural countryside who cannot make a living pile into this slum. They squat, set up their huts, and try to create a life and existence. 
   I asked how many people live in this slum. They said: Somewhere between 500,000 and 800,000; we are not sure, it changes so quickly. There is virtually no sanitation, no water. It all has to be brought in. And there certainly is no health care. 
   Kenya is ravaged by AIDS as well. Sadly, for a long period of time they denied it. They did little about it. Just  recently there was an indication that they are going to start admitting it and dealing with it. This political denial is part of the problem, and we in the United States have to be part of the solution in convincing these governments in Africa that what is at stake is not just this little boy but the future of a continent. 
   From Kenya we went to Uganda, and thank God it was the last stop on the trip because what we saw in Uganda suggested to me that there is no reason to despair, we should keep our hope alive, there is a chance to deal with this epidemic. 
   The reason Uganda is so far ahead of many other Third World countries is an interesting story. 
   About 10 years ago, President Museveni of Uganda sent some of his Ugandan soldiers to Cuba to be trained to fight rebels in the countryside. After a few weeks, he received a message from the Cuban Government. They said: We are sending your soldiers home. Of course, his Government asked why. And they said: Because half your soldiers you sent to Cuba have HIV. 
   That was 10 years ago. It was stunning for them to realize that what they thought was an isolated disease now infected half of the military. 
   We met some of the soldiers--in fact, some were HIV positive--in each of these countries who have now come forward and dealt with this in a more open and forthright way. 
   When those soldiers came back from Cuba to Uganda, at about that same time, one of the more prominent figures in music in Uganda, a man by the name of Philly Lutaaya, announced publicly that he had AIDS. By going public and talking to the people of Uganda, he achieved, in many ways, what Magic Johnson achieved in the United States. He suddenly raised our eyes from our other life's undertakings to look straight into the eyes of someone whom we knew and admired and thought this would never happen to. 
   Uganda then set out on a program to reduce the incidence of HIV infection, and when they tested the pregnant women of that country, they found that 30 percent of them were HIV positive. They started pushing for abstinence, faithfulness, and condoms as an effort to reduce the incidence of HIV infection. Ten years later, they cut that down from 30 percent of pregnant women to 15 percent--a dramatic improvement. Yet, in this country of 17 million people, there are some 1.7 million AIDS orphans today. 
   If you travel around Uganda and see how they have dealt with this epidemic and the success they have achieved, you come to understand human nature and the strengths of people who are facing the worst possible outcome: an early death from an incurable disease. 
   We went to a clinic called The AIDS Support Organization, TASO. It started many years ago with a handful of people and has grown into tens of thousands of HIV-positive people who come there when they have a problem, when they are fighting off an infection. They do not have the AZT cocktail. They can never dream of that. Countries which spend $2, $3 per capita annually on public health cannot even imagine spending $1,000 to treat AIDS. It is beyond their comprehension. 
   How do they get by? With the basics: With some antibiotics to try to get through each infection. They talk about nutrition and improving their lifestyle, eliminating alcohol and all sorts of things to make them stronger so they can cope with these infections. 
   There is another element that is equally, if not more, important. At TASO, there is a choir, a group of about 30, who perform for those who visit. They are all men and women, mothers and fathers, who have AIDS themselves. 
   They sing when you come by. 
   In Africa, it is not unusual that when you go to a group, they will sing, hello; when you leave, they sing, good-bye. When you are there, they sing about what they are thinking about. It is an African style that really grows on you. 
   But the TASO choir sang some songs they had written. Some of them are very basic--``When We Come Together We Feel Strong.'' This support group keeps the people going, day in and day out, to know that others suffer from this disease and that they can rely on one another for consoling and for strength. I am proud that the U.S. Government, through the US Agency for International Development, helps support this TASO clinic. 
   As I watched this choir and listened to them sing--and they were very good--I looked into their eyes and thought: There must be some anger or resentment about this. 
   There is almost a resignation to this disease, this HIV. One of the songs, which a young lady named Grace had written for the TASO choir is entitled ``Why Me?'' It just breaks your heart to hear them sing: ``Why me? Why him? Why her? Why you? Why me?" 
   We went to another project, which I think is a good investment, a support group called NACWOLA, the National Community of Women Living with AIDS. It is a group that counsels women with AIDS and children. They have a little house in which they come together and meet on a regular basis. They talk to one another and try to help one another. 
   They have a special project. It is called the ``Memory Book.'' Mothers sit down and try to write their life's story in this book, with family photos, and they talk about where they came from and who their parents were and experiences they have had. And they talk about their children because, you see, they want to leave these books for their kids, so that when they are gone--and they know that day is coming--their children will have this memory book to look at. 
   I sat on the porch there at the NACWOLA house in Kampala, Uganda, as two of the mothers, Beatrice and Jackie, read to me from their books. I realized then that I was in a nation that had turned into a hospice. These people were not crying. They were not angry. They were doing all they could do. They were trying to get by every day and leave a legacy for the kids who were playing in the yard. 
   The kids gathered around us and started singing. When they started singing, they talked about their future. They know their parents have AIDS. They know their lives are uncertain. They said: We hope we don't end up with cruel stepparents. We hope we don't end up on the streets. As they were singing, I looked behind me, and there were the mothers holding the Memory Books. 
   That is the state of Africa today. Some people ask: Why should we care? It is half a world away. We will never see these people. Of course, a lot of things have devastated Africa through the generations. I think there is more to the story. 
   The AIDS epidemic, most people believe, started in Africa. It is questionable when it started, but most people think it started there. It is now a worldwide epidemic. It is naive to believe that you can contain this kind of health problem and believe that it is not going to travel beyond other countries' borders. 
   Equally important, I think we understand, as Americans, one of the things that makes us different from some other people in the world is that we do care and we do try to make a difference. I think we can make a significant difference when it comes to this AIDS epidemic in Africa. 
   Let me tell you some of the things we can do and some of the things we are doing. 
   Senator FEINGOLD talked about the medical research going on in Africa. It is not at the same level as medical research in the United States. You do not have drug companies that are inspired by huge profits and think if they can find the cure to AIDS they are 
   going to make billions of dollars. That isn't going to happen. These folks are looking at medical research at a much different level. 
   At Mulago Hospital in Kampala, Uganda, they have a project underway where they are testing this drug, Nevirapine. Nevirapine has been mentioned on the floor a couple times. A dosage of this drug to a mother at the time she goes into labor, and then a dose to the baby, basically cuts in half the transmission of AIDS from mother to child. This is a simple drug, at $4 a dose, which can make a big difference. It is not likely to be a big seller in the United States because no drug company will get rich at $4 a dose. But it works. It appears to work very well. 
   Thank goodness the Centers for Disease Control--part of our Government--Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, and this hospital have come together. They are showing how it can make a difference.  
   They are looking for supplements to diet--for example, whether additional vitamin A can mean that a person with HIV can live longer and be healthier. 
   They are operating at a lower level because that is all they have to work with. It is a survivalist approach. But it is making life better and longer for a lot of people. It is working. We are helping it to work. I am glad the United States is part of that. 
   There is a woman who has become somewhat legendary. Anyone who has not seen this I hope will get a chance to see this Newsweek cover story: ``10 Million Orphans.'' It talks about the AIDS epidemic in Africa. Her name is Bernadette Nakayima, and she lives near Kampala, Uganda. She had 11 children. Ten of her children died of AIDS. They are buried on a hillside by their home. The one surviving daughter lives nearby. 
   This 69-year-old grandmother, after her 10 children died, brought in the orphans to her home. She has 35 orphans in her home. How does she get by? Well, according to the Newsweek story, at one point she did not think she could. She gathered all the children in a room and said: Close the doors and lock them. We're just going to starve to death here. We can't make it. But luckily somebody knocked on the door and said: Come out. We're going to try to help you. People are trying to help. 
   As I speak here on the floor today, Sandra Thurman, who is the head of the effort to deal with AIDS, is in the gallery. I was in Africa with her. She has visited Bernadette many times. She draws the same inspiration, as everyone who goes there, to think of the strength of this woman who, in advancing years, is trying to raise 35 grandchildren, one of whom, incidentally, is HIV positive. 
   How is she getting by? It points to another thing at which we should look; that is the fact that she is part of something called FINCA. FINCA is a microcredit program in Africa. Microcredit, as I mentioned earlier, is a small loan, primarily to women where they can dramatically improve their lives by having a little additional income. 
   Women like Bernadette are able to bring in AIDS orphans and help them lead normal lives in a family setting rather than on the streets. 
   One of the meetings I had with a FINCA group was in Lugazi, Uganda. I will not soon forget where we had the meeting. Our meeting of 20 women, who were coming to report on their loans and to seek additional credit assistance, took place in a little hut that a few days before had been a chicken coop. The chickens, who had been moved out of that coop to the adjoining room, squawked during the whole meeting. But these ladies were not going to be deterred by a few angry roasters. They were there to get on with the business. The business was borrowing money to improve their lives. 
   I asked one of the ladies: What have these microcredit loans meant to you? She said, through an interpreter: Because of these loans, my knees have gone soft. I had no idea what she was talking 
   about. She explained. She said: Before I had microcredit, before I had more income, I used to have to crawl on my knees to my husband to beg for money for food for the children and to send the kids to school. Now I have some money. I don't have to crawl. My knees are going soft. 
   That story was repeated over and over again by the 20 women gathered there. I said: How many of you who are borrowing this money, by these small loans that make such a difference, have brought in AIDS orphans to your home? Half of them raised their hand--two children here, and four here, and six here. They had the wherewithal to do it. 
   In countries where people survive on 30 cents a day, it does not take much to dramatically improve the quality of life and keep these children within the extended family. It can help. It can work. 
   The second thing that is helping is food assistance. We are directing food assistance in areas where we know that we have serious problems with AIDS orphans. We need to do more in this regard. 
   I use these examples so that people who might otherwise want to throw up their hands and say: Well, it is a problem we should worry about, but how can we possibly address it if there are so many people victimized by it? There are things we can do, small things for a great nation to do, that can make a great difference, small things that can save lives and give families a chance. 
   I am going to introduce legislation today which is entitled: ``The AIDS Orphans Relief Act of 2000.'' It addresses microcredit to try to increase it as an effort to help AIDS orphans find homes and to increase food assistance for that same purpose. 
   This is not going to solve the problem, by a long shot. There is so much we need to do in the areas of research and prevention, creating an infrastructure for distributing the medicines that are available in Africa. 
   I hope this will be one part of an agenda, that we can gather together and speak, as Senator FEINGOLD and Senator FEINSTEIN did, about the pharmaceutical side of it, address the larger issues that the World Bank might be able to help us with, through Senator JOHN KERRY's bill and Congressman JIM LEACH'S bill, and invite all of the Members of the Senate to focus on this issue in a bipartisan fashion. I believe sincerely we can make a difference. 
   It has been said earlier that this devastating disease is lowering the life expectancy of people in Africa. You find, when you go to some countries, such as South Africa, that employers will hire two people for a skilled position because they know one is not going to survive. Those are the odds. That is what they are up against. It calls on us to focus on what we can do to help. 
   A little while ago we had a meeting of Democratic Senators not far from the floor, and Sandy Thurman, our AIDS director, was there, as well as a young woman named Rory Kennedy. She is the daughter of Robert Kennedy. She has been recognized for her skill as a producer of documentary films. She presented for us a 12-minute documentary film on the AIDS epidemic in Africa. It is a film she put together when she visited with a group not that long ago. It really does put in human terms what I am trying to say in words. 
   You see the faces of those little children. You see the trips to the graveyard to bury babies who have died because of HIV. You go down the road, as you would in Kampala, Uganda, and you notice the stalls of produce. Then at the end, you see the huge sign that says ``coffins.'' 
   When I spoke to the Ambassador, Martin Brennan, he told of going to a village outside of Kampala and seeing in the town square stacks and stacks of coffins. It, unfortunately, is a big growth industry in Africa. It calls on us to address this in so many different ways. 
   Let me tell you another way that may not seem obvious that is part of this as well. While we were traveling in Uganda, we went to an agricultural research station. This is a station which brought together some ag research which the United States has supported for years. Cassava is a basic root crop used as a staple for the diet of many people in central and eastern Africa. Not that long ago, there was this virus that affected this crop and dramatically reduced it. People were going hungry and starving to death. Because of this research at this station they have found ways to end this so-called mosaic virus. People are now seeing this cassava grow, and they are once again feeding their families. 
   It was a little thing, lost in the budget of the Department of Agriculture, which means that millions have a chance to live. Some people will question ag research from time to time, even mock it. Yet we see day to day in Africa and in the United States that it pays off. This is a part of the world that has been ravaged by civil war, ravaged by famines as bad as the potato famine, ravaged by epidemic, now as bad as the bubonic plague, all of these things are coming down on central Africa like four horsemen of the apocalypse. They are coping with it every single day. 
   We need to do all we can to make sure that our country, working with other countries, can try to stop this crisis from getting any worse. The lessons we will learn in Africa will help us save lives there. It will help us take the message to other parts of the world, such as India and other parts of Asia, that are threatened with this epidemic. But there is something else we will learn. We will learn from the courage and compassion of the people who  live in this area that there is strength in the darkest hour. 
   I came back from this trip determined to do something. I hope that with this meeting today of several Senators on the floor of the Senate we can start this dialog. I think we cannot only reach across the aisle to my friends on the Republican side and share our feelings, but reach out beyond this Chamber and beyond this Government. I think we can reach out to churches across America. 
   I have written a letter to the Catholic bishops in my home State of Illinois. There, as a little boy growing up, I used to give pennies and nickels every day to the missions. It was something they did automatically in Catholic schools when you were growing up. I didn't know where that money was going. I barely knew what the missions were. But when I went to Sunday Mass at the basilica in Nairobi, Kenya, and saw 2,000 people, standing room only, I found out where that money went. It converted a lot of people to Catholicism, as the Anglican Church converted a lot of people to their religion. Now we have a chance to say to some of these religions, such as Catholicism and others: We made an investment in Africa at a time when they needed our help, and now they need it again. Can we bring together the religions of the United States that have focused on Africa and try to cope with this crisis? 
   The head of the National AIDS Commission in Uganda is a retired Catholic bishop. I think that says a lot. It says that they are crossing religious boundaries in an attempt to deal with this epidemic and this crisis. 
   When it comes to the security side of this issue, I have spoken about the military in Uganda, and I am afraid it is the case in so many other countries. They, too, are infected, and that is a source of concern for all of us. If your military cannot respond to a crisis in the country, it fosters instability. It creates security problems which reach far beyond that country, that may even involve the United States, as in the past 10 years we have been to Africa on peacekeeping missions, some with tragic results. 
   So if we can work, and I hope we can, through our skills and our military to help them cope with this disease in the ranks of the militaries in Africa, it is good for them and their countries. It is good for our world. I will be working with my colleagues to see if we can achieve that. 
   Let me close by thanking the Chair for this opportunity to speak. I have gone beyond the usual allotment of time. I thank the Chair for his patience in that regard. I hope in this session of Congress we can come together as they do at TASO in Kampala, Uganda, and find the strength and support to care for people halfway around the world, people perhaps of different color from some of us, but people who are our brothers and sisters. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the Senate has been debating, S. 625, the bankruptcy reform bill for weeks. I am happy to say that many Democratic amendments have been accepted which have brought much needed balance to the bill. 
   The issue of bankruptcy is a highly technical and convoluted area of our law replete with terms like cram downs, reaffirmations, panel trustees, automatic stays, nondischargeable debt, priority debt, secured debt, and even something known as a ``superdischarge.'' 
   And the bankruptcy code is not only complex and arcane. It is the fulcrum point of a delicate balance. When you push one thing, almost invariably something else will give. That's because no matter how hard you try there is a limited resource pie. All we do many times is increase the fighting over the small pie--and usually no one really wins that fight. 
   The Senate made several improvements to ease the burdens on low income debtors while making sure that wealthy debtors pay their fair share. The Senate adopted my amendment to allow debtors to attend mandatory credit counseling by telephone or over the Internet, which will make it easier for debtors with transportation difficulties. By adopting a cap on the homestead exemption of $100,000, Congress will continue the longstanding policy of giving a debtor a fresh start--not a windfall. 
   Improvements were also made to make the bill more cost effective and less expensive for taxpayers. My  amendment to streamline the means test for debtors between 100 and 150% of the median income was adopted and will save the taxpayers $8 million a year in administrative costs. In addition, Senator LEAHY's amendment to exempt certain debtors from the requirement of filing 3 years of tax returns will reduce both costs and undue burdens on low income debtors. 
   Finally, tremendous progress was made on the bill in the area of credit card disclosure. If we are going to make it harder for people to file for bankruptcy, then we need to provide them enough information to ensure they are making informed decisions about their credit. 
   I was happy to join Senator SARBANES in an effort to require creditors to warn consumers about interest costs and provide toll free numbers where debtors can learn how long it will take to eliminate a credit card balance by making only the minimum monthly payment. 
   I will be watching the bankruptcy conference closely to ensure that all of the hard fought amendments adopted on the Senate floor remain in the bill through conference. If 
   these provisions are stripped out in conference, then this bill will likely face the same fate as last year's bill--it will never become law. 
   Because of improvements in areas of concern to me, I will vote for the underlying bankruptcy legislation, but I want to make clear my opposition to the Republican minimum wage measure. It was clear from last year's debate and it's clear today that the Republican minimum wage does little to help America's lowest wage earners. In fact, it's a slap in the face for all of our hardworking citizens who strive every day to lift themselves out of poverty and into a better way of life. 
   Over the next three years, a minimum wage worker would receive over $1,200 less under the GOP version than the Democratic proposal. Let's break that down, Mr. President, into real terms. For America's lowest wage earners: $1,200 a year translates into over four months worth of groceries, over three months of rent, almost half a year worth of utilities. For the lucky ones, that's one full year of tuition and fees at a two-year college. Yet, the Republicans want to deny their constituents this opportunity and I can't understand why. 
   Mr. President, this Republican minimum wage proposal sounds vaguely familiar to us. You may recall how the other side of the aisle tried to stretch out tax refunds for our lowest income workers under the Earned Income Tax Credit. We grant tax relief to those that need it most and then the Republicans turn around and try to delay their refunds. These types of delaying tactics didn't work for the EITC and they certainly won't work for an increase in the minimum wage. 
   Something I've heard very little about, and maybe it's because the Republicans don't want you to know about it, is Section Two of their amendment that effectively repeals overtime pay provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act that have been the law for over 60 years. This provision would eliminate the requirement that bonuses, commissions, and other compensations based on productivity, quality, and efficiency be considered part of a worker's ``regular rate'' of pay for purposes of calculating overtime pay. Because overtime pay is based on one and a half times regular pay, overtime pay is lower if a worker's regular pay is lower. Today, almost 73 million Americans are entitled to overtime pay and the GOP provision jeopardizes their overtime benefits. Think about it. If employers can pay less for overtime, they have a financial incentive to require workers to work overtime without getting the pay they deserve. That's another slap in the face on top of the one they get from this half-hearted attempt to raise their wages from $5.15 an hour. 
   Mr. President, it's clear that the Democratic bill would do a better job at getting a pay increase to those who need it most. On our side of the aisle, we believe it's not only our obligation, but our duty to help those who need it the most. It is my hope that the conference committee will wake up and remedy this malady that will be imposed on the American people by the Republicans should this bill become law.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DURBIN. I am more than happy to rise in support of what I consider to be a very important and valuable amendment in this debate on the bankruptcy bill. 
   I am not one who is in favor of abolishing the second amendment, nor, I am sure, is the Senator from Michigan. What we are attempting to do in this bill is address a very serious problem. For those who believe the second amendment is somehow an absolute right to bear arms, I will just tell them, there are no absolute rights under the Constitution of the United States. Each and every right that is guaranteed to us as individual citizens can be limited. Whether it is the right  of free expression limited by the libel laws or even the right to life limited by death penalties that are imposed in many States, all of these things suggest that no right is absolute, and certainly the right to bear arms is not either. 
   We have had regulations throughout our modern history that have limited the rights of those who care to bear arms in the interest of the public good. That is what this amendment is all about. 
   Why are we debating guns on a bankruptcy bill? It gets down to the very basics. The bankruptcy law is designed so a person who has reached an economic position in life where they can't see a good future can go to the court and ask for relief from their debts, whether that is an individual or a family or a business. We say, for almost two centuries in this country, that bankruptcy is a right of individuals under our Federal court system. Again, we make exceptions and say that some people who come to court will be limited in the types of debts they can discharge. 
   We make a list, a pretty lengthy list, of some 17 or 18 exceptions. They include such things as debts incurred by fraud that can't be discharged in bankruptcy court, alimony and child support, student loans, debts from death or personal injury resulting from driving while intoxicated, court fees. There are several others. It suggests that when the Congress wrote the bankruptcy laws and continued to amend them, we said there are certain things in a bankruptcy court from which you cannot escape. If you have been guilty of certain conduct, if you have not met certain obligations, the bankruptcy court will not be your shield or your shelter. 
   What the Senator from Michigan is doing with his amendment is saying that the gun industry, the gun manufacturers, if they have engaged--and I will quote directly from the amendment--if they have engaged in fraud, recklessness, misrepresentation, nuisance, or product liability, they cannot race to the bankruptcy court and escape their responsibility to the American people. It is just that straightforward. 
   Those who are arguing that we should carve out some special exception for these gun manufacturers are the same people who are loath to regulate these businesses in the first place. 
   Several firearm manufacturers have recently been sued in cases that have been brought by cities and municipalities and counties and other local governments that have, frankly, been victimized by gun crimes. These people, in their lawsuits, are alleging that the gun manufacturers have been guilty of misconduct beyond selling the gun, that they have been involved in marketing practices, for example, that end up putting guns in the hands of those who commit crimes. Those lawsuits are still pending, but the interesting response from the gun manufacturers is: So what, sue us if you want to. Ultimately, if you win your verdict, we will go to bankruptcy court, and we are going to escape any liability to the citizens of these cities and counties and States which are bringing these lawsuits. 
   Two companies have already sought bankruptcy protection: Lorcin Engineering and Davis Industries. The Lorcin .380 pistol tops the list of all guns traced by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms for its involvement in crime. By virtue of the 
   bankruptcy law, these manufacturers are able to make millions of dollars flooding the market with low-quality firearms of little appeal to legitimate sportsmen and hunters but of great appeal to criminals and gang bangers. 
   Once these companies are sued, because they are flooding the market with these cheap Saturday night specials, they simply declare bankruptcy and walk away free from any financial responsibility for their misconduct. The owners of these companies remain free to start up a new company under a new name making the same weapons, wreaking havoc across America because they are flooding us with these guns. 
   Lorcin officials stated to Firearms Business, a magazine that is published by the gun industry, that the company chose to ``take advantage of the system'' when it decided it couldn't defend against liability claims. What Senator LEVIN is doing--and I am happy to join him--is to say to Lorcin and other companies: Not so fast. If you are going to flood the markets of America with these cheap Saturday night specials, if you are going to be liable for increasing crime and increasing violence in America, you cannot use the Federal law as your shield or shelter when it comes to our bankruptcy court. I think Senator LEVIN is on the right track. 
   For those who would argue, as I have already heard on the floor, we already have too many laws when it comes to guns, they are just not enforced, let me be quick to add that when it comes to standards for the manufacture of firearms in this country, we virtually have no laws whatsoever. The Consumer Product Safety Commission has the responsibility of regulating virtually every product for household or recreational use. In fact, the toy guns sold for Christmas and birthday gifts are subject to regulation by the Consumer Product Safety Commission. But the real guns, the Saturday night specials and the firearms that could be the subject of these lawsuits, are not subject to any Federal safety regulations at all. The gun industry, by its power in Washington, has successfully lobbied to keep a law in place that protects them from any regulation on the safety of their product. 
   So for those who are supporting the gun industry, they want it both ways. They don't want the Government to impose any standard on the product that is sold, and they don't want the companies held liable if that product turns out to be dangerous, if that firearm leads to crime and violence and death across America. 
   Senator LEVIN has said if these manufacturers come to court and they are found guilty of recklessness, fraud, misrepresentation, nuisance, or product liability, they cannot escape that liability because of the bankruptcy law. 
   How important is it to America? It is important because the costs of gun violence in both human lives and health care continue to escalate. All those who argue that the laws Congress has contemplated in the past are somehow restricting gun ownership in this country cannot answer the most basic question: If gun ownership is so restrictive in this country, how do we happen to have over 200 million firearms already in a nation of 275 million people? 
   The fact is, these guns are readily available, and on the average almost 90 people are killed, including 12 children, every day because of the proliferation of firearms and the fact that they get into the wrong hands. Gun manufacturers understand that they are finally going to be held accountable. These lawsuits are going to accomplish what legislatures across the Nation and this Congress have failed to face; that is, the fact that American families are fed up with this gun violence. They expect Members of the Senate and the House to come forward with reasonable suggestions to make their neighborhoods safe and take guns out of the hands of those who would misuse them and out of the hands of children. 
   Senator LEVIN has a valuable amendment here. He is saying to these companies: You will be held responsible. Even if this Congress cannot muster the courage to regulate the safety of a firearm that is sold in the United States, we will not let these manufacturers escape their liability in a court of law. Cities around the country--Chicago, New York, New Orleans, Atlanta, Bridgeport--have initiated suits against the industry to try to force changes to make guns safer and less likely to end up in the hands of criminals. Certainly, automobile manufacturers have faced a spate of lawsuits that really challenge them to use the most modern technology to make our cars safe. 
   Why are we not holding this industry to the same standard of responsibility? And why, if they are found guilty of fraud or recklessness in the products they sell, should they be able to get off the hook in a bankruptcy court? That is the gist of the Levin amendment--to hold these companies accountable. To say there are no privileged classes--if you engage in this conduct, you will be held as responsible as any other company or person for their wrongdoing. 
   The gun industry has long placed profits above the safety of America. I think it is interesting that an industry that can cause politicians to cower before them are scared to death to face a  jury in a courtroom in our country. I strongly support Senator LEVIN's amendment. By adopting it, we will further the goal of reducing abuses of the bankruptcy system. Remember, that is why this debate is underway. We are considering bankruptcy reform because many came to us and said that folks are abusing the bankruptcy system. Don't let the gun manufacturers abuse the bankruptcy system. Make certain that they are held accountable for the wrongdoing and the violence and death that results from their recklessness and fraud and the negligent use of their products. We should be on record as opposing bankruptcy abuse, whether it is the result of individual misconduct or the misconduct of gun manufacturers. 
   I yield the balance of my time.

   Mr. DURBIN. Thank you. 
   I am proud to be a cosponsor of Senator DODD's resolution. 
   What a curious footnote in the history of this world that this Senate Chamber would focus its debate and the attention of the media in this country on a little 6-year-old boy from Cuba. 
   But if you scan history, you will find similar cases where one person being caught in the vortex of controversy becomes the focal point. In this case, the focal point is a 6-year-old boy named Elian Gonzalez, and at issue is the foreign policy between the United States of America and the Nation of Cuba. 
   Yesterday, Senator DODD was kind enough to invite me, as well as three other Senators, to meet with the grandmothers of Elian Gonzalez. I sat and listened for an hour as they explained their family circumstances and answered our questions. It really brought me back to that moment in time many years ago when I was a practicing lawyer in Springfield, IL, and spent many days involved in family law. It was not the most enjoyable part of my legal practice. 
   In fact, many times those cases, involving divorce and child custody and child support, unfortunately, brought out the very worst in people. Those battles over children became proxy battles over a failed marriage. It saddened me, as I am sure it saddens many who are involved in this. 
   As I listened yesterday, I understood that these two grandmothers were basically making the case that they had a good family to offer in Cuba, a good family for Elian Gonzalez. I thought they made their case convincingly. The fact that this young boy, after his parents were divorced, was the subject of joint custody is, in and of itself, a telling fact. It is rare. There are people who fight in court for years and spend thousands of dollars over the question of joint custody. 
   In this case, Elian Gonzalez' mother decided that she could trust her former husband, the father of Elian, so much so that she left him with his father 5 out of 7 days each week. That simple fact told me a great deal about whether or not Elian Gonzalez' father was a fit parent. In the eyes of Elian's mother, the former wife of Elian's father, he certainly was a fit parent.  
   But then I have to tell you that some of the things said to me by these grandmothers were so touching. Consider Elian's maternal grandmother who came to the United States. Think about what she has been through. In just a few short weeks, she saw an effort by her daughter and Elian, along with a man, to come to the United States. I am not sure how much she knew of this in advance. In fact, she indicated to us she did not know that they were going to take off for the United States. 
   Then she was told her daughter was involved in a ship sinking, that her daughter drowned at sea, that this little 6-year-old boy watched his mother drowning at sea, that he grabbed on to a life preserver and hung on, some say for days, before he was rescued, and then was swept up into the caring arms of those who rescued him, brought to the United States, and given to a great uncle, who I am sure cares for him very much. 
   But since he arrived in the United States, this little boy, no more than a first grader, has been the focus of such attention. They have heaped gifts on him, puppies and gifts and trips to Disney World. The cameras swirl around him as he walks across the backyard and plays with a ball or pets his little puppy. 
   I remember things similar to that in my practice of law. We used to call it Disneyland daddy. If you are only going to get this little boy for a weekend, you will give him the world. You will take him to the ice cream shop as often as he wants to go, buy some toys, take him on a nice vacation, create an atmosphere in his mind that is idyllic. That is what has happened to Elian Gonzalez. In an effort to show love and caring, he has had all these gifts heaped upon him by his great uncle and his family. Yet I believe, as the grandmothers do, that the most basic thing Elian Gonzalez needs is his last surviving parent. He needs his father's loving arms more than he needs a trip to Disney World. 
   I think with his father and the rest of his family in Cuba, they could start to try to reconstruct this little boy's life and to say to him that though you have seen more tragedies in your few years than many people do in a lifetime, we will stand by you. We will give you the support to make your life whole again. That should be what this debate is all about. 
   I think the Immigration and Naturalization Service has it right. They asked the first question: Who will speak for this boy's interest? They concluded it would be his natural father. Then they asked the second important question: Is this natural father a fit parent? They interviewed him twice, went to Cuba to do it. They asked a lot of people about his background and came back and said, yes, he is a fit parent. He had joint custody of the little boy. The mother entrusted the boy to his father many, many times. 
   They concluded, and properly so, that Elian Gonzalez should be allowed to return home to Cuba, but unfortunately that is not the end of the story because this little boy is caught up in a foreign policy debate that has been going on for more than 40 years in America. During my time in college, I lived with a Cuban American expatriate who explained to me what it was like to be forced out of Cuba, to be forced out of your home, to give up everything, by the Castro regime, by this Communist leader who refused to recognize the most basic human rights. I heard firsthand from this roommate of mine in college what his family went through, the sacrifice, the deprivation, the loss of things they would never see again. 
   I always understood the feelings as best I could, not having lived them personally, of that generation of Cuban Americans who escaped to America's shores to finally get away from Castro and to have a chance at their own life and democracy. I have seen what they have created in south Florida and many other places around the United States. I am very proud that this group of immigrants to this country has made such a valuable contribution to our Nation, but like most immigrants, they never forget their homeland. That is not to say they don't love the United States, but they never forget their homeland of Cuba. They stay intensely involved in the foreign policy debate in Washington about the future of Cuba. They have become quite a political force in Florida, perhaps in national politics. 
   They feel--and I share their feeling--that the people of Cuba deserve better than Fidel Castro. They deserve a democracy. They deserve an opportunity to live in freedom. They remind us of that frequently. I share their belief. I think they are right. But I have to say I believe they have taken the wrong tack when it comes to Elian Gonzalez. It is much more compelling to most American families that this little boy be reunited with his family than it is that he be in the 
   midst of a foreign policy debate. Some Members of the Senate have suggested that next week we will stop the business of the Senate and we will focus the attention of this deliberative body on a 6-year-old Cuban boy named Elian Gonzalez. They have proposed, in one of the rare instances in American political history, that this little boy will have conferred upon him American citizenship--frankly, citizenship without even asking. 
   We presume in most courts of law that a 6-year-old boy can hardly make a big decision about his life. He is too easily swayed by emotions and doesn't have the maturity to decide. They want to make the decision for him. They want to decide that he is an American citizen. 
   I am reminded of an experience I had not long ago in Chicago. I went to a Mexican restaurant. After I finished my meal, a fellow came up to me from the kitchen. He was wearing a cook's clothes. He said: Can I talk to you for a minute, Senator? I said: Of course. He said: I am almost 65 years old. I was born in Mexico. My dream, for as long as I have lived, is to be a citizen of the United States of America. Here is my application form for naturalization. 
   He had taken it and encased it in plastic; it meant so much to him. He said: This means so much to me, but the Immigration and Naturalization Service system is so slow and so bureaucratic and the new laws coming out of Washington make it so difficult, it has been over 2 years, and I am waiting for my chance to raise my hand and swear my loyalty to the United States of America. He said: Senator, I am afraid I will die before that happens. That would break my heart and the hearts of my family. 
   I think about him, and I think of hundreds of thousands like him who have come to this country and followed the orderly process to become citizens. They have had to wait. They have had to go through a tangle of bureaucracy. They are hoping they will get the chance to raise their hands and become naturalized citizens. 
   My mother was one of those. She was an immigrant to this country from Lithuania. In her 20s, after being married, she became a naturalized citizen. I have her naturalization certificate above my desk here in Washington. I am very proud of that. 
   But you won't hear any efforts on the floor of the Senate for the hundreds of thousands of people who are longing for this chance to become Americans, waiting for the naturalization process to be completed. No, we will focus on one 6-year-old boy from Cuba. Why? Because he makes an important foreign policy point. I don't believe it is fair to him, only 6 years of age. Nor is it fair to the hundreds of thousands who are waiting patiently for us to say that he will move to the front of the line and become a citizen without even asking for it. That doesn't speak well for this country and our respect for the law. 
   I have compassion for this little boy and what he has been through. Do I believe he could live in the United States and enjoy freedom in this country? Certainly. But as Senator DODD and others have said, there are many good families living in countries with bad governments. Though Elian Gonzalez, by the matter of fate, was born in Cuba under a repressive regime, I don't doubt for a minute that he has a loving family who can 
   give him so much in his life as he grows up. If we are going to have compassion for children and particularly immigrant children, let me tell you, the Senate has a full agenda. I returned 2 weeks ago from Africa where there are literally over 20 million AIDS orphans. These kids need the same compassion and concern.

   Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair. 
   There are many millions of children around the world who deserve our concern and our compassion. I hope those who are expressing this feeling about Elian Gonzalez will not stop at that, will decide that we can do more to help many others in small ways and large ways combined. I hope next week the leadership of the Senate does not bring this matter before us. I will oppose it. I will support the resolution from the Senator from Connecticut. I think it is sensible. It answers the basic question with the most basic family value. Where should Elian Gonzalez be? He should be with his father, his last surviving parent. The trauma that he has been through I think, I hope he can endure. I hope he will be a strong little boy. I hope he will grow up and reflect on his experience in the United States, remembering that there were people who loved him in this country as well, and there certainly are. 
   Let me close by saying that I hope Cuban Americans will consider this for a moment. I don't believe the action they have taken relative to Elian Gonzalez has increased the popularity of their cause at all. Many people are confused and bewildered that they would fight a foreign policy battle on the back of a 6-year-old boy. 
   I think we should learn a lesson from history. There was a time when Eastern Europe was under Soviet domination. 
   There was a time when we considered them to be victims of a Communist regime. We decided in the latter part of the last century that the best way to change that government and that mindset in Eastern Europe was to open the doors wide, let them see the rest of the world, let them trade with the United States and Europe, and let them understand what democracy was all about, let them see what freedom meant in their daily lives, and, you know, it worked. 
   We saw the Berlin Wall come down. We saw countries such as Poland, under Soviet domination for 40 years, emerge into a democracy and an economy that is an inspiration to all. Can't we learn the same lesson when it comes to Cuba? If we open the doors and allow Cubans to come to the United States to visit, to work, to trade, to engage in cultural and educational exchanges, is there anyone who can doubt that will lead to a new Cuba? Is there anyone who doubts that kind of exchange, instead of this isolationism, will force the political change we have been waiting for for over four decades? 
   I don't think that change will come about by granting citizenship to Elian Gonzalez. That one little boy will become just a tragic footnote in history. He has endured enough in his short life. I hope this Senate doesn't add to the burden he now has to carry--the memory of seeing his mother drown at sea. I hope the leadership of the Senate will think twice before they allow us to become party to what has become a sad chapter in the history of this country. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the Senate, we hope today or perhaps tomorrow, will be bringing this session to a close. It has been a session which has involved some historic decisions by the Senate. Of course, it began with an impeachment trial of the President of the United States, which ended in a bipartisan decision of the Senate not to convict the President. Then, shortly thereafter, we faced a rather historic challenge in terms of our role in Kosovo. So we went from one extreme in the Constitution, involving an impeachment against the President, to the other extreme, where this Senate had to contemplate the possibility, the very real possibility, of war. That is how our session began, at such a high level with such great challenges. 
   There were so many other challenges that were presented to the Senate during the course of the year. I am sad to report that we addressed very few of them. Things that American families really care about we did not spend enough time on, we did not bring to a conclusion. So, as we return to our homes, States, and communities after this session is completed and we are confronted by those who are concerned about their daily lives and they ask us, What did you achieve during the course of this session? I am afraid there is very little to which to point. 
   This morning, I received some letters from my home State of Illinois from senior citizens concerned about the cost of prescription drugs, as well they should be, because not only are these costs skyrocketing, but we find gross disparities between the charges for prescription drugs in the United States and the cost of the very same drugs made by the same companies if they are sold in Canada or in Europe. 
   In fact, in the northern part of the United States, it is not uncommon for many senior citizens to get on a bus and go over the border to Canada to buy their prescription drugs at a deep discount from what they would pay in the United States. That is difficult for seniors to understand; it is difficult for Senators to understand as to why that same prescription drug should be so cheap if purchased overseas and so expensive for American citizens in a country where those pharmaceutical companies reside and do business. 
   The senior citizens have asked us, as well as their families who are concerned about the costs they bear, to do something. Yet this session comes to an end and nothing has been done--nothing has been done--either to address the spiraling cost of prescription drugs or to amend the Medicare program and to make prescription drugs part of the benefits. 
   Think about it: In the 1960s, under President Lyndon Johnson when Medicare was created, we did not include any provision for paying for prescription drugs. We considered it from a Federal point of view as if prescription drugs were something similar to cosmetic surgery, just an option that one might need or might not need, but certainly something that was not life-threatening. 
   Today, we know we were wrong. In many instances, because of the wide array of prescription drugs and the valuable things they can do for seniors, we find a lot of our senior citizens dependent on them to avoid hospitalizations and surgeries and to keep their lives at the highest possible quality level.  
   Last week, I went to East St. Louis, IL, the town where I was born, and St. Mary's Hospital and visited a clinic. I walked around and met groups of senior citizens and asked them how much they were paying for prescription drugs. The first couple took the prize: $1,000 a month came in from their Social Security; $750 a month went out for prescription drugs. Three-fourths of all the money they were bringing in from Social Security went right out the window to the pharmacy. 
   There was another lady with about $900 a month in Social Security; $400 a month paid in prescription drugs. 
   Another one, about $900 a month in Social Security; $300 a month in prescription drugs. 
   The last person we met, though, told another story. He was retired from a union job he worked at for many years, a tough job, a manual labor job, and he, too, had expensive prescription drugs, but he was fortunate. The union plan helped him to pay for them. Out of pocket, he puts down $5 to $15 a month and is happy to do it. 
   Think of the contrast between $750 a month and $15 a month. One can understand why people across America, seniors who want to continue to lead active and healthy lives, have turned to Congress and said: Please, learn from the President's lead in the State of the Union Address that we should have a prescription drug benefit. 
   This Senate--this Congress--will go home without even addressing that issue. That is sad. It is a reality facing American families. You will recall, as well as I, a few months ago we were all in shock over what happened at Columbine High School with the killing of those innocent students. This Senate made an effort to keep guns out of the hands of children and criminals with a very modest bill that said if you were going to buy a gun at a gun show, we want to know your background. 
   The bill passed. It was sent over to the House of Representatives. The gun lobby got its hands on it, and that was 
   the end of it. End of discussion. 
   As we return home to face parents who say, what have you done to make America safer, to make communities, neighborhoods, and schools safer, the honest answer is nothing, nothing. 
   Take a look at campaign finance reform. Senator FEINGOLD of Wisconsin is on the floor. He has been a leader on this issue with Senator MCCAIN of Arizona. They had a bipartisan effort to clean up this mess of campaign funding in America. Yet when it came to a vote, we could muster 55 votes out of 100 favoring reform, which most people would say: You have a majority; why didn't you win? 
   Under Senate rules, it takes more than a majority. It takes 60 votes. We were five votes short. All of the Democratic Senators supported campaign finance reform, and 10 stalwarts on the Republican side came forward. Yet when it was all said and done, nothing was done. We will end this session never having addressed campaign finance reform, something so basic to the future of our democracy. 
   On a Patients' Bill of Rights, there is a term which a few years ago American families might not have been able to define. I think they understand it now. It was an effort on the floor of the Senate to say that families across America and individuals and businesses would get a fair shake from their health insurance companies; that life-and-death decisions would be made by doctors and nurses and medical professionals, not by clerks at insurance companies. It is that basic. Mr. President, you know as well as I, time and again, a good doctor making a diagnosis, who wants to go forward with a procedure, first has to get on the phone and ask for permission. 
   I can recall a time several years ago in a hospital in downstate Illinois where I accompanied a doctor on rounds for a day. I invite my colleagues to do that. It is an eye-opener to see what the life of a doctor is like, but also to understand how it has been changed because health insurance companies now rule the roost when it comes to making decisions about health care. 
   This poor doctor was trying to take care of his patients and do the right thing from a medical point of view, and he spent most of his time while I was with him on the phone with insurance companies. He would be at the nurses' station on a floor of St. John's Hospital in Springfield, IL, begging these insurance companies to allow him to keep a patient in the hospital over a weekend, a patient he was afraid might have some dangerous consequences if she went home before her surgery--her brain surgery--on Monday. Finally, the insurance company just flat out said: No, send her home. 
   He said: I cannot do that. In good conscience, she has to stay in the hospital, and I will accept the consequences. 
   That is what doctors face. Patients who go to these doctors expecting to get the straight answers about their medical condition and medical care find they are involved in a game involving health insurance companies and clerks with manuals and computers who decide their fate. 
   When we tried to debate that issue on the floor of the Senate, we lost. American families lost. The winners were the insurance companies. They came here, a powerful special interest, and they won the day. They had a majority of 100 Members of the Senate on their side, and American families lost. 
   Thank goodness that bill went to the other side of the Rotunda. The House of Representatives was a different story. Sixty-eight Republicans broke from the insurance lobby and voted with the Democrats for the Patients' Bill of Rights so that families across America would have a chance. But nothing came of it. That was the end of it. The debate in the House was the last thing said; no conference committee, no bill, no relief, no protection for families across America. 
   I will return to Illinois, and my colleagues to their States, unable to point to anything specific we have done to help families deal with this vexing problem. 
   The minimum wage debate is another one. Senator KENNEDY, who sits to my right, has been a leader in trying to raise the minimum wage 50 cents a year for the next 2 years to a level of $6.15. He has been trying to do this for years. He has been stopped for years. We are literally talking about millions of Americans, primarily women, who go to work in minimum-wage jobs and try to survive. Many of them are the sole bread winners of their families. We will leave this session of the Congress--the Senate and the House will go home--and those men and women will get up and go to work on Monday morning still facing $5.15 an hour. 
   In a Congress which could come up with $792 billion for tax breaks for the wealthiest people in America, we cannot find 50 cents for the hardest working men and women, who get up every single day and go to work, as people who watch our children in day-care centers, as those who care for our parents and grandparents in nursing homes, as those people who make our beds when we stay in hotels, service our tables when we go to restaurants. They get up and go to work every single day. This Senate did not go to work to help those people. We could find tax breaks for wealthy people, but when it came to helping those who are largely voiceless in this political process, we did nothing. We will return home and face the reality of that decision. 
   If there is any positive thing that came of this session, it emerged in the last few days. Finally, after an impasse over the budget that went on for month after weary month, the Republican leadership sat down at the table with the President. The President insisted on priorities, and you have to say, by any measure, he prevailed. And thank goodness he did. 
   Let me tell you some of the things that are achieved in the budget we will vote for. It has its shortcomings--and I will point out a few of them--but it has several highlights. 
   The President's 100,000 COPS Program across America has had a dramatic impact in reducing violent crime and making America a safer place to live. There was opposition from Republican leadership to continue this program. But, finally, the President prevailed, and we will move forward to send more police and community policemen into our neighborhoods and schools across America to make them safer. That is something achieved by the President, in negotiation with congressional leaders at the 11th hour and the 59th minute. 
   In the area of education, the President has an initiative at the Federal level which makes sense from a parent's point of view. If we can keep the  class sizes in the first and second grade smaller--rather than larger--teachers have a better chance to connect with a child, to find out if this is a gifted child who has a bright future, or a child who needs some special help with a learning disability, or perhaps a slow learner who needs a little more tutorial assistance to get through the first and second grade. 
   You know what happens when those kids do not get that attention? They start feeling frustrated and falling behind, and the next thing you know, it is even a struggle to stay in school, let alone enjoy the experience and learn from it. The President has said: Let's take our Federal funds, limited as they are, and focus on an American initiative to make class sizes smaller in the first and second grade. 
   I went to Wheaton, IL, and I saw a class like this. Believe me, it works. Don't take my word for it. Ask the administrators at the school, who applied for it, and the teachers who benefit from it. And the parents are happy that it is there. 
   The Republican side of the aisle resisted the President's initiative. But thank goodness, in the closing minutes of the negotiations, the President prevailed. Common sense prevailed. And we will continue this initiative to reduce class size. 
   The way we are paying for some of these things is very suspect; I will be honest with you. We had this long debate during the course of the year about the future of the Social Security trust fund. Some on the Republican side said: We will never touch it. Well, historically we have touched it many times. The money, the excess and surplus in that fund that is not needed to pay Social Security recipients has been borrowed by President Reagan, President Bush, and President Clinton, with the understanding it would be paid back with interest. 
   Now that we have gotten beyond the deficit era in America, when we talk about surplus, we hope we do not have to borrow from it in the future. So this year, to avoid directly borrowing from the fund, Republicans argued that they have done some things that 
   are fiscally responsible. 
   Let me give one illustration. This budget agreement contains $38 billion for education programs. That is 7 percent, $2.4 billion, more than last year. However, this increase is due to the fact that the agreement includes $6.2 billion more in advance appropriations than last year's bill. 
   What is an advance appropriation? You borrow from next year. You do not take your current revenue; you borrow from next year. So in order to provide more for education, we borrow from next year. 
   You might assume, then, we are going to have this huge surplus of money from which we continue to borrow. It is anybody's guess. We pass a bill, we appropriate the money, but we cannot account for its sources. 
   Let me tell you about Head Start. 
   This is a good story. Head Start is a program created by President Lyndon Johnson in the Great Society. There were people who were critics of the President's initiatives, but Head Start has survived because it is a great idea. We take kids from lower income and disadvantaged families, and bring them into a learning environment at a very early age, put them in something similar to a classroom, and give them a chance to start learning. And we involve their parents. That is the critical element in Head Start. 
   This budget is going to provide $5.3 billion--the amount requested by the President--to serve an additional 44,000 kids across America, and to stay on track to serve 1 million children by the year 2002. 
   Class size reduction, which I have mentioned to you, is one that is very important to all of us. Disadvantaged students--there is $8.7 billion for title I compensatory education programs. That is an increase of $274 million, but it is still short of what the President requested. 
   In special education there is good news. This budget will provide $6 billion, $912 million--or 18 percent--more than the fiscal year 1999 appropriations for special ed. In my home State of Illinois, school districts will receive $227 million, a 62-percent increase since 1997. 
   Keep in mind these school districts, because of a court decision and Federal legislation, now bring disabled children and kids with real problems into a learning atmosphere to give them a chance. But it is very labor intensive and very expensive. I am glad to see that this budget will provide more money to those school districts to help pay for those costs. 
   Afterschool programs: We provide $453 million, an increase of $253 million, to serve an additional 375,000 students in afterschool programs. How important are afterschool programs? Ask your local police department. Ask the families who leave their kids at the school door early in the morning, and perhaps do not return home from work until 6 or 7 o'clock at night. They have to be concerned about those kids, as anyone would be. And the people in the local police department will tell you, after school lets out, we often run into problems. So afterschool programs give kids something constructive to do after school. I am glad the Federal Government is taking some leadership in providing this. 
   In student aid, the agreement increases maximum Pell grant awards to college students by $175, from $3,125 to $3,300. Since President Clinton has taken office, we have seen the Pell grants increase by 43 percent. 
   This is an illustration of things that can be done when Congress works together. But we literally waited until the last minute to consider the education bill in the Senate. What is the highest priority for American families was the lowest priority of the Appropriations Committee. When we wait that long, we invite controversy and delay. Fortunately, it ended well. The President prevailed. These educational programs will be well funded. 
   Let me tell you of a bipartisan success story: The National 
   Institutes of Health. That is one of the best parts of the bill that we are going to vote on. It receives a 15-percent increase over last year's funding level. The National Institutes of Health conducts medical research. Those of us who are in the Senate, those serving in the House, are visited every single year by parents with children who suffer from autism, juvenile diabetes, by people representing those who have Alzheimer's disease, cancer, heart disease, AIDS. And all of them come with a single, unified message: Please, focus more resources, more money on research, more money on the National Institutes of Health. We increase it this year some 15 percent. 
   Fortunately, one of the budget gimmicks which would have delayed giving the money to the National Institutes of Health until the last 48 hours of the fiscal year was changed dramatically. Because of that change, we do not believe there will be any disadvantage to this important agency. 
   I will give you an example of the life of a Senator and how this agency affects it. A few weeks ago, a family in Peoria, IL, who had a little boy named Eric with a life-threatening genetic disease called Pompe's disease, called my office. Their son's only chance to live was through a clinical trial; in other words, an experimental project at Duke University, which was being sponsored by a private company. 
   Unfortunately, there were not any additional slots available for Eric in this clinical trial. The company could only manufacture enough of the drug for three patients. Eric would have been the fourth. Eric was denied admission to the trial for this rare disease. Sadly, Eric passed away. Pompe's disease is rare. Children like Eric frequently rely on the Government and its sponsored research for cures because a cure for a rare disease is unlikely to be very profitable for a lot of the pharmaceutical companies. 
   I am glad to salute Senator SPECTER, Republican of Pennsylvania; Senator HARKIN, my Democratic colleague from Iowa; and my colleague from Illinois, Congressman JOHN PORTER, a Republican. They have made outstanding progress in increasing the money available for the National Institutes of Health in this bill. 
   There is money also available for community health centers. We have talked about a lot of things in this Congress, but we don't talk about the 42 million Americans--and that number is growing--who have no health insurance. Many of these Americans who are not poor enough to qualify for Medicaid and not fortunate enough to have a job with health insurance go to community health centers, trying to get  the basic health care which all of us expect for our families in this great Nation. These community health centers serve so many of these people, and they deserve our support. With a 30-year track record of providing quality service to America's most vulnerable, these community health centers need to have our support. 
   According to congressional testimony by the Health Resources Service Administration, which overseas health center programs, 45 percent of these health centers are at risk financially, 5 to 7 percent close to bankruptcy, and 5 to 10 percent in severe financial trouble. Between 60 and 70 health center delivery sites already have been forced to close their doors. Changes in the Medicaid program have cut the compensation for these centers. The Balanced Budget Act, which was good overall, made some cuts that really have resulted in deprivation of funds. An additional $100 million to community health centers would provide health care to another 350,000 Americans. It can open up 259 new clinics. This is something we should do. 
   Let me point to one thing I am particularly proud of in this bill. It is an initiative on asthma. I was shocked to learn of the prevalence of asthma in America today. I was stunned when I learned it is the No. 1 diagnosis of children who were admitted to emergency rooms across America. Asthma is the No. 1 reason for school absenteeism in America. When I asked my staff to research what we are doing to deal with asthma, I found that we did precious little. I started asking my colleagues in the Senate about their concerns over asthma and was surprised to find so many of them who either had asthma themselves or had a member of their family with asthma. 
   They joined in trying to find a new approach, a new initiative that would deal with this problem. Leading that effort was my colleague from the State of Ohio, Senator MIKE DEWINE. He and I put in an amendment, which was funded in this bill, to provide $10 million in funding to the Centers for Disease Control for childhood asthma programs. 
   What is asthma like? I have never suffered from it, thank God. But imagine this illustration: For the next 15 minutes, imagine breathing through a tiny straw the size of a coffee stir, never getting enough air. Now imagine suffering this three to six times a day. That is asthma. 
   There have been some innovative things that have been done. In Southern California, Dr. Jones, with the University of Southern California, has started a ``breathmobile'' moving around the areas and neighborhoods of highest incidence of asthma, identifying kids with the problem, making sure they receive the right treatment and that their parents and teachers know what to do. That is what we have to encourage. The $10 million Senator DEWINE and I have put in this bill for this type of outreach program for asthma can have dramatic positive results. 
   There is one other thing I will mention. That is a program in which I became interested in 1992. I went to Detroit, MI, and saw an effort that was underway to provide residential treatment to addicted pregnant women. I thought it was such a good program, I asked the directors: Where do you get your Federal funds? They said: We don't qualify for Federal funds. I went back to 
   Washington and put a demonstration project in place so that we could take addicted mothers across America out of their drug-infested neighborhoods, put them in a safe environment, and try to make certain that the babies they would bear would be free from drug addiction. 
   It was a demonstration project, and it worked--1,500 children in 1994 in America were born drug free because of this program which we started in 1992. We were about to lose it this year. Imagine, we know a drug-addicted baby is extremely expensive, let alone, perhaps, a waste of great potential in human life. I was able to work with Senators SPECTER and HARKIN to put $5 million in the bill to expand our current efforts. 
   I say, in closing, there is one area of this bill I find particularly troubling. In a world which now has 6 billion people, in a world where we see the need for family planning and population control to avoid serious poverty, to avoid environmental disaster, and to avoid wars, the leadership in the House of Representatives and the Senate has turned a blind eye to international family planning. I cannot understand how this Republican Party--not all of them but many of them--can be so insensitive to the need for international family planning. Every year it is a battle. We have to understand that when population growth is out of control in underdeveloped countries, it is a threat to the stability not only of that country, of that region, but of the world and the United States. 
   We have to follow the lead of President Clinton and many in Congress who have said U.S. involvement in international family planning is absolutely essential. We hear arguments and see amendments offered because there are some who want to make this an abortion issue. The sad reality is that if a woman in a faraway land does not have the wherewithal to plan the size of her family and has an unintended pregnancy, it increases the likelihood of abortion. So family planning, when properly used, will reduce the likelihood of these unintended pregnancies. That is as night follows day, for those who care to even take a look at this policy issue. 
   I am sorry to report that although we are going to finally pay a major part of our U.N. dues, which has been an embarrassment to many of us for so many years while the Republican Congresses have refused to pay those dues, it was at the price of threatening international family planning programs. The Republican leadership in the House of Representatives insisted, if we are going to pay our U.N. dues, it has to be at the expense of international family planning programs. I think that is extremely shortsighted. I hope the next Congress will have a little more vision when it comes to family planning, when it comes to enacting a treaty, for example, a nuclear test ban treaty. The Senator from Nebraska, who is now presiding over the Senate, is working with Senator LIEBERMAN from Connecticut in an effort to revive that effort as well. 
   I hope the next session of Congress will be more productive in that area and many others. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DURBIN. I agree with the Senator from Nevada. Isn't it ironic that if you bought a hospitalization policy now, as an employee of a company, you would expect some sort of prescription drug benefit as part of it, that goes along with most policies? 
   Medicare does not include that. Seniors find themselves at a distinct disadvantage. Many of the seniors I talked to the other day in East St. Louis, IL, had heart problems. Back 35 years ago, we didn't have the wide array of potential prescription drugs to deal with blood pressure problems, for example. Now we do. The fact that these prescription drugs are available means longer and better lives for seniors.

   Mr. DURBIN. I do not. I agree with the Senator from Nevada that it is extremely shortsighted. Perhaps we are striking a moralistic pose when we say we are not going to allow prescriptions for contraception. In other words, we will acknowledge all of the other needs a woman may have, but not provide for birth control pills. That seems to me to be out of step with what American families expect us to do. Let them make the decision with their doctor. Instead, we are imposing on them what may be viewed by many as a moralistic point of view that should not be in our province. This is the first I have heard of this conscience clause, where a pharmacist, for example, might refuse to fill a prescription for birth control pills. Under this amendment that is being put in the bill, he or she is not required to do so.

   Mr. DURBIN. I agree completely with the Senator from Nevada. If we did nothing else but change that to say these health insurance companies could be held liable in a court of law before a jury of Americans for their decisions on health care, it would have a dramatic overnight impact on their decisions also. They would think twice about denying a doctor's recommendation for a surgical procedure or a hospitalization. They would think twice about delaying these decisions. 
   I have noticed, and I am sure the Senator from Nevada has noticed as well, many times, poor families I represent in Illinois will get into a struggle with an insurance company to try to get 
   help, for example, for a child with a serious illness or disease, and the struggle goes on for months; ultimately, the family prevails; but during that period of time, the poor child is suffering and the family is suffering. I think that giving those families across America the right to sue health insurance companies and saying to the health insurance companies that, like every other business in America, you will be held accountable for any wrongdoing, is just simple justice. To do otherwise is to suggest that we are going to create some special, privileged class of companies and that, literally, the health insurance companies are above the law. That is not America.

   Mr. DURBIN. That is right. The Senator probably saw the survey that there are people against giving families the right to hold health insurance companies accountable in court, and they say, well, if you work for an employer who provides health insurance, those families may turn around and sue the employer, as opposed to the health insurance company. So we looked at that and did a survey; we investigated. We found out that only in a very rare situation has that occurred. Here is an example. 
   In one circumstance, the employer collected the health insurance premiums from the employee and then didn't pay the health insurance company. So when the family tried to get coverage for medical care, the next thing that occurred was they found out the premiums had not been paid by the employer. That was the only example we could find. But if the employer picks a health insurance company and they make a decision, we could not find a single case where the employer was held liable because of the health insurance company's bad medical decision. 
   So that, I think, is a red herring, one that really does a disservice to American families who deserve this right.

Frankly, during the course of the debate here, the Senator can remember that when they referred to reputable medical leaders in the United States, such as Sloan Kettering--which is a great institution when it comes to cancer treatment and research and is respected around the world--they said, after their survey, that clinical trials really open the door for new treatments and therapies that, frankly, save us money. They found better and more efficient ways to keep people healthy. Meanwhile, the health insurance companies won't pay for them, and we are literally stopped in our tracks from moving forward with this kind of medical research and clinical trials. 
   In this case, with this little boy, Eric, who passed away from this disease, he was closed out of a clinical trial. Would he have survived with it? I am not sure, but because of the health insurance company, he never got a chance.

   Mr. DURBIN. I am aware of it. I salute the Senator from Minnesota, my  friend, Senator PAUL WELLSTONE, and our colleague, Senator DOMENICI from New Mexico, for their leadership on this issue. It is a classic illustration of another problem facing American families which this Congress has refused to address. The problem is very straightforward. 
   An internist from Springfield, IL, came to see me and said, ``Senator, I am literally afraid to put in a patient's record that I am giving them medication for depression because the insurance company will then label them as `victims of chronic depression,' a mental illness, and discriminate against them when it comes to future health insurance coverage.'' 
   That is outrageous. Mental illness is an illness, it is not a moral shortcoming. These people can and deserve to receive the very best care. Unless and until the Senator from Minnesota and others of like mind prevail in the Senate and in the House of Representatives, we will continue to discriminate against the victims of mental illness. That is something this Congress can do something about. We will leave here today or tomorrow, again, with that unfinished item on the agenda.

   Mr. DURBIN. The list grows. The Senator from Nevada knows as well as I do that unless and until we face the reality that every American citizen and every American family deserves the peace of mind of health insurance coverage, you will continue to see employers deciding not to offer health insurance protection, and working, lower income people in America will be without the protection of either Medicaid or health insurance at work. These people get sick as other people do. When they present themselves to hospitals, they receive charity treatment which is paid for by everyone, instead of receiving quality health care from the start. Preventive care can avoid serious illness. 
   Again, it is an issue that this Congress has refused to address.

   Mr. DURBIN. No. We haven't missed it, as the Senator from Nevada knows very well. This is the third rail for a lot of politicians around here because you have to start to talk about things that cost a lot of money. Doing nothing costs a lot more money. People get ill, they have to go to the doctor, and to the hospital. When they need to have serious treatment, or hospitalization, that is very expensive, too. 
   It strikes me that those of us who sought this office to serve in the Senate or the House of Representatives did not do it just to collect a paycheck and accumulate years toward a pension but to do something to help families across this country. This is the No. 1 concern of families across the country. 
   If you have a child reaching the age of 23, and all of a sudden it dawns on you: Where is my daughter going to get her health insurance? I can't bring her under my policy. You start thinking. I am sure the Senator from Nevada has. I have. As a parent, every day I call my daughter in Chicago, who is an art student, and an artist, and say, ``Jennifer, are you insured this month?'' ``Yes, dad.'' But I have to ask the question because health insurance is not automatic. 
   This Congress has done little, if anything, to help families across America who struggle with this every single day--not to mention those with preexisting conditions. If you have a preexisting condition and it is a serious one, and you have to change insurers, good luck. Most people find themselves being discriminated against. 
   I agree with the Senator from Nevada. We have been here day in and day out, and I have heard literally nothing suggested by the Republican leadership to deal with this.

   Mr. DURBIN. It is an embarrassment, and it is sad. We have spent more time this morning on the floor of the Senate talking about providing health insurance to the uninsured than we have spent in the entire session this year debating any proposals to deal with the problem. 
   I would say to my friends on the Republican side of the aisle that if you have an idea, or a concept, or a piece of legislation, come forward with it. Let us put our best proposal on the table. That is what the Senate is supposed to be about. It is supposed to be a contest of ideas, and the hope that when it is all said and done, the American people will prosper because we will come out with something that improves the quality of their lives. This year we have not.

   Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from Nevada is right. We overlook the numbers. The numbers are important. It is good to do something symbolic, but it doesn't solve the problem. We know the problem grows, as the Senator from Nevada has indicated, by 1 or 2 million a year--more people without health insurance coverage, more people who are vulnerable, and a Congress which has a tin ear when it comes to this issue. 
   We look at the Time magazine polls where it talks about the concern of the American people about health care. It doesn't get through to the leadership in Congress, and we will leave this year having done nothing to make it better.

   Mr. DURBIN. That is what it came down to. Those who would argue that gun control legislation and Capitol Hill want to take your gun away, that is not the case at all. What it is all about here is to say if you want to purchase a gun in America, whether it is from a licensed dealer, a pawnshop, or a gun show, we want to know a little about you. Are you a stable person? Do you  have a criminal record? If the answer is yes to either of those, if you are unstable, or you have a criminal record, then we will deny you the right to own a gun. Who can argue with that? A person who may 
   in a weak moment do something to hurt an innocent person shouldn't be given advantage or given an opportunity by the purchase of a firearm. 
   We passed that when Vice President Gore came to the floor and cast a deciding vote just a few weeks after Columbine. And that issue died over in the U.S. House of Representatives when the gun lobby came through and said that is an outrageous suggestion--that you would keep guns out of the hands of kids and criminals. 
   I think American families see this a lot differently. I am hoping that when Members of the Senate who voted with the gun lobby go home, they will hear the other side of the story.

   Mr. DURBIN. It is more than a little excessive. It is outrageous. In Illinois, of course, we are faced with similar demands. If you want to buy television time, you have to raise money. If you can't write a personal check for it, you have to go out and beg for it. 
   Members of the Senate and House of Representatives who spend their time on the telephone begging for money from individuals and special interest groups are not using their time to represent people in Congress. They are, frankly, unfortunately bringing an element into this political process that is not positive. And the voters know this. 
   Interestingly enough, since 1960, we have seen a dramatic increase in spending on Presidential election campaigns, for example. And we have seen a dramatic decline in voter turnout and the number of people who participate. Voters have decided to vote with their feet and stay home. They are sick of the negative advertising. They are sick of the special interest groups. They are sick of the fundraising involved in this. And they are sick of the process. In a democracy, you can't stand that very long because if democracy is going to work, people have to be involved in it. And that means cleaning up our acts. 
   When Senators FEINGOLD and MCCAIN came forward with campaign finance reform, 55 Senators--45 Democrats, 10 Republicans--said we agree, at least with respect to eliminating soft money. We should go forward with reform. 
   The Senator from Nevada, though, points to another problem: Even eliminating soft money will not eliminate the expense of campaigns, until we find a way to put legitimate candidates on the television without the extreme costs they run into now.

   Mr. DURBIN. I agree with the Senator from Nevada. He came to Congress, as I did, in 1983. There has been a dramatic and palpable change in the atmosphere on Capitol Hill in that period of time. I know he can remember in the early days when there was real civility between the political parties and real dialogue and parties at night. We went to dinner together even if we fought like cats and dogs on an issue on the floor. 
   That has changed. The well has been poisoned by the obsession with negative politics. I think that is one of the reasons the American people are checking out. They said if that is the best that can be done, you professionals in the business, we would just as soon stay home and watch professional wrestling. Occasionally professional wrestlers are involved in politics. The point they make is they don't approve of what is happening as we sink to lower and lower depths in the Democratic or Republican campaigns. 
   I agree with the Senator from Nevada. If one can't say something honest and complimentary about someone across the aisle without another person looking for a political advantage, that is a sorry commentary on the state of political affairs in America.

   Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from Nevada knows that is the source of many problems. At juvenile justice facilities across America, whether in the courts or in the correctional system, we will generally find the kids who are there dropped out of high school. Having dropped out, with time on their hands and no skills to get a job, many of them veered toward drugs and crime and a life that is not productive. 
   We end up paying for that over and over and over and over again. The old saying about an ounce of prevention is true. The Senator from Nevada has been a leader on this, telling the Nation we have to look at high school  dropouts not just as a sad reality but as a challenge to all to do better. 
   I look at some of the things I have learned recently about the American workforce. When I visited Dell Computer in Austin, TX, last week and talked to their officers and leaders in their company, they said they hired some 6,000 people in the previous 3 months to work for Dell Computer in Austin and Nashville, TN. I find their complaint or request similar to those I have heard in Illinois. We can't find enough skilled workers. That says to me that our educational system has to be better, it can't let any child fall behind and be forgotten. We have to address dropouts. We have to address skilled training. We have to address the kind of educational reform that goes way beyond the question about who wears a uniform to school and who doesn't. But we haven't done it in this Congress. 
   I am glad the Senator from Nevada has been a leader on this issue of dropout.

   Mr. DURBIN. I remember that debate. Frankly, I think that was really the critical debate, when it came to the future of that amendment and when the Republican majority rejected our attempts to protect the Social Security trust fund in the balanced budget amendment debate. That was the end of the debate. As I recall, that amendment lost by one or two votes at the most. I voted against it. I think the Senator from Nevada did as well. If it was not going to protect Social Security, then we should not go forward with it. 
   As I reflect on it, it is a little over 2 1/2 years ago that the battle cry on Capitol Hill was: The deficits, the balanced budget amendment, let the courts step in and have Congress stop spending; that was our only hope. Now we are in the era of surpluses. We have changed so dramatically without that constitutional amendment. 
   The Senator from Nevada recalls accurately the Social Security trust fund was a viable issue at that point.

   Mr. DURBIN. I was in the House of Representatives and cast a vote in favor of the President's program. I can tell you, literally, there were Democratic Members of the House of Representatives who lost in the next election, in 1994, because of that vote they cast. It was a really courageous effort on their part. It was exploited by those who said they were going to somehow destroy the economy and raise taxes across America. Yet look at what has happened. From 1993 to the current day, we have seen the Dow Jones index go from 3,500 to over 11,000, and all the things the Senator from Nevada has alluded to. 
   So that decision by President Clinton, supported exclusively by Democrats on Capitol Hill, had a very positive impact on America and its future. We have gone through one of the longest and strongest economic growth periods in our history. I think it relates back directly to that 1993 vote. 
   I can recall a number of my colleagues--Congresswoman Mezvinsky, a new Congresswoman from Pennsylvania who only served one term because she had the courage to cast that vote. If she had not, America might have gone on a different course than we have seen recently.

   Mr. DURBIN. It is a face-saving gesture on their part. Once we got into the budget negotiations and the Republican leadership was faced with actually saying, no, we won't add additional teachers, we will not have additional cops on the beat to address the crime problem across America, they could not do it. They ended up saying we actually won because we got this so-called across-the-board cut of .37 percent. 
   I might say to the Senator from Nevada, as he well knows, this is entirely within the discretion of the President, so it is not across the board. He can decide which areas of Federal spending to reduce to reach this target.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am delighted to join with my distinguished colleagues, Senators FRIST, DEWINE, KENNEDY, LEVIN and others in supporting the passage of Senate Resolution 225, which designates November 23, 2000, Thanksgiving Day, as a day for families to discuss organ and tissue donation with other family members and to Give Thanks, Give Life. The purpose of this legislation is to encourage discussions concerning family members' intentions to donate their organs so that informed decisions can be made if the occasion to donate arises. 
   As we prepare to recess for the Thanksgiving holiday, we are all aware that this is one of the few times throughout the year for families to take time out of their busy lives to come together and give thanks for the many blessings in their lives. This occasion presents an ideal opportunity for family members to have frank discussions about their intentions on the issue of organ and tissue donation. This is a discussion about life and sharing the gift of life and fits perfectly with the theme of Thanksgiving Day. Although family members may have already designated themselves as organ donors on their driver's license or voter registration, that step does not ensure donation will take place since the final decision on whether a potential donor will share the gift of life is usually made by surviving family members regardless of their loved one's initial intent. 
   There are approximately 21,000 men, women, and children in the United States who receive the gift of life each year through transplantation surgery made possible by the generosity of organ and tissue donors. This is only a small proportion of the more than 66,000 Americans who are on the waiting list, hoping for their chance to prolong their lives by finding a matching donor. Tragically, nearly 5,000 of these patients each year, or 13 patients each day, die while waiting for a donated heart, liver, kidney, or other organ. 
   In order to narrow the gap between the supply and the increasing demand for donated organs, we must step up our effort to encourage willing donors to make their desire to donate clear to the only people usually able to make the decision if the occasion should arise--their immediate family members. Although there are up to 15,000 potential donors annually, families' consent to donation is received for less than 6,000 donors. As the demand for transplantation increases due to prolonged life expectancy and increased prevalence of diseases that lead to organ damage and failure, including hypertension, alcoholism, and hepatitis C infection, this shortfall will become even more pronounced. Additionally, the need for a more diverse donor pool, including a variety of racial and ethnic minorities, will also continue to grow with the predicted population trends. 
   Many Americans will spend part of the Thanksgiving Day with some of those family members who would be most likely approached to make the important decision of whether or not to donate. Therefore, this would be a good time for families to spend a portion of that day discussing how they might give life to others on a day devoted to giving thanks for their own blessings. Open family discussions on this topic on a day of relaxation and family togetherness will increase awareness of the intentions of those willing to make the courageous and selfless decision to be organ donors, leading to more lifesaving transplants in the future. Designation of November 23, 2000, Thanksgiving Day, as a day for families to Give Thanks, Give Life is an important next step to promoting the dialogue between willing donors and their families, so that family members will know their loved ones' wishes long before the issue arises. 
   We have received a great outpouring of support for this resolution from many of the national organ and tissue donation organizations, including the American Heart Association, American Kidney Fund, American Liver Foundation, American Lung Association, American Society of Transplant Surgeons, American Thoracic Society, Association of Organ Procurement Organizations, Coalition on Donation, Eye Bank Association of America, James Redford Institute for Transplant Awareness, National Kidney Foundation, National Minority Organ and Tissue Transplant Education Program (MOTTEP), Transplant Recipients International Organization (TRIO), United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), and the Wendy Marks Foundation for Organ Donor Awareness. The tireless efforts of these groups and others have been critical in increasing donor awareness and education of the public on this extremely important cause. Their willingness to become involved with the Give Thanks, Give Life resolution and to provide their expertise in the development and implementation of a national campaign targeted at Thanksgiving 2000 will be invaluable in making this a national event with far-reaching effects. 
   The adoption of this resolution is a small victory for the organ donation awareness cause, but we must not forget the many casualties who have died awaiting a donated organ. One tragic loss that so many of us can relate to is the recent death of Walter Payton, an American hero. He contracted a rare liver disease that is often cured if the patient can receive a liver transplant. In Payton's case, the risk of deadly complications grew too quickly for him to be saved. He likely would have had to wait for years for his life-saving organ. The prevention of deaths like that of this great man and of so many other silent heroes is why our efforts in this life-saving cause must continue. A  day must come when no one dies because there is no available liver, kidney, heart, lung or other organ to save his or her life. 
   Mr. President, I thank all of my colleagues for joining me in supporting this worthwhile resolution designating Thanksgiving day of 2000 as a day for families to discuss organ and tissue donation with other family members, a day to ``Give Thanks, Give Life.''

   Mr. DURBIN. I salute Senator ROTH, Senator MOYNIHAN, Senator KENNEDY, Senator JEFFORDS, Senator HARKIN, and others who worked so hard on this Work Incentives Improvement Act. 
   A close friend of my family had a son who was mentally ill. This young man wanted more than anything to go to work. He knew if he did so, he would lose the protection of health insurance. So he was held back from that opportunity. I don't believe he was better for that. I don't believe America was better for that. 
   This bill addresses that challenge and says that as the disabled go to work, they will still be able to use Medicaid and Medicare to protect themselves with health insurance even as they earn some income. That is only just. It opens up an opportunity that currently is not there. I am happy to be a supporter of this legislation. I look forward to voting for it when it comes to the floor. 
   There is some reservation in my mind about the bill that is before us, not because of the provision I just mentioned, nor because of the extension of certain tax credits and benefits, but, rather, because of the language in this bill relating to organ donation. 
   This is the challenge we face in America. If you are an American grievously ill, in need of an organ transplant, your chances of survival depend more than anything on your address and how much money you have. You could be the most seriously ill person in some State in this Union and be overlooked and bypassed in favor of another patient in another State who is not as seriously ill and might be able to wait. That needs to change. That is certainly not a fair or American way. 
   The rules we are trying to promulgate to make that change have been the source of great controversy on Capitol Hill. It is sad when it comes to a point where Members of the House and Senate are deeply involved in a debate over the availability of organs for donation to those who need a transplant to live. 
   In my State of Illinois, over the last 3 years, 97 people have died waiting for organ transplants at the University of Chicago. I see my colleague from the State of Pennsylvania, Senator SANTORUM, where 187 people died waiting at the University of Pittsburgh. My colleagues, Senator MOYNIHAN and Senator SCHUMER, know that 99 people died waiting at Mount Sinai in New York. In the last week alone, two people have died at one of the Chicago transplant centers because an organ did not become available. 
   If you are an American who needs a liver transplant to survive and you live in the following States, you have much less chance of receiving the transplant: Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, New York, or Pennsylvania. 
   This is not a fair system. It is a system which cries out for justice and one that cries out for the politicians to step aside. Let the medical community find the best and most efficient way organs can move to the people who need them to live, instead of getting caught up in some special interest tangle here or political dogfight. It is sad that we are now in a situation on this bill where we have not resolved this contentious issue. I sincerely hope all parties will come together, and soon, to make certain that changes are made to make the system fairer. We know, by the people we represent, that this is literally a life-or-death argument. 
   Kathryn Krivy lives in Chicago. She runs the wellness clinic at the Northwestern Memorial Hospital. She is desperately in need of a new liver. She has developed primary biliary cirrhosis, a very rare autoimmune disease that is incurable. She has been on the transplant list in Chicago for over 2 years, but currently, because of the delay, she has decided to sign up at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota because it is much more likely she can receive a transplant in a shorter period of time. She has the knowledge and the resources to make that decision, but many of the poorer people in America waiting for an organ transplant do not have that luxury. 
   We should not reach the point in America where something as basic as the gift of life, an organ donation, depends on your home address. That is exactly what has occurred. An estimated 66,000 potential organ recipients are waiting their turn. Only 20,000 will see an organ transplant this year. Nearly, 5,000 Americans will die each year, at least 13 every day, while awaiting organ transplants. Of those, it is estimated that 300 to 1,000 Americans, maybe up to 3 a day, might be spared if this system were fairer and were revised. Unfortunately, that is not the case. 
   Though this is an excellent bill which I support, I believe it is a sad commentary that we have reached this state of affairs. I hope in the next session of Congress we can bring justice to organ donation. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to address several topics that I think may be of interest to those who are following the debate in the Senate. One in particular has become a focal point of the news media across the United States and literally around the world. That was the crash of the EgyptAir aircraft just a few weeks ago and the loss of over 200 lives. 
   I find it interesting, as we try to piece together all the information to determine what happened in that aircraft disaster, how limited we are with  respect to investigative tools. We have the so-called black box which has the flight data information. We are poring through that to try to determine what was happening mechanically on that plane when it went down. Then we have the audio recording which is now the focus of all sorts of international speculation. We listen to that audio recording for sounds, for words, and then try to piece together this mystery to determine what happened in the cockpit of that plane which led to this loss of life. 
   This is more than just to satisfy curiosity. This investigation is being undertaken, as most are, to determine whether there is something we can or should do to change the way aircraft are maintained and flown to protect those who are passengers. These investigations are critically important. We often come up with information about a mechanical failure. We then set out to repair it. We decide that planes won't go back up in the air until that is taken care of. If there is human error--that will happen in most accidents--we at least get to the bottom of the equation and understand what is going on. 
   The thing I find absolutely incredible, in 1999, is that we are dealing with such primitive tools when it comes to investigating aircraft disasters. The idea of an audio recording in a cockpit goes back to the 1930s. That was the state of the art then. But today, technology is far more advanced and I would suggest that we need to update plane safety by putting a video camera in the new planes' cockpits so we can determine what is happening in a crash. 
   The obvious is not being used. If you walk into a bank, if you walk into most office buildings, a casino, a convenience store, or stand in front of an ATM machine, you will be on a video camera which will reflect your conduct and your activities. Think what a difference it would make today if there had been a video camera in the cockpit of the EgyptAir aircraft. 
   The obvious question is, Why haven't we done this? The technology is there. It is a question of will. It may be a question of legislation. That is why I have written not only to the head of the Federal Aviation Administration as well as the Department of Transportation and the National Transportation Safety Board, urging them to expedite this question about whether or not we can safely install a video camera in the cockpit of aircraft to make certain that if there is an accident, so that we have another tool available to determine the reason for the disaster. We wouldn't be involved in all this speculation with the people of Egypt about the utterance of a prayer and whether that meant this was a suicide mission or something far different if we had a videotape we could refer to. We could find out who was at the controls and what they did at those controls. We would have an obvious clear answer to the question. 
   As I went through this, I was amazed. I stopped and thought for a moment, why in the world are we still stuck with a tape recording of voices and sounds in the investigation of this aircraft disaster? I am urging my colleagues, those who feel as I do, to join me in this effort to make certain we bring the very best technology to the cockpits of aircraft, not only in the United States but those who serve the United States, so the day may come that if there is a disaster, we will have a final and complete answer, not just to satisfy curiosity but, even more important, to make sure passengers across the world can at least have some piece of mind knowing we have done everything we can to make airline safety our top and highest priority.

   Mr. DURBIN. In the closing days of this session--it is interesting--we have spent almost a year debating 13 appropriations bills. Now we are trying to bring them to a close. We have some six or seven bills that will finally be lumped together in a huge package which literally no single Member of the Senate will ever read. 
   It will come to the floor. And then weeks afterwards, when people pore through the details, they will call us in our offices and say: Did you know there was a paragraph in this bill which has an impact on some people or some businesses? In all honesty, we don't. We rely on our leadership and other appropriators. Frankly, we rely on a system that is flawed, a system that allows this to happen too often. It is an unfortunate system and, frankly, 
   reflects the fact that this Congress has been very unproductive. 
   When Members of the Senate return to their homes and are asked by average families in their States, what did you accomplish to make life better for the families of America, we will be hard pressed to point to any significant thing we have done. 
   If we pay attention to the polling data of what Americans are worried about and what families are concerned about, we have missed the boat entirely. We have missed it entirely, when it comes to the question of the relationship between American families and their health insurance companies. Time and time again, when asked, these families respond that they are concerned about the fact doctors are no longer making decisions, nurses are no longer making decisions. Decisions are being made by insurance companies and their clerks. 
   We are down to the wire. Most of the major issues that are on the minds of the American public are being buried in this session of the Congress. Most of the bills, such as the Patients' Bill of Rights, that could have helped working families are being stifled and gutted. The Senate passed a bill several months ago which was an embarrassment. It was, in fact, a protection bill for the insurance companies. It didn't protect patients. It protected the CEOs of companies that are making literally millions of dollars off health care in America. 
   Over the steadfast opposition of the Republican leadership, the House of Representatives took a different course. They overwhelmingly approved, 275-151, a bipartisan bill with strong protections for all privately insured Americans. What a contrast. The Senate came up with an insurance version of the bill; the House came up with a version for American families. 
   Well, keep hope alive. Can there be a conference? Can we come together? Can we finally come up with a bill to protect American families? No. The honest answer is the Republican leadership in the House and the Senate refuse to convene the conference to come up with the bill and the House leadership has rigged the naming of conferees so that their conferees are all members who opposed the House passed bill. So we leave and close this session at the end of 1999 no better than when we started. We have nothing to say to the families across America when they ask whether we have taken any steps to protect them when it comes to their relationship with these insurance companies. 
   I am glad 68 Republicans in the House of Representatives broke from their leadership and voted with the Democrats for a real Patients' Bill of Rights. The bill the Senate passed on July 15 did absolutely nothing when it came to protecting Americans and dealing with their concerns about health insurance. 
   Let us take a look at some of the differences between the two bills introduced in the House and the Senate. This chart shows the Senate Republican bill and the bipartisan bill passed by Republicans and Democrats in the House of Representatives. It goes through a long litany of things American families tell us they want to see in their health insurance policies: protecting all patients, whether they are employed in a small or large business or bought their own insurance; the ability to hold plans accountable if they make the wrong decision about medical care; the definition of medical necessity; access to specialists; access to out-of-network providers--the list goes on and on--can a woman keep her OB/GYN as her primary care physician if that is the person with whom she is comfortable. 
   Some plans say no. Many women across America think that is a decision that should be made by them and their doctors. That is in this bill. And as we go through all of these, we find the bipartisan bill that passed the House of Representatives basically provides all these protections. 
   Look at the scant protections provided by the Senate Republican bill. You can see why many people across America think we have failed in our most important mission. The bill  passed by 
   the Senate excluded more than 100 million Americans from basic protections of health insurance reform. Most of the provisions applied only to the 48 million Americans in big employer-sponsored plans. It failed to provide basic protection to millions of others. 
   In my State, Caterpillar Tractor Company's workers would have been covered by the Senate bill; Motorola's employees would have been covered. John Deere's would be covered. But America's small business employees would be left behind by the Senate Republican bill. A farmer in Macoupin County, IL, who pays for his own family's insurance, and pays a lot for it, wouldn't be safe from insurance abuses. Public school teachers, policemen, women, firemen, and so many others would be out of luck. 
   I will return to this in a moment. I will speak to another issue, which I believe the Senator from Massachusetts is going to address. That is the perilous situation we find ourselves in in the closing hours of the session when it comes to the critical question of fairness in organ allocation. 
   We have a situation across America where over 4,800 Americans die every year waiting for an organ transplant. There are people in your State and mine sitting by the telephone hoping for the call that tells them they have a chance to live. It is hard to believe this has become a political issue. In fact, it has. An effort by the Department of Health and Human Services to make organs available across America to those in need is being stopped by an organization and a special interest group that really has put profit ahead of human well-being. I hope we can address this and address it forcefully. Let it be known on a bipartisan basis that we want to take the politics and the special interests out of organ allocation, that our dedication is to the men and women and children sitting by those telephones waiting for word of the availability of an organ. 
   At this point, I yield the floor to my colleague from Massachusetts, Senator KENNEDY.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, as we reflect at the end of this legislative session on our accomplishments, it is my belief that there are very few things we can go back home to tell the American people we achieved. 
   100 Senators and 435 Members of the House of Representatives came to Washington, DC, at the beginning of the year and listened closely to President Clinton's State of the Union Address where he outlined a program and some objectives, many stood and cheered. The applause lines were frequent during the course of that speech. People of both political parties left the State of the Union Address saying they were now energized and invigorated to go forward and address the issues facing America, and we began the legislative process. 
   For me, it is the 17th time I have been through this. It is hard for me to remember another session of the Congress as unproductive as this session of the Congress. When it came to issues that the people and families across America care about, this Congress refused to do anything. This wasn't a titanic struggle between the Republican conservative agenda and the progressive agenda of the Democrats where we brought issues to the floor and fought over amendments from one side to the other. That is what we are supposed to see on Capitol Hill. That didn't happen because there was no agenda on the other side. The Republican leadership had no agenda. 
   Recently, a Republican Congressman said we considered this year a ``legislative timeout.'' When timeouts occur during the course of an NFL football game, most people leave the room and go to the refrigerator; if America's families had left the room and gone to the refrigerator, they would have spent a lot of time there this year if they were waiting for Congress to do something. We didn't do it. We didn't respond. Now we have to go home, as we should, and explain it. 
   Let me state some of the issues we failed to act on this year, issues that make a difference to families across America. The Patients' Bill of Rights: The relationship of a person, a family, a business, to their health insurance company. That is pretty basic. When we asked America's families, they said that is the No. 1 concern. We want to make certain, when we go in a doctor's office, that the doctor makes the decision, not some clerk at an insurance company off in Topeka, KS. 
   I know from my experience in Illinois, as most others know from their own personal experiences, many times doctors are being overruled. I can recall a doctor who said to me a mother came in the office with an infant and the baby had been complaining of a headache on the right side of his head for several months. The doctor asked if it was always complaining about one side of the head, and the mother said yes. The doctor thought: I had better take an MRI to see if there might be a brain tumor. Before he said that to the mother, he looked at her file for the name of her insurance company. He said, excuse me, left the room, got on the phone and called the insurance company. He said: The mother presents herself with an infant complaining of headaches for several weeks and  months on one side of the head. It is my medical decision and opinion we should have an MRI to determine whether there is a possibility of a brain tumor. 
   The voice on the other end of the phone said: No; no. The insurance company that pays for the bills declines that procedure. 
   That doctor had to walk back to that room and not even tell the mother what had happened. He was bound by his contract not even to disclose that his medical judgment had been overruled by an insurance company clerk. 
   That is the state of health care in America. Families who go into those doctors' offices, confident the patient-doctor relationship is a sacred one that can be trusted, are beginning to think twice. They appeal to Members of Congress, Democrats and 
   Republicans: Do something; restore our faith in our medical system. Restore quality health care. Pass a Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   No, not in this Congress. This Congress and the Senate on July 15 passed a bill friendly to the insurance companies--as if they needed another friend on Capitol Hill--a bill which, frankly, didn't address the most basic issues families worry over every single day. 
   I won't even get into the question of expanding medical insurance coverage. We wouldn't even utter those words on Capitol Hill for fear it might bring down charges of radicalism, the idea that the 44 million uninsured Americans who grow in number every year might have their Government care enough to do something. We are not in that business with the Republican-controlled Congress. We don't talk about those things--like the aunt who is somewhere off in the distance, never referred to by a family. 
   We don't talk about medical coverage for all Americans. Families talk about it. Families talk about their kids turning 23 years of age, coming off the health insurance policies of their moms and dads, and whether they have a chance to be covered. Families talk about whether or not someone with a preexisting condition can find insurance in this country. We don't talk about it in Congress, no. The insurance companies don't want Members to talk about it. The special interests ruled this session of Congress. 
   We see in the Republican legislative landfill of the 106th Congress the Patients' Bill of Rights, an issue we failed to address. 
   The nuclear test ban treaty: Just a few weeks ago, possible one of the worst decisions made by Congress in a decade, a decision to turn down a treaty where the United States not only would have the moral leadership in the world but enact a treaty that backs it up and says to countries around the world: If you are not a nuclear power, don't become one. If you have nuclear weapons, don't test them. Let's stop this nuclear arms race in place. 
   This nuclear test ban treaty failed in the Senate on a largely partisan vote. It was a sad day for America. It was a sad day for a country which has tried to lead the world and say to countries such as India and Pakistan, stop what you are doing, don't keep this arms race going and develop nuclear weapons that could mushroom into a war that would destroy not only people in those two countries but in many other nations. This Congress, this Senate, failed to enact a nuclear test ban treaty. 
   We failed to enact any legislation to deal with school construction. Take a look at the numbers: There will be more kids showing up for classes in the next 10 years than we have been serving in the last 10 or 20 years. Those kids need teachers, they need classrooms, they need modern schools, schools where they have the electricity to make certain they can sustain the computer technology, schools that are safe, schools where kids have a positive learning environment. When the President made this proposal for school construction, it was greeted with disbelief and disapproval on the other side of the aisle. We have done nothing in this session of Congress to deal with school construction. 
   Campaign finance reform: Is there a more basic issue for the future of Congress? Will we ever change the current system which has become a bidding war among special interests where Members of the Senate such as myself literally have to be on the phone day and night, begging for money for a campaign that costs millions of dollars? If you are not independently wealthy and cannot write a big check to sustain your own campaign in the Senate, you spend most of your time begging for money. Is that what Americans want in the Senate or the House of Representatives? I don't think so. 
   A bipartisan bill--Senator JOHN MCCAIN, a Republican, of Arizona, and Senator RUSS FEINGOLD, a Democrat from Wisconsin--said we can clean up this system, but this Congress failed to enact meaningful campaign finance reform. Only 55 Senators--45 Democrats and 10 Republicans--came forward in support of this most basic change in reform. 
   As part of the legislative landfill of the 106th Congress, Republicans were successful in not passing campaign finance reform. 
   Minimum wage increase? The minimum wage in this country is $5.15 an hour. When you calculate that out, it means a little over $10,000 a year in income. Can any of us consider a life on $10,000 a year and what it would mean? Keep in mind, these are men and women who get up and go to work every single day and make $5.15 an hour. Inflation eats away at it, at a wage that was already too low to be livable. We tried this year to increase the minimum wage by 50 cents an hour each year over the next 2 years, saying it is only fair that working men and women have that help from their Government. We were resisted on the Republican side of the aisle. Ultimately, they came up with their own package. They do not do it over 2 years; they do it over 3 years, which costs those wage earners $1,200 a year in income to take that approach. Mr. President, $1,200? You might say that is not that big a deal. It is if you are making $10,000 a year; it is a very big deal. 
   The Republican approach representing special interests in stopping the minimum wage increase prevailed. They also added in there some tax breaks that, frankly, cannot be taken seriously because they did not pay for them. There we have it--the minimum wage issue into the landfill. 
   This is one you will remember, the juvenile crime control bill. You will remember it because it came up right after Columbine High School. It was an effort by the Senate to pass a sensible gun control law. When the final vote was cast, it was 50-50. Vice President Al Gore came to the floor, broke the tie, and we enacted the bill which said as follows: When people buy guns at gun shows, we want to know if they have a history of violent mental illness or a criminal record. 
   In an effort to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and kids, we passed a sensible gun control measure, sent it across the Rotunda to the House of Representatives, where it literally died because the National Rifle Association and the gun lobby decided they did not want to pass any gun control bills this session. This Nation, which was shocked by the occurrences at Columbine and so many other schools, had a chance to pass sensible gun control legislation and failed. We will go home now to face our constituents, many of whom live in cities where gun violence is a commonplace occurrence, and have to tell them this Congress failed to pass any sensible gun control legislation. 
   Smaller class size--thank goodness the President prevailed in his negotiations. The President's goal, and one I share, is to reduce class size in the early grades so quality teachers can meet with kids right when they are starting their education and help them along. You take the kids who are the best and the brightest and you give them the biggest challenges. You take those who may be suffering from some learning disability, you diagnose their problem and try to deal with it at an early age. You take the kids who do not learn as quickly and give them special attention. For teachers to achieve that, they need smaller class sizes. If you put 30 kids in a classroom, the teacher is lucky to maintain discipline, let alone meet the special needs of individual students. 
   So the President said, and I agree: We need to focus 100,000 teachers into reducing class size across America. Until a few days ago, the Republicans had opposed this. Finally, the President prevailed. Finally, we are moving forward on this initiative which we started last year that serves school districts all across America, not just in  the cities but in the towns and suburbs alike. 
   Look at the efforts to help family farmers. We finally came through with that on a bipartisan basis. It is one of the things we achieved this year. But it begs the question, to leave it at that, because next year if we do not change the basic Federal farm policy, the so-called Freedom to Farm Act, we are going to see a rerun, unfortunately, of what we saw this year--farmers literally struggling to survive. As prices across the world have plummeted, they cannot make a decent income. 
   In my home State of Illinois, a State that has a very strong farm sector, just a few years ago the average net farm income for a farmer was about $48,000 a year. This year it will be about $25,000. That is about half. But $13,000 of the $25,000 will come from Federal payments. The other about $12,000 will come in farm operations. We cannot sustain a farm economy where half the income of farmers in Illinois and Minnesota or Nebraska comes from the Federal Treasury. The law has to be changed, and this year we did not take up a change in the law as we should have. 
   The last point I would like to make before I yield to my colleague from Minnesota is this. The Patients' Bill of Rights is an issue we have to return to as the highest priority in the next Congress. When you consider the lives of people who are dependent on this action, you understand the severity of it. I will tell one quick story. 
   Take a look at this little girl here. She is Theresa. She lives in Yorkville, IL. Her dad is a police officer and her mom stays at home to look after her. She suffers from a rare disease known as spinal muscular atrophy. It is a very debilitating disease. As you can see, she is on a ventilator, and I met a couple of kids just like this. This is what her mother says:  
   She was hospitalized from September 2nd last year until February 15 of this year due to fighting the insurance company for certain provisions we could not do without in our home. 
   We had to fight and fight with the insurance company for things the doctors had said were needed [for Theresa.] So we fought for 2 1/2 months. We eventually did get everything that we needed, except it was a very long battle.  
   Can you imagine having your family separated that long because the insurance company did not want to help?  
   Theresa caught RSV in the hospital while we were waiting for the appeal to go through. That is why she now has [a ventilator and tracheotomy.]  
   That is a real life family. Theresa's dad is a policeman. Theresa and her family would not be protected by the Republican version of the Patients' Bill of Rights. They would not have the benefit of an appeals process in a timely fashion so they could get a good answer, a sensible medical answer for this little girl. Instead, they are embroiled in month after month of weary debate with the insurance company. That is health care in America for too many American families. This Congress has failed, utterly failed to address this critical issue. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Several Senators addressed the Chair.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, on Friday, November 12, a United Nations World Food Programme airplane carrying 24 people crashed in northern Kosovo, killing all on board. The plane departed Rome bound for Pristina, Kosovo--the wreckage was found only 20 miles from its destination. The passengers, mainly humanitarian aid workers, were on a routine flight run by the World Food Programme. 
   The World Food Programme is the world's largest international food aid organization that provides food aid to 75 million people worldwide through development projects and emergency operations. 
   The WFP fights both the acute hunger that grips a family fleeing civil conflicts and the chronic hunger that slowly gnaws away a life. Hunger afflicts one out of every seven people on earth. 800 million people are malnourished. Starvation threatens at least another 50 million victims of man-made and natural disasters. In 1998, the WFP delivered 2.8 million tons of food to 80 countries. These projects are enormous undertakings, and are sometimes not without human costs. 
   The WFP has lost more employees than any other UN agency in work-related accidents, illnesses or attacks. Fifty-one people since 1988 have lost their lives while in service to those who would otherwise go hungry. Among the 24 people who died in the most recent tragedy were doctors, a civil engineer, aid workers, a volunteer chemist, police officers and non-governmental organization workers. 
   As we begin to plan our Thanksgiving meals, let us pause a moment to reflect on those who dedicate themselves to the eradication of starvation. Let us remember our dear friend and colleague, Congressman Mickey Leland, who died in a plane crash 10 years ago while leading a mission to an isolated refugee camp in Ethiopia. 
   And as we talk about the United Nations, let us not forget who the U.N. is made up of--humanitarian aid workers who devote their lives, often at great risk, to easing the suffering of others.

    Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in 1996, President Alexander Lukashenka imposed a new constitution on Belarus that effectively destroyed its nascent democracy and returned that country to a Soviet-style police state. Human rights violations are routine and living conditions are deplorable because of the stagnant economy. Opposition leader Simyon Sharetsky fled to Vilnius, Lithuania. 
   The situation in Belarus has worsened dramatically in recent months for remaining members of the opposition. Some have disappeared, including Viktor Gonchar, Yuri Krasovsky, Yuri Zakharenka, and Tamara Vinnikova. Some have been arrested for taking part in the October 17, 1999 ``Freedom march,'' including Anatoly Lebedko, Chairman of the Committee for International Affairs of the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Belarus, Nikolay Statkevich, leader of the Social Democratic Party, and Valery Shchukin, Deputy of the Supreme Council. 
   Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia are very concerned about the direction Belarus has taken under the Lukashenka regime. Belarus' economy is apparently imploding, and neighboring countries are concerned about regional instability. Our recent experience with Slobodan Milosevic's Yugoslavia should make us all concerned about the implications of a ruthless dictator threatening stability in Europe. 
   Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia have successfully transformed themselves from Soviet-dominated Communist states to fully democratic market democracies integrated with the West and Western institutions. We must be sure that Belarus does not threaten the remarkable progress these stalwart countries have made in only 10 years since the fall of the Soviet empire. 
   Also troubling is a draft treaty that may be signed before the end of the year between Lukashenka and President Yeltsin to effect a political union between Russia and Belarus. All Western countries should be concerned that such a union would only hurt efforts to shore up Russia's economy and strengthen its fragile democracy. 
   That is why my colleague, Senator CAMPBELL, and I join together today to a resolution condemning the actions of the Lukashenka regime. This resolution--a companion measure to one introduced by our colleague in the House of Representatives, Representative SAM GEJDENSON--condemns the Lukashenka regime, the arrest of opposition figures and the disappearance of others; calls for a dialog between Lukashenka and the opposition, the restoration of a democratically-elected government and institutions; calls on the U.S. President to fund travel by Belarusian opposition figures and for non-governmental organizations in Belarus and to support information flows into Belarus. I call on my colleagues to join us in cosponsoring this resolution.

Is it not true that we waited until the very last day to even bring up this issue of education, the highest priority for American families? Now we find ourselves trying to adjourn, stuck on an issue that could have been resolved months ago had we made education as high a priority on Capitol Hill as it is in family rooms across America.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor to offer an amendment on the bankruptcy bill, but in light of the statement that was just entered into the record by Senator HELMS, in reference to my former colleague, Senator Carol Moseley-Braun, I am constrained to respond. 
   Let me say at the outset, I fully support President Clinton's decision to nominate Senator Carol Moseley-Braun to continue to serve this Nation as our Ambassador to New Zealand and Samoa. I was happy to appear before the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee last Friday and to introduce her. I believe she received a fair hearing that day, and those of us who were there came away with the impression that, when her name is called to be appointed Ambassador, she will receive a strong bipartisan vote of the Senate. But I have to say some of the suggestions that have been made in the previous statement at least need to be cleared up for the record. 
   Running for the Senate subjects you to all sorts of inquiry and investigation, not only by your opponent, who will look at you in the harshest terms, but by the press and any other inquiring mind. Those of us who subject ourselves to that process understand it is going to be tough. Senator Carol Moseley-Braun has done that repeatedly throughout her career, running for offices at the legislative level, the county level, and twice as a statewide candidate in Illinois. Not surprisingly during that period of time there have been many charges that have been thrown at her. Many of those charges were just repeated today on the floor of the Senate. I might remind my colleagues in the Senate, they are just that. They are charges; they are not proven. 
   I might also say to my colleagues in the Senate, those who view this body as somehow a closed club that takes care of its own ought to take a look at what happened with this nomination, because what Senator Carol Moseley-Braun was subjected to during the course of this process is a standard which, frankly, may exceed a standard imposed on any other person who comes up for an ambassadorship to a post such as New Zealand. In other words, she was subjected to more rigorous examination and questioning than virtually any person off the street nominated by the President. 
   It may surprise some people to think a former United States Senator would go through that process, but I am happy to report, as the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee learned last Friday, after Senator Carol Moseley-Braun went through an extensive background check at the request of the White House, after her campaign records were reviewed in detail, after all the charges put in the RECORD on this floor were investigated, after the Internal Revenue Service and Department of Justice and FBI were called in and asked point blank if she was guilty of wrongdoing, they all concluded there was no proof of wrongdoing, and they recommended her name to the President, who then submitted it to the Senate. 
   Now we are in a position where many of those same charges, with no basis in fact, have been repeated again on the Senate floor. That is truly unfortunate. Let me address two of them. No. 1, as a Senator serving in this body, she visited Nigeria and a leader there of whom the United States did not approve. 
   I will have to tell you I did not approve of that leader 
   either, but no one has ever questioned the right of any Senator or any Member of the House to decide to take foreign travel and visit a foreign leader without the approval of the State Department. I think, frankly, that is all well and good. When the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Senator HELMS, chose to visit General Pinochet in Chile, that was his right. Many people in the United States might question it, but I do not question his decision to do that. That is something for him to defend to the voters of North Carolina. 
   When my Governor in the State of Illinois decided 2 weeks ago to visit with the dictator leader in Cuba, Fidel Castro, again it was his right. In fact, I supported his visit. I thought it was important. 
   So to bring up this red herring of a visit to Nigeria while she served in the Senate is to hold Carol Moseley-Braun to a different standard than we hold our own colleagues and other leaders across the Nation. I don't think that is fair. 
   Second, on the talk about campaign finances and whether she misspent them, the record of the committee tells the story. When an auditor came from the FEC and looked at detailed records from the Carol Moseley-Braun campaign in 1992 and went through the $8 million in expenditures in that campaign, they were able to identify $311 unaccounted for. 
   Mr. President, I make a great effort to try to have a full accounting, as required by law. I am sure every Senator does. But $311 out of $8 million? To make of that some sort of a disgrace or scandal is to exaggerate it beyond recognition. Those are the charges flung again at Senator Carol Moseley-Braun on the Senate floor. 
   That is a sad occurrence and one which I wish had not occurred. Frankly, I hope the Members of the Senate, before we adjourn today, have a chance to vote on giving our colleague a chance to serve because we are not only sending an able representative to represent the United States with one of our great allies, New Zealand, we are sending to New Zealand evidence the American dream is still alive because  Carol Moseley-Braun--and I will readily concede she is not only my former colleague but my friend--and her public life are a testament to what America stands for. Born in a segregated hospital facility in Chicago, her mother, a medical technician in the same place, her father a Chicago policeman, she worked her way through college to not only earn a degree but earn a law degree from the University of Chicago, to serve for 5 years as an assistant U.S. attorney and prosecutor, to become the first African American woman to ever serve as a member of the leadership in the Illinois General Assembly, 
   to become the first African American woman ever elected countywide in Cook County, and the first African American woman in this century to be elected to the Senate. 
   Time and time again, every step of her life has crushed down another barrier so that those who follow her will have a better opportunity. 
   Now she joins some four other African American women who serve as our Ambassadors should the Senate decide to give her that chance. As she journeys to New Zealand--and I hope she will soon--she will bring with her not only a wealth of public service but a story about how the American dream can be realized if you believe in yourself and if you believe that equality is more than just a word--it is a principle which guides this great country. 
   I stand in strong support of Carol Moseley-Braun. I believe she will be an excellent Ambassador, and I believe the vote that comes out of this Chamber will be strong and bipartisan and put to rest, once and for all, many of the charges and rumors which have been swirling around her nomination over the past several weeks. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor to my colleague, the Senator from New York.

   Mr. DURBIN. Shortly the Members of the Senate will have a chance to vote on an amendment to which I hope they will give consideration. It is an amendment which addresses a segment of the credit industry which represents the bottom feeders. These are the people who prey on the vulnerable in society. These are the people who try to ensnare vulnerable, frail, elderly, and sick people into literally signing over the only thing they own on Earth--their homes. 
   You have seen the cases. You have read about them in the papers and seen the exposes on television. They find a widow living alone in her home. They come in and want to sell her some siding or a new roof or new furnace. The next thing you know, she has a second mortgage on her home. The terms of the mortgage are outrageous. She finds herself losing the only thing she has left on Earth--her home. These are so-called ``equity predators.'' 
   I salute the Senator from Iowa, Mr. GRASSLEY, who is the manager of this bill on the Republican side, because he had a hearing in March of 1998 of the Special Committee on Aging of the Senate that was dedicated exclusively to this outrage in the credit industry, that these people would come in and prey on so many vulnerable people. 
   Let me quote Senator GRASSLEY. I do not know if I have his permission, but I did give him notice that I would read this from the hearing. He said:  
   Before we begin, I want to quote a victim--a quote that in my mind sums up what we are all talking about here today. She said the following: ``They did what a man with a gun in a dark alley could not do. They stole my house.''  
   That is what is happening, time and again, when these unscrupulous creditors and lenders prey on the elderly and people who are less educated and end up taking something away from them that they have saved for their entire lives. 
   What does my amendment do? My amendment says that if this plays out, if they end up ensnaring some poor person into their trap, so that they stand to lose their home, and ultimately that person has to go bankrupt because of this unscrupulous lender, when they go to bankruptcy court, that same equity creditor cannot take away their home. If that person did not follow the law that requires full disclosure and fair treatment of people who are loaned money, they cannot come to bankruptcy court and end up with the deed to the home of an elderly widow. 
   I think that is simple justice. It was a question before this Senate today as to whether or not, when we talk about abuses by those filing for bankruptcy, we will be equally outraged by abuses by creditors such as these predatory lenders who use our legal system and our bankruptcy court to literally push through processes that take away from people things they have saved for their entire life. They are serial credit predators. They prey on the elderly, the less educated, the frail, and the vulnerable. They are the bottom feeders in the credit industry. My amendment will give my colleagues in the Senate a chance to tell them once and for all, stop this devious conspiracy to go after the elderly in America. 
   How many people are affected by this? So many that in the State of California they have set up a special  fraud unit to go after these predatory lenders. 
   I am sad to report that as I stand here today, many reputable lenders are opposing my amendment. What does that say about them? If they are opposing my amendment to go after the bad guys, how does that reflect on the good guys in this business? I don't think it tells a very good story. 
   The groups supporting my amendment include the Consumer Federation of America, the Consumers Union, National Consumer Law Center, the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, the UAW, and others who have decided, as I have, that we should put an end to this once and for all, as is stated in their letter in support of my amendment: As consumers who receive these loans are commonly forced into bankruptcy, it is essential to create a bankruptcy remedy that protects debtors and other honest creditors from the predators who seek to enforce these loans. 
   Let me give a couple examples of these loans. Lillie Coleman is a resident of New City in Illinois, 68 years old, living on a pension. In comes a person who says: I'll tell you what I will do, Ms. Coleman. I know you own a house. I will consolidate all your debts, and I will lend you $5,000 for home improvement. The next thing you know, she has signed a $65,000 mortgage on the home she owned and had worked for for a lifetime. The next thing you know, they are holding these closings without inviting her. They are not giving her the papers to sign. They have broker's fees that were never disclosed to her. They find out that checks that were supposed to go to her creditors aren't going to creditors. They are finding out basically that there is money missing. 
   There sits Ms. Coleman with a second mortgage on her home and the prospect of losing her home in her retirement at the age of 68. Those are the people we are talking about. Those are the folks knocking on the doors, ringing the telephone off the hook night and day, sending all these luring mailings to people saying: You can just sign the back of this little check, and the next thing you know, there will be money in your hand. 
   The next thing you know, there is a new mortgage on your home. And if you miss a payment or if you don't understand the terms, you could lose it. 
   It didn't just happen in Illinois. It happens all over the place. In fact, it has happened in Utah, two or three cases of balloon payments. Do you know what a balloon payment is? You make the regular monthly payments; everything is going along fine. There is a small clause in the contract that says: At one point in time you had better come up with $49,000 or you lose your home. That is a balloon payment. Many borrowers don't know the details, particularly if they are folks who are 
   elderly. They don't see well. They may not hear well. They think they are doing the right thing. They, of course, have the legal capacity to sign a contract. The next thing you know, they end up with their home on the line. They may end up in bankruptcy court. 
   What I am saying with this amendment is, we are not going to give them a chance to use the bankruptcy courts of America as a fishing expedition for the well-earned assets of American families. 
   This amendment was part of the bankruptcy bill we passed last year 97-1. If there is anybody sitting on the floor saying this idea is way too radical, they voted for it last year. They voted for it last year 97-1. It is something that should be part of this bill. 
   If you are outraged by the lawyers who are ripping off the system, as I see my friend, the Senator from Alabama, on the floor, who brings this up regularly, if you are outraged by those who go to bankruptcy court who shouldn't be there, share your outrage when it comes to these predatory lenders. Join me in passing an amendment that tells them once and for all, you can't use our legal system to continue this deceptive scheme. 
   We have found in the course of researching this matter that there are several different approaches these predatory lenders use. They engage in practices where they lend somebody money far beyond their ability to repay. They know going in, with a borrower of limited savings and equity in a home, that they can put that borrower on the spot where, in a short period of time, they are going to default. 
   We know as well that they try to make an arrangement saying: I will tell you what, we will put the siding on the home. We will make the direct payments to the home contractor, and don't you worry about it. The next thing you know, they have signed the mortgage, the home contractor is not paid, and the poor widow finds herself being assaulted in every direction by those who expect to be paid and finds herself in bankruptcy court. 
   They impose illegal fees, such as prepayment penalties or increased interest rates at default. They impose balloon payments due in less than 5 years. We have a group of people who are gaming the system at the expense of the most vulnerable people in America. 
   This amendment does not add any additional requirements to current law. It says that those who want to lend money have to themselves obey the law. If you want to stand for law and order when it comes to somebody coming into bankruptcy court, a debtor who can no longer pay their debts, if you want to establish new and higher standards for them so that they don't rip off the system, for goodness' sake, show some heart when it comes to those who are in bankruptcy court through no fault of their own. They are elderly people who signed onto the contract, and the next thing you know the only thing they own on Earth is at risk.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this amendment was enacted by the Senate as part of the bankruptcy bill last year. The bill received a vote of 97-1. It imposes no new legal duties on creditors or lenders but says they must follow the law if they want to take advantage of the law. 
   We are talking about equity creditors, lenders who prey on people who are disabled, elderly, vulnerable, and less educated. Folks on a fixed income with a home end up with a new mortgage because they wanted siding on their home or a new roof and several months or years later find out they are about to lose the last thing they have on Earth--their home--because of unscrupulous practices by these creditors. 
   The bottom line is this: If we are going to have rules in this society for borrowers, we should also have rules for creditors. The rules are called the law. If they do not follow the law, they can be thrown out of bankruptcy court if they are a borrower. If they do not follow the law and the Durbin amendment passes, they will be thrown out of the court because they have been guilty of unscrupulous credit practices, taking advantage of the elderly. 
   All the Senators on the floor who have lamented the scandalous behavior of these creditors in the past have a chance now to vote for an amendment to tell them once and for all that their low-life tactics are unacceptable in America. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, when the Senate returns tomorrow morning, our very first vote will be an important one for literally millions of American workers and families, and some 320,000 in Illinois, who are watching carefully to see if this Senate is listening to America. It is the question of the minimum wage and whether or not it is going to be increased. 
   Senator KENNEDY has a proposal that I support which calls for an increase in the minimum wage from the current level of $5.15 an hour to 50 cents more on January 1 of the year 2000, and then 50 cents again on the following January 1. 
   So that those who are going to work every single day, trying to raise their families, trying to make a decent income, will, in fact, move closer to a livable wage. This is still a long way away from it because people who are earning $5.15 an hour or $6.15 an hour hardly live in the lap of luxury. 
   There is a noteworthy difference between the approach being suggested by my friend and colleague, the Senator from New Mexico, on the Republican side, and the suggestion of Senator KENNEDY, my friend and colleague on the Democratic side, when it comes to a minimum wage. The difference may seem cosmetic to those who do not take a close look because the Republican side suggests that to raise the minimum wage by $1, we should take an extra year or 3 years instead of 2 to achieve this. 
   What does that mean to the working person? If the Republican approach should pass, it means $1,200. For someone making $50,000 a year or $100,000, or more, $1,200 hardly seems to be a grand amount of money to be worried over when you stretch it over a period of time. But imagine if your income was only $10,000 a year on a minimum wage, and what is at stake here is $1,200. The Republican approach would shortchange those who go to work every single day in America on a minimum wage by $1,200 as they stretch this out over a 3-year period of time. 
   Of course, the bill does much more than address the increase in the minimum wage. It also addresses some needed changes in tax law. 
   I support Senator KENNEDY's approach. He does provide the kind of relief which small businesses need in order to find the tax relief to provide things for their employees. It is a proposal from Senator Chuck ROBB of Virginia and Senator Max BAUCUS of Montana, a small business tax proposal which, among other things, finally puts a 100-percent deduction for the health insurance costs of self-employed people. The Senate and Congress have been moving toward this goal. This bill will achieve it on the Democratic side, if it is passed. 
   It also provides assistance to small businesses that provide child care. Think about families, particularly single mothers and single parents who have to worry every single day whether or not their kids are safe. This is an incentive for small businesses to provide child care facilities, a tax credit, one that can assist them and their workers. 
   In addition, there is a pension package which has been supported by Senator GRAHAM, a Democrat of Florida, and Senator GRASSLEY, a Republican of Iowa. The Democratic package is not only a well-balanced package providing child care health and retirement benefits for small businesses, but more important than anything, the Democratic  package is paid for. It is paid for. The Republican package of tax changes is not. 
   In other words, it is an extension of the possibility of debt. It is a promise that can't be kept. The Democratic package is paid for. The Republican one is not. The Democratic package increases the minimum wage over 2 years by $1 an hour, and the Republicans over 3 years costing workers $1,200 by taking the Republican approach. 
   I say to those who are working across America that this is hardly what they need. It is curious to me that only a few weeks ago, the same Republican Party that cannot produce $1,200 for people who get up and go to work every day at minimum-wage jobs came before us with a $792 billion tax cut primarily for wealthiest people in this country.

   Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from New Mexico. 
   Mr. President, consider that only a few weeks ago, this Chamber was seriously considering a $792 billion tax cut for some of the wealthiest people in America, and many people on the other side of the aisle said that is good, wise policy. Alan Greenspan of the Federal Reserve didn't think so. Frankly, the people of America don't think so. They told the Republican Party to keep this tax cut primarily for wealthy people. 
   Now comes a proposal from the Republican side when it comes to the working families that would cut out $1,200 in income, $1,200 to a family making about $10,000 a year. That is an upside down priority. That is a priority that forgets the real people who are working in this country to make America strong. Eleven point four million workers would get a pay increase with the Democratic Kennedy minimum wage increase package, and with this proposed increase that Senator KENNEDY has proposed and I am supporting, it means over $2,000 a year for people who are scraping to get by, primarily women who are in the minimum wage workforce, African-Americans, and Hispanics, people who go to work every single day who understand the importance of work and deserve our respect for doing so. 
   The vote tomorrow morning will be a measure of how much respect we have for them. This $2,000 increase for these workers can mean 7 months of groceries, 5 months of rent, 10 months of utilities, tuition and fees at a community college so one of their kids has a chance to even have a better and more successful life. 
   I say to the Senate this is a test. It is a test as we wrap up this session about where our values will be. Will they be with these working families? Will we make certain they get an increase in their basic wage or will we stand with those who want to delay it and delay and delay it? The argument is often made that if you increase the minimum wage, you are going to lose jobs. 
   Take a look at my home State of Illinois. Since the 1996 increase in the minimum wage, take a look at the real statistics: 268,100 new jobs since we last increased the minimum wage; 33,100 new retail jobs, the area where most minimum-wage jobs are found; unemployment is down 10 percent; and the unemployment rate is 4.7 percent. 
   As we increase the minimum wage, we have not seen all of the things that the Republicans tell us we should be afraid of--afraid of losing jobs and creating chaos in the workplace. Exactly the opposite has happened across America. Since we last raised the minimum wage, we have seen an economy moving forward. 
   Now the real test for this Senate is whether or not we are going to bring on board this ship as it moves forward the people who get up and go to work every single day, the men and women who work in the convenience stores, who make our beds in motels and hotels we stay in overnight, the folks who serve our food and cook it in the kitchen. These are the invisible people who keep America moving forward. But these invisible people will be watching tomorrow to see if this Senate is going to give the minimum wage increase which is so essential. 
   I hope those on the Republican side who are preaching fiscal integrity and fiscal soundness will think twice about voting for a bill that not only stretches the minimum wage an extra year but provides tax cuts without compensating offsets. What does that mean in layman's terms? The Republican package doesn't pay for the tax cuts that they are trying to enact. They have some good ideas, I am sure. But it isn't honest if you didn't pay for them. 
   What Senator KENNEDY and the Democrats have done, what we have said is when it comes to small business and the tax proposal, we have the means of paying for them. And by and large, we are going to make sure that when the small businesses that enact these increases in the minimum wage turn to us and say, are you listening to some of our other concerns, the answer will be yes. We want to make sure you can deduct every single penny of your health insurance premiums as every major corporation can. Self-employed people, farmers, and small businesses deserve the same benefit: Make sure that there is a facility available for child care; make sure that a pension package can be offered--things that will help small businesses extend opportunities for their workforce and create better employee moral and productivity. 
   I close by saying that this vote tomorrow morning at 10:30 is a test of the Senate's will and the Senate's values. I hope that we will stand by people who go to work every single day. 
   It is one thing to preach on the floor about people looking for a handout; these folks are looking for a hand up. They are working and need assistance and an increase in their minimum wage. I rise in strong support of the proposal by Senator KENNEDY. I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join me. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my distinguished colleagues, Senator FRIST, Senator DEWINE, Senator KENNEDY, Senator LEVIN and others in submitting a resolution that would designate November 23, 2000, Thanksgiving Day, as a day for families to discuss organ and tissue donation with other family members. The resolution uses the theme Give Thanks, Give Life to encourage these discussions so that informed decisions can be made if the occasion to donate arises. 
   Traditionally, Thanksgiving is a time for families to take time out of their busy lives to come together and give thanks for the many blessings in their lives. This presents the perfect opportunity for family members to discuss their intentions on the issue of organ and tissue donation. Although designation as an organ donor on a driver's license or voter's registration is a valuable first step in the donation process, it does not ensure donation will take place since the final decision on whether a potential donor will share the gift of life is always made by surviving family members regardless of their loved one's initial intent. 
   There are approximately 21,000 men, women, and children in the United States who receive the gift of life each year through transplantation surgery made possible by the generosity of organ and tissue donations. This is only a small proportion of the more than 66,000 Americans who are on the waiting list, hoping for their chance to prolong their lives by finding a matching donor. Tragically, nearly 5,000 of these patients each year (or 13 patients each day) die while waiting for a donated heart, liver, kidney, or other organ. 
   In order to narrow the gap between the supply and the increasing demand for donated organs, there must be an effort to encourage willing donors to make their desire to donate clear to the only people able to make the decision, if the occasion should arise--their immediate family members. Although there are up to 15,000 potential donors annually, families' consent to donation is received for less than 6,000 donors. As the demand for transplantation increases due to prolonged life expectancy; increased prevalence of diseases that lead to organ damage and failure including hypertension, alcoholism, and hepatitis C infection, this shortfall will become even more pronounced. Additionally, the need for a more diverse donor pool, including a variety of racial and ethnic minorities, will also continue to grow with the predicted population trends. 
   Many Americans will spend part of the Thanksgiving Day with some of those family members who would be most likely approached to make the important decision of whether or not to donate. Therefore, this would be a good time for families to spend a portion of that day discussing how they might give life to others on a day devoted to giving thanks for their own blessings. Open family discussions on this topic on a day of relaxation and family togetherness will increase awareness of the intentions of those willing to make the courageous and selfless decision to be organ donors, leading to more lifesaving transplants in the future. Designation of November 23, 2000, Thanksgiving Day, as a day for families to Give Thanks, Give Life is an important next step to promoting the dialogue between willing donors and their families, so that family members will know their loved ones' wishes long before the issue arises. 
   We have received the support of many national organ and tissue donation organizations for this resolution including: the American Heart Association, American Kidney Fund, American Liver Foundation, American Lung Association, American Society of Transplant Surgeons, Association of Organ Procurement Organizations, Coalition on Donation, Eye Bank Association of America, National Kidney Foundation, National Minority Organ and Tissue Transplant Education Program (MOTTEP), Transplant Recipients International Organization (TRIO), United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), and the Wendy Marks Foundation for Organ Donor Awareness. The efforts of these groups and others have been critical in increasing donor awareness and education of the public on this extremely important cause. 
   Mr. President, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this worthwhile resolution designating Thanksgiving day of 2000 as a day for families to discuss organ and tissue donation with other family members, a day to ``Give Thanks, Give Life.''

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, before us is S. 625, a bill relating to bankruptcy. It is a bill with which I have some knowledge and experience because last year I was a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and a member of Senator GRASSLEY's subcommittee. We spent a great deal of time preparing this bill for consideration on the floor of the Senate. I enjoyed very much working with Senator GRASSLEY on the bill. He has become not only a trusted colleague but a good friend in the process. We have had our disagreements, but we have tried to resolve them amicably and in the best interest of the legislation. 
   I also salute a number of staff people who have been at this task for a long time: John McMickle, a member of Senator GRASSLEY's staff; Kolan Davis; Jennifer Leach, who now works for Senator TORRICELLI on the Democratic side; Darla Silva, a member of my staff who is with me today on the floor; her predecessor, Victoria Bassetti, now legislative director for Senator JOHN EDWARDS. All of these staff people have put in so many hours that we could not calculate it to consider this significant revision of the bankruptcy law in the United States of America. 
   As this bill comes to the floor, I still have many concerns about it. I think most honest critics would suggest this was not a bill that came from the demands of our mailbag or the American people. I scarcely find any members of the bar living in the State of Illinois who are begging me for a big change in the bankruptcy law. No, this law was inspired and has been pushed for several years by the credit industry. The credit industry was becoming increasingly concerned that more and more people were filing for bankruptcy. As these people filed for bankruptcy and are discharged from their debts, their creditors and credit card companies receive less money. So they came to Congress and said: We want to change the law and make it more difficult for people to file for bankruptcy. 
   In other words, when you are down and out and cannot pay your bills, when your income is such that you cannot meet your obligations, when you have tried everything and you have given up hope and you finally have said, ``We have no choice but to declare bankruptcy and to try to start over,'' this law is going to say, stop, we may not let you do it because there are two different kinds of bankruptcy at issue. One is the so-called chapter 7 bankruptcy, where you walk in and, after a court proceeding and all the evidence is presented, the final act of the court is to clear your debt and to say now you can start over. Of course, you start over with very few assets and with that specter of having filed for bankruptcy over your head. 
   The alternative is something called chapter 13. Chapter 13 says, stop, we won't let you declare bankruptcy, we won't clear off all of your debts, and we are going to make you pay all or part of those debts over a lengthy period of time. 
   Those are two different outcomes. With one, the slate is wiped clean and the other the slate is still filled with many debts that have to be paid off. This bill attempts to define which people belong in which category, which Americans should be 
   so down and out and up against it that they are allowed to have their debts wiped out completely and those who will continue to pay. It is no surprise that the credit industry is determined to keep as many people as possible on the hook and paying off these debts for a lengthy period of time. 
   Now, in some cases this is warranted. In some cases, people file for bankruptcy when they have assets and they have the means by which they can pay off at least a substantial portion of their debt. As this bill addresses that problem, I applaud it. I think they are right. People who are gaming the bankruptcy system to avoid paying their honest debts are, frankly, a burden on all of us as consumers, as those who are debtors as well. Those people should be excluded from the process. Life should be difficult for them, no matter how good their attorney, if  they try to walk away from a debt they can pay. But that represents an extraordinarily small minority of those in bankruptcy court. The vast majority of those who walk through the doors of bankruptcy courts in America are in big trouble; they need help and need it quickly. 
   Unfortunately, this lengthy bill will create a process where some families who are absolutely out of options and have nowhere to turn have to walk through a new process of proof before they will even be considered to be discharged in bankruptcy. 
   Bankruptcy is an interesting concept, not new to the United States. It has been discussed at length throughout history. The history of the relationship between those who borrow and those who loan goes back to ancient times. Throughout history, those who borrow have not always been treated fairly. Under early Roman law, creditors who were unable to collect the debts owed to them were permitted to cut up the debtor's body and divide the pieces, or leave the debtor alive and sell him into slavery. 
   Thank goodness things have improved. In America, the delegates of the Constitutional Convention gave Congress the power to establish uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcy. Only one delegate to America's Constitutional Convention objected--Roger Sherman of Connecticut. It is said he was concerned that they didn't make it clear that if you file for bankruptcy, you would not be subjected to the death penalty. That is how onerous debt and collection was in those days. Mr. Sherman observed that bankruptcy was in some cases punishable by death under the laws of England, and he did not choose to grant a power by which that might be done in the United States. In response, Gouverneur Morris said he would agree to a bankruptcy clause because he saw no danger of abuse of power by the legislature of the Government of the U.S. I hope Gouverneur Morris' trust was not misplaced. 
   I have a statement from a bankruptcy judge in Chicago by the name of Joan Lefkow. Judge Lefkow, when she was inducted to be a part of the bankruptcy judiciary, gave an extraordinary statement about the history of this subject. She talked about Charles Dickens and his Pickwick Papers, of the ``Old Man's Tale About the Queer Client.'' It is a story of a man who is cast into debtors prison by his father-in-law and left by his own father to languish in desperation, while his wife and child starved. Dickens wrote: ``It was no figure of speech to say that debtors rotted in prison.'' 
   In a twist of fate, in this story, the debtor's father, although he had ``the heart to leave his son a beggar,'' put off arranging it until it was too late. Thus, the man was freed from prison and provided a means by which he could exact revenge on the father-in-law who cast him into prison. He hired a lawyer to drive his father-in-law into bankruptcy so he could suffer the same fate as the son-in-law. 
   He directed the lawyer, ``Put every engine of the law in force, every trick that ingenuity can devise and rascality execute; aided by all the craft of its most ingenious practitioners, ruin him! Seize and sell his lands and goods, drive him from house and home, and drag him forth a beggar in his old age to die in a common jail!'' 
   Those were the good old days when a debt led to a big problem when people could end up literally rotting in prison. 
   We decided in the United States to take a different course of action and to establish a bankruptcy procedure so that American families and businesses faced with that awkward and painful and embarrassing moment might have recourse. Our bankruptcy system is part of it. 
   But bankruptcy has become extremely technical and convoluted. During the course of this debate, we talk about cram-downs and reaffirmations and panel trustees and automatic stays, nonchargeable debt, prior debt, secured debt, and even something known as ``supper discharge.'' 
   The bankruptcy code is a delicate balance. When you push in one area to create greater rights, or take rights away, it has an impact on another area. That is because no matter how hard you try at bankruptcy court, there is a very limited pie. All we can do is increase the fighting over that small pie, and usually no one wins that fight. 
   Mr. President, I note that my colleague from Wisconsin is on the floor. I believe he is prepared to offer an amendment. I ask permission of the Chair to yield the floor to my colleague from Wisconsin, and I ask consent that after he has completed his statement, I reclaim my time and continue.

   Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   I fully support the amendment offered by Senator KOHL and Senator SESSIONS. This gets to the heart of it. This would be a real test as to whether or not we are going to close one of the major loopholes in the bankruptcy law, a homestead exemption loophole where a person goes into the bankruptcy court and says: I am broke. I can't pay my debts. 
   The court says: Well, I guess we will have to discharge these debts. You can't pay them. But, of course, you keep your home. 
   Different States define how much value there could be in that home. We have seen in case after case where some have received a lot of publicity and we have people who are holding back homes that are worth hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars under this homestead exemption and keeping that out of court. This is a ruse. It is a fraud. 
   I thank Senator KOHL and Senator SESSIONS for their leadership in introducing this amendment. I hope it passes. 
   Incidentally, this same amendment was defeated in the House of Representatives in the last session. I am not sure if they voted directly on it in this session. But it gives you an indication that some in the House who pound the table for reform in bankruptcy are the last in line when it is going to stop the fattest of cats from protecting themselves from bankruptcy by buying these huge homes and ranches. 
   I hope Senator KOHL is successful. I will be supporting him in every way I can. 
   Let me tell you one of the reasons I am here today to discuss this bankruptcy code. It is because of the increase in filings over the last several year. It is true that more people have gone into bankruptcy court. 
   It is an interesting thing that as our economy improves more people file for bankruptcy. Logic would argue just the opposite. But apparently people get into a frame of mind where they are so optimistic that they get strung out with too much debt. They never think they are going to lose a job. 
   They never think they will face a divorce. They never anticipate the possibility of medical expenses for which they cannot pay.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, as I mentioned earlier, there has been a dramatic increase in filings for bankruptcy over the last several years--30 percent in some years. 
   People ask, How can this be? Of course, I think it is overoptimism. Folks in a good economy don't think anything will go bad; sometimes they do, and people who thought they had the world by the tail end up in bankruptcy court. 
   There is another factor at work here, as well. As Senator TORRICELLI of New Jersey, the Democratic minority spokesman on this committee, noted earlier, everyone who has a mailbox knows what is going on when it comes to credit cards. There is scarcely a day that goes by in my home in Springfield, IL, that there is not another solicitation for another credit card. In fact, some of the solicitations come in the name of my daughter who married years ago and hasn't been at that address for a long time. Some group has captured her name and address and continues to offer her credit cards on a monthly basis. 
   I asked my staff how many of them had been solicited likewise. It turned out everybody has received these solicitations. In fact, one of my staffers sent me a recent offer for a credit card that was sent to my godson. He is about 6 years old. I don't think he is creditworthy yet, but obviously some  companies have taken a hard look at him and are considering whether or not Neil Houlihan needs to have a MasterCard at the age of 6. I hope that isn't an indication of what is happening across America. 
   I think we all know that part of the reason so many people end up in bankruptcy court is because we are flooded with easy credit. Easy credit has a good side and a bad side. Easy credit says to a person who traditionally could not qualify for credit that they now have a chance. I am told historically a waiter or waitress was unlikely to get a credit card because they didn't have a steady and predictable income. Those days have changed, thank goodness. People in those professions and occupations are given that opportunity for credit. 
   The bad side is that it extends credit, easy credit, to people who are already in over their heads. It doesn't parse out those who deserve credit and who can use it responsibly from those who are just going to dig a deeper hole and find themselves in short order facing a bankruptcy court judge. That, I think, is an indication of why so many people are starting, or did start, to use the bankruptcy courts. 
   The latest statistics for filings in bankruptcy have started to trail off. What appeared to be a national growing trend has changed. This year, second quarter filing reports show a drop in 42 States, including double-digit decreases in 14 States. We have to ferret out those people who abuse the bankruptcy system, but not at the expense of those families and businesses that need it. 
   The sad but obvious fact is that the people who declare bankruptcy are poor. The average income of a person who declares bankruptcy is $17,652. In 1981, the average income was $23,254. People in our bankruptcy system are just getting poorer. One would not believe that to be the case listening to the debate, the suggestion that so many people are coming into the bankruptcy court who are loaded with money, who, through crafty attorneys and their own ingenuity, are able to avoid their responsibility. 
   However, statistics tell a different story. By and large, the people showing up in bankruptcy court are poor people, with 
   $17,652 as the average income of a person filing bankruptcy. If memory serves me, average indebtedness is roughly $25,000. These people have more than a year's income in debt before they finally show up in bankruptcy court. 
   As distasteful as bankruptcy is, the fact remains: We need the system. We shouldn't change it radically. By and large, it works. Let me give a few examples of people who are filing. 
   The three major reasons for filing bankruptcy are employment, health care costs, and divorce. Older Americans are less likely to end up in bankruptcy than their younger counterparts. But when they do file, a larger fraction of senior citizens--nearly 40 percent--give medical debt as the major reason for filing. Think about it: A catastrophic illness catching a family by surprise, particularly a senior with limited income and fixed resources, ends up in bankruptcy court because there is no place else to turn. 
   The second category is women raising families. Both men and women are likely to declare bankruptcy following divorce. Collectively, the bankruptcy sample has 300 percent more divorced people than the population in general. Families already stuck with consumer debt cannot divide their income to support two households and survive economically. Divorced women file bankruptcy in greater proportion than divorced men. 
   Before being elected to Congress, I was a practicing attorney in Springfield, IL. I was an attorney in hundreds of divorce cases. Almost without fail, the woman at the end of the divorce case had less money to try to meet the needs of her children and herself. Sometimes they are pushed too far. Many times, they end up in bankruptcy court. 
   Keep in mind as we debate these bills and whether we are going to run people through a means test with all sorts of questions to be answered and, if they miss an answer, thrown out of court, we are talking about older Americans and divorced women who are struggling to keep their family together. 
   Unemployed workers: More than half the debtors who file for bankruptcy report a significant period of unemployment preceding their filings. For single-parent households, a period of unemployment can be devastating. 
   Let me comment on this current bill. I favor the bill we passed last year. I think the Senate favored the bill we passed last year by a vote of 97-1. It is pretty odd in this Chamber to have 97 Senators agree on a bankruptcy bill. I think it was a better bill, better than the bill now before the Senate. I hope we make changes in this bill to bring it closer to last year's bill. 
   The changes should center around three themes: First, ensure fairness to women and children while ensuring that wealthy debtors pay their fair share. This can be accomplished by Senator KOHL's amendment, which Senator SESSIONS has cosponsored, which establishes a cap on the homestead exemption of $100,000 and ensures as well that women are not competing with credit card companies in collecting child support after the bankruptcy is over. This is a critical point that has been raised by Elizabeth Warren of Harvard as well as some 82 different bankruptcy professors across the United States who have written to Members of the Senate and asked them to be very sensitive to the fact that what we do in this law could make life more difficult, if not impossible, for women trying to raise their children after a divorce. 
   Alimony and child support payments oftentimes are a major part of the income on which they live. When we allow credit card companies and finance companies to grab more in bankruptcy and hang on to more after bankruptcy, it lessens the likelihood that the divorced woman trying to raise a child is going to be able to have any pot of money to draw from for help. It is just the bottom line. This is a pie of limited proportions after a bankruptcy. If the credit card companies can stay there, taking the money away from that former husband who filed for bankruptcy, many times it will be at the expense of his children and his former wife. That is a fact. It is a cruel fact. It is one that has not been overcome to date by anything suggested in this bill or on the floor. 
   Merely changing the priorities in the bankruptcy system, making the alimony and child support payments a higher priority, takes care of what happens in court, but after bankruptcy, then we have a problem. The same mother of the children trying to draw money from what is left after bankruptcy and income finds she is competing with credit card companies and others that have been given more rights under this bill to claim more money after the bankruptcy has been initiated. 
   Second, this bill needs to be more cost effective and less expensive for taxpayers. This can be accomplished by providing a safe harbor for means testing for a below-median debtor and streamlining the tests for debtors above the median income to eliminate needless paperwork. 
   A cliche I learned as a kid, as everybody learned, I am sure, over and over again: You can't draw blood from a turnip. In some cases, people in bankruptcy court, no matter how hard we try or how hard we look, are never going to have the money to pay off the debt. It is more sensible for us to step back and say, let's focus on those who are abusing the system rather than adding more paperwork requirements on those who will never be able to pay off their debts. 
   Let me give an illustration from the same law school professors who wrote to every Member of Congress about a recently completed study. Since last year's debate on bankruptcy reform, a study was funded by the independent, nonpartisan American Bankruptcy Institute. They found that less than 4 percent of consumer debtors could repay even 25 percent of their unsecured nonpriority debts, even if they could dedicate every penny of income to a repayment plan for a full 5 years. In short, for about 96 percent of consumer debtors, chapter 7 bankruptcy is an urgent necessity. 
   The fact that most debtors cannot pay more does not mean this means test will not affect them, though. Mr. President, 96 percent of those who file in bankruptcy court cannot pay more, according to the study. They are really up against it. They need to file for bankruptcy. Yet we find in this law the  requirement that they still go through this rigorous standard of means testing and examination to question whether or not they can file for bankruptcy. I hope we will adopt the House standard at least, which says those at median income will be absolved from going through this lengthy test in bankruptcy court. People making median income in this country, filing for bankruptcy, are not likely to be able to pay off many of their debts. 
   Further, we ought to require that those earning up to 150 percent of median income should be subject to a reasonable screening to determine if it is possible they could pay back some of these debts. But to make every single person who walks into that court go through this process is unfair, it is burdensome, and it is not of any benefit to taxpayers or, ultimately, to creditors. 
   In addition, this bill needs to acknowledge the credit industry's role in increasing the number of bankruptcy filings. In order for this bill to be balanced, we have to enact additional disclosures on credit cards to allow debtors to make an informed choice about their credit. I had a lengthy list of disclosures included in last year's bill. Some have survived; some have been changed; some will be offered again on the floor. But is it unreasonable for us to say to these credit card companies that shove these credit cards at us faster than we can put them in our wallets, that they at least have to give us an honest monthly statement which tells us a few basic things? Isn't it reasonable to look at that statement, where it lists ``minimum monthly payment,'' and then say: If you make the minimum monthly payment, it will take X months to pay off the balance, and when you pay off the balance, you will have paid X dollars in interest and X dollars on principal? 
   That is not a tough calculation in the world of computers. The people who send us the bills have all sorts of information they want us to read and absorb. Shouldn't we at least know the bottom line? We may be too deep in debt. Maybe another credit card is not a good idea. That is not an outrageous suggestion 
   where I live. But when we suggested that to the credit industry, they blanched and said: Oh, never can we do that; we cannot make that kind of disclosure. 
   They certainly can. The question is whether they will. That question will be answered by the Senate when it decides whether the consumers deserve more information so they can make informed credit choices. This is not a question of rationing credit. It is a question of informing debtors and informing those who are going to buy the credit cards as to what their obligations are going to be. 
   Let me give one example on a chart which is an illustration of the credit card debt in America charted against bankruptcy cases. I think this chart tells the story about why we have more bankruptcy cases in the United States. If you will notice the blue line here, it represents bankruptcy cases from 1962 to 1995. The red line indicates debt-to-income ratio. 
   Do you want to know why there are more cases being filed in bankruptcy court? People are getting deeper in debt; they have more credit cards. That is what it is all about. When we had the first hearing on the subject, some of the people from the credit industry came in and said:  
   American families just don't think there is a moral stigma attached to bankruptcy any longer. They are filing for bankruptcy without really feeling bad about it.  
   I take exception to that. I am sure there are some who are gaming the system and trying to figure out how to win, but the folks I have run into, filing for bankruptcy was a sad day when they finally had to concede they just hadn't handled things right, or faced a problem they couldn't manage, and had to go to bankruptcy court. It wasn't a proud day for the family. You don't hold a party when you go into bankruptcy court. 
   When it comes to moral stigma, I said to the people in the credit industry: You say folks are taking bankruptcy more lightly these days. Let me ask about the credit cards you are sending college kids and kids who have virtually no income and no credit history, with no questions asked? And what about those ATM machines at the casinos. You are talking about moral stigma. Is your industry sensitive to the mores of America in the way you offer credit and money to people regardless of whether it is a good idea or not? 
   I think there are two sides to the story. I think, unfortunately, this bill only addresses one side of it. According to the Federal Reserve Board, there are 429.2 million Visa and MasterCards in circulation in the United States. The number of cards per cardholder increased in 1998 to a total of 4.2 credit cards per person. 
   In addition to the solicitations we receive in the mail, telephone calls are made. In fact, 1998 was a banner year for solicitations for credit cards. The credit industry sent out 3.45 billion direct mail solicitations during 1998, an increase of 15 percent from the 3 billion in the previous year, and 2.4 billion in 1996. 
   Interestingly enough, there are only 78 million creditworthy households in the United States. Yet, as you can see by the numbers, there were 3.45 billion credit card solicitations. That is why your mailbox is full at home. 
   We even have proof the credit industry is targeting people in bankruptcy. Let me show you this. Talk about moral stigma. This is a solicitation offered by FirstConsumers National Bank 
   in Portland, OR, and Beaverton, OR. To whom do they send this solicitation? People who file for bankruptcy. They want them back in debt. Let's get them back into debt. 
   In case you think it is easy to file for bankruptcy and pick up a credit card, they generously offer you an annual percentage of 20.5 percent, and if you stumble, it goes up to 25 percent interest. So the credit card companies that talk about the morality of the situation are quick to jump on the folks coming out of bankruptcy court and give them a very expensive credit card. That is not much of a fresh start as far as I am concerned. 
   Why is this occurring? We often debate these issues and don't get down to the bottom line. Why is the credit card industry so intent on reducing the number of people in bankruptcy courts who can discharge their debts? Why do they want to keep people paying on the debts? There is money to be made. 
   Between 1980 and 1992, the rate at which banks borrowed money fell from 13.4 percent to 3.5 percent. During the same period, the average credit card interest rate rose from 17.3 percent to 17.8 percent. Notice the spread. It used to be you had credit card interest rates of 17.3 percent when the banks were borrowing money at 13.4 percent. Now the credit card interest rate average goes up to 17.8 percent and the banks are borrowing the money they give to you at 3.5 percent. This is a big winner for these credit card companies. They want to keep people getting credit cards as they walk out of the bankruptcy courts. There is money to be made. It is a profitable business. The aggressive marketing campaign is going to continue as long as there is money to be made. 
   Of course, it is going to mean people are going to get in over their heads. You basically cannot have it both ways. You cannot recklessly offer credit to financially vulnerable people without increasing the number of bankruptcies. The credit industry knows this and so do a lot of conservative magazines. The London-based Economist, in a recent editorial about the reckless marketing of credit cards, wrote:  
   Given its readiness to hand out money with almost no questions asked, the credit card industry's demands that Congress stop the rapid increases in filings for personal bankruptcy ring hollow. 
   No doubt many people have benefited from the credit revolution that gave them an ability to borrow they have been denied in the past. And certainly, borrowers unable to meet their obligations bear some responsibility for their woes. 
   Yet it is pure hypocrisy for credit card firms to complain that personal bankruptcy has lost its traditional stigma. For they have been deliberately directing their sales efforts at people on the edge of financial distress.  
   The rise in bankruptcies tracks consumer debts, and that is a fact. So in these times it is even more important for people to be fully informed about and careful about the credit card debt they rack up. 
   That is why this legislation, which gives the consumer as much information as possible, is more important than ever. 
   I am confident we can approve this bill on a bipartisan basis. I pray we will  not have the same experience as last year. We passed a bankruptcy bill in the Senate by a vote of 97-1. It went to the conference committee, and I was a part of and assigned to that conference committee. We had an introductory session where we smiled at one another, shook hands, and left the room. That was the only meeting of that conference committee. 
   Within a matter of hours, that same conference committee, with only one political party represented--not my own--came back with a bill and said: Take it or leave it. Thank goodness the Senate said leave it. It was a bad bill. If this bill is going to escape a similar fate, it needs to be negotiated in good faith on a bipartisan basis. 
   I am offering an amendment designed to penalize a growing category of high-cost mortgage lenders who lead vulnerable borrowers down a rose garden path to foreclosure and bankruptcy. These lenders prey with shame on low-income elderly and financially unsophisticated people, jeopardizing their lifelong investments and hard work in home ownership. 
   The number of older Americans who are so financially vulnerable that they end up going to bankruptcy court to deal with overwhelming debt is considerable. In 1998, more than 280,000 Americans age 50 or older filed for bankruptcy. The number of Americans age 55 and older filing has grown by more than 120 percent since 1991. Those age 50 and 55 is the fastest growing age group in bankruptcy. 
   Last year, during the Senate Judiciary's Committee debate on bankruptcy, I offered an amendment designed to curtail one terrible practice that plagues senior citizens: predatory high-cost mortgage loans targeted to the low-income elderly and financially unsophisticated. The amendment was part of the bill that passed 97-1. My colleagues may already be aware of the problems that are cropping up in the home mortgage industry. Let me explain. 
   In recent years, there has been an explosion in subprime high-interest loan markets. In the Chicago area, these lenders made 50,000 loans in 1997. This map shows foreclosures on subprime loans in Chicago in a 12-month period of time. 
   In the Chicago area, there were more than 50,000 loans in 1997, 15 times as many as in 1991, when they originated 3,137 loans. Even more dramatic than the increase in subprime loans has been the increase in foreclosures. Subprime lenders foreclosed on 30 loans in the Chicago region in 1993, 2 percent of the foreclosures that year. 
   In June of 1998 to June 1999, the subprime lenders foreclosed on 1,917 loans, 30 percent of the year's total foreclosures. Why is the growth of this industry of concern? Two reasons: First, these companies use reprehensible tactics and predatory lending practices to conduct their business and, second, because of the vulnerable victims--senior citizens and low-income people--whom they target. 
   I will tell a story that demonstrates the problem. In Decatur, GA, a 70-year-old woman named Jeannie McNab, retired, living on Social Security benefits, in November 1996 with the help of a mortgage broker obtained a 15-year mortgage loan from a large national finance company in the amount of $54,300. Her annual percentage rate on this mortgage loan was 12.85 percent, 
   and under the terms of the loan, she would pay $596.49 a month until the year 2011 when she then would be required to make a total final payment of $47,599. Think about it: 15 years from now, when this woman is 85 years old, she will be saddled with a balloon payment that she can never possibly make and face the loss of her home and her financial security, not to mention her dignity and her sense of well-being. 
   She paid a mortgage broker $700 to find and fund this unconscionable loan, a mortgage broker who, to add insult to injury, collected a $1,100 fee from the mortgage lender. 
   Unfortunately, Mrs. McNab is a typical target of high-cost mortgage lenders. She is an elderly person living alone on fixed income, just the type of person who may suddenly encounter a financial obstacle and turn to this type of loan for assistance. 
   According to a former career employee of the subprime mortgage industry who testified anonymously last year before Senator GRASSLEY's Special Committee on Aging--this may sadden you:  
   My perfect customer would be an uneducated woman who is living on a fixed income, hopefully from her deceased husband's pension, and Social Security, who has her house paid off, living off credit cards but having a difficult time keeping up with credit card payments.  
   The perfect target, according to this anonymous witness before Senator GRASSLEY's committee. This industry professional candidly acknowledged that unscrupulous lenders specifically market their loans to elderly widowed women, blue-collar workers, people with limited education, people on fixed income, non-English speaking people, and people who have significant equity in their homes. With lump sum balloon payments and terms that cannot be rationalized, they ensnare these folks and take away the only asset they have left on Earth--their home. 
   When that occurs, these people should not be able to go into court, once that person has defaulted on this mortgage, and recover. They have defrauded the individual who has borrowed the money. They are guilty of predatory loan practices and they should not receive the same treatment as an honest creditor who comes to court looking for compensation. 
   The amendment which I will offer will do several things. When a person such as Jeannie McNab goes to bankruptcy court seeking help from overwhelming financial distress the lenders caused her, the claim of the predatory home lender is not going to be allowed. If a lender has failed to comply with the requirements of the Truth in Lending Act for high-cost second mortgages, the lender will have absolutely no claim against the bankruptcy estate. The unscrupulous high-cost mortgage lender will not recover the fruits of their ill-gotten gain. 
   This amendment has been opposed by a lot of mortgage companies and banks that ought to know better. They are standing in defense of these predatory lenders who are taking advantage of vulnerable people and saying: We cannot treat them any differently; we cannot treat them harshly even if they abuse the system. 
   That is a sad commentary on the credit industry and it is a sad commentary on the mortgage industry that they will not join me and the Members of the Senate in ferreting out those who are exploiting people across America with these second mortgages and subprime mortgages which ultimately are indefensible--absolutely indefensible--as we found time and again. If the 
   credit industry wants to defend those loans, it casts a real question and suspicion and doubt as to their sincerity in dealing with borrowers across America. I hope they will change their point of view and support this amendment. 
   I made some changes in the amendment to accommodate the industry to make it clear we are not going to deal with technical violations to disqualify those who try to collect in bankruptcy court. We are going after the bad guys. 
   I added a materiality requirement so the violations must be a material violation in order for the claim to be invalid. The amendment will apply to situations where a lender engages in the practice of lending based on home equity without regard to the borrower's ability to repay, or a lender makes direct payments to a home improvement contractor instead of to the borrower, or when the lender imposes illegal fees, such as prepayment penalties or increased interest rates at default, or imposes a balloon payment due in less than 5 years. 
   These illegal practices are not technical violations. I ask my colleagues to join me in this effort to protect the elderly by stopping predatory lending practices by adopting this amendment. 
   I send my amendment to the desk.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Egg Safety Act of 1999. This legislation would improve the safety of our nation's egg supply by granting USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) the authority to regulate and inspect shell eggs from farm to retail level, requiring labeling on egg cartons, requiring uniform expiration dating for all shell eggs, and prohibiting repackaging of eggs.  
   Last year, I requested a report from the General Accounting Office (GAO) regarding the safety of our egg supply. On July 1 of this year, that report was released at a hearing before the Government Affairs Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management, on which I serve. According to the report, the GAO found cracks, confusion and contradictions in our nation's efforts to protect consumers against contaminated eggs and egg products. 
   Approximately 67 billion eggs are sold each year in the United States, with each American eating an average of 245 during that time. Eggs are a nutrient-dense food that plays an important part in most Americans' diets, either alone or as an ingredient in other foods. However, eggs, like any other perishable product, need to be handled with care. Perishable products will always have a degree of risk, but this risk is manageable. 
   According to the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC), Salmonella enteriditis (SE), a bacteria commonly associated with raw or undercooked eggs, caused about 300,000 illnesses in 1997, resulting in between 115 and 230 deaths. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the economic costs of food-borne illnesses related to eggs were estimated to be between $225 million and $3 billion in 1996. Between 1985 and 1998, 81.7 percent of SE outbreaks were associated with eggs. 
   In 1998, the Illinois Department of Public Health recorded 405 reported cases and five deaths resulting from SE. Food-borne illness has struck in Illinois several times over the past decade, including a 1990 outbreak of SE from bread pudding with 1,100 reported cases; a 1993 outbreak of SE from pancakes with 22 reported cases; and a 1993 outbreak of SE from bearnaise sauce with 13 reported cases. 
   Make no mistake about it: our country has one of the safest egg supplies in the world. But we have the science and know-how to make it even safer. Eating French toast, Caesar salad, or any other foods that may include raw or undercooked eggs is a manageable risk that can be reduced even further. Make some common sense changes in our federal food safety efforts can protect consumers, families and the credibility of U.S. food products at home and abroad. 
   How would putting all egg safety responsibilities within one agency make eggs safer? According to the GAO report, lack of coordination between the four federal agencies responsible for egg safety has resulted in gaps, inconsistencies and inefficiencies. For example, while one of those agencies, USDA, conducts daily inspections of plants where eggs are broken and made safe by pasteurization, another agency, Food and Drug Administration, rarely inspects egg farms or facilities where unbroken shell eggs are packed unless the agency is trying to trace an outbreak of illness. 
   The absence of or inconsistent egg carton expiration dating laws can mislead consumers. Consumers may believe the expiration date accurately reflects the age of the egg. For example, when comparing carton dates, a consumer may be more likely to select eggs not graded by USDA because a later date on the carton seems to imply that those eggs are fresher. But the eggs with the later date may actually be the older ones. Under the USDA Agricultural marketing Service voluntary egg grading program, expiration dates are set at 30 days from the date the eggs were packed. However, some egg processors that do not participate in the voluntary program set their own expiration date or have no expiration date at all. 
   The Egg Safety Act of 1999 would require uniform expiration dating for all shell eggs. No eggs packed for consumers could be older than 21 days from the date of lay when packed, and they must carry an ``expiration date'' or ``sell by date'' of no more than 30 days from the packing date. 
   Repackaging or re-dating of eggs provides the wrong information to consumers. Both time and temperature safeguards are likely to be compromised in eggs that are repackaged. For example, repackaged eggs are re-washed in hot water which can lead to increased SE risk. Under the USDA Agricultural Marketing Service voluntary egg grading program, which includes 30 percent of shell eggs, repackaging is prohibited for eggs coming back from the retail level but allowed for eggs stored at the packaging plan. Industry has called for a prohibition on egg repackaging. 
   While repackaging may not be a widespread practice, it should be completely prohibited. The Egg Safety Act of 1999 would prohibit eggs returned to the packer from grocery stores or other retail establishments from being repackaged as shell eggs intended for human consumption. These eggs could only be diverted for further processing as pasteurized egg products. 
   The Egg Safety Act of 1999 would also grant FSIS the authority to regulate and inspect shell eggs from farm to retail level for the purpose of ensuring the protection of public health. The standard for inspection frequency would be ``continuous monitoring and verification of performance standards.'' The bill would also require FSIS to implement a ``Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point'' (HACCP) program for egg safety. 
   The Egg Safety Act of 1999 would require labeling on egg cartons to warn consumers of the risk of illness associated with consuming raw or undercooked eggs. This labeling requirement would be in addition to the current ``keep refrigerated'' label which remains a requirement for all eggs. 
   The Egg Safety Act of 1999 is supported by the Center for Science in the Public Interest, Consumers Union and Consumer Federation of America. 
   Consumers should have the information they need and the assurance they deserve when buying eggs. They should be able to count on the fact that what they're putting on the table is as safe as possible. The Egg Safety Act of 1999 is one step toward ensuring that goal. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this important legislation, to give people the assurance that the eggs they buy are safe.

    Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize six students at Georgetown-Ridge Farm High School who captured the Environmental Challenge division title at the Odyssey of the Mind's world competition in Knoxville, Tennessee. These Georgetown-Ridge Farm High School students, under the tutelage of their coach, Jeannine Patterson, beat out 54 teams representing other states and countries to win first place. 
   While this is the third consecutive year in which a Georgetown-Ridge Farm High School team has advanced a team to the world competition, students Ryan Frohock, Lynsey Hart, Manda Paige, Derek Galyen, Chelsey Spurlock, and James Chandler are the first to win the world competition, which consists of a long-term problem and a spontaneous problem. 
   Mr. President, we often heap praise upon athletes who demonstrate a special ability to throw a ball, catch a pass, or run extremely fast. Intellectual accomplishments, such as the one achieved by these six Georgetown-Ridge Farm students, however, are rarely acknowledged. But capturing a world title in a competition that involves both creativity and intellect clearly merits the highest commendation we can bestow upon these students. It is important that this achievement receive its due recognition, and I congratulate the six students at Georgetown-Ridge High School who won the Environmental Challenge world title at the Odyssey of the Mind's world competition, as well as their teachers, parents, and friends, all of whom played a role in their victory in Knoxville, Tennessee.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to commend the chairman and ranking member for their efforts on an issue that is important to workers in Illinois, as well as those in New York and other states. Specifically, I refer to their efforts and leadership in addressing the need to modify tariffs on wool fabrics used in the men's suit industry. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of S. 218 introduced by Senator MOYNIHAN at the beginning of this year, and have worked with both Senators from New York and many other colleagues on both sides of the aisle, on this issue. 
   Because of a loophole in NAFTA, Canadian suitmakers have become our largest source of imported suits at the expense of tens of thousands of American workers who have seen their plants close. I am a supporter of NAFTA--I voted for it and I believe it is good trade policy for our country. However, as part of NAFTA, concessions were made by our U.S. negotiators to allow Canada to bring Canadian manufactured suits in to the United States, duty-free. Canada proceeded by removing its tariffs on imported wool fabrics, setting up a situation where its manufacturers could import the same fine wool fabrics American manufacturers import, manufacture a suit in Canada, and export that suit to the United States, without paying a single tariff. Our U.S. manufacturers are forced to pay over 30 percent in tariffs for this same fine wool fabric. All our manufacturers ask for from us is to provide a level playing field on which they can compete. 
   This has been a difficult issue to resolve because of the various stakeholders involved. However, unless the final trade bill offers some relief for this industry, more Americans will lose their jobs as a result of our own U.S. trade policies. 
   The pending amendment will allow this issue to be resolved in conference, and I commend both our majority and minority committee leaders for their efforts.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, during the course of our debate on the floor of the Senate today, we have considered a myriad of important amendments to a very important trade bill. The attention of Senators on both sides of the aisle was focused on the floor, of course, but it was also focused on our Cloakrooms, the rooms that are a few feet away from me. Again, on television, every time we walked in the Cloakroom, we looked up to see another all-news channel with pictures that were incredible. Of course, the footage today comes from the city of Seattle, WA. Seattle, WA, has become another battlefront in America's endless gun war. Seattle, WA, erupted in violence today. 
   As I stand here now, I don't know if they have been able to apprehend the terrorist who was involved in this. They were searching for him. The latest news suggests that two people are dead and two are critically wounded. I know some eight or nine schools have been locked down with children inside in the surrounding neighborhood, for fear they might become victims of senseless gun violence as well. 
   One of my colleagues in the Senate, PATTY MURRAY, lives in Seattle, WA, just a few blocks away from the scene. She has been on the phone all day calling her son, a grown man who is working at a business nearby, to make certain he was safe. Her plea to her son to take care, I am sure, has been repeated over and over thousands of times by the residents in Seattle who are worried about their loved ones who might be in the path of another gun terrorist. 
   This surreal scene that seems to be unfolding in Seattle as we watch the television screen shows SWAT teams going through the neighborhoods of that lovely city with bulletproof shields, trying to find this gun terrorist, schools locked down, people staying behind closed doors for fear if they walk out in the street, they will literally be killed, as two already have been. 
   This is what happened today in the State of Washington. But America's families should also know what did not happen today in the city of Washington--Washington, DC. What did not happen today was a meeting between House and Senate conferees to finish work on a commonsense gun control bill to try to keep guns out of the hands of those who would misuse them--kids, criminals, people with a history of violent mental illness. 
   The Nation was shocked and the Senate was shocked a few months ago with the Columbine killings--shocked into finally doing something. We passed a bill by one vote, the tie-breaking vote being that of Vice President Al Gore, who came to this floor and voted for the bill which provided, very modestly, that before a person can buy a gun at a gun show, we have the right to know whether they have ever been convicted of a violent crime or whether they have a history of violent mental illness. 
   Is it a radical idea to try to keep guns out of the hands of kids, criminals, and those who are unstable? Most American families don't find that radical. I am glad we passed that bill. We sent it over a few hundred feet away to the House of Representatives so that, in our bicameral Government, they could do their part of the job. 
   Well, in the ensuing time between it leaving the Senate and arriving in the House, the people with the gun lobbies in Washington got very busy. They lined up enough votes to literally stall and kill that bill. So we have the only attempt in this congressional session for sensible gun control being stopped in its tracks by the gun lobby on Capitol Hill. Yet day after frightening day, another city across the United States of America is subjected to senseless gun violence. 
   Today, it was Seattle. Yesterday, it was Honolulu, HI, where a man walked into the company where he once worked and killed seven people with a handgun, 
   a man who had a history of psychological problems. When they finally apprehended him and searched his home, they found some 18 different weapons, semiautomatic weapons, shotguns, and handguns--a small arsenal in the hands of a person who was turned down when he attempted to get a firearm owner's permit in 1994. 
   That was Honolulu yesterday; Seattle today, two more victims. 
   I need not tell you that nothing happened on Capitol Hill yesterday to deal with gun violence, and nothing happened today as this senseless violence unfolds in Seattle. You have to ask yourself whether the men and women elected to the Senate and to the House of Representatives can walk blindly by the television screens and ignore this endless war of gun violence in America that unfolds every day. 
   Have we become so oblivious to the pain that is being visited upon America by the proliferation of guns in the hands of those who shouldn't have them? You would have to draw the conclusion that the gun lobby has blinded this Congress to the reality of gun violence in America. 
   Sadly, what happened in Honolulu yesterday and is happening in Seattle even as we speak is repeated day in and day out across America. We lose 13 children every single day in America, as many children as were killed in Columbine we lose every day in gun violence. 
   Have we become so callous we can't even feel this any longer, that we don't understand what is happening to our country, this great and noble Nation which has allowed itself to disintegrate into areas of violence that, frankly, people around the world can't even understand? How can this Nation that has so much to say for itself stand by and do literally nothing when it comes to this gun violence? 
   This Congress has been at its worst when it comes to responding to this national crisis--at its worst. This Congress has been a captive of the gun lobby, unable and unwilling to promote even the most basic and modest provision in the law to protect families across America. We stand idly by. 
   Some even argue, well, the answer is to give everyone in America a gun. What a solution that would be, the so-called ``concealed carry law.'' So that no matter what restaurant you walk into, what high school basketball game you attend, what mall you stroll through, never knowing if that little argument in the corner is going to erupt into gunfire because people are packing guns right and left. What an answer. That is no answer whatsoever. America's families know it. 
   Let me tell you something else that recently happened. Senator BOXER of California put a provision in an appropriations bill which said as follows: No licensed gun dealer in the United States can sell a gun to a person they know to be intoxicated. They accepted the amendment on the floor. As soon as it got to conference, the gun lobby took it out. Think about that. They would even want us to allow gun dealers to sell guns to intoxicated people. How irresponsible can you be? 
   When I tried to put in an amendment that held gun owners who are licensed legally responsible for the safe storage of their own guns away from children--beaten back by the gun lobby, unacceptable. Many States have put that standard in the law. But in Washington we wouldn't even consider it as we see day after weary day children finding the gun cabinet, reaching in, getting a handgun, killing themselves, or some innocent 
   playmate whose family may not have even known there was a gun in the residence. 
   When we tried to put a provision in the law to say you can't buy more than one gun a month in the United States, unacceptable; one gun a month, unacceptable. 
   This fellow in Honolulu and others build up a personal arsenal and build up their own psychological problems to the point where they break and turn on innocent people. 
   I hope those who serve in Congress understand that we will be held accountable and should be held accountable. But I hope even more that families across America who are afraid of gun violence in their communities and who are fed up with what the gun lobby has done to this Congress will speak out. That is the only way this will change. You have to ask your candidate for Congress, the House Member or Senate: Where do you stand? Where are you going to be when it comes to sensible gun control? Will you stand up for the families of America or will you stand up for the gun lobby and the National Rifle Association? It is a very basic question. If it is not asked and  answered, the sad reality is that what happened today in Seattle and what happened yesterday in Honolulu could happen in anyone's hometown tomorrow. 
   We have been told by the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Henry Hyde, that it is not likely the conference will meet in the next few days on this gun control bill. That is a shame. We may leave this year doing absolutely nothing to make America's streets safer. 
   Frankly, this Congress, again, has put first things last. We have done some good things today; we are proud of them, I am sure. But tonight's news will not herald our accomplishments on the Senate floor. Tonight's news reports another tragedy in America, a tragedy in America which this Senate and this House of Representatives refuses to even acknowledge. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues from the State of Mississippi who are justifiably proud of Walter Payton. His home State of Mississippi can look to Walter Payton with great pride. There is a great deal of sadness in my home State of Illinois, particularly in the city of Chicago, with the passing of Walter Payton at the age of 45. 
   Later today, I will enter into the RECORD a statement of tribute to Mr. Payton, but I did not want to miss this opportunity this morning to mention several things about what Walter Payton meant to Chicago and Illinois. 
   He was more than a Hall of Fame football player. He ran for a record 16,726 yards in a 13-year career, one of those years shortened by a strike, and yet he established a record which probably will be difficult to challenge or surpass at any time in the near future. 
   The one thing that was most amazing about Walter Payton was not the fact he was such a great rusher, with his hand on the football and making moves which no one could understand how he pulled off, but after being tackled and down on the ground, hit as hard as could be, he would reach over and pull up the tackler and help him back on his feet. 
   He was always a sportsman, always a gentleman, always someone you could admire, not just for athletic prowess but for the fact he was a good human being. 
   I had the good fortune this last Fourth of July to meet his wife and son. They are equally fine people. His son, late in his high school career, in his junior year, decided to try out for football. The apple does not fall far from the tree; he became a standout at Saint Viator in the Chicago suburb of Arlington Heights and now is playing at the University of Miami. I am sure he will have a good career of his own. 
   With the passing of a man such as Walter Payton, we have lost a great model in football and in life--the way he conducted himself as one of the most famous football players of all time. 
   The last point I will make is, toward the end of his life when announcing he faced this fatal illness, he made a plea across America to take organ donation seriously. He needed a liver transplant at one point in his recuperation. It could have made a difference. It did not happen. 
   I do not know the medical details as to his passing, but Walter Payton's message in his final months is one we should take to heart as we remember him, not just from those fuzzy clips of his NFL career but because he reminded us, even as he was facing his last great game in life, that each and every one of us has the opportunity to pass the ball to someone who can carry it forward in organ donation, and the Nation's commitment to that cause would be a great tribute to him. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to perhaps the best running back who ever carried a football, Walter Payton, who died yesterday at the age of 45. In Carl Sandburg's City of the Big Shoulders, ``Sweetness,'' as Payton was nicknamed, managed to carry the football hopes of an entire city on his shoulders for 13 magnificent years. 
   From the law firms on LaSalle to the meat packing plants on Fulton, Monday mornings in Chicago were always filled with tales of Payton's exploits on the field from the previous day. We marveled at his ability and reveled in the glory he brought to Chicago and Da Bears. In a life cut short by a rare disease, he blessed Chicago with several lifetimes of charisma, courage, and talent. 
   Who could forget the many times Payton lined up in the red zone and soared above opposing defenders for a Bears touchdown? Or the frequency with which his 5-10, 204-pound frame bowled over 250-pound linebackers en route to another 100-yard-plus rushing game? His relentless pursuit of that extra yard and the passion with which he sought it made his nickname, Sweetness, all the more ironic. It would take the rarest of diseases, barely pronounceable and unfortunately insurmountable, to finally bring Sweetness down. 
   It was that passion that inspired Payton's first position coach, Fred O'Connor, to declare: ``God must have taken a chisel and said, `I'm going to make me a halfback.' '' Coach Ditka called Payton simply ``the greatest football player I've ever seen.'' Payton's eight National Football League (NFL) records, most of which still stand today, merely underscore his peerless performance on the field and his extraordinary life away from it. The man who wore number 34 distinguished himself as the greatest performer in the 80-year history of a team that boasts more Hall of Famers than any other team in League history. 
   He played hurt many times throughout his career, and on one notable occasion, when he should have been hospitalized with a 102 degree fever, he played football. On that day, November 20, 1977, Payton turned in the greatest rushing performance in NFL history, rushing for a league record 275 yards en route to victory against the Minnesota Vikings. 
   Self-assured but never cocky, Sweetness had no interest in indulging the media by uttering the self-aggrandizing sound bites that are all too common among today's athletes. Instead, he would praise the blocking efforts of fullback Matt Suhey or his offensive linemen, all of whom were inextricably linked to the surfeit of records he amassed. He play the game with a rare humility--refusing to call attention to himself--always recognizing the individuals who paved the way for his achievements. 
   He once refused to be interviewed by former Ms. America Phyllis George unless his entire corps of linemen were included. Following his first 1,000 yard rushing season, Payton bought his offensive linemen engraved watches. The engraving, however, made no mention of the 1,390 yards he finished with that year, but instead noted the score of the game in which he reached 1,000 yards, underscoring the essential contributions that his offensive linemen made in enabling him to achieve this feat. 
   And how many times did we see Walter Payton dance down the field, a limp leg, a quick cut, a break-away. He could find daylight in a crowded elevator. And when a tackler finally brought him down, Walter Payton would jump to his feet and reach down to help his tackler up. That's the kind of football player he was. That's the kind of person he was. 
   Payton lightened the atmosphere at Hallas Hall with an often outlandish sense of humor, even during the years when the Bears received boos from the fans and scathing criticism from the press. Rookies in training camp were often greeted by firecrackers in their locker room and unsuspecting teammates often faced a series of pranks when they turned their backs on Payton. Just last week, as Payton was clinging to life, he sent Suhey on a trip to Hall of Famer Mike Singletary's house, but not before he gave Suhey a series of incorrect addresses and directed Suhey to hide a hamburger and a malt in Singletary's garage. 
   While Payton lived an unparalleled life on the football field, he also lived a very full life off the field. He was a brilliant businessman, but never too busy to devote countless hours to charitable deeds, most of which were unsolicited and voluntary. Sweetness shared with us a sense of humanity that will endure as long as his records. I had the good fortune on July 4th to meet his wife and children, who are equally fine people. The apple didn't fall too far from the tree. Jarrett Payton, like his father, decided to try out for football in his Junior Year. Jarrett was a standout at St. Viator High School in Arlington Heights, a Chicago suburb, and he is now playing football at the University of Miami. It looks as if he may have quite a career of his own. 
   In his last year, Walter Payton helped illuminate the plight of individuals who are afflicted with diseases that require organ transplants. Patients with the rare liver disease that Payton contracted, primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), have a 90% chance of surviving more than one year if they receive a liver transplant. Unfortunately, the need for donations greatly exceeds the demand. The longer that patients wait on the organ donation list, the more likely it is that their health will deteriorate. In Payton's case, the risk of deadly complications, which included bile duct cancer, grew too quickly. Payton likely would have had to wait years for his life-saving liver. This was time he did not have before cancer took his life yesterday. A day when everyone who needs a life-saving organ can be treated with one cannot come soon enough. 
   More than 66,000 men, women, and children are currently awaiting the chance to prolong their lives by finding a matching donor. Minorities, who comprise approximately 25% of the population, represent over 40% of this organ transplant waiting list. Because of these alarming statistics, thirteen people die each day while waiting for a donated liver, heart, kidney, or other organ. Half of these deaths are people of color. The untimely death of Payton is a wake-up call for each of us to become organ donors and discuss our intentions with our families so that we do not lose another hero, or a son, a daughter, a mother or a father to a disease that can be overcome with an organ transplant. 
   Mr. President, today is a sad day in Chicago and in our nation. We have lost a father, a husband, a friend, and a role model all at once. While we are overcome with grief, we are also reminded of the blessings that Payton bestowed upon his wife, Corrine, his children, Jarrett and Brittney, and the city of Chicago during his brief time with us. 
   So thanks for the memories, Sweetness. Soldier Field will never be the same.

   Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote against this bill. This is nominally the District of Columbia appropriations bill. But D.C. is such a small part of it. It is a flea on the back of a big rogue elephant. 
   We are happy the District of Columbia appropriations bill has reached a point where it should be passed and signed by the President, and the District of Columbia can go on about the business of managing itself. But, unfortunately, leaders in Congress have decided to take this relatively noncontroversial bill and add to it this behemoth of a Labor-HHS appropriations bill. 
   I am going to vote against this bill. As many others on the Democratic side, it marks probably one of the few times in my career that I have opposed the bill by which we fund the Department of Labor, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Education. But I think those who look closely at this bill will understand there is good reason to vote against it. 
   Mark my word; this bill that may pass today is going to be vetoed before the sun goes down, and we will be back tomorrow to talk about the next version of the Labor-HHS bill. 
   Senator DASCHLE is correct. This is a colossal waste of time. We should be negotiating a bill that can be signed 
   instead of posturing ourselves. But if we are to address a posture, let's look at this bill and the posture it takes on one agency. That agency is the National Institutes of Health. 
   Let me tell you that if for no other reason, every Member of the Senate should vote against this bill because of the decision of the budget ``smooths'' to change the way that we fund the agency that pays for medical research in the United States of America. 
   Look at the way this bill would fund the National Institutes of Health. Historically, the blue lines represent more or less even-line spending throughout the year, month after month, by the National Institutes of Health on medical research, on cancer, on heart disease, on diabetes, and on arthritis. That is the way it should be. It is ordinary business, steady as you go. Researchers know the money will be there and that they are going to be able to use their best skills to find cures for the diseases that afflict Americans and people around the world. But some member of the Budget Committee, or the Appropriations Committee, has said: Let's play a little game here. Let's take 40 percent of all the money for the NIH and give it to them in the last 2 days of the fiscal year. Let them sit for 11 months, 3 weeks, and 5 days without the money, and then dump it on them in the last few days so that 40 percent of the money and 60 percent of the grants will be funded at the tail end. 
   The red line indicates what would happen if this Republican proposal went through. This is irresponsible. If we are going to play games with the budget, let's not do it with the National Institutes of Health. 
   I will concede, as Senator SPECTER said earlier, both he and Senator HARKIN, as well as Congressman PORTER from my State, have done yeomen duty in increasing the money available to the National Institutes of Health over the years. I have always supported that. I will tell you why. 
   Each Member of the Senate can tell a story of someone bringing a child afflicted by a deadly disease into their office and begging them as a Member of the Senate to do everything they can to help the National Institutes of Health. It is heartbreaking to face these families. It is heartbreaking, I am sure, to sit on the subcommittee and consider the scores of people who come in asking for help at the National Institutes of Health. But each of us in our own way gives them our word that we will do everything in our power to help medical research in America so that the mothers and fathers and husbands and wives sitting in hospital waiting rooms around America praying to God that some scientist is going to  come up with a cure will get every helping hand possible from Capitol Hill. This bill breaks that promise. This bill plays politics with the National Institutes of Health. 
   This bill, if for no other reason, should be voted down by the Senate to send a message to this conference and every subsequent conference that if you are going to find a way out of this morass, don't play politics with the National Institutes of Health. 
   A few weeks ago, I had the sad responsibility of working with a family in the closing days of the life of their tiny little boy who had a life-threatening genetic disorder called Pompey's disease. He never made it to a clinical trial because we could never bring together the NIH and the university to do something to try to help him. But I did my best, as I am 
   sure every Member of the Senate would. 
   A mother came to see me last year with a child with epileptic seizures that were occurring sometimes every 2 minutes. Imagine what her life was like and the life of her family. 
   Each and every one of them said to me: Senator, can you do something to help us with medical research? I gave them my word that I would, as each of us does. 
   Let's make sure this bill today draws a line in the sand and says to future conference committees that we hold the National Institutes of Health sacred, and we will not allow political games to be played with their budget. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, we come today to begin the debate on the appropriations bill for the District of Columbia. I am not certain, but I believe, of the 13 appropriations bills considered by the House and Senate, this is probably the smallest bill. Yet if you looked at the controversy that has preceded this debate, it would be a surprise to realize it is a small bill in comparison to other spending bills. 
   I say at the outset, my colleague and my friend, the Senator from Texas, Mrs. HUTCHISON, has been a pleasure to work with. Oh, we disagree on some things, and we have had some pretty hot debates, but I have the highest respect for her ability and her hard work and her willingness to sit down to try to work out our differences. I think it is because of that that we come today with the underlying D.C. appropriations bill--once vetoed by President Clinton--considerably improved over the original version. 
   The Senator from Texas has outlined several elements that we have changed or improved, and I would like to note them as well for the record. 
   I think it is important we follow the lead of the public health experts, who tell us the incidence of HIV and AIDS in the District of Columbia is a national disaster. It is seven times the rate of the rest of the United States. If we do not acknowledge this health care crisis, and respond to it with aggressive and creative programs, we are going to doom generations of D.C. residents and others who come into contact with them. It is that serious. That is why I applaud the Senator from Texas. 
   The needle exchange program no longer receives any Federal funds or any local funds, but if the program is offered by a clinic, in the District of Columbia, they will not be disqualified from other public health programs. That, then, leaves it to the individual clinics to make the decision. It does not ban the program, it merely says there will not be governmental funds used for these purposes. That is not the compromise I was looking for, but I think it is a reasonable one. I support it. 
   On the question of voting rights, it retains the ban on local and Federal funds on the voting rights case. But the D.C. corporation counsel, the city's attorney, is permitted to review and comment on legal briefs and private lawsuits. 
   This is what it is all about. There is a fear on the Republican side of the  aisle that if the District of Columbia ever achieves statehood, it will elect Democrats. So they have historically opposed any efforts toward statehood; and they have tried to stop or slow it down in a variety of ways throughout history. It is a very clear political decision. But I think we have done the best we can and said that the D.C. corporation counsel can at least review and comment on the status of lawsuits moving in that direction with the city council. 
   The cap on city council salaries of 5 percent is not something I would vote for were it not part of a package that I think is important to pass. I do not believe we should try to inject ourselves in the decisions of the D.C. City Council--even bad decisions. This is a questionable decision. The pay raise they are envisioning, I believe, is in the neighborhood of 15 percent, if I am not mistaken--a pretty substantial increase. And the Senator from Texas believes it should be no more than 5 percent. 
   I am not certain I would even weigh in on that debate since it is a local decision. If we are going to weigh in on local decisions, I certainly would like to weigh in on what I consider the absolute foolishness of the D.C. City Council in announcing a tax cut of $57 million at a time when the District of Columbia still lacks the most basic in public services. 
   You can leave this Capitol Building right here, that is well known around the world, and go four or five blocks away, at night, and run the risk of being shot and killed. Of course, that happens 
   in some other cities, including in my State of Illinois. But the fact is, the District of Columbia is not safe for visitors or residents. And to declare a tax cut under these circumstances is absolutely foolish. To ignore the public health needs of the District of Columbia and to say we have so much money in our till that we can give away $57 million in tax cuts is ridiculous. 
   The HIV/AIDS crisis alone would argue that the District should take this public health issue more seriously. There was a program on television the other day, on CNN, which reported the ratio of students to computers in the United States of America: Dead last--and no surprise--the District of Columbia, 1 computer for every 31 kids. That is as good as it gets if you happen to be a child in the District of Columbia. 
   Did the D.C. City Council decide to buy more computers so the kids could learn and become proficient in the use of computers to be able to compete and get good jobs? No; no way. They want to give a tax cut of $100 or $200 a year. 
   Oh, there is applause among some quarters. You can say: I'm a politician. I'm giving away a tax cut. Then you look around and say: Wait a minute. It's not safe to live in my neighborhood. There's an HIV epidemic going on. And the schools are the most disgraceful in the Nation. That is what it comes down to. I think it is a bad decision, but it is a decision they have made. 
   When you come down to other questions, such as attorneys fees and special education, we have made a concession in terms of the amount of money that will be allowed to attorneys representing families of special ed kids. 
   I would like to finish my comments on this bill related to the D.C. Appropriations bill and the Labor-HHS Appropriations bill which is before us, but I see our minority leader has come to the floor. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to yield to the minority leader for such time as he may consume, and then resume my comments on the bill.

   Mr. DURBIN. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I was trying to do my duty as a member of Senator DASCHLE's team. 
   Let me say that having said earlier that Senator HUTCHISON has done such an extraordinary job in trying to find a compromise, I would have to tell you that the District of Columbia deserves better. They deserve better than a process where every Member of the House or the Senate would decide that they might add a rider to a bill to override local decisions by the D.C. City Council. 
   The District of Columbia certainly deserves better than to be in the predicament they are in today, where they have been appended as an afterthought to a huge spending bill, the Labor-HHS and Education bill, and, frankly, have bought a ticket on the Titanic. This bill is going to be vetoed, just as sure as I am standing here. So D.C. is about to see its third incarnation as an appropriations bill even later in the session. 
   I would like to yield, if I might, to the Senator from----

   Mr. DURBIN. I find no problem with that. I would be glad to yield to Senator SPECTER in one moment. 
   Let me just finish on the D.C. bill, if I might, very quickly, and then yield to Senator SPECTER. Then we can come back to our side of the aisle for further comment. 
   Let me tell Senators, for perspective, we are talking about a $429 million Federal appropriations bill for the District. The District of Columbia has its own budget of $6.8 billion. That budget is twisted in knots by Members of the House and Senate who have their own political agenda they want to inject into the appropriation for the District of Columbia. They impose standards and restrictions on the District of Columbia they would never consider even suggesting in their home States. The evidence is obvious. Some of the more controversial issues in which we get involved in the D.C. appropriations bill turn out to be programs these Congressmen and Senators don't even talk about in their home States. I think that really tells the whole story about what has happened with the District of Columbia in its spending bill. 
   I have a number of comments I would like to make about the underlying bill, the Labor-HHS appropriations bill. But in the interest of continuing this debate and acknowledging the presence of the chairman of that Appropriations subcommittee, I yield the floor to Senator HUTCHISON, if she would like to yield to Senator SPECTER.

   Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   Let me join a chorus thanking Senator BYRD and Senator DASCHLE for their leadership. Illinois has a history of being a great coal-producing State. Environmental standards have changed, and I hope we can find ways to develop technology so that this almost infinite energy resource can be tapped that now sits in the ground. Many unemployed coal miners drive over it every day asking policy leaders in Washington what they are doing. The legislation Senator BYRD is proposing is a step in the direction of finding new technology to use this domestic energy resource to create jobs in  America, to be responsible to the environment, and to lessen our dependence on foreign fuel. 
   As always, I salute Senator BYRD for his leadership on this.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, earlier we were discussing the District of Columbia appropriations bill. It is a bill that I have taken an interest in as the ranking Democrat on the subcommittee. One of the smaller spending bills, it has now become one of the largest. You might wonder what has happened. 
   It turns out that the District of Columbia appropriations bill has become a vehicle in the closing hours of this session for a lot of legislative attempts at spending. In fact, the largest nondefense budget to be considered by the Congress each year is for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and related agencies. It is the largest bill. It passed the Senate in one form a few weeks ago. But the bill in its original form never has passed the House of Representatives. In fact, they went the entire session debating about whether or not there would be enough money to fund critical programs for education and health. The House could not muster a majority to pass that bill during its regular session. It had to wait for a conference committee which involved the District of Columbia to finally bring it to the floor just a few hours ago where it passed with a very close vote. It now is headed to the President's desk for his consideration after we vote on Tuesday. It is my guess that the rollcall will be by and large a partisan rollcall, but that the bill will pass the Senate and head down to the White House. 
   It is also fairly certain that bill will be vetoed by the President. In fact, the D.C. appropriations bill, as I mentioned earlier, has bought a ticket on the Titanic. This bill is going to sink, as it should, and let me tell you why it should. 
   I can't understand why we wait until the closing days of the session to address the issue of education. It is the last priority in Federal spending from the congressional perspective. It is the first priority of every American family. 
   We just don't get it. We don't connect with people who time and time again, when asked in opinion polls for the major concern we face as a nation, identify education. 
   Yet in this congressional session it is an afterthought. We have done everything else; now let's look at education. I don't think the American people expect that kind of conduct from Congress. They don't expect Members in the closing hours of any session to finally get around to talking about schools, kids, and education. That is exactly what we have done. 
   This bill, which the President should veto and send back to Congress to work on more, guts the class size reduction initiative, an initiative which allows hiring more than 100,000 teachers nationwide so that first and second grade classrooms have fewer kids. Every teacher and parent knows the wisdom of that decision. Yet the Republican majority resists. They voted for it last year; now they don't want it. 
   They ought to come to Wheaton, IL, and the schools I visited there. This is considered to be a fairly conservative area politically. They are for the President's initiative. They have seen it work. Why this bill wants to kill that initiative, I don't know. They are not listening to teachers or parents when the Republican majority insists on that. The Republican bill funds 3,400 fewer afterschool centers. Almost a million kids in America are denied afterschool programs, a million who would have received it if the President's request had gone through. The kids will be out of school at 3 in the afternoon with little or no adult supervision and nothing constructive to do. The Republican majority says that's fine; that is the way it has to be. I don't think so. I think our vision of America should be broader. We know kids going home to an empty house or hanging around a mall or street corner are not engaging themselves in learning. I think the President's proposal was far better. 
   There are many other areas of concern, including denying title I reading and math teachers. Think about that. At a time when we need more scientists and computer engineers, we are going to eliminate 5,400 title I teachers who would have been included in the President's budget to teach reading and mathematics. Cut reading instruction for 100,000 kids, and they fall behind in their classes. 
   Is this the kind of bill we want to kick off the new century? Does this define our priority in education? I think not. I think it is a bad political decision. I hope the President wastes no time in vetoing it and sending it back to the Republican majority to address. 
   The worst part of the bill, if that isn't bad enough, has to do with medical research. Every administration tries in some way, shape, or form to find something to do legally with the budget which will allow them to get away from some tough decisions. Democrats have done it; the Republicans have done it. What we have done with the National Institutes of Health is tragic. The National Institutes of Health--and I am sure most Americans are familiar with that name--is the agency we assign the responsibility of finding cures for the diseases that plague Americans and people across the world. 
   When one of my former colleagues in the House of Representatives, Bill Natcher of Kentucky, who passed away several years ago, used to bring this bill to the floor, he would say: This is the people's bill, the one that everyone can identify with because we are all interested in schools, education, and safety in the workplace. 
   The people's bill isn't being treated very well when it comes to medical research. I had a chance to look at comments made in the House of Representatives during this debate by my friend and former colleague, Congresswoman NANCY PELOSI of San Francisco, CA. I think she hit the nail on the head when she said our former Speaker, Tip O'Neill, said all politics is local. But in this bill 
   all politics is personal. It is as personal as the woman with breast cancer, the man with prostate cancer, or people with AIDS who look to us for hope. 
   As a Senator, one of the more emotional things I have to go through each year is a visit from different groups interested in the National Institutes of Health funding. They come to me in desperation. They are the mothers and fathers of children with juvenile diabetes; they are the mothers and fathers of autistic children; they are people who are suffering from cancer and heart disease and rare diseases with names that one might never have heard. They say: Senator, do something; make sure the National Institutes of Health have the money they need to look into medical research to save our children's lives and to give them some hope. 
   That is a tough responsibility for anyone to face. Doctors face it every day, but politicians and Senators face it rarely. When we do, it is not a comfortable situation. I always assure them I will do everything I can, I will pass every bill I can to put money in medical research. 
   For the last several years, we have increased the amount of medical research. That is good. My colleague in the House, JOHN PORTER, a Republican from Illinois, has been a leader in that. I salute him for that. I think we should continue on that track. This bill, unfortunately, takes a giant step backwards because this bill, as it is drafted and being sent to the President, says the National Institutes of Health must postpone the awarding of medical research grants until the closing weeks of next year. It means that universities and medical researchers all across America are put on hold. They won't be given the money to research diabetes, cancer, heart disease, AIDS and all the other things we are concerned about. They have to wait. 
   What do their official organizations say about that? The American Council on Education says of this approach in the Republican bill to delay medical research in America:  
   ..... research programs cannot be stopped and started up again without considerable, often irretrievable loss to research progress.  
   The Association of American Medical Colleges says of this Republican idea:  
   The cumulative impact of these effects will slow the overall pace of research.  
   The Coalition for Health Funding says:   
   The net effect would be a significant slowing of biomedical research endeavors.  
   This isn't just a budget gimmick. This isn't a way to save face. This is, frankly, something that should alarm every American family. If there is not someone in your household who is ill, you are blessed, but tomorrow that can change. 
   For those who sit patiently in doctors' waiting rooms, in hospitals, praying for a miracle for help from Washington when it comes to medical research, this bill is no hope at all. This bill takes a step backwards. The President should veto this bill. Basically, it says to the National Institutes of Health, we will give you more money but wait 8 months. Let's let medical research stand on hold for 8 months. Mr. President, 40 percent of their spending, 60 percent of their grants will be delayed until the closing days of the next fiscal year. This is beyond budget gimmickry. This is unfair. It is inhumane. If for no other reason, President Clinton should veto this bill. 
   What it does to the Centers for Disease Control is also awful.

   Mr. DURBIN. That is true. I concede the overall spending is 
   moving up, but they are slicing it back as part of the 1-percent, across-the-board cut. 
   As we learned from the Congressional Budget Office yesterday, if the Republican leadership is to keep their hands out of the Social Security trust fund to accomplish this, 1 percent won't be enough. They will need to cut back 5.8 percent, which means less money for medical research than otherwise would have been there. 
   By failing to make the necessary, tough, hard choices about where to spend money and where not to respond, they have tried to spread this. And by doing so, they have hit areas such as medical research.

   Mr. DURBIN. The Senator is correct. As a member of the Appropriations Committee, he has had the responsibility of putting together a budget. We are supposed to make choices. Some programs are worth investing in and some are not. Instead of making the choice, the Republican leadership says let's take a cut across-the-board on all of these projects and programs. 
   I am not going to stand here and say there is waste, fraud, and abuse when it comes to medical research. We fund at the current time fewer than half of the requests. People come to NIH and say: We have an idea for a cure for diabetes, or something to do with asthma, arthritis. These people are vetted, the professionals look at them, the money is given. 
   This approach is not only going to cut a percentage off the money for medical research, it is going to delay 40 percent of the funds until the closing days of the year. So all the researchers are put on hold, and all the people out in America, worried about these medical conditions for themselves and their families, frankly, are going to be faced with that same delay.

   Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from Nevada is right. Again, let me remind you, this is a budget gimmick. If you delay the spending in an agency until the closing weeks of the year and then when you calculate how much it is going to cost, it won't come out to the same dollar amount. In order to meet some budget guidelines and conform with some regulations and rules, they make this decision to make an across-the-board cut and delay the spending. 
   If somebody came to the floor and said, I have a great idea, let's delay paying Members of Congress until the last few weeks of the year, I think we might have some resistance here. I think some of my colleagues and my wife and I might see that a little differently. When it comes to medical research, we are prepared to do that. How can you say that to the families you have met and I have met who come and expect us to do our very best to encourage medical research? 
   Let me tell you another area. The Centers for Disease Control gets $2.8 billion. What do they do? They try, across the United States, to do things such as reduce the incidence of HIV and AIDS, try to reduce tuberculosis, immunization programs for kids, things that make America healthier. This appropriation the Republicans have brought to us delays until the very end of the fiscal year a third of that money. Slow down your effort to try to stop the spread of AIDS, this appropriation bill says. I think that is irresponsible. 
   If there is any reason for the President to veto this bill, it is in the area of health research and disease prevention. I hope the President vetoes it, sends it back up in a hurry, and says to the Republican leadership: Roll up your sleeves and get serious. If you are going to make cuts in order to achieve some budget goals, don't start with medical research, don't start with children who are suffering from diseases where we might find a cure, don't go to the Centers for Disease Control which has an important mission for all Americans to make this a healthier nation. No, go somewhere else. 
   I have been elected to the Congress, the Senate, now, for 17 years. There are some areas that are really worth a fight. We can talk about roads and bridges. They mean a lot to a lot of people. But when it comes to education and health, I think that is worth a fight. I invite the President's veto as quickly as possible. Send this bill back up here and say to the leadership, on both sides of the Rotunda, that they have a lot more to do. Balancing this budget on the backs of kids who need special tutorial help to learn to deal with reading and math is unconscionable. Balancing this budget on the backs of thousands who receive assistance from the Women, Infants, and Children Program for nutritional assistance, so 
   babies are born healthy, that is unconscionable. 
   For those of us who next year again will face a steady stream of people--from Illinois, in my case, Nevada in the case of Senator REID--who come to our office and beg us, please do something about medical research so my child might live, I want to be able to look them in the eye and say: We did the right thing. We encouraged the President to veto an irresponsible bill, a bill which would have delayed medical research for a lot of people across America who are depending on it for their survival. 
   When it comes down to the closing hours of the session, sometimes things move through quickly and people are anxious to get home. I know I speak for myself and I probably do for many others when I say I am prepared to stay as long as it takes to see that the National Institutes of Health and all their medical research responsibilities do not become part of the political gamesmanship of the end of this session. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, many people who are watching the business of Capitol Hill are curious as to the current state of affairs. We are obviously past our deadline of October 1 for a new fiscal year. We were supposed to have passed all of the appropriations or spending bills by that time. Very few Congresses ever achieve that, and this Congress did not. But most Congresses reach a point in the late days of October where we at least know the end game, we know how it is going to end, and we are merely putting paperwork together. 
   Well, we are not quite there yet. In fact, we are in a situation where there is great doubt about how this session will come to an end, and it is a great irony that we would be questioning how it will end in light of all the circumstances that we face. This is an extraordinarily good time for America in terms of the state of our economy, its growth, the creation of jobs, keeping inflation under control, and giving businesses opportunities to start and expand. All of these things are good signs. In fact, we are generating enough money now in terms of revenues to the Federal Government that we have gone beyond the era of deficits and have now started talking about the era of surpluses. 
   It was a little over 2 years ago that we were fixated in this Chamber on passing a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. There were some Members of the Senate who had literally given up hope that the Senate could meet its own responsibility, and they insisted that a constitutional amendment be passed to give the Federal courts the authority to enforce the law and stop Congress from spending. That is how desperate many of these Members of the Senate were in terms of the deficit situation. 
   Well, things have changed dramatically; 2 1/2 years later we now seem to be at an impasse over a surplus, not over a deficit. That amendment did not pass. It lost by one vote. I voted against it and would do it again. Now we are talking about surpluses and what to do with them. 
   The interesting thing about this debate, though, is we are not focusing on individual appropriations bills but really keep returning to a subject that has been around since 1935, because it was in 1935 that Franklin Roosevelt showed the vision and the political courage to create Social Security. In creating the Social Security system, he really said that we were going to do something dramatic to make sure our parents and grandparents could live in dignity when they reached retirement age. Some people, primarily from the other side of the aisle, called it socialism. They said, no, we aren't going to go along with ``New Deal'' politics creating these massive government programs. This same Republican voice was  heard time and again for decades over the creation of Social Security; that it was a bad idea; it was socialism; it was too much government. 
   Yet the program endured. Thank goodness it did because it changed the lives of Americans for the better and gave us hope that in our senior years, in our years of retirement, we could be independent and live in dignity. Look at what we have today--so many healthy, vibrant seniors leading great lives, knowing they have a safety net called Social Security in which they have invested through all of their work experience. It is not enough to lead a luxurious life by far, but it certainly gives people that safety net, and they are glad they have it. 
   We are debating about what to do with Social Security as we end this session. It is a principal source of retirement income for two-thirds of the elderly. Listen to these statistics: In 1959, 40 years ago, the poverty rate for senior citizens was 35 percent, one out of three. In 1998, it was 10.5 percent, the lowest on record. Last year, Social Security benefits lifted roughly 15 million senior citizens out of poverty. 
   That is what it means. It means people who would not be able to make it can make it, at least barely make it, if they are relying on Social Security. It is more than just a retirement program because one out of five people who receive benefits under Social Security are either disabled, mentally or physically, or they are the survivors of those who paid into the system. 
   We on the Democratic side have for years advocated the protection of Social Security. In that debate I mentioned earlier about a balanced budget amendment, we offered an amendment on our side and said we did not want the budget to be balanced by using the Social Security trust fund. Well, we offered that amendment and only two Republican Senators voted for it. 
   When we tried to protect the Social Security trust fund from being raided as part of that constitutional amendment, only two Republican Senators would join us and we were not successful. 
   Now we have this whole question about whether or not we are currently spending the Social Security trust fund. There have been ads run by political parties saying this fund should be held sacred and it should not be touched. Yet when we look at the record, the Congressional Budget Office tells us, as of a month ago the Republican appropriations bills already use $18 billion of the Social Security surplus. This estimate assumed appropriations bills already enacted or those in accordance with the then-current status in the House of Representatives. Since September 29, the use of the Social Security surplus has grown. 
   I think that is a challenge to some of the advertising being put on television by the other side of the aisle. The facts do not back them up. Republicans have talked about protecting Social Security, but, frankly, they have not. They have used $18 billion of the Social Security trust fund so far. 
   They do not want to talk about a program which a few months ago was their pride and joy, the so-called Republican tax cut; a $792 billion tax cut, the vast bulk of which went to the wealthiest people in this country. That tax cut idea went over like a lead balloon. People across America said: Why in the world do you want to talk about a tax cut when we have a national debt we should be concerned about, when we have the future of Social Security we should be concerned about, when we have Medicare we are concerned about? Why do you want to talk about a tax cut primarily for wealthy people? 
   If you remember the Republicans went out in August and said we are going to take our case to the people. They came back after the August recess and said: We are going to close the books on this case. The people aren't interested. We will talk about it next year. 
   The American people were interested enough to take a look at and reject this Republican tax cut, and it is a good thing they did for the sake of Social Security. Estimates suggest that some $83 billion would have had to come out of the Social Security trust fund to pay for the Republican tax cut package for wealthy people. That was not going to fly. The American people let the Republican leadership know that and they dropped their tax cut plan from their agenda and came back and said instead we are dedicated to protecting Social Security. 
   Let me tell you, the President has the right idea when it comes to the solvency of the Social Security trust fund. He wants to make sure we lock away that trust fund so it cannot be raided and so we can say to future generations: Social Security is not only solvent to the year 2032 or 2034, but beyond. I think he is on the right track. 
   The President's Social Security lockbox ensures another generation can receive benefits from this important program. It locks away interest savings for Social Security. It transfers interest savings to the Social Security trust fund. It extends the solvency of the Social Security system to the year 2050. 
   One other point that bears mentioning, we must address the needs of the future of Medicare. Time and again, the debate on this floor has ignored the Medicare Program. Medicare is the health insurance program for seniors and disabled that, frankly, needs attention at this moment more than any other program. It will be insolvent by the year 2015. Yet precious little is said or done in the debates on Capitol Hill to address the needs of the Medicare system. 
   The Medicare trust fund will go bankrupt in 2015. To make matters worse, the strains in the system will continue to increase as the baby boom generation retires, with the number of Medicare-eligible seniors expected to double to almost 80 million within a few decades. We have proposed, on the Democrat side, to 
   lock away part of our surplus that we see coming in the years ahead to extend the life of Medicare for an additional 12 years. Not only would this extend the solvency of the system and the program, it would eliminate the need for future excessive cuts in medical care. Medicare is the critical other half of the equation that the Republicans continue to ignore. 
   Democrats are determined to make sure that, as Speaker Gingrich once said, Medicare does not ``wither on the vine.'' We want to make sure this system continues and survives. 
   I see my colleague from Massachusetts, Senator KENNEDY, on the floor. I will yield to him in morning business and close by saying, as we come to the end of this congressional session, families across America have the right and responsibility to hold this Congress accountable; to ask us the hard questions. What have we done under our stewardship to make life better in America during the course of this year? 
   Did we pass campaign finance reform to clean up the mess in our campaign election system? I am afraid the answer is no, we did not. It broke down on partisan lines. Even though we had 55 Republican and Democratic Senators who were determined to pass it, 45 Republican Senators opposed it and it died. 
   Did we pass Senator KENNEDY's minimum wage increase so we go from $5.15 an hour to a more livable wage for the 350,000 people in Illinois who get up every morning and go to work for $5.15 an hour? The answer, sadly, is no, we did not pass an increase in the minimum wage. 
   What did we do for the people who are concerned about their managed care, their health insurance, when they want their doctors to make the decisions and not the insurance company bureaucrats; when they don't want to turn over a life-or-death decision to somebody at the end of a telephone line who may have a high school diploma and no knowledge of medicine? Did we do something to stand up for patients? Sadly, the answer is no. The special interests, the insurance industry, prevailed in this Chamber. They killed the good legislation we were trying to pass. Sadly, that means the American people have lost out. 
   What have we done for education, to reduce class size? When I visit a classroom in Wheaton, IL, with 16 kids in the first grade and the teacher says: Senator, this Federal program works. I can give special attention to these kids. If they are falling behind I can help them. If they are gifted, I can give them something extra to do. Keep the class size initiative on track. 
   What have we done? We are in a bitter fight now as to whether we will even continue that program. 
   Sadly, as you look at all the issues, whether it is sensible gun control in light of the violence in schools such as  Columbine, or whether you look at minimum wage or campaign finance reform or the Patients' Bill of Rights, this Congress is going to go home emptyhanded. We have failed the American people. They should hold the leadership in this Congress accountable for coming here, drawing their paychecks, punching the clock for their pensions, and going home without addressing issues that American families care about. 
   So I hope in the closing days of this session we can salvage something for the time we have spent in Washington. I hope as we start the next session, the next round, the Republican leadership will finally listen to the people across America who want us to act in their interests, not for the special interests. Time and time again, families have lost and special interests have won and that is not what this Senate should be about. 
   I yield the floor.

   The Senator has been here through many of these legislative battles. He knows there are forces at work that want to pass a bipartisan Patients' Bill of Rights to help families, and there are forces against. Will the Senator, for the record, tell us how those forces line up?

   Mr. DURBIN. If I might, then, say to the Senator from Massachusetts, the President's program for 100,000 cops has given the money directly to the police departments and the communities to put more cops on the beat. We have seen the crime rate coming down in America, partially because of this. Now we have the same debate about the money going directly to the schools so they can reduce class size. And there is resistance, again, from the Republican side of the aisle. 
   Have we not learned any lesson from the 100,000 cops, that if the money goes directly to the problem, we can get results?

   Mr. DURBIN. I want to make sure those who are following this debate understand what we are talking about. When we use terms such as ``fill the tree,'' which we are talking about, we are basically talking about a gag rule here which says Members of the Senate can't offer amendments. 
   Some critics say: We know what you mean; the old Senate filibuster. You want to go on forever offering amendment after amendment after amendment so you can never get anything done around here. 
   Can the leader on the Democratic side tell us, have we offered to the Republican side to limit the debate on the amendments, to limit the number of amendments, to require they be published in the RECORD so we know the parameters of the debate and so we know it will come to an end at a certain time, we know there will be an up-or-down vote? Has that been part of the bargaining?

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, for the last several hours on the floor of the Senate, we have discussed basically the business of the Senate over the last year. A lot of us focused on Social Security. It is a curious thing that this program, which once was so controversial, has now become so universally lauded and acceptable that both political parties are determined to be portrayed as the guardians of Social Security. 
   Coming from the Democratic side of the aisle, the party of Franklin Roosevelt, I think our party has good claim to the authorship of the original program of Social Security and the fact it has been sustained, now, for some 62 years primarily because of Democratic support. 
   Having said that, though, I will concede over the years what started off as Republican opposition to Social Security has mellowed to some extent, and they now embrace it where once they called it socialism and big government and the New Deal and Franklin Roosevelt run amok. They now have come to a different conclusion since millions of Americans and their families rely on Social Security to live independent and decent lives after their retirement. The debate now seems to focus on, what are we going to do with the excess money collected--for instance, in payroll taxes for Social Security? Should the Government be allowed to borrow that money and the money then be used for some other purpose and paid back to Social Security with interest? Or should the money be held sacred and apart, untouchable? That seems to be where the debate is. 
   The television ads, which have been the source of a lot of debate on the floor, relate to an effort by the Republican Party, soon to be answered by the Democrats, to blame us for somehow spending the Social Security trust fund. 
   It is an interesting claim to make for several reasons. First, we are the minority party. We do not pass bills here; the Republicans pass the spending bills. So to blame us for a spending bill which reaches into the Social Security trust fund just defies arithmetic and common sense. If there has been a bill passed, a spending bill, it has been initiated by the Republican leadership. It has come forward and been sent to the President primarily with Republican votes. For them to suggest one of these bills went over the line and reached into the Social Security trust fund and blame the Democrats for it is really a stretch. 
   But I will tell you what we can point to, and it is not in the area of spending bills. It was a project by the Republican Party just a few months ago initiating an idea of a massive tax cut. The party, the Republican Party, which had bemoaned deficits for years, to the point of calling for a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, now, when they heard of the possibility of a surplus at the Federal level, answered by suggesting we should have a tax cut of some $792 billion given primarily, if not exclusively, to the wealthiest people in America. They thought this was going to be a big winner. It was an echo of Senator Robert Dole's Presidential campaign where, when he could not get traction against President Clinton, he came up with the Dole tax cut.  
   It did not work for Senator Dole then. It certainly did not work for the Republican Party a few months ago. They took this idea back to the States, and people universally said: What are you talking about? Why would you, after years and years of deficits, be giving a $792 billion tax cut primarily to wealthy people? If you are going to do anything, take the money and pay 
   down our national debt which costs us $1 billion a day in interest. If we have a surplus, make sure Social Security is sound and solid for decades to come. Put the money into Medicare, make certain it is there for generations to come, for our parents and grandparents who will need it. 
   In fact, those who analyzed the Republican tax cut said, incidentally, of the $792 billion, at least $83 billion of that has to come out of the Social Security trust fund. 
   So the Republican Party that is pointing its finger at Democrats and saying we are raiding the Social Security trust fund had a tax cut package primarily for the wealthy which dipped its hand into the Social Security trust fund for $83 billion. That is a fact. 
   Now let's take a look at the spending bills, the Republican spending bills, keeping in mind the Republicans control both the House and Senate and Appropriations Committees and have now broken from the tradition of Congress which used to call for bipartisan meetings of the Appropriations Committees. They are very partisan now. I am a member of the Appropriations Committee here in the Senate, and I was in the House. For years, we worked on a bipartisan basis in an effort to try to pass bills. I am sad to say, now, many times we are not even called for meetings. The Republicans author these bills and put them together, bring them to the floor, and basically the Democrats are not part of that process. 
   What do we make of the claim by the Republicans that the Democrats are reaching into the Social Security trust fund? The most recent thing we have to point to is a letter from the Congressional Budget Office. This is one of the two offices we turn to for answers to questions such as: If we initiate a certain program, how much will it cost us? How much will this program cost us each month? Will it add to the deficit or to the surplus? All of the basic questions that need to be answered to be responsible in budgeting. 
   The Congressional Budget Office has today sent a letter--yesterday, I believe--to Congressman John Spratt, the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee. Congressman Spratt, a friend of mine and former colleague, asked the Congressional Budget Office whether or not the spending bills already passed by the Republicans and sent to the President, reached into the Social Security trust fund. The Congressional Budget Office, which enjoys a reputation primarily for being nonpartisan, replied that the Republicans have already spent $17 billion of the Social Security trust fund. 
   They then asked the Congressional Budget Office, in the same letter, What about the proposed 1-percent across-the-board reductions in spending which the Republicans now propose as a way to solve all our problems and go home? It was the conclusion of the Congressional Budget Office that, if the Republicans really wanted to keep their hands off Social Security and not reach in the trust fund, certainly 1 percent across-the-board was not going to do it; they had to find some $17 billion to be made up that they have already reached into the trust fund for. They said it would take another 4.8-percent cut across the board for that to happen, meaning 5.8 percent would have to be cut from all budgets of the Federal Government to avoid touching the Social Security trust fund, just with appropriations bills already enacted by the Republican majority in the House and the Senate--5.8 percent. 
   Then they went on to say--and this is important 
   considering the realities of politics in Washington--if you take off the table the defense budget, saying our national security cannot stand the 5.8-percent cut, military construction --part of the same argument, and veterans programs, which both parties hold dear, everything else will have to be cut 11.8 percent. 
   Here we are, deep into the next fiscal year. We do not have our appropriations in order. In order to balance the books and not touch Social Security, the Republicans would have to cut almost 12 percent across the board in budgets for things such as education; Head Start; Women, Infants and Children; Meals on Wheels--things on which senior citizens rely. 
   What a curious state of affairs that only a few weeks ago Republicans told us we were so awash in money, we could give out a $792 billion tax cut to the wealthiest people in this country and now have come back to tell us we are in such dire straits that they, frankly, have to be cutting education by 10 or 11 percent in order to balance the books. That, to me, shows the basic emptiness of this argument that has been made against the Democrats and so many others. 
   The sad reality is that we come to the end of the session and find ourselves bereft of accomplishment. Having been sent to Washington to respond to the needs of America's families, we have dropped the ball. I have said repeatedly, if you held a gun to the head of any Senator in this body and said I am going to shoot you unless you tell me what you have done to help average American families lead a better life and have more opportunity, I would have to say: Fire away. I can't point to a thing. 
   What did we do on minimum wage? Nothing, absolutely nothing; turning our backs on the millions of people who go to work every day in this country stuck at a minimum wage of $5.15 an hour. The Republicans will not even allow us to debate the issue. The greedy big-business interests that will not give working families a decent living wage have prevailed over those who get up and go to work every single morning--primarily women, many minorities--working at minimum wage, showing they believe in the work ethic, and hoping this body and the House of Representatives will be sensitive to their need for more resources for their families. 
   The Patients' Bill of Rights: How many times have I been across Illinois and met families, sat down with them, and doctors, and nurses? They have told me horror story after horror story of trying to provide quality medical care for people in need only to be turned down by insurance companies; Doctors on telephones debating with insurance company clerks about surgeries and hospital admissions and different medications that the doctor thinks are necessary, and losing the debate every single time. 
   We want to stop these faceless bureaucrats in the insurance companies making life-or-death decisions without any medical training. We want families across this country to be able to sit down across the table from a doctor when someone is seriously ill and be treated in an honest, competent, professional way. 
   We lost that fight on the floor of the Senate. No, let me take that back. We did not lose that fight; America's families lost that fight here. Do you know to whom we lost it? Another special interest group. The health insurance lobby prevailed big time in this bill, and America's families lost big time, and that is another failure of this year we have spent here on Capitol hill. 
   Campaign finance reform: This is truly a bipartisan issue. Senator JOHN MCCAIN, a Republican candidate for President from the State of Arizona, and Senator RUSS FEINGOLD, who sits behind me, a Democrat from the State of Wisconsin, came forward with a bipartisan way to clean up this mess of campaign financing that has everybody across America so cynical about our process. 
   The President supports it. In fact, a majority of Senators support it. Fifty-five voted in favor of it. That is not good enough for the Senate; we need 60 votes. We could not dislodge some 45 Republicans who are bound and determined to keep this miserable system in place. This is another failure of this Congress. 
   Sensible gun control: How many times, walking into the Cloakroom right behind the Senate floor, have I been startled to hear a news flash on CNN that in another high school in America, there is more violence, kids being shot, teachers being shot, the grief of parents, and the visits by the President and the Vice President, news magazines and shows on television just focusing for days and weeks on violence in schools. 
   People across Illinois and across America say: Senator, what are you  doing to make this a safer place to live, to protect our kids? 
   We work up all kinds of speeches in this Chamber, but what do we do? We have one bill, a sensible gun control bill, which says if you want to buy a gun at a gun show, we have a right to ask whether or not you have a criminal record or a history of violent mental illness. That bill passed the Senate with the vote of Vice President GORE breaking a tie. It went over to the House and disappeared. Sensible gun control. Nothing is going to happen this year. The Republican majority in the House and the Senate do not want to act on that issue. 
   I pray to God there is never another school tragedy in America, but if there is, each of us will be held accountable as to whether we did everything we could to keep guns out of the hands of kids and those who would misuse them, criminals and those with serious background problems. 
   This Senate passed a bill, barely; the House Republicans killed it. The National Rifle Association, another special interest group, won and America's families and schoolkids lost again. 
   100,000 teachers: This is a program the President has proposed for one simple reason. He believes, and I agree with him as a parent who has raised three kids, that if you can have fewer kids in a classroom, you have a better chance of paying attention to their needs. 
   I went to Wheaton High School and met with a teacher who had 15 kids in her class. She was part of the President's program. She said: Thank you; I can help the kids who are falling behind and the gifted kids; it really works better when I have a smaller class size. 
   What parent would not agree? I remember how tranquil life was with one child in our house and how hectic it became when the second and third arrived. Imagine a classroom of 20, 30 kids. The President said: Reduce the size of that class and I bet you have more kids who can read, learn basic math, and have a better chance for their education. 
   The Republicans want to kill it. They do not agree. Last year, they voted for it; this year, they want to kill it. This is a partisan battle. The losers are the families across America who expect us to do something in Washington to make 
   education better for our kids and give them a chance. 
   Cops on the Beat Program: I see my friend, Senator LEAHY, from the Judiciary Committee. I am proud to serve with him. He was one of the leaders on the President's program to send 100,000 police to local communities and reduce crime. 
   Do my colleagues know what happened when we sent policemen out to the cities of Chicago, and Cairo, IL, and across America? The crime rate came down. The people who wanted to commit a crime looked around and saw there were a few more cops and squad cars and decided not to do it. Thank goodness. It meant fewer victims and less crime perpetrated on the people in this country. 
   The Republicans fought us tooth and nail. They do not want to continue this program despite its proven success. They have put partisanship ahead of reality. The reality is we all want to be safe in our neighborhoods. We want our kids safe in school. The President has a program that works, and they want to kill it, stop the 100,000 COPS Program. That is so shortsighted. 
   The Medicare prescription drug program: Here is one where seniors across America tell us--Senator DODD from Connecticut, Senator LEAHY, and others--that this is a very real concern, paying that bill every single month for these prescription drugs that Medicare does not cover. The President has a plan to move us forward. The Republicans say: Oh, here comes a brand new program. 
   They have a self-financing mechanism, as they should, to make certain we do not cause any more problems to the fiscal picture in the Medicare program. The fact that we cannot move forward on this Presidential suggestion of a Medicare prescription drug program is going to be a serious problem for seniors across America. 
   So we come to the end of this session with an empty basket, with nothing to show to families across America. Oh, we have drawn our paychecks, we punched our time cards for our pensions, and we are headed home looking forward to the holidays, and we have nothing to show for it. 
   My basic question to the Republican leadership is, Why are you here? Why do you want to be called leaders if you do not want to lead? Why do you ask to serve in the Senate, which was formerly known as the greatest deliberative body in the world, if you do not even want to deliberate these questions? Why are you afraid to debate these questions? If your position is so sound and solid, for goodness' sake, stand up and defend it. Let me argue my best point of view, you do the same, and let's have a rollcall vote up or down, yes or no. Let it be printed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD to be seen by the United States and the world. 
   That is why we are here. That is why we ran for these offices--not for a title but to do something for America's families. We have not done it this year. We have not done anything substantive to help these families lead a better life. 
   We have lost opportunities, and I hope we do not continue to lose opportunities. We have given in to special interests time and time again. We have forgotten the interest of America's families. 
   I sincerely hope Senator DASCHLE, who took this floor earlier, prevails; that he can convince Senator LOTT, the Republican leader, to finally let Senators roll up their sleeves and get down to work. Goodness' sake, in the last 2 weeks, let's do something substantial. Let's have courage to vote on the issues. To stop debate and put a gag rule on Senators so we cannot offer amendments on all the issues I mentioned, frankly, is a travesty. It is a travesty not only on those who serve here, but on the history of this great institution of which I am proud to be a part. I sincerely hope Senator DASCHLE can prevail, and we can have the debate which the American families deserve.

    Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to applaud BP/Amoco for its decision to provide cleaner gasoline to the Chicago Metropolitan Area. BP/Amoco recently announced that it will begin offering lower sulfur premium gasoline immediately and that it intends to provide lower sulfur gasoline in all three grades by 2001--three years ahead of the requirement for lower sulfur gasoline proposed by EPA. 
   The average sulfur content of gasoline sold in Chicago today is approximately 300 ppm. BP/Amoco's decision will reduce the sulfur content in its gasolines to 30 ppm. As a cosponsor of legislation to cap the sulfur content of gasoline--S. 172, the Clean Gasoline Act of 1999--I believe reducing sulfur levels in gasoline is an extremely cost-effective way to improve our nation's air quality. 
   It is estimated that when fully implemented, lower-sulfur gasoline offered by BP/Amoco will reduce nitrogen oxide emissions--one of the precursors to the formation of ozone--by about 3 tons per day. That is the equivalent of removing 70,000 cars from Chicago's highways every day. 
   BP/Amoco's decision to voluntarily reduce the sulfur content of gasoline sold in Chicago means cleaner, healthier air for the residents of the Chicago metropolitan area. It demonstrates again that when we work together we can ensure continued economic growth and protect our environment.

   Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Florida. 
   Yesterday, as I was driving with my wife to the airport in Springfield, IL, to catch the plane, we were listening to National Public Radio and heard that my friend and colleague, Senator John Chafee, had passed away. I turned to my wife and said: This was a really special guy. I am sorry you didn't get to know him. 
   I have only served in the Senate for a little over 2 years. I look over there at his desk, which now has a bouquet of flowers, and realize that just a few days ago we were on the floor together talking about legislation and votes. 
   He was such an extraordinary man. In the 2 1/2 years I have been here, I  came to know him and developed a friendship across the aisle, Democrat to Republican. I really came to respect John Chafee. He has an amazing story. Tom Brokaw has a famous book that is very popular called ``The Greatest Generation,'' about the men and women who served our country in World War II and what special people they were. John Chafee was one of those people. To leave Yale and enlist at the age of 20, to go into the Marines and be part of the invasionary force on Guadalcanal, and then to come back and complete his education but to consider his obligation to his country so paramount he left again to serve in the Korean war under some very difficult circumstances, it shows a special, personal commitment to public service. Many of us, myself included, stand in awe when we consider that. 
   Then, of course, he served as Secretary of the Navy during the Vietnam war, a very controversial period in our history, and was regarded as a fair and honest man in that responsibility. Three times Governor of his State of Rhode Island, four times elected as Senator from a State which has historically elected more Democrats than Republicans, it was quite a tribute to John Chafee that he was elected time and again by his neighbors and friends in the State of Rhode Island. 
   Here on the Senate floor he played an important role. In my mind, he was a constant reminder of what the Senate could be on a good day; that there could be people of like mind on both sides of the aisle coming together to find bipartisan solutions. When I would have a gun control bill I wanted to offer to try to reduce gun violence, I would look across the aisle. I always knew John Chafee would stand up and come to the press conference. We would announce the bill. As we would leave, he would say: I know I am going to hear it again from the National Rifle Association back home but, he said, I just think this is the right thing to do. 
   It wasn't just on issues of gun violence. You could find the same thing when it came to issues to protect the environment. John Chafee always stood out from the pack. He was always a special person, trying to build an alliance, trying to build a coalition. 
   I recall when he came to me and asked me to do him a personal favor. As a junior Member of the Senate who respected him so much, I wasn't going to say no. But he told me he had been chosen by the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations to head up an Atlantic Forum that took place every 2 years, bringing together political leaders from Europe, South America, and North America to talk about the future. He asked me if I would be kind enough to attend that conference in Portugal. 
   I thought about it and realized if it was important to him, it should be important to me. We went to Portugal together. John Chafee presided over about the 150 gathered to talk about some very involved political issues. He did it with such grace and style, such knowledge of the subject. It was one of the more successful conferences I ever attended. When it was over, he announced, shortly thereafter, that he was going to retire from the Senate. He came and asked me, as a favor, would I consider taking over the chairmanship of this forum. 
   It was a great honor that he would even ask me to consider following in his footsteps, after he had written such an envious record as the chairman of the Atlantic Forum. I have agreed to do that. I hope it will continue in his memory. 
   As he tried to bridge the ocean to make sure people in North America and South America and Europe came together to find common ground, he did the same thing day in and day out in the Senate. 
   Just a few months ago we had a contentious debate over gun control. At the last moment, Vice President GORE came in to cast the deciding vote. An important bill left the Chamber, but before that vote was cast, I was talking to John Chafee about this issue on which we held common views. He talked to me about what we could accomplish on the Senate floor and how we shouldn't go too far. He said: A lot of my colleagues over here on the Republican side disagree with me on this issue. I think we ought to stop at this point. I think we have made our point, and we have a good bill. We should proceed. 
   When I came back over to the Democratic side, I said: This is the advice of John Chafee. A lot of Democratic Senators looked and nodded because they knew it was good advice. It was not only good advice from the head; it was advice from the heart. That was the kind of person he was, respected so much for his intelligence but respected even more for his kindness and his compassion. 
   I am honored to serve in the Senate. There are moments in public life when each of us think twice about whether we chose the right career. But there are also moments that are ennobling moments, when you feel as if you were part of a great institution for a great Nation. I always felt working with John Chafee embodied those moments. He spoke to the best of the Senate. 
   He was a good friend, a great colleague, and he was a great American who served his Nation in so many ways. We are going to miss John Chafee, but his memory will endure.

    Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the Women's Business Development Center in their efforts to help female entrepreneurs establish their niche in the corporate world. The WBDC helps train and provide technical assistance to entrepreneurial women. These are the same women who own your neighborhood dry cleaner, run your child care center, and assist with your taxes. 
   Mr. President, I would like to call special attention to the women who have dedicated their time expanding child-care availability in Illinois. The WBDC sponsors the Child Care Business Initiative (CCBI) in cooperation with the Hull House Association that will provide information, resources, and guidance to women seeking entry into this important and growing industry. Over 250 women have utilized CCBI to gain critical business skills and key industry information about child care. 
   The Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs estimates that over 1,000 child care centers would need to be created to meet the projected demand for child care in Illinois alone. In light of the fact that only 20% of the 162,000 children who are in working families receive full-day, licensed child care, the role that the CCBI plays in helping women establish day care centers may have a significant impact on the availability and accessibility of child care in Illinois. 
   Again, I would like to take this time to commend the WBDC for creating and expanding opportunities for ambitious, women entrepreneurs.

   Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair, and I thank the Senator from California for yielding me this time. 
   I am going to vote in favor of the Harkin amendment. The Senator from Iowa has put the question before the Senate, which is very straightforward: Do you support the 1973 decision of the U.S. Supreme Court which said that we will protect a woman's right to choose? 
   The decision of that Court said that the privacy of each of us, as individuals, has to be protected, and particularly the privacy of a woman when she is making a critical decision about her health. 
   I have, over the past day or so, been involved in a debate on this floor about this issue. And I thank all of my colleagues for participating in this debate. 
   On an amendment I offered, there were some 38 votes last night. I wish there were more. Any Senator would. I am proud of those who stood with me and hope we have taken one small step toward finding common ground consensus, while conceding what the Senator from Iowa has made a point in his amendment; that is, first, we will keep abortion procedures safe and legal in America and, second, we will try to find reasonable restrictions within that decision. I believe that is what the debate was about yesterday. 
   The point I make this morning, in the brief time I have, goes to the heart of this issue. This amendment really tests us as to our feelings about the women of America, particularly those who are mothers, and the children of America. I am troubled by those who oppose the Roe v. Wade decision and  say they are doing it because they believe in the women of America. Then we look at their voting records and say, where are they? 
   For example, let's use one very basic issue. We on the Democratic side, with the help of Senator KENNEDY and others, have been fighting hard to increase the minimum wage. Our belief is that people who are going to work every day deserve a decent living wage. The minimum wage has been stuck at $5.15 an hour for too long. Who are the largest recipients of the minimum wage in America? Women, women who go to work, many with children, struggling to survive. If we believe in the dignity of women, we should be voting for an increase in the minimum wage. 
   Not too long ago, the Republican majority in the House suggested cutting back on a tax credit for lower-income working families, the earned-income tax credit. They said: This is the way we will balance the budget. Thank goodness even a Republican candidate for President came out against that idea. 
   It raises a question in my mind: Those who oppose the idea of Roe v. Wade and say they still stand up for the women of America, where are they on these other issues as well? Historically, the same people who are opposed to Roe v. Wade are opposed to increasing the minimum wage and want to cut the tax credit for working families, particularly single-parent families. 
   Let's take a look at the children's side of the equation. Many who oppose abortion procedures say these children should be born. The question is, Once they are born, will you help care for them? The record is not very encouraging. The same people who oppose the abortion procedures oppose an increase in the minimum wage, by and large. The same people who oppose Roe v. Wade are the folks who are leading the charge for cutting the earned-income tax credit, cutting the Head Start Program for the children, cutting education and health care and the basics of life. 
   If this is a question of commitment to life, take a look at this next roll call on the Harkin amendment, which I will support. Line up those Senators on both sides of the aisle and ask: If you say you want more children born in this world, are you willing to stand by and help the families raise them? Too many times, I think we will be sadly disappointed. 
   There was a study that came out a few days ago. It was from a woman at Claremont Graduate University in California who did a survey of all the States that have the strongest anti-abortion laws and found they are many times over more likely to have less assistance for families and children. Those who stand here and say, oppose Roe v. Wade, allow these children to be born, the obvious question of them is, Will you stand, then, for the programs to help these children? Time and time again, they do not. 
   I believe Roe v. Wade has in a way recognized the constitutional reality of privacy in this country. It is said a woman should have the right to choose. In that critical moment when she is making that decision with her doctor, with her husband, with her family, with her conscience, the Government should not be there making the decision for her. 
   Yes, there are restrictions in Roe v. Wade. Some people think they are too much; some, too little. Be that as it may, the basic constitutional principle is sound. Members of the Senate will have, in a very brief moment in time, a critical opportunity to decide whether or not they want to turn back the clock to back-alley abortions, to the days when abortions were not safe and legal in this country. 
   I hope we have a solid, strong majority vote in support of the Harkin amendment.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I consider my service in the Senate representing the people of Illinois to be the highest honor I have ever been given. I continue to believe it is the very best job in American politics. As I go back to my home State and meet with people who have entrusted me with this responsibility, I literally thank them for giving me this opportunity. 
   However, this debate may be one of the most painful aspects of serving in the Congress, and specifically in the Senate, because it raises before the Senate an issue which most Senators would rather not look at again. In the course of 17 years, I have voted on this abortion issue countless times. Each time has been a struggle. 
   I am sure those who are listening to this debate might question what I just said. Don't you get used to it? Isn't it automatic? Don't you just vote the same way you did last time? 
   That has never been the case for me. I have tried in every instance to be honest about the specific debate that was involved. My views on this issue have changed over the years as I have listened to the debate of those with various positions. 
   I have come to a position now that I am at peace with personally. Though I know that I am at peace, the people I represent may see differently. 
   The best I can say in the course of this debate is what I am about to say and what I am about to offer in terms of an amendment which represents my best good-faith effort to deal with a painful issue. This is not like most issues we face in the Senate. I can go home after a week of working most times and people do not have a clue as to what we have even talked about or debated. I can go to family reunions and get-togethers and people do not ask me how did you vote on a certain bill involving grazing rights in the West. It never comes up. 
   But this issue, the issue of abortion, is one that most Americans have an opinion on because we have been confronted, since the Roe v. Wade decision, with a huge national debate, a very divisive debate as to whether the Supreme Court was correct or incorrect in giving a woman in the United States the right to choose whether to have an abortion procedure. 
   There are people dug in on both sides of this debate. What I am saying, I am sure, is no surprise to anyone who observes it. There are some who believe that Roe v. Wade was just plain wrong; that the Supreme Court never should have legalized abortion procedures under any circumstances. There are those on the opposite side of the spectrum who believe that Roe v. Wade did not go far enough with respect to a woman's right to choose and her privacy. I think you will find the majority of Americans in between those two groups; struggling, on one hand, I think, to keep abortion safe and legal but, on the other hand, to put restrictions on it which are common sense. 
   The Senator from Pennsylvania comes before us today with a bill which seeks to address one aspect. He has focused on one particular abortion procedure. It goes by a lot of different names. The common parlance is partial-birth abortion. There are some who say that is just a made-up name for politics; it has nothing to do with medical terminology. But for better or for worse, that is how this debate is characterized, the partial-birth abortion debate, which has been around so many times on this floor and in Congress. 
   It now has a further shorthand, PBA. I do not think that is fair to the Senator offering the amendment, the Senator from Pennsylvania, nor to the gravity of the issue. This is a serious issue. The Senator from Pennsylvania focuses on this procedure which I will tell you, as I view it, is a gruesome procedure. It is gruesome. I don't know if his description of it is accurate, but if it is close to accurate it is gruesome. 
   He believes this procedure should be banned at every stage of pregnancy. Let me address that from two perspectives. First, there has been a lot said on the floor already this morning as to whether or not this kind of procedure is ever medically necessary. I am not a doctor. I cannot reach that conclusion on my own. I have to turn to others for advice. 
   Let me tell you what I did last year, in July. I had just read an article published in the Chicago Tribune in my home State that quoted former Surgeon General Everett Koop. Because of that article and what I read and my respect for him, I sent a letter. My letter was addressed to Dr. Ralph Hale, the executive director of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists here in Washington. 
   I am going to read the letter because I want you to understand I tried my very best to give an open-ended opportunity for this medical doctor in the specialty of obstetrics and gynecology to tell me his professional opinion. Let me read the letter:

   Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania. That is a reasonable question. 
   I would say to him, though, there is clearly, at least, a difference of opinion within the medical community as to medical necessity. 
   Dr. Koop, whom I respect very much and have worked with on a lot of issues, says: Never. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says it is never the only thing you can do, but it may be the most appropriate thing to do for the health of the mother. And then, of course, you go on to say give us some examples. I think that is reasonable. 
   I ask we continue the debate at least to find out what those examples might be. That is reasonable. 
   But you have to say at this moment in time there at least is a difference of opinion, based on the letters introduced by the Senator from California, among medical professionals as to whether this is ever medically necessary or the most appropriate thing. 
   This raises a policy question. When we get to the point where doctors differ about the use of a procedure, is it appropriate, then, for the Senate to decide that we will ban a procedure, a medical procedure? That is what the Santorum amendment does. I think the Senator from Pennsylvania would concede it. 
   He attempts to ban the use of this procedure. Based on this letter I received from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, to do so would say to doctors in some circumstances: You may not use the safest procedure for my wife, my daughter, my sister; Congress has banned that procedure. That is where I struggle with what the Senator from Pennsylvania is attempting to do. 
   I am not the doctor. I will not play one in the Senate. When I rely on doctors' opinions, they are at best divided on the question. 
   Let me address the second issue in relation to the Santorum legislation, and that is why we are doing this again and again. I do not question the sincerity of the Senator from Pennsylvania. I know his feelings on this subject are heartfelt, but I do question why we continue to bring this same legislation time and time again before the Senate, not because it is not important to the Senator from Pennsylvania and others, but, frankly, we have been getting readings from courts across America that this language he is proposing today is, on its face, unconstitutional. 
   We are spending our time in a debate over a bill which 19 States have stricken. These States have all tried to model some type of legislation based on his banning this procedure, and time after time, Federal courts have come forward and said, no, this is unconstitutional. The judges making the decisions are not so-called liberal jurists. You will find within their ranks appointees of President Reagan and President Bush, some very conservative jurists who say on its face this is not constitutional. 
   We took an oath as Members of the Senate to uphold that Constitution. There are times when interpretations can differ as to what that oath means. But in this case, the Santorum legislation before us has consistently been stricken by the courts, I believe, with only one exception, in the United States. Because of that, I have to ask this question, not questioning the Senator's sincerity, but why are we doing this? Why are we engaged in this debate over language which time and time again has been found unconstitutional and enjoined in my home State of Illinois and across the Nation? 
   This is a political exercise. It is not an attempt to pass a bill which will become a law. Forget for a moment the President's veto, if you will, and take a look at the merits of the legislation which time and time again has been found by the courts to violate the Constitution. 
   I would think that at this point in time, the author, whose feelings on this are heartfelt, would have changed his approach, changed his language, tried to address some of the constitutional questions, but it has not happened. We get a rerun every year. This is all about a record vote. This is all about raising this issue for public consciousness and a record vote of the Members of the Senate. 
   Some people want a scorecard. Some people want to use it politically. So be it. That happens around here. It is a shame that it happens on an issue of this gravity and importance because, honestly, I do believe there are things we can and should do which will address what I raised earlier. The feeling of the vast majority of Americans is that abortions should remain safe and legal and that restrictions on abortion should be in place only when necessary. 
   I am going to offer an amendment shortly which addresses my 
   approach to this. As I said earlier, although I am honored to have nine cosponsors, nine other Senators who join me in this amendment--it is a bipartisan amendment--including the two Senators from the State of Maine, both Republican, I do not suggest it is the point of view of anyone other than ourselves. A vote will demonstrate whether I am right or wrong. I hope a majority sees this as a reasonable way to bring this contentious debate to a constitutional and fairminded conclusion. 
   If we do not, I predict we will have another vote next year on the unconstitutional Santorum legislation and perhaps in years in the future. But what will we have achieved? Contentious, painful debate with no resolution other than a political scorecard, and that for me is a troubling outcome. 
   I hope we can find a better way to do it because I believe there is a more sensible way. Let me tell you why I think there is.  
   I am going to offer an amendment which addresses not an abortion procedure but addresses a stage in pregnancy. It is a stage which is known as postviability, that moment in time where the decision is reached that the fetus can sustain survival outside the womb with or without artificial support. That is a moving target. Viability has changed because medicine has changed. Go into any neonatal intensive care unit in America and look at the size of the babies who are surviving. They are smaller than your hand, tiny little babies who are surviving. 
   Viability is a moving target, and it was a standard that was used in the Roe v. Wade decision. They said until that moment in time when that fetus is viable, could survive outside the womb, then there are certain legal rights in this country. But once viability is reached, those rights change, and we start acknowledging the fact that this fetus has now become a potential human being at birth. Roe v. Wade said we will define the laws of America based on viability. 
   The problem with the Santorum legislation, the reason why this bill and versions similar to it have been found unconstitutional time and again, is they refuse to accept this basic premise, the premise of Roe v. Wade, the premise of existing law in this country. They will not acknowledge that you should have a law banning a certain procedure only after viability. Each time it is stricken because it would, in fact, restrict the right to abortion before viability, before the fetus can survive. Court after court after court has stricken down State laws that have followed this Santorum model. Yet here we are again. 
   My amendment, the one which I will offer to the Santorum bill, accepts the Roe v. Wade premise that any changes which we are going to make have to be consistent with Roe v. Wade, and this is what it says: Any late-term abortion--that is, an abortion after viability--is disallowed or prohibited under law. We are talking usually 7th, 8th, 9th month of gestation. Those abortions are prohibited under law except in two specific cases: where continuing the pregnancy threatens the life of the mother or in those cases where continuing the pregnancy poses a risk of grievous physical injury to the mother. That is it. Grievous physical injury. There are those who disagree with me and say it should include emotional injury as well. I have drawn this line at physical injury. 
   Here is why I believe this is a reasonable standard: At this late stage in the pregnancy, the 7th, 8th, or 9th month, I believe Roe v. Wade tells us we have to look at the pregnancy in different terms. We are now postviability. We are now in a position where the fetus can survive. In those circumstances, what I have said is, the only reason legally you could terminate the pregnancy is if continuing it could literally kill the mother or continuing it could subject her to the possibility of grievous physical injury, which is defined in the amendment. 
   I go on. One of the objections customarily made is that if you allow a doctor to certify that a mother's life is at stake or she runs the risk of grievous physical injury if the pregnancy continues, you are playing right into the hands of the people who perform the abortions. 
   I have heard this argument so many times on the other side of the aisle. They argue doctors will say anything, the ones who perform these procedures, because they just want to make the money; they don't care. 
   I take an additional step. I require a second doctor to certify. You will have two doctors in those decisions, two doctors who come forward and say: If this pregnancy continues, this mother could die, or, if this pregnancy continues, this mother could risk grievous physical injury. 
   What risks do these doctors take if they are falsifying this information? Substantial fines and the suspension of their licenses to practice medicine are included in this amendment. It is very serious. 
   When we get to this stage in the pregnancy, I do believe the rules should be a lot stricter. That is why I am offering this as an alternative, one which I believe deals with some very fundamental questions.

<DOCNO>106-durbin-il-7-19991020</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DURBIN. I want to explore this, because I really want to understand what we are driving at here. I gave an example of a baby inside a mother's womb with its brain outside of its skull. This brain was growing in size. It was very clear that the baby was alive through the mother that continued to detect a fetal heart beat, and there is an obvious question as to whether this baby could ever survive. At the moment, they had to make a decision. They knew if they went through certain procedures, the mother could have her uterus rupture because of the size of this abnormal growth of the baby, and they decided to use the procedure that the Senator would ban. 
   Now, conceding everything you have said, does the Senator from Pennsylvania not acknowledge the fact that the baby's life was something that, frankly, was not going to last but a few seconds? As soon as that baby was disconnected from the mother's umbilical cord, the placenta, that baby was not going to survive at that point. The doctor had to say: This baby is not going to live and if I don't use the procedure that you are going to ban here, I can do damage to this woman where she would never have another baby. That is the kind of case. I understand the Senator says it is a living thing, but it is living because of the mother's body and it cannot live on its own.

   Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield so I understand the Senator's point of view? 
   I don't want to put words in his mouth. But what I hear him say is you can find some other abortion procedure in that instance other than the one you are banning. That is fine. The Senator may not personally like abortion at all. But from his point of view, he is saying just as long as you use a different kind of procedure, this bill is OK.

   Mr. DURBIN. Having said that, there are choices where these women use this procedure under extraordinary circumstances. In the cases the Senator was talking about, they were literally dealing with the birth of a fetus which was not going to survive which was so abnormally sized that it caused a danger and the possibility that the mother would never have another child. Why would we want to preclude any medical procedure that might save that mother's life or give her a chance to have another child, if the Senator from Pennsylvania concedes that he is not arguing against all abortion procedures?

   Mr. DURBIN. Let me ask this question, if I might. I ask this question in good faith because I think we should have this dialogue. 
   Step aside from the argument about whether we should have abortion at all, and go to the first two points; that this  procedure is never medically necessary and is especially risky. 
   Before I was elected to Congress, I used to practice law as a trial lawyer in medical malpractice cases. 
   I ask the Senator from Pennsylvania, why would any 
   physician subject themselves to a medical malpractice case if the two points that the Senator made are so obvious; that is, this procedure is never medically necessary, and it is more dangerous than other procedures for the mother? Why in the world would they ever take the risk of a lawsuit by using this procedure unless they believe they could justify that it is medically necessary and that in effect it was the safest procedure for the mother to use?

<TEXT>
   Mr. DURBIN. This type of approach has been stricken, I believe, in 19 different States as unconstitutional. 
   I offered a substitute which related strictly to late-term abortions, those occurring after viability, after a fetus could survive, and said that we would only allow an abortion in an emergency circumstance where the life of the mother was at stake or the situation where continuing the pregnancy ran the risk of grievous physical injury to the mother. 
   I believe, of course, the Court will, if it comes to that, ultimately decide what I have offered, being postviability, is consistent with Roe v. Wade which drew that line. Before that fetus is viable and can survive outside the womb, the woman has certain rights. When the viability occurs, then those rights change, according to Roe v. Wade. 
   To make sure I understand, the Senator from Iowa is offering an amendment that is not antagonistic to my amendment but, rather, wants to put the Senate on record on the most basic question about Roe v. Wade as to whether or not the Senate supports it. 
   My question to the Senator is this: Is the Senator saying in his amendment, in the conclusion of the amendment, Roe v. Wade was an appropriate decision and secures an important constitutional right, and such decision should not be overturned--that is the conclusion of his amendment--is he saying that if we are to keep abortion legal in this country and safe under Roe v. Wade, we vote for his amendment and those who believe abortion should be outlawed or prohibited or illegal would vote against his amendment? Is that the choice?

   A further question to the Senator from Iowa, if he will yield. The Senator is from a neighboring State. There are many parts of Iowa that look similar to my State, particularly in downstate Illinois. On this controversial issue--there are those who have heartfelt strong feelings against abortion, Roe v. Wade; those who have heartfelt strong feelings on the other side in support of a woman's right to choose and Roe v. Wade--I have found the vast majority of people I meet somewhere in between. It is my impression most people in America have concluded abortion should be safe and legal, but it should have some restrictions. I ask the Senator from Iowa, has the Senator from Iowa had that same experience in his State of Iowa?

   Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair. 
   I want to say something to my colleagues who are following this debate in their offices. There are not that many on the floor, but many do watch these debates in their offices. 
   We are coming perilously close to reaching a consensus opinion on one of the most divisive topics that this Congress has ever faced. The Senator from Maine, Ms. COLLINS, and my colleague, Senator SNOWE, on the Republican side of the aisle, and about 10 Members on the Democratic side, finally have said: Let us try to get down to the bottom line and see if we can come out with some commonsense answer to such a divisive issue as late-term abortions. 
   I respect the Senator from Pennsylvania and his heartfelt views on this. I have said it repeatedly on the floor. But I think if we are going to finally be able to say to the American people, we have followed what we think are your feelings; first, keep abortion safe and legal for women across America; but second, restrict abortions so that they are in situations which are necessary, postviability in particular, that is what the Durbin amendment strives to do. And I thank the Senator from Maine for her kind words. 
   Here is what it says, very basically: All late-term abortions, regardless of the type of procedure, are prohibited after the fetus is viable; that is, after the moment when it can survive outside the womb, except for two specific exceptions: One, if continuing the pregnancy threatens the life of the mother, or if continuing the pregnancy means the mother runs the risk of grievous physical injury. 
   We then go on to say--we are serious about this--not only the treating doctor but an independent physician has to certify, in writing, that one of those two conditions are met for any late-term abortion postviability. If the doctor misleads or states something that is not truthful in that certification, he is subject to a civil fine, and with repeated offenses the fine grows and his license to practice medicine can be suspended. 
   The reason I think we should take care--and I hope my colleagues will  look carefully at this amendment--is that we would finally emerge from this tangled debate with something that many of us can agree on. 
   I am characterized as a pro-choice Senator. I am offering an amendment which some pro-choice groups do not support. I would hope that some on the pro-life side would look at this as a reasonable way to restrict late-term abortions. 
   If Senator SANTORUM's amendment passes, and restricts one rare procedure, it will reduce the number of abortions that are involved in that procedure, and they are very small relative to the total number. In all honesty, if my amendment passes, the bipartisan amendment, even more abortions will be restricted after viability. So for those on the pro-life side, it is a situation they should accept, too. 
   I urge my colleagues to seize this opportunity. It has 
   come along so seldom in the time that I have been up here on this contentious issue. I hope they will understand that ours is an attempt to strike a good-faith compromise, consistent with Roe v. Wade, consistent with the Constitution, that protects a woman's health, as well as her life, in medical emergency circumstances. 
   I think if we pass this amendment that I have offered, with the help of so many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, we will finally say to the American people: Yes, we did come together on the issue of late-term abortion, and we think this is a reasonable way to deal with it. 
   I will readily concede there are differences of opinion and those on both sides of the aisle who see it differently. But I think I can go before my voters in Illinois, and my family because we talk about this, and explain to them the case histories that I presented on the Senate floor--where mothers, anxious for the birth of their babies, having painted the nursery and named the baby, found, at the last minute in the pregnancy that some terrible complication had occurred, and the doctor said: If you continue the pregnancy, you could die. And if you don't die, you might lose your chance to ever have another baby. Think about that, what the families face; and the doctors said, in that circumstance: We have to go forward with an abortion procedure. 
   Some of the women involved said: I've been conservative, antiabortion my whole life, and it struck me that it was going to hit me right in the face. I had to deal with it. And they did. 
   Frankly, any of our families faced with that would want to have every available medical option to save the life of the mother or to protect her from grievous physical injury. 
   I urge my colleagues to please look carefully at this amendment. We are perilously close to doing something by way of consensus that is a commonsense answer to a very contentious issue.

    Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of the tremendous economic contributions made by women business owners in Illinois and to recognize the work of the Women's Business Development Center, a woman's business training and technical assistance center that has assisted over 30,000 women in realizing their dreams of business ownership. 
   The newest statistics from the National Foundation for Women's Business Ownership confirm that women entrepreneurs now make up more than 38 percent of all business and continue to be the most dynamic, fastest growing sector of our Nation's economy. I am proud to tell you that there are now 384,700 women-owned businesses in Illinois, employing 1.5 million workers and generating $195 billion in annual sales, a growth of 139 percent in 7 years. 
   Women business owners in Illinois area vibrant sector of our State economy and strong advocates for women's business ownership nationwide. Recently one of Illinois's own, Sheila G. Talton, president and CEO of Unisource Network Services, Inc., headquartered in Chicago, was appointed to serve on the National Women's Business Council. Unisource Network Services provides network interrogation consulting, including voice, data and multimedia consulting. Ms. Talton, who has 20 years of experience in the information systems and telecommunications field, formed the company in 1986 and sales are projected at $17 million this fiscal year. The company services an elite class of Fortune 500 companies, major educational and health care institutions and public agencies. 
   Unisource Network Services exemplifies the type of high-growth business that is attractive to investors in Illinois and around the country. In fact, Ms. Talton financed the growth of her technology company with venture capital investments. Unfortunately her story is usual; I'm told that most women entrepreneurs are having difficulties raising the capital they need to take their technology-based companies to the next level. Though women are starting high-growth business at unprecedented rates, they currently access less than 5 percent of all venture capital investments. 
   Mr. President, the strength of the economy of Illinois and the Nation depends upon the success of enterprises like Unisource. The opportunities to launch and grow businesses and the demand for training and capital have never been greater. In order for these new businesses to flourish, we must ensure that their access to capital and markets is unimpeded and that they have information and resources they need to compete at the speed of the Internet.

   Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair. 
   This debate on campaign finance reform is certainly not a new topic for any Member of this Chamber. I start by saluting my colleague, Senator JOHN MCCAIN of Arizona. He has been my friend since we served together in the House of Representatives many years ago. We have differed from time to time, which is not unusual in politics, but I have the greatest respect and admiration for the leadership he has shown on this and so many important issues, such as tobacco and others, that are near and dear to my heart. I thank him. I know that sometimes it is a lonely task to be a leader on an issue. I respect him very much for what he has done. 
   My colleague, Senator RUSS FEINGOLD, deserves similar accolades, and more, for the leadership role he has taken on this issue. Senator FEINGOLD, in his race for reelection in the State of Wisconsin, demonstrated rare political courage when he said he would live by the standards he preached when it came to campaign finance reform. It is a real test for every one of us in public life to be held to that standard. I am glad the people of the State of Wisconsin not only respected his decision but said they wanted him to continue as their spokesman in the Senate. I am happy to count him as a colleague and a friend. 
   I find this debate to be absolutely critical when it comes to the future of our Nation. I don't think what is at stake in this debate is just a question of money and where it comes from. It is about much more. What is at stake in this debate is the future of this democracy. We expect politicians to be hyperbolic, to say things that sound so sweeping, they can't be true. 
   But in my heart, I really believe what I have said is true. I am honestly, genuinely, and personally concerned, as a Member of the Senate, a former Member of the House of Representatives, and as a person who, for better or worse, has devoted his adult live to public service, about the fact that the people I represent and we represent are losing interest in their Government. The clearest indication of that loss of interest is in their declining participation in elections. 
   Why is it, at this moment in the history of the United States of America, in the closing days of 1999, as we anticipate a new century and a new millennium, as we see the end of the so-called American century, when we swell with pride when hearing our national anthem and seeing our flag and appreciating what this country is all about, when we watch as leaders from around the world in burgeoning democracies come here to the United States to validate their pursuit of democratic ideals--why is it now that the people of the United States of America have decided they are basically not going to be involved in the most critical single decision any citizen can make, which is the decision to vote for the man or woman of their choice for public office? 
   I have tried to analyze this, and I have to say it is interesting that this problem, in my mind, relates to this debate on the floor. This is a debate about political campaigns, money, and voters. 
   I have a bar graph I would like to display which shows in fairly graphic terms what I think this debate is all about. If you look at this, you will notice that, in 1960, in the Presidential election campaign, both candidates spent the relatively meager sum of $175 million. And then, if you will fast forward to the estimated expenditures of the 1996 campaign--a span of 36 years--it went from $175 million to $4 billion. 
   What happened in between to cause this dramatic increase in spending on campaigns? Certainly inflation was part of it, but this is more than inflation. What happened is that candidates--myself included, and virtually every Member of the Senate--decided that to win a vote or entice a voter, they had to spend money in record amounts--on television, on radio, direct mail, bumper stickers, pocket combs. 
   I carry a comb in my pocket given to me by a friend named Craig Lovett who ran for Congress and lost. About the only thing remembered of Craig's campaign is these wonderful combs, which I have carried around for over 20 years. He was a great fellow, and he has passed away. Sometimes that is all that is left of a campaign. We spend money on things such as that, as candidates, in trying to reach the voters, touch the voters, convince them we are worth voting for. If you look at them, you have to ask, as we plow more money into our political system of elections, is it working? The honest answer is that it is not. 
   There is another part of this graph that is worth noting, too. The statistics here indicate voter turnout in Presidential elections. Look at what is happening. When we spent $175 million in 1960, 63.1 percent of the eligible voters turned out. Then we started piling on big time all the money we could find and raise legally in the system. And what happened? There was a steady decline in voter interest and participation to 49.1 percent in 1996. We have lost 14 percent of the eligible electorate as we have plowed massive amounts of money into the system. 
   Some people on the other side of this debate have argued 
   that the weakness in the American political system is not enough money. If we can just jam this blue bar up in the next campaign to $5 billion, $6 billion, and beyond, they will tell you, in their way of thinking, that is how democracy works. I have heard political spokesmen such as George Will talk about money being free speech, and if we had more free speech--that is, more money--then we would be living up to our constitutional ideal, and that is what we should be all about. But the facts don't bear that out. The more money we plow into it, the fewer people turn out to vote. I think that is significant because I think something is happening here that really is worth our observation. 
   Look at what happened on November 5, 1996--or perhaps what didn't happen. I think it represented the single most dangerous and tragic threat to our democracy, the outcome of that election campaign--not the candidates, but from the voters' point of view. One need not look beyond the voter turnout in the last Presidential election to recognize the degree of public disillusionment in America. It is perplexing that this very same election cycle that spawned skyrocketing revenues and outlays in campaign dollars generated only a 49.08-percent turnout at the polls. 
   The 1996 Presidential campaign had the lowest national average turnout for a Presidential election in 72 years. The money was there; the voters weren't. If one accounts for the flood of new voters in 1924 with the passage of women's suffrage, it may have been the lowest percentage turnout of eligible voters to vote for President since mass popular balloting was introduced in America in the 1830s, in the 160-year history of the United States. And by 1996, the voters of the United States said: None of the above; we don't care; a majority will stay home. 
   The average voter participation rate in Presidential elections between 1948 and 1968 was 60.4 percent. This dropped to a 53.2-percent average turnout from 1972 to 1992. Campaigns are too long,  too expensive, too negative, and a majority of self-respecting people have said: We don't want to sully our hands by even voting. And they vote with their feet; they stay home. 
   The decline in the exercise of the basic right of citizenship is a grave concern. More than 100 million Americans of voting age don't participate. I don't think this is an accident. Despite the fact that we tend to register more voters--an increase of some 8 million eligible voters, resulting in 4 million being registered--fewer Americans cast their ballots in the most recent election, the 1998 mid-term, than in 1994's similar election, plunging voter turnout to the lowest level in over 50 years. 
   I think the message here is clear. Americans have watched this electoral process, and an estimated 119 million of them have decided to avoid the ballot box like a root canal. That is the largest number in American history. If you look at the United States in terms of other countries around the world and all the things we point to with pride in this country, we cannot point to voter participation with pride. 
   According to data compiled by IDEA, the United States ranked 114 out of 140 countries the voter turnout of which has been assessed since 1945. Despite all the money, we don't see the participation we have come to expect. 
   The life of a Senator is a wonderful life in many respects. 
   I am so honored to represent a great State such as Illinois and to be able to stand in this Chamber and use my best judgment on my votes to try to help them. But the path to the Senate, for someone who is not independently wealthy, is a path that takes you to many small offices, many desks, many telephones, and many telephone calls to perfect strangers, begging for money. 
   When I was a Member of the House of Representatives running for the Senate, I used to take off during the course of a day, drive about a block away to a little cubicle I had rented, where I could sit and legally make fundraising calls. I would take every available minute to do it. When I received my beeper notification, I would race back to the floor of the House of Representatives to cast a vote and then back to make more phone calls and raise more money. Of course, it is going to have an impact on your private life, and it had an impact on my public life, too. I can remember, to this minute, the day I left to race over and make a vote on the floor of the House. As I cast my vote, I looked up and thought of the list of potential contributors I was now about to call. But there were two or three of them I could not call. I just voted against them. You know, when that becomes part of the calculation, it takes something away from your judgment. 
   I don't point the finger of blame to any of my colleagues in this Chamber. I think they are, by and large, to my knowledge, some of the most honorable people I have come to know in life, and they are really conscientious in the job they do. But the system as it is currently constructed is a system that, frankly, is going to lead all of us to make conclusions and make decisions which may not be the right ones. 
   The argument on the other side against Senator MCCAIN and Senator FEINGOLD is the suggestion that more money into this system is going to make it better. This is not a new argument. We have seen it in several other iterations. 
   I can recall the debate over guns in America. The National Rifle Association is for a concealed carry law. What does it mean? It means all of us would be able to carry a gun around in our pockets or, for women, in their purses, taking them into shopping malls, restaurants, churches, and high school basketball games. It is their belief that this proliferation of guns in America will make us safer. 
   Yesterday, we had a vote on a nuclear test ban treaty. Many of us believe that we have all the nuclear weapons in the world we will ever need and that we should have passed that treaty to reduce the number of nuclear weapons in those countries that possess them. The treaty was defeated. Those who wanted fewer nuclear weapons lost. Those who believe we shouldn't have a limit on testing and, therefore, the development of nuclear weapons around the world prevailed. They believe, obviously, that more nuclear weapons around the world make us safer. I don't share that belief. 
   But a similar argument is at hand. There are those who argue that more money going into the political system will 
   somehow result in better men and women being elected to Congress and to other offices. I don't believe that is the case. 
   In 1996, the Republicans raised $548 million; the Democrats raised $332 million. The Republicans outraised us 65 percent more than we did in 1996. In 1992, both parties had only raised $507 million. So you can see the numbers going up dramatically. 
   Part of the resistance to campaign finance reform reflects the reality that the incumbent Republican leadership in the House of Representatives and in the Senate does not want to put an end to a good thing. I can understand that. It makes sense to me as a political person that some might take that position, with notable exceptions such as Congressman SHAYS from Connecticut, the Republican who supports campaign finance reform, and others on the Republican side. 
   Centuries ago, Machiavelli wrote his famous book, ``The Prince,'' and outlined some ideas and principles of politics. I have always said that if he did not have a chapter in his book on the subject, he should, and it should be entitled ``If you have the power, for God's sake, don't give it away.'' The power now is in the money. And many on the Republican side of the aisle who are capable of raising more money than we do on the Democratic side of the aisle do not want to surrender that advantage. 
   It is similar to handing a weapon to your enemy, as they see it. That is an understandable conclusion by some. But thank goodness for Senator MCCAIN and others who have risen above it and said it is an empty victory to continue the status quo, the current system of campaign fundraising, if in fact we are losing credibility and losing the respect of the American people. What good does it do for us to be elected and supposedly lead this country when the American people do not give us the respect for the office or the job we do? It has a lot to do with the campaign finance system. 
   This bill in its particulars addresses many issues, and one of them primarily in the focus of this debate is on the question of soft money. In 1996, the Republican national party committees tallied soft money receipts of $141 million; in 1998, an off year, $131.6 million. That was the dramatic increase over the prior off-year election. The Democratic side raised $122 million in soft money in 1996 and, in 1998, $92.8 million. That was a 89-percent increase over the summer election cycle just a few years before. 
   Much time and energy has been spent in the aftermath of the 1996 Federal election cycle, launching accusations about questionable practices that occurred. I sat through Senator THOMPSON's hearings investigating the Presidential campaign for a year. There were certainly irregularities and embarrassments involved in that campaign. I am certain as I stand here that similar irregularities and embarrassments happen on both sides--Democrat and Republican. 
   You cannot deal with these massive sums of money from people whom you don't know as well as you might a member of your family and not run into embarrassing circumstances. I have. There have been times when I have received checks in my campaign and have taken a hard look at them and said, ``Send them back.'' It just raises too big a question as to whether my values and principles are being compromised. Think about a national party raising millions of dollars under similar circumstances and wondering if any single check is tainted or raises questions about your honesty. 
   What we learned from investigating the Presidential campaigns is that some of the most reprehensible and unseemly tactics are perfectly legal under the law today. Several loopholes in the law allow funds to be raised and spent in ways that do not violate the letter, although they might violate the spirit, of the law. Chief among them is soft money donations. 
   It is an arcane world for the average American to try to figure out the difference between hard money and soft money, caps on spending, and the like. I can tell you, there are certain things that can basically differentiate them.  Hard money is limited as to how much you can raise with each individual. You are limited as to the sources and individuals as well as PACs. You are limited in how much they can give, and everything is disclosed. 
   Hard money is a reform that really tried to clean up the system by saying, if we limit those who can give while staying away from corporations, for example, and we limit how much people can give, and then we have full disclosure, we will have a more honest system. I think the premise was sound. 
   Soft money violates basically all these rules. Soft money doesn't live by these limitations. The sources, the amounts, and the disclosures in many cases just aren't there. 
   That is what this debate is about. Senators MCCAIN and FEINGOLD have said put an end to this soft money and the problems it creates for our electoral system. 
   There are several items and issues that will come up, I am sure, later in the debate. I am going to hold back from going into some of them. One of them has to do with issue ads. I am looking forward to that because I think my greatest fear is that if we ban soft money, we will create vehicles for more and more independent so-called ``independent organizations'' to appear and become part of this process. 
   Let me close by saying this: I have supported the McCain-Feingold bill as originally written. It embodied a number of reforms that I think are essential to restore confidence in this electoral process. I have been disappointed by some sponsors. I understand their political realities. But I have been disappointed in the fact that we have over time lost some of the major reform provisions in the bill and we are now focusing on just one--the abolition of soft money. There are many other parts of that bill which deserve to be enacted into law if we are going to have real reform. 
   I will close on this note. I hope this Congress--particularly this Senate--can muster the political courage to vote for this reform. I hope that will happen. I am skeptical as to whether that will be the outcome. 
   We have seen demonstrated in American political history time and time again that it takes a major overwhelming scandal for this Congress to act to enact real reform. The Watergate scandal is one example, and others have shown up in our history. We are not dealing with such a scandal today in specifics, but we are dealing with a scandalous system, a system which really troubles me the most, that so many Americans have given up on us. We can't allow that to happen. We can't afford it. 
   For those who argue that we have to allow the very wealthiest in America to be articulate in our political process by writing checks for thousands--$10,000, $20,000, $50,000, or $100,000--I think on its face is laughable. To think we would give up on working people, average families, and businesses making modest amounts and disclosing contributions and instead turn this process over to the wealthiest in America is to give up on the very basis of this democracy. It will continue to push away from the average American that interest they should have in this most fundamental system of representative democracy. 
   I rise in support of McCain-Feingold. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by my Illinois colleague, Senator FITZGERALD, in introducing legislation that would authorize an important Department of the Interior project--the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library in Springfield, Illinois. 
   I should begin by confessing a Lincoln bias. Obviously, I'm an Illinoisan, but I hail from the same city, Springfield, that Abraham Lincoln once called home. I practiced law in an office not far from the historic Lincoln-Herndon Law Office. I also represented a district in the U.S. House of Representatives that included portions of the district Congressman Abraham Lincoln represented in the 30th Congress--1847 to 1849. My home state, the ``Land of Lincoln,'' holds the former President in very high regard. 
   Abraham Lincoln is considered to be one of our nation's greatest Presidents. Yet, his works and the story of his life and public service are spread over numerous historic sites, monuments, museums, and private collections of Lincoln memorabilia. The State of Illinois has a more than 42,000-item Lincoln Collection which contains national treasures such as the Gettysburg Address, the Emancipation Proclamation, and Lincoln's Second Inaugural Address. The Collection is part of the State's 12-million-item historical library, which is the nation's only public institution engaged in ongoing research on the life and legacy of Abraham Lincoln. 
   Currently, 13 former Presidents, including Confederate leader Jefferson Davis, have presidential libraries. Our 16th President certainly deserves such a facility so children and people from around the world can learn from the excellent examples Lincoln set during his life and his Presidency and historians can continue to discover more about the man who preserved the Union. 
   The Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library would serve as a state-of-the-art, interactive library, museum, and interpretative center where visitors could learn about Abraham Lincoln and the events and places that shaped his life and the history of our country. It would also serve as an academic archive and research facility for scholars to study Illinois' collection of Lincoln documents and personal effects. 
   The legislation we are introducing today would require that for every dollar of federal funds directed toward this project, two dollars must come for other non-federal sources. The State of Illinois and the City of Springfield have already pledged significant financial support for the Library. Also, it is important to note that the U.S. Department of the Interior is not being asked to operate or maintain the facility. The State of Illinois, through the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency, would run the day-to-day operations and handle upkeep of the Library. 
   Mr. President, the Illinois Congressional Delegation, Illinois Governor George Ryan, and the City of Springfield strongly support this important project and this authorizing legislation. I urge my colleagues to join me and Senator FITZGERALD in constructing a lasting legacy for Abraham Lincoln.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, there are several issues that have been debated on the floor this morning, and it is typical of the Senate, which considers myriad issues, to consider some that are quite contrasting. To move from nuclear proliferation to help for soybean growers is about as much a contrast as you could ask for. But it reflects the workload that we face in the Senate, and it reflects the diversity of issues with which we have to deal. 
   I will speak very briefly to the issue of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty. This nuclear test ban treaty, which may be considered for a vote this afternoon, could be one of the most significant votes ever cast by many Members of the Senate. It appears the vote will be overwhelmingly in favor of the treaty on the Democratic side of the aisle, with a handful of Republican Senators joining us--not enough to enact this treaty into law and to ratify it so that it becomes virtually a law governing the United States. If that occurs, if we defeat this treaty this afternoon--as it appears we are headed to do--it could be one of the single most irresponsible acts ever by the Senate. 
   Let me give specifics. It was only a few hours ago, in Pakistan, that a military coup took place and replaced the administration of Mr. Sharif. Mr. Sharif had been elected. He was a man with whom we had dealt. He was a person who at least came out of the democratic process. But he was toppled. We have not had that experience in the United States, and I pray we never will. But the military leaders decided they had had enough of Mr. Sharif. They weren't going to wait for an election. They decided to take over. It appears from the press reports that the source of their anger was the fact that Mr. Sharif had not aggressively pursued the war against India, nor had he escalated the nuclear testing that took place just a few months ago.  
   You may remember, on the Fourth of July, the President of the United States of America stayed in the White House for a special meeting--a rare meeting on a very important national holiday with Mr. Sharif of Pakistan, where he laid down the rule to him that we didn't want to see the Pakistani army engaged in the militia tactics against the Indians in an escalated fight over their territory in Kashmir. He produced, I am told, satellite imagery that verified that the Pakistanis were involved, and he told Mr. Sharif to stop right then and there. If this escalated, two nascent nuclear powers could see this develop into a conflagration that could consume greater parts of Asia. The President was persuasive. Sharif went home and the tension seemed to decline--until yesterday when the military took over. 
   Why does that have any significance with our vote on a nuclear test ban treaty? How on God's Earth can the United States of America argue to India and Pakistan to stop this madness of testing nuclear weapons and escalating the struggle when we reject a treaty that would end nuclear testing once and for all? It is really talking out of both sides of your mouth. 
   This nuclear test ban treaty had been supported originally by Presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy, Democratic and Republican Presidents, over the years. It was President George Bush who unilaterally said we will stop nuclear testing in the United 
   States. He did not believe that it compromised our national defense, and he certainly was a Republican. 
   If you listen to the arguments of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, you would think this is just a cut and dried partisan issue, with Republicans on one side and Democrats on the other. The polling tells us that 82 percent of the American people want us to pass this test ban treaty. They understand full well that if more and more nations around the world acquire nuclear weapons, it doesn't make the United States any safer; it makes the world more dangerous. Leaders in some of these countries, who should not be entrusted with a cap gun, will end up with a nuclear weapon, and we will have to worry whether they have the delivery capability. 
   Why is a nuclear test an important part of it? You can't take this nuclear concept from a tiny little model on a bench and move it up to a bomb that can destroy millions of people without testing it. If you stop the testing, you stop the progress of these countries. Some say there will be rogue nations that will ignore that, that they don't care if you sign a treaty in the United States; they are going to go ahead and build their weapons. 
   I don't think any of us would suggest that we can guarantee a nuclear-free world or a nuclear-controlled world by a treaty. But ask yourself a basic question: Are we a safer world if we have a nuclear test ban treaty that puts sensing devices in 350 different locations so we can detect these tests that occur? Are we a safer world if we have a regime in place where one nation can challenge another and say, ``I think you have just engaged in the development of a nuclear weapon you are about to test, and under the terms of the treaty I have a right to send in an international inspection team to answer the question once and for all.'' 
   Why, of course, we are a safer world if those two things occur. They will not occur if the Republicans beat down this treaty today, as they have promised they will. An old friend of mine--now passed away--from the city of Chicago, said, ``When it comes to politics, there is always a good reason and a real reason.'' 
   The so-called good reason for opposing the treaty has to do with this belief that it doesn't cover every nation and every possible test. 
   The real reason, frankly, that a lot of them are nervous about going against this treaty is the fear that in a week or a month or a few months we will have another member of the nuclear club; in a week or a month or a few months we will have more testing between India and Pakistan; in a few weeks we may see what is happening in Pakistan disintegrating further and then having to worry about whether there will be nuclear weapons used in the process of their confrontation with India. 
   Those who vote to defeat the treaty will wear that collar, and they will know full well that they missed the signal opportunity for the United States to have the moral leadership to say our policy of no nuclear testing should be the world policy; it makes us safer. It makes the world safer. 
   Sadly, we have spent virtually no time in having committee hearings necessary for a treaty of this complexity, and a very limited time for floor debate. It is a rush to judgment. I am afraid the judgment has already been made. But ultimately the judgment will be made in November of the year 2000 when the American voters have their voice in this process. Our debates on the floor will be long forgotten. But the voters will have the final voice as to which was the moral, responsible course of action to enact a treaty supported by Presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy, and the Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a treaty that really gives us an opportunity for a safer world, or to turn our backs on it. 
   I sincerely hope that enough Republicans on that side of the aisle will muster the political courage to join us. The right thing to do is to pass this treaty.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I want to address the second issue before us, and one which is of grave concern in my home State of Illinois. It is the Agriculture appropriations bill. 
   It has been my high honor to serve on the agriculture appropriations subcommittee in both the House and the Senate. I have been party to some 13 different conferences. That is where the House and Senate come together and try to work out their differences. 
   I want to say of my chairman of the subcommittee, Senator COCHRAN, that I respect him very much. When I served in the House and he was a conferee, I believe that we always had a constructive dialog. There are important issues involving American agriculture. I was honored to be appointed to the same committee in the Senate, and I have respected him again for the contribution he has made as chairman of the committee. 
   But what happened to Senator COCHRAN in this conference shouldn't happen to anyone in the Senate. He was moving along at a good pace, a constructive pace, to resolve differences between the House and the Senate. Unfortunately, the House leadership turned out the lights, ended the conference committee, and said we will meet no more. What was usually a bipartisan and open and fair process disintegrated before our eyes. That is no reflection on the Senator from Mississippi. I have no idea what led to that. It occurred. It was clear that the problem was on the House side. We were making progress. We were making bipartisan decisions. The process broke down. 
   But with that said, I will vote for this bill, and 
   reluctantly. I believe it will provide some relief for struggling farmers in our fragile farm economy. 
   The Illinois Department of Agriculture estimates that $450 million from the $8.7 billion agricultural relief package will directly benefit Illinois producers through receipt of 100 percent of the 1999 AMTA payments. I agree with the Senator from North Dakota. Using an AMTA payment is fraught with danger. I think it is an open invitation for every one of these investigative television shows to have fun at the expense of this bill and this decision process. When they find people who haven't seen a tractor in decades but have ownership of a farm receiving payments upward of $.5 million, they are going to say: I thought you were trying to help struggling farmers, not somebody with a trust account who has never been near a farm. 
   That may occur because we have chosen these AMTA payments. We should have done this differently. I think we are going to rue the day these payments are made and the investigations  take place. But these AMTA payments will be in addition to the more than $450 million already received by Illinois farmers this year to help them through this crisis. 
   I voted for the Freedom to Farm Act. I have said repeatedly that I did not believe when I voted for that farm bill that I was voting for the Ten Commandants. I believed that we were dealing with an unpredictable process. Farming is unpredictable. Farm policy has to be flexible. We don't know what happens to weather or prices. We have to be able to respond. 
   You have to say in all candor as we complete this fiscal year and spend more in Federal farm payments than ever in our history that the Freedom to Farm Act, as we know, has failed. It is time for us, on a bipartisan basis, to revisit it, otherwise we will see year after weary and expensive year these emergency payments. 
   Look at the Illinois farm economy. My State is a lucky one. We usually aren't the first to feel the pain. God blessed us with great soil and talented farmers and a good climate. But we are in trouble. 
   Farm income in Illinois dropped 78 percent last year to just over $11,000 a year. That is barely a minimum wage that farmers will receive. That is the lowest net income on farms in two decades. 
   Incidentally, if you are going to gauge it by a minimum wage, as the Presiding Officer can tell you, farmers don't work 40-hour workweeks. When they are out in the fields late at night and early in the morning, they put in the hours that are necessary. Yet they end up receiving the minimum wage in my State of Illinois. That is down from $51,000 in 1997. That was the net farm income per family in that year. Lower commodity prices and record low hog prices in particular are primarily to blame for this net farm income free fall in my home State. 
   The Illinois Farm Development Authority recently noted that the financial stress faced by Illinois farmers today is higher than it has been for 10 years. Activity in the authority's Debt Restructuring Guarantee Program is four or five times higher than last year. They have approved 7 to 10 loans per month in 1998. In 1999, the authority has been approving 30 to 40 debt restructuring loans per month--a 300-percent increase. This is a record level unmatched since the 1986-1987 farm crisis.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I plan to cast my vote in favor of the fiscal year 2000 Agriculture appropriations conference report. I do so, however, with great disappointment in the final package crafted by the Republican leadership. In short, I believe the conference report inadequately addresses the needs of our Nation's farmers, falls short on lifting economically dangerous embargos, and has turned a usually bipartisan, open, and fair process into a backroom operation. 
   With that said, Mr. President, I cannot stand in the way of at least some relief for to our struggling farmers and our fragile farm economy. The Illinois Department of Agriculture estimates that $450 million from the $8.7 billion agriculture relief package will directly benefit Illinois producers through receipt of 100 percent of their 1999 Agriculture Market Transition Act (AMTA) payments. This is in addition to the more than $450 million already received by Illinois farmers this year to help them through this crisis. 
   The Illinois farm economy is in trouble. Farm income in Illinois dropped 78 percent last year to just over $11,000, the lowest in two decades and down significantly from the $51,000 figure in 1997. Lower commodity prices and record low hog prices, in particular, are primarily to blame for this net farm income free fall in my home State. 
   The Illinois Farm Development Authority recently noted that the financial stress faced by Illinois farmers today is higher than it has been for 10 years. Activity in the Authority's Debt Restructuring Guarantee Program is four or five times higher today than last year. The Authority approved 7 to 10 loans per month in 1998. In 1999, the Authority has been approving 30-40 Debt Restructuring loans per month-a 300-percent increase. This is a record level, unmatched since the 1986-87 farm crisis.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by the Senator from Missouri, Mr. BOND. 
   During the course of this debate, we will hear many terms, which sound technical in nature, about the issue at hand. It has been described as ergonomics, musculoskeletal disorders. I think we ought to try to get this down to the real-world level of what this debate concerns. 
   I have before me a study from the Centers for Disease Control and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services relative to this particular problem. They state, early in the study, the term ``musculoskeletal disorders'' refers to conditions that involve the nerves, tendons, muscles, and supporting structures of the body. 
   Another definition says: Ergonomic injuries have many names. They are called musculoskeletal disorders, repetitive stress injuries, cumulative trauma disorders, or just simply strains and sprains. These injuries occur when there is a mismatch between the physical requirements of a job and the physical capacity of a worker. 
   I wanted to make sure we said that at the outset, so those who are following this debate will understand that what is at issue is not a highly technical, scientific issue but something that every one of us who do manual chores at home or at the workplace understands. If you sit there and have to peel a bag of potatoes, when it is all over your hand is a little sore. What if you had to peel a bag of potatoes every half hour, 8 hours a day, 40 hours a week, 12 months a year? How would your hands react to it? That is what we are talking about--ergonomics; musculoskeletal disorders. 
   I note that the Republican majority wants to limit this debate. They have asked on two occasions that we agree to a limitation. I hope they will reflect on the fact that we are talking about injuries that occur to 600,000 workers a year. It is only fair to those workers, when we consider this amendment by Senator BOND of Missouri, that this debate reflect the gravity of the issue. I will not make a unanimous consent request at this time, but I think it is reasonable that we allot in this debate perhaps 1 minute for every 250 workers who were injured each year by one of these conditions. 
   That is 1 minute of debate for every 250 workers. By my calculation, that comes out to about 24,000 minutes, and it turns out to be a 40-hour work week. Wouldn't it be interesting if the Members of the Senate had to stand in their workplaces 4 and 5 hours at a time debating this amendment and then talk about the aches and pains they suffer. Imagine the worker who puts up with that every single day. 
   Each of us in the Senate brings our own personal experiences to this job. I am sure there are many colleagues in support of this amendment who have been engaged in manual labor. I oppose this amendment. I have had the experience, in my youth, of some pretty tough jobs. My folks were pretty adamant that I take on tough jobs so I would want to go back to school and finish my college and law school education. 
   Well, it worked. I grew up in East St. Louis, IL, and spent several summers working in the stockyards, sometimes working the graveyard shift, from midnight until 8 in the morning, and other times during the day. I did all sorts of manual labor, such as moving livestock, cleaning up in areas that needed to be cleaned up. It was a lot of hard, tough work. At the end of each summer, I was darn glad to go back to school. 
   But there were two jobs I had that educated me more than others about the workplace, and dangers, and why this debate is not about some dry concept but about real people who get up every single morning, pull themselves out of bed, brush their teeth, and head off to work to earn a paycheck to pay for their families' needs and maybe to realize the American dream. 
   One job I had was on a railroad. It was considered a clerical job. It involved a lot of moving back and forth, sometimes in the middle of the night, in Brooklyn, IL, between 
   trains that stopped. I was a bill clerk walking up and down with a lantern, trying to keep track of these trains. One night, in the middle of the night, I climbed a ladder on the side of one of these gondolas to see if it was empty or full. As I started to jump down from that ladder, my college graduation ring caught on a burr on the ladder, causing a pretty serious injury and a scar I still carry. That was a minor injury. I was back at work in a few days. Some workers aren't so lucky. 
   But the job I had really educated me about this issue, so I understand it personally. I hope my colleagues can come to understand it. It is a fact that I worked four straight summers in a slaughterhouse, the Hunter Packing Company of East St. Louis, processing hogs and pork products. We were unionized, the Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Butcher Workers of Greater North America, and we had a contract. Thanks to that contract, I think I received $3.50 an hour, which, in the early 1960s, was a great wage for a college student. I could finish that summer and take $1,500 back to school and do my best to pay my bills. My kids, and a lot of college students today, laugh when they consider that amount of money, but that was a large amount of money in my youth. When you came to the slaughterhouse as a college student, you expected the worst jobs, and you took them if you wanted to make the salary you needed. So I worked all over this slaughterhouse. 
   The union had entered into an agreement with the company, Hunter Packing Company, which said: You will work an 8-hour day, but we define an 8-hour day in terms of the number of hogs that are processed. If I recall correctly, our contract said we would process 240 hogs an hour, which meant slaughtering or processing on 2 different floors, 2 different responsibilities. 
   Some people who worked there said: Wait a minute, if 240 hogs equals an hour, and we are supposed to work 8-hour days, and at the end of the day we are supposed to have processed or slaughtered 1,920 hogs, if we can speed up the line that carries these hogs, or speed up the conveyor belt that carries the meat products, we might be able to get out in 7 hours. 
   So it was a race every day to get to 1,920 hogs. Hundreds of men and women who were standing on these processing lines were receiving that piece of the animal or piece of meat to process it, knowing another one was right behind it, just as fast as they could move--repetitive action, day in and day out. 
   I saw injuries in that workplace because of the repetition and the speed. I can remember working on what we called the ``kill floor,'' where the first processing of a hog took place. I worked next to an elderly African American gentleman, a nice guy. He joked with me all the time because I was this green college student doing everything wrong. One day, I looked over as he slumped and fell to the floor; he passed out. 
   I can recall another day when I was working on a line where they were putting hams on a table to be boned and then stuck into a can so we could enjoy them at home. These men were--it was all men at that time--paid by the ham. The faster they could bone the hams, the more money they made. The knives they used were the sharpest they could possibly get their hands on. They covered the other hand with a metal mesh glove, and they would set out to bone the ham as quickly as they could. There were hams flying in every direction and hands flying in every direction. The next thing you know, there were injuries and cuts. 
   Of course, if your hand is cut and you work as a piece worker, you really don't make much money until it heals. You can't go back too soon into an environment with a lot of meat juices and water because it won't heal. I  would see these men with bandaged hands standing over to the side waiting for another chance to make a living for their family. 
   These images are as graphic in my mind today, in 1999, standing on the floor of the Senate, as they were in my experience as a kid in that packing house. As I looked around at the men and women who got up every single day and went to work--hard work, dirty work, but respectable work--and brought home a good paycheck for a hard day's work, I saw time and time again these injuries on the job. 
   The amendment offered by the Senator from Missouri, Mr. BOND, says to the Federal Government--in this case, it says to the Secretary of Labor--not to study and not to come up with regulations that would protect workers in the workplace from repetitive injuries. 
   It is a common question in legislatures and on Capitol Hill: Who wants this amendment? Who is pushing for this amendment? Who would want to leave millions of American workers vulnerable in the workplace from repetitive stress injuries when we know that over 600,000 workers a year are injured? Who is it who wants to stop or slow down this process? 
   Well, I am virtually certain it is some business interest. I don't know which one, because the curious thing is that every business that comes to talk to this Senator, or others, is quick to say: We care about our workers. We put things in place to protect our workers. We don't need the Federal Government to 
   come in because safety in the workplace is No. 1 at our plant. 
   I hear that over and over again. I don't dispute it. When I talk to you a little later on about some of the companies that have responded to this particular challenge, you are going to find big names, Fortune 500 names, such as Caterpillar Tractor Company of Illinois, a big employer in my State. I am proud of what this company makes and exports around the world. You will hear about what they have done to deal with the problem. Chrysler Motor Company in Belvidere, IL. I have been there. We will talk about what they did. 
   Finally, you are going to say, if the Fortune 500 companies and the ones that talk to you are the good guys, the companies that are really trying to protect workers and understand how expensive and serious it is to have injuries in the workplace, who in the world is pushing for this amendment that would eliminate holding every business in America responsible for safety in the workplace? 
   My conclusion is that some bad actors out there in the business community who are not living up to the same standard as these companies are the ones behind this amendment. And the sad reality is, the larger companies, through the organizations that represent them in Washington, have joined ranks with the bad actors. 
   They are playing down the lowest common denominator. They are trying in a way to protect their competitors that aren't living up to the same good standards for their workers. I think that is shameful. I think it is disgraceful. 
   This Bond amendment--make no mistake--I want to read to you what it does--says after a lot of preparatory language:  
   None of the funds made available in this act may be used by the Secretary of Labor, or the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, to promulgate, or to issue, or to continue the rulemaking process of promulgating or issuing any standard regulation or guideline regarding ergonomics prior to September 30, 2000.  
   In other words, turn out the lights downtown on establishing standards that you send down to businesses to protect workers.

   Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from New York is accurate. At the conclusion of my remarks, I will ask unanimous consent to enter into the RECORD a news release from the U.S. Department of Labor that is dated Thursday, August 30, 1990, a release from then-Secretary of Labor, Elizabeth Dole, that says as follows in the opening paragraphs:  
   Secretary of Labor, Elizabeth Dole----  
   The same person who is now a Republican candidate for President, I might add----  
   *.*.* today launched a major initiative to reduce repetitive motion trauma, one of the Nation's most debilitating across-the-board worker safety and health illnesses of the 1990s.  
   She goes on with a quote that says:  
   These painful and sometimes crippling illnesses now make up 48 percent of all recordable industrial workplace illnesses. We must do our utmost to protect workers from these hazards, not only in the red meat industry, but all U.S. industries.  
   That was Secretary Elizabeth Dole, Republican administration, 1990.

   Mr. DURBIN. I think the Senator from New York identifies the real problem here in defining the issue because in many cases we are talking about what is characterized as a ``soft tissue injury.'' In other words, examination by an x ray or an MRI may not disclose any problem and yet there is a very serious and real problem. 
   I used to find in my life experience people suffering neck and back injuries. You couldn't point to objective evidence of why this person was crippling up or why this person had a problem. In fact, the problem was very real. 
   What we are trying to do is establish a standard so the worker is not accused of malingering and the worker is not accused of faking it, but the worker has a recourse when there is a very real and serious injury to at least get time off and at least go for some medical attention. 
   The Senator from Missouri, Mr. BOND, with this amendment wants to stop this process, wants to say that this Government will not establish that standard of protection for American workers. The net result of it, of course, is that 600,000 victims of these injuries each year will not have the protection to which the Senator from New York has alluded.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me go on to say that the objective of continuing to study this matter is one of the oldest strategies on Capitol Hill. It is the way many people who object to a certain thing occurring delay the inevitable and prolong the process of review. 
   I have been involved for years in the battle against the tobacco companies. I can't think of a product in America that has been studied more than tobacco. It shouldn't be. It is the No. 1 preventable cause of death in America today. 
   When the tobacco companies ruled the roost on Capitol Hill, they would postpone health standards and warning labels, and banning smoking on airplanes, for example, by saying: We just need another study. If we can get another study, then maybe we will arrive at the truth about what to deal with, what to do in dealing with tobacco products. 
   This is another good illustration. I listened to the Senator from Missouri. He said in his conclusion supporting this amendment, which I rise in opposition to: ``It is time for OSHA to act compassionately.'' 
   I understand the virtue of compassion, and I hope I have some in my life. 
   But there is no compassion for millions of American workers if we do not set out to establish a standard of protection when it comes to these types of injuries. 
   To postpone this for another year--which is what this amendment would do--is to put their health and safety at risk. For what? So that bad companies that care less about their worker injuries don't have to improve the workplace? That is what it is all about. That is the bottom line on this debate. 
   As I said earlier, major companies already recognize the problem and respond to it. Go into many of your discount stores and one sees workers wearing back brace belts. I have seen them at Wal-Mart and other stores. Their employers understand reaching over and pulling groceries hour after hour can cause some back strain, so they have done something about it. Voluntarily, on their own, they have done something. They don't want the workers to be off work and an expense to the company. They want them to continue on the job with good morale and they provide them some protection. 
   When I went to the Belvidere Chrysler plant where they make the Neon automobile in my State of Illinois, I was pleasantly surprised to see all the changes that had taken place on the assembly line. In the old days, a worker would turn around and pick up a piece of an automobile, move around, and put it on the automobile to fix it in place. That has changed. There are all sorts of cranes and devices so parts can be moved without strain or stress to the employee. That was done not just to protect the employee but to protect the bottom line of the company. 
   Frankly, worker injuries cost the companies in terms of time lost and in terms of productivity as the experienced workers leave the line and someone new takes their place. That is being done by conscientious companies. OSHA needs to develop a standard for those that are not conscientious. The Bond amendment is not compassionate. The Bond amendment stops the Department of Labor from establishing that standard of protection. 
   As I mentioned earlier, over 6 million workers have been injured in the course of keeping records on this particular type of injury, 600,000 each year. Over 2,000 studies on these hazards have detailed how the hazards in the workplace harm people and put them out of work, and the devastating impact they have had on the American workforce. 
   Yet the Bond amendment delays, stops it, says to the workers who go to work every single day, put your life and your earning capacity at risk in the workplace. And we in Congress, each year, for the sake of a handful of companies that refuse to act responsibly in dealing with their workers, will stop you from any standard of protection. 
   The following disorders in 1997 accounted for more than 600,000 workplace injuries. One is fairly common. In fact, some people who work in my office have dealt with this problem because of the nature of working on a keyboard. This type of musculoskeletal disorder is called carpal tunnel syndrome. It accounts for $20 billion annually in workers' compensation costs. As I am speaking now, there is a court reporter standing in front of me working away at her machine; she does that every single day. If she is not careful, she can develop problems, as people in ordinary clerical situations do on a regular basis. 
   I don't think these people are malingerers. I don't think these people are faking. Ever seen the scars from the surgery? That strikes me as a great length to go to to fake an injury. I think these people are in real pain and seeking real relief. 
   One of the things I have noticed, some of the keyboards have been changed now so there is less stress on the hands of workers who use them. Companies have decided in redesigning the keyboard that they will address that problem directly. It could be that the development of a standard by the Department of Labor will move our country in that direction and reduce the $20 billion paid out every year by American businesses for workers' compensation cases involving those with carpal tunnel syndrome. 
   Who is affected the most by the Bond amendment? Which workers will be hurt the most by the Bond amendment? Women across America. Women workers suffer a much higher rate of carpal tunnel syndrome. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 86 percent of repetitive motion injury increases were suffered by women; 78 percent of tendinitis increases were suffered by women. Yet women make up 46 percent of the workforce. 
   What kind of jobs are these women in? We have talked about clerical jobs, obviously. But there are nurses, nurse's aides, cashiers, assemblers, maids, laborers, custodians, and, yes, many of these jobs employ minority workers. It is estimated between 25 and 50 percent of the workforce are Hispanic and African American workers in those particular jobs. 
   A 6-month study by the National Academy of Sciences in 1998 stated,  ``The positive relationship between the occurrence of musculoskeletal disorders and the conduct of work is clear.'' 
   We heard the Senator from Arkansas, we heard the Senator from Missouri--I am sure we hear others--stand up and defy this scientific conclusion. Despite 2,000 studies and this clear language, some would lead Members to believe that it is 
   still a mystery how 600,000 workers could complain of this type of injury in America every single year. We know better. We know better from our life experience. That is why this amendment is so bad, why this amendment, in delaying protection for those workers, ignores the obvious, the injuries and the scientific conclusion that leads us to at least a standard of care to protect those same workers. 
   A few minutes ago, I made reference to the press release from the Department of Labor, 1990, at a time when the Secretary was Elizabeth Dole. Elizabeth Dole is a person I came to know and respect when she was Secretary of Transportation and appeared before my subcommittee in the House of Representatives. There was a time when we spoke of worker protection issues as bipartisan issues. Sadly, with a very few exceptions, that is not the case anymore. 
   If we are talking about increasing the minimum wage, which historically was a bipartisan issue--both Democrats and Republicans understanding that people who went to work every day deserve a living wage--that has changed. It has changed for the worse. 
   This amendment, if it comes to a vote, will evidence that this has become a very partisan matter. Those offering the amendment on the Republican side of the aisle will generally, if not exclusively, vote in support of the amendment; those on the Democratic side of the aisle will generally vote against it. We have broken down on partisan lines. 
   The sad reality is the workers we are talking about and the workers who were injured do not break down on partisan lines. The workers who come off that job with neck and back injuries and carpal tunnel syndromes are Republicans, Democrats, Independents, and nonvoters. They deserve better than to let this issue break down to the partisan battle which it has. 
   Secretary of Labor Elizabeth Dole said in August of 1990:  
   We must do our utmost to protect workers from these hazards in all U.S. industries.  
   She said at that time, 9 years ago:  
   We are publishing these guidelines now because we want to eliminate as many illnesses as possible as quickly as possible.  
   She goes on to say:  
   The Department [of Labor] is committed to taking the most effective steps necessary to address the problem of ergonomic hazards on an industry-wide basis.  
   That was 9 years ago. Here we are today, without those standards of protection, and an effort underway by Senator BOND of Missouri to, once again, delay the establishment of these standards. 
   Secretary Elizabeth Dole said in 1990:  
   We are emphasizing the need for employers to fit the job to the employee, rather than the employee to the job. This involves such measures as designing flexible workstations which can be adjusted to suit individuals and relying on tools developed to minimize physical distress and eliminate crippling injuries. It begins by organizing work processes with the physical needs of the workers in mind.  
   That is basically what I have seen applied to businesses in my home State of Illinois, by companies that care. This entire news release has now been agreed to be part of the RECORD. Those who review this debate will see that Secretary Dole was on the right track--a Republican Secretary of Labor. 
   Why, today, the Republican Party, through the amendment of Senator BOND of Missouri, wants to take a different venue, a different tack, and to eliminate this responsibility, I cannot explain. 
   This press release is from a different Labor Secretary, not our current Secretary of Labor, Alexis Herman, who said if the Bond amendment is adopted, she will veto this entire important bill; it is from Secretary Elizabeth Dole. But it is from Secretary Elizabeth Dole. Secretaries Dole, Reich, and Herman have support this issue, but they are not alone. Other endorsements establishing the standard of protection for American workers come from the American Nurses Association, the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons, the National Academy of Sciences, the American Public Health Association, and the National Advisory Committee on Occupational Safety and Health. 
   I received a letter from the American Public Health Association, which I would like to make part of this record as well.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this letter is dated September 27, 1999. It comes from a long list of organizations that comprise the American Public Health Association. 
   Reading the introductory paragraphs will make it clear where they stand, in opposition to the Bond amendment:  
   We are deeply concerned about S. 1070, legislation that would not only block OSHA from issuing an ergonomics standard, but even from issuing voluntary guidelines to protect working men and women from ergonomic hazards, the biggest safety and health problem facing workers today. 
   We strongly support OSHA's efforts to promulgate a standard to protect workers from ergonomic injuries and illnesses. These disorders are real, they are serious and they account for nearly a third of all serious job related injuries (more than 600,000 workers a year); moreover, they are preventable. One type, carpal tunnel syndrome, alone results in workers losing more time from their jobs than any other type of injury, including amputations. The worker's compensation costs of ergonomic injuries are estimated at $20 billion annually, the overall costs at $60 billion. 
   For women workers, OSHA's efforts are particularly important, because nearly half of all injuries and illnesses among women workers result from ergonomic hazards. Though these hazards are present in a variety of jobs, many of the occupations predominantly occupied by women are among the hardest hit by ergonomic injuries.  
   Why is it when it comes to this floor and the battle is worth fighting, if the well-heeled special interest groups with the strongest lobbies can come in, whether it is an oil company trying to avoid paying its fair share of royalties to drill for oil on public lands or other large companies, we take the time and end up giving the special favors, but when it comes to women in the workplace, minorities in the workplace, time and time again this Senate, this Congress, will cut a corner and say, ultimately: Perhaps we ought to give the benefit of the doubt to the employer, perhaps we ought to ignore the 600,000 who are injured? 
   As one who spent a small part of my life in the workplace, that standard is upside down. If the Senate in Washington, DC, is not here to protect those who are voiceless, then we have lost our bearings completely. This issue goes to the heart of that debate. 
   The General Accounting Office has found employers can reduce costs and injuries associated with musculoskeletal disorders and improve not only employee health but productivity and product quality. 
   When workers know their employer cares enough about them to make the workplace safer for them, it is a clear and strong message to them that increases employee morale. The time has come for the other side of the aisle to make good on its promise to the American people. The leader in the candidacy for the Presidency on the Republican side, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, claims he is a compassionate conservative. During the course of this campaign, we will try to figure out what that means. 
   Today, we can ask ourselves if we are seeing an exhibition of compassionate conservatism from the Republican side of the aisle. I think not. With this amendment, I think we see an effort to turn our backs on people who need compassion, understanding, and protection. 
   Last year, the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, Robert Livingston of Louisiana, and his ranking Democratic member, DAVID OBEY of Wisconsin, made it clear in a letter to the Secretary of Labor:  
   ..... by funding the National Academy of Sciences study [on this issue], it is no way our intent to block or delay issuance by OSHA of a proposed rule on ergonomics.  
   The reason I raise that is so those who are following the debate understand that this attempt at delay is nothing new. I have the letter. The letter makes it clear that both the Democratic and Republican leaders on the House Appropriations Committee last year made it clear they wanted to go forward with the rule or a standard of protection on these types of injuries.

   Mr. DURBIN. Here we have the Bond amendment which says the deal is off. For the sake of some companies which do not protect their workers in the workplace and do not care to spend the money to do it, we are basically going to say we will establish no standards for workplaces across America. Senator GREGG, my colleague, proposed the new National Academy of Sciences study last September in committee. Then he stated, ``..... the study does not in any way limit OSHA'' in moving forward with the ergonomic standard. 
   By the way, this study asks exactly the same seven questions the previous study asked. Even Chairman STEVENS of Alaska stated, ``There is no moratorium under this agreement.'' 
   So we are told the Department is supposed to go forward in establishing these standards. Along comes the Bond amendment. I remind my colleagues, the Bond amendment stops the Department of Labor in its tracks. It prohibits that department, OSHA, from promulgating or continuing the rulemaking process, issuing any standard, regulation, or guidelines regarding ergonomics for a year. 
   So the deal has been changed. The losers in this bargain are the workers across America who expect us to care and expect us to respond. I think it is time to bring an end to this charade. We have a real problem. We need real solutions. Workers across this country need real protection. The Bond amendment removes the possibility of establishing this standard of protection. 
   A few weeks ago I was visited by Madeleine Sherod. Madeleine is a victim of these injuries, a mother of five children who are now all grown. She has worked for an Illinois paint company for 20 years. 
   When she started, she literally lifted and moved work stations from one area of the plant to another. This job consisted of lifting several different sizes and weights of boxes. After several months of this type of work she transferred to the shipping department where she performed the duties of a warehouse worker. Her job consisted of driving a material handling truck and lifting cartons of paint that were packaged in various sizes and weights (5 gallon pails weighing approximately 20 lbs-90 lbs). She performed this job for at least 13 years. She later transferred to a job where she now operates several different pieces of machinery. She must keep the equipment operating efficiently--if the machinery breaks down then manual labor must be performed. 
   Her first injury occurred about 15 years ago. She was diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome and had surgery to relieve the pain. As a mother of 5 children her ability to perform the normal tasks as a parent was an everyday struggle. She was unable to comb her three daughters hair, wash dishes, sweep floors, or many other day-to-day tasks that working moms must perform.  
   Her second injury occurred about 7 years ago. Madeleine was diagnosed with tendinitis and this time had tenon release surgery. Even today she has to wear a wrist brace to help strengthen her wrist. Being extra cautious has become part of her everyday life when it comes to the use of her wrist. 
   She recently found a lump on her left wrist, and is preparing herself for yet another surgery. 
   The company has not been able to make any adjustments for her at this time. They say that there really is nothing they can do to change the work that is preformed in the shipping department to curtail repetitive use of the hands, knees and back. 
   And here's the clincher: the majority of the women who have worked for this company for more than 10 year have had similar surgeries for their injuries.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer this amendment regarding childhood asthma. For the next 15 minutes imagine breathing through a tiny straw the size of a coffee stirrer, never getting enough air. Now imagine suffering through this process three to six times a day. This is asthma. 
   Today, asthma is considered the worst chronic health problem plaguing this nation's children, affecting nearly 15 million Americans. That figure includes more than 700,000 Illinoisans, of whom 213,000 are children under the age of 18. Illinois has the nation's highest asthma-related death rate for African-American males, and Chicago has one of the highest rates of childhood asthma in the country. 
   During a recent visit to Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago, I met a wonderful little boy whose life is a daily fight against asthma. He told me he can't always participate in gym class or even join his friends on the playground. Fortunately, Nicholas is receiving the medical attention necessary to manage his asthma. Yet for millions of children, this is not the case. Their asthma goes undiagnosed and untreated, making trips to the emergency room as common as trips to the grocery store. 
   In an effort to help the millions of children who live every day with undiagnosed or untreated asthma, I am offering this amendment with my colleague Sen. MIKE DEWINE. It would provide $50 million in grants through the Center for Disease Control, for community-based organizations including hospitals, community health centers, school-based programs, foster care programs, childhood nutrition programs to support asthma screening, treatment, education and prevention programs. 
   Despite the best efforts of the health community, childhood asthma is becoming more common, more deadly and more expensive. In the past 20 years, childhood asthma cases have increased by 160 percent and asthma-related deaths have tripled despite improved treatments. 
   Chicago has the dubious distinction of having the second highest rate of childhood asthma in the country. Only New York City has higher rates. According to a study published by the Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology, of inner-city school children in Chicago, researchers found that the prevalence of diagnosed asthma was 10.8 per cent, or twice the 5.8 per cent the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates in that age group nationally. The study also found that most of the children with diagnosed asthma were receiving medical care, but it may not be consistent with what asthma care guidelines recommend. Researchers questioned parents of kindergartners and found 10.8 per cent of the children had been found to have asthma. The researchers estimated an additional 6 to 7 percent had undiagnosed asthma. By comparison, the nationwide asthma rate for children 5 to 14 is 7.4 per cent. Moreover, many of the asthma cases were severe: 42 per cent had trouble sleeping once or twice a week because of wheezing, and 87 per cent had emergency room visits during the previous year. 
   Asthma disproportionately attacks many of society's most vulnerable those least able to fight back, children and minorities. A recent New York Times article described a study in the Brooklyn area where it was found that a staggering 38 per cent of homeless children suffer from asthma. 
   Some of the factors known to contribute to asthma such as poor living circumstances, exposure to cockroach feces, stress, exposure to dampness and mold are all experienced by homeless children. They are also experienced by children living in poor housing or exposed to urban violence. There are other factors such as exposure to second hand smoke and smog that also exacerbate or trigger asthma attacks. 
   For minorities, asthma is particularly deadly. The Asthma death rate for African-Americans is more than twice as high as it is for other segments of the population. Illinois has the highest asthma-related death rate in the country for African-American males. The death rate is 3 times higher than the asthma-related death rate for whites in Illinois. Nationwide, the childhood asthma-related death rate in 1993, was 3 to 4 times higher for African Americans compared to Caucasian Americans. The hospitalization rate for asthma is almost three times as high among African-American children under the age of 5 compared to their white counterparts The increased disparity between death rates compared to prevalence rates has been partially explained by decreased access to health care services for minority children. 
   Even though asthma rates are particularly high for children in poverty,  they are also rising substantially for suburban children. Overall, the rates are increasing. Every one of us knows of a child whether our own, a relative's or a friend's who suffers from asthma. 
   Asthma-related death rates have tripled in the last two decades. My state of Illinois has the highest asthma-related deaths in the country for African American men. 
   The effects of asthma on society are widespread. Many of you may be surprised to learn that asthma is the single most common reason for school absenteeism. Parents miss work while caring for children with asthma. Beyond those days missed at school and parents missing work, there is the huge emotional stress suffered by asthmatic children. It is a very frightening event for a small child to be unable to breathe. A recent US News article quoted an 8-yr old Virginian farm girl, Madison Benner who described her experience with asthma. She said ``It feels like something was standing on my chest when I have an asthma attack.'' This little girl had drawn a picture of a floppy-eared, big footed elephant crushing a frowning girl into her bed. 
   In many urban centers, over 60 per cent of childhood admissions to the emergency room are for asthma. There are 1.8 million emergency room visits each year for asthma. Yet the emergency room is hardly a place where a child and the child's parents can be educated in managing their asthma. In 1994, 466,000 Americans were hospitalized with asthma, up from 386,000 in 1979. 
   Asthma is one of the most common and costly diseases in the US. In contrast to most other chronic diseases, the health burden of asthma is increasing rapidly. The financial burden of asthma was $6.2 billion in 1990 and is estimated to increase to more than $15 billion in 2000. 
   Most children who have asthma develop it in their first year, but it often goes undiagnosed or as the study I mentioned earlier, the children may not receive the best treatment. The National Institutes of Health is home to the National Asthma Education and Prevention board. This is a large group of experts from all across the fields involved in health care and asthma. They have developed guidelines on both treating asthma and educating children and their parents in prevention. It is very important that when we spend money on developing such guidelines that they actually get out to communities so that they can take advantage of this research. 
   CDC has been working in collaboration with NIH to make sure that health professionals and others get the most up to date information. My amendment could further help this effort by providing grantees with this information. 
   We do have treatments that work for most people. Early diagnosis, treatment and management are key to preventing serious illness and death. There are several wonderful models for success already available to some communities. Take for example the ``breathmobile'' program in Los Angeles that was started 2 years ago. This program provides a van that is 
   equipped with medical personnel, asthma education materials, and asthma treatment supplies. It goes out to areas that are known to have a high incidence of childhood asthma and screens children in those areas. This ``Breathmobile'' program has reduced trips to the emergency room by 17 per cent in the first year of operation. This program is being expanded to sites in Phoenix, Atlanta, and Baltimore. I hope that we can be as successful in Illinois and other parts of the country. Children in these Breathmobile programs are also enrolled in the Children's Health Program if they are income eligible. We have all heard of how slow enrollment in the children's health program has been and anything that we can do to speed enrollment up is vitally important. 
   In West Virginia, a Medicaid ``disease management'' program which seeks to coordinate children with asthma's care so that they get the very best care has been found to be very cost effective. It has reduced trips to the emergency room by 30 per cent. 
   In Illinois, the Mobile CARE Foundation is setting up a program in Chicago based on the Los Angeles initiative. In addition, the American Association of Chest Physicians has joined with other groups to form the Chicago Asthma Consortium to provide asthma screening and treatment. Efforts like these need our amendment. This Childhood Asthma Amendment would expand these programs to help ensure that no child goes undiagnosed and every asthmatic child gets the treatment he or she needs. 
   I am offering this amendment here today with my colleague from Ohio, so that we can expand these programs to other areas of the country. It is a very simple amendment. It adds $10 million to the Centers for Disease Control's appropriations for local community grants to screen children for asthma and if they are found to have it, to provide them with treatment and education into how to manage their asthma. 
   CDC has current authority to carry out such programs and as the Bill Report already notes on page 93 of the report: ``The Committee is pleased with the work that CDC has done to address the increasing prevalence of asthma. However the increase in asthma among children, particularly among inner-city minorities, remains alarming. The Committee urges CDC to expand its outreach aimed at increasing public awareness of asthma control and prevention strategies, particularly among at risk minority populations in under-served communities.'' I couldn't agree more. We do need to do more in this area. 
   No child should die from asthma. We need to make sure that people understand the signs of asthma and that all asthmatic children have access to treatment and information on how to lessen their exposure to things that trigger asthma attacks. 
   My amendment responses to the alarming increase in childhood asthma cases and asthma-related deaths. It would provide funds to community and state organizations that serve areas with the largest number of children who are at risk of developing asthma and areas with the highest asthma-related death rates. The grantees could use the funds to develop programs to best meet the needs of their residents. The funds could be targeted to those communities where there are the highest number of children with asthma or where there is the highest number of asthma-related deaths. 
   This amendment is a small step toward addressing this the single greatest chronic health illness of children today. $10 million is a pretty small sum. I am glad that this amendment has been accepted. 
   The Amendment is supported by the American Lung Association, the National Association for Children's Hospitals and Research Institutions, the Academy of Pediatrics, the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America and others who support children's health. 
   I thank my colleagues on behalf of the 5 million children who suffer from asthma today in America for accepting this amendment that can make some progress to combat this the most preventable childhood illness.

    Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to honor those who have enriched the lives of men and women with disabilities. Each year the Illinois chapter of the American Association on Mental Retardation recognizes the work of Illinoisans who have dedicated and committed their lives to helping people with disabilities. 
   These award winners live in Illinois and play an important role in the lives of Illinoisans with disabilities. A 1999 Direct Service Award winner is someone who devotes more than 50 percent of their time working hands-on with their client. These award winners work directly with their clients with commitment, sensitivity, professionalism, and patience. These qualities set them apart and increase their value to their patients. 
   It is important we recognize these individuals who go beyond the call of duty to improve the lives of others. We should note that these individuals do not only enrich the lives of those for whom they care, but enrich our lives as well. They represent the true spirit of community service. 
   It is my honor and privilege to recognize the achievements of the following distinguished Illinois direct service professionals: Linda Barnes, Karen Catt, Candace Fulgham, Ross Griswold, Delores Hardin, Cathey Hardy, Raterta Kalish, Eldora Madison, Anita Martin, Vickie Mckenny, Ida Mitchell, Michael Peters, Noreen Przislicki, Douglas S. Revolinski, Angelo Reyes, Karie Rosenown, Laureen Saathoff, Ruby Sandefur, Emma Smith, and Kathie Tillman. It is a privilege to represent these award winners in the United States Senate. 
   Again, I applaud them for their lifetime effort and their dedication to better the lives of others who are less fortunate. These distinguished men and women are heroes in their field, and I am proud to recognize their work.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, those who are trying to follow what is happening on Capitol Hill at this moment in time should be aware of some of the basics. Our calendar year for budget purposes ended on October 1. We started a new year. So, ``happy new year'' to all who are following this debate. Unfortunately, we do not have our spending bills passed. 
   In fairness, neither Democrats nor Republicans have a very good record of passing these bills on time. But I think most people would concede, we are at a moment in time in the history of this institution where we have never faced such chaos as we do today. There does not seem to be any exit strategy. People are getting too comfortable here. Instead of thinking about ending this session in a responsible way and going home, we are still jousting back and forth politically, and that is sad. 
   What is even sadder is the situation in which we find ourselves today. After all the time we spent on the budget and after all the suggestions about how to resolve it, we do not have anything near a dialog between the President and the leaders on Capitol Hill. Some say they do not want the President to come up to Capitol Hill because that may not be a good environment for the debate. Some say the Republican leaders are afraid to go to the White House because they have had their pockets picked there in the past. I suggested we set up folding chairs on The Mall and let them meet there, let the whole world watch, and let's see if we can bring it to a conclusion. 
   I think the American people ought to pay attention to this debate because now what we hear from the Republican  side of the aisle is that in order to exit this place, they want to have an across-the-board cut in all the appropriations bills. That may sound eminently fair: Everybody suffers. But keep in mind, some suffer more than others. When you start cutting back in programs such as Head Start and you have the kinds of cuts we need to balance the budget, 43,000 children are taken out of this program where we try to get them ready for school. How many people do you want the cut at the Federal Bureau of Investigation? How many people do you want to cut from the border guards to stop drugs from coming into the United States? 
   These are legitimate questions, and spending committees make these decisions as they build their budget bills. Now, in a effort to get out of town, we hear from the Republican side of the aisle, ``Let's just have an across-the-board cut,'' and I think that is sad. We have had entirely too much gimmickry in this budget debate already. At one point in time, one of the Republican Senators suggested we should amend, not a bill but the calendar, not the legislative calendar but the real calendar; let's create a 13th month in a year. We were going to have a contest to see if we could come up with a name for it in an effort to at least have some bipartisan agreement. But after it did not pass the laugh test, it was dropped as an idea. 
   Then last week, the Republican leaders in the House said: We'll take the millions of Americans, working Americans, who get some tax relief called the earned-income tax credit, and let's just delay paying those people. That was a suggestion from the House Republican leaders. That did not even pass the George W. Bush compassionate conservative test. He announced to his party and America: Don't do that. You have to find a way out of this short of hurting people who are working for a living and struggling to get by. 
   It seems as if every week there is a new notion, the latest one being this across-the-board cut. Let's try to get to the bottom line here. You will hear us toss out CBO, OMB, on and on. We love to do that in Washington. The Congressional Budget Office comes up with some estimates on spending and the economy. The Office of Management and Budgeting does the same. Sometimes they agree; sometimes they don't. It is a calculated guess. But they both seem to agree at this point in time that we will be borrowing money from the Social Security trust fund in order to bring this to a conclusion. I don't want to see that happen. But it has happened for years and years and years, and this year we would borrow less than we usually do. I hope we do not have to borrow any, when it is all said and done. 
   President Clinton came to us and said: Here are some offsets. Here are some things you can do that will, in fact, provide the revenue we need for us to leave on time. 
   I think some of them were reasonable. Let me give you an idea. One of them suggested a 50-cents-a-pack tobacco tax. I know from serving in this body, my colleagues are not going to warm up to that idea. I support it. Yes, it is true, the Senator from Illinois just said he supports a tax increase on tobacco products, because when the price goes up, the kids stop buying them. When kids stop buying them, they start weaning themselves from an addiction that can ultimately lead to death and disease--50 cents a pack, $6 to $8 billion a year, money that can be spent for education, for health care, for priorities in this country. I think the President is on the right track. 
   So I sincerely hope, before we resort to cutting such things as education and FBI, border guards, military personnel--personnel staffing reductions--we ought to step back for a minute and see if there is not some common ground left here. 
   The most amazing thing about this across-the-board cut debate is that the ink is hardly dry on the Republican proposal that was offered, and then thrown off the table, to give America a $792 billion tax cut. You may remember it. It has only been a few weeks ago. We had so much money, we were awash in money, we were going to start giving it back in huge sums. Thank goodness the American people and many leaders in Washington said wait a minute, take another look at it.

   Mr. DURBIN. So when the proposal was made by the Republican side for the $792 billion tax cut, many people said: Wasn't it 24 months ago that this Senate floor was consumed in a debate about amending the Constitution of the United States to pass a balanced budget amendment to stop the deficits once and for all, 
   to bring discipline by the Federal court system imposing limitations on spending? 
   Yes, it was a little over 2 years ago. That is what we were talking about. 
   Then the proposal came from the Republican side: We have so much money now that we can give away a massive tax cut, primarily to the wealthiest people in this country. 
   The idea was rejected by Alan Greenspan who has no political ax to grind and wants to see the economy move forward. The idea was rejected by economists, as well as leaders from the President on down, and most important, it was rejected by the American people. 
   A few weeks later, the same Republican Party that had this massive tax cut tells us we are in desperate straits as to this year's budget, and we have to do across-the-board cuts in law enforcement, education, and health care. That tells us, frankly, the captain on the ship does not know where he is headed. The captains, in these cases, are the leaders in the House and the Senate on the Republican side. 
   I will tell you where I think they should be heading, and I think the American people expect this to happen. We have to end this in a sensible fashion. We have to make certain when it is done we meet our basic obligations--obligations to kids and school, obligations to those who depend on us for the very basics, obligations to Social Security to make sure it is strong beyond the year 2032, and as for Medicare, beyond the year 2015. These should be viable systems. That is our first obligation. 
   It is our obligation, as well, to provide for the basics of this country--the national defense, to make sure the men and women in uniform are treated humanely and they have not only good assignments but are adequately compensated for the service they give to our country. 
   The list is pretty obvious and most American families would agree with them, but we have not gotten the dialog underway between Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill. I sincerely hope this idea of an across-the-board cut is rejected. I believe the Appropriations Committee has to make priority judgments on spending. The President's offset package will save us some money.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for raising this issue. In reply to my colleague, the Senator from Oklahoma, I believe the Senator from Massachusetts is making it clear, now that we know that lurking at least in the backs of the minds of many of the Republican leaders is the idea of an across-the-board cut, to somehow develop an exit strategy, the Senator from Massachusetts reminds us that across-the-board cuts means a cut in education. 
   Let me give you some specifics, if I might. When I look at the committee report from this education funding bill, I see that if the 5.5-percent cut that is envisioned by some of the Republican leaders is put into place, we will reduce the amount of money for title I, the major Federal educational program for disadvantaged children, to below last year's level of funding. So those who say this is a harmless cut that will never be noticed are not portraying this accurately, I'm afraid. 
   I am prepared to discuss the facts with the Senator from Oklahoma, and the facts, unfortunately, lead to the conclusion that if we take his across-the-board cut strategy, we are going to cut educational funding below last year's level of spending. In so doing, whom do we jeopardize? Title I, of course, sounds pretty general and pretty bureaucratic, but this program is critically important for 11 million kids across America. Who are these kids? These are the kids most likely to drop out of school; these are the kids most likely to need special help to stay up with their classes and not fall behind; these are the kids who need that extra tutor for reading so they don't get behind the class, get discouraged, and drop out of school or, frankly, become a problem in the classroom. That is what title I is about. That is the program that would be cut by the Senator from Oklahoma. 
   It is not the only program. The Congressional Budget Office says that the 5.5-percent across-the-board cut that is envisioned by some Republican leaders will cut many other programs as well: $26 million from the COPS Program, a program to put more police on the street and in communities, which is bringing down crime in America. Is there a higher priority? I don't think there is in my State of Illinois. The Head Start Program, from which millions of kids from poor families get a helping hand before they start kindergarten so they can succeed, we would see $290 million cut from that program by this idea of an across-the-board cut. National Institutes of Health: Of all of the progress we have made in improving Federal funding for medical research, we would cut $967 million out of the progress and research into diseases and problems facing American families. I think that is a serious mistake.  Title I education grants, a $380 million cut. 
   Let me tell you some of the other cuts in education effected by this Republican strategy of across-the-board cuts. Afterschool programs: All of us stood on this floor in horror over what happened at Columbine High School in Littleton, CO. We knew something went wrong in a very good school. Children lost their lives. We said: What is it that we need to do to protect our kids in school and to make sure fewer kids go 
   astray? We were told by the experts time and time again that we need counselors at the schools to seek out troubled kids, and we need programs at the schools so kids can use their time effectively. 
   An across-the-board cut would reduce the amount of money available to American schools for afterschool programs. By reducing that amount of money, it is just going to lessen our opportunity to reach out to kids who need something constructive to do in a supervised environment after school. So when my friends on the Republican side say that the easy way out, the painless way, is an across-the-board cut, they don't want to face reality. Those cuts will touch people who need a helping hand. They are going to touch kids who might drop out of school. They are going to cut afterschool programs. They are going to cut the kind of tutoring we need to make sure that kids succeed. 
   In this day and time, at this time in our history, with the prosperity of the American economy, with the strength of this budget and of our budget process, have we reached a point where we have no recourse but to cut the most basic program for America--education? I think not. The President has come up with a list of offsets that will preserve the Social Security trust fund and still keep our budget in balance. I urge this Senate to adopt the amendment offered by the Senator from Massachusetts. 
   Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the hallmark of our criminal justice system has always been the search for the truth. With this goal in mind, I am introducing legislation to ensure the quality of justice in our criminal courts through the use of DNA testing. 
   In the last decade, the use of DNA evidence as a tool to assign guilt and acquit the innocent has produced dramatic results. The Innocence Project at the Cardozo School of Law has identified 62 cases in the United States since 1988 in which the use of DNA technology resulted in overturned convictions. In my home State of Illinois, 12 innocent men in the past 12 years have been released from Illinois' Death Row after DNA testing or other evidence proved their innocence. 
   The bill I am introducing today, The Right to Use Technology in the Hunt for Truth (TRUTH) Act will amend the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Specifically, the bill will allow Federal defendants to file a motion to mandate DNA testing to support claims of actual innocence. Under current law, rule 33 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure imposes a 2-year time limitation for new trial motions based on newly discovered evidence. This time limitation can act as a carrier even in cases where the evidence of actual innocence is available. My bill will allow defendants to bring a motion for forensic DNA testing without regard to the 2-year time limitation. It will not waive the 2-year time limit for all new trial limitations. Only motions for forensic DNA testing under limited circumstances will not subject to the 2-year time limitation. 
   This Federal rule change allows a defendants to utilize technology that was unavailable at the time of their conviction. The bill requires the defendant to show that identity was an issue in the trial which resulted in his conviction and that the evidence gathered by law enforcement was subject to a chain of custody sufficient to protect its integrity. 
   DNA technology has undergone rapid change that has increased its ability to obtain meaningful results from old evidence through the use of smaller and smaller samples. In the World Trade Center bombing case, DNA was recovered from saliva on the back of a postage stamp. 
   In the past, crime laboratories relied primarily on restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) testing, a technique that requires a rather large quantity of DNA (100,000 or more cells). Most laboratories are now shifting to using a test based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method that can generate reliable data from extremely small amounts of DNA in crime scene samples (50 to 100 cells). 
   Two States in the country, New York and Illinois, have laws mandating post-conviction DNA testing. The Illinois law has led to as many as six overturned sentences, including some murder charges. 
   When the measure was debated in the Illinois Legislature, some lawmakers raised concerns that allowing DNA-based appeals would lead to an avalanche of prisoners' demands for such tests. 
   But the response from experts is that such motions have not been excessive because prisoners who were justifiably convicted of crimes would have that DNA tests would only underscore their guilt. 
   Recently, a high-level study of a commission appointed by Attorney General Janet Reno has encouraged prosecutors to be more amenable to reopening cases where convictions might be overturned because of the use of DNA testing. The Innocence Project in New York estimates that 60 percent of the samples it sends out for testing come back in their clients' favor. 
   Justice Robert Jackson wrote some 40 years ago, ``[i]t must prejudice the occasional meritorious application to be buried in a flood of worthless ones. He who must search a haystack for a needle is likely to end up with the attitude that the needle is not worth the search.'' This bill will help make the hay stack smaller by separating out motions for new trial based on scientific evidence of actual innocence.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to change the mood a little bit and wish all of my colleagues a happy new year. Here we are on October 1, a new fiscal year. I wish to say it is a pleasure to be in the Senate debating the spending bills for our Nation, and it is a pleasure to have the resolution brought by my friend, the Senator from Oklahoma. 
   I have to agree with the Senator from Iowa; it is hard for some people to keep a straight face when the Congressional Budget Office reported just 2 days ago that the Republican leadership in the House and Senate is already $18 billion into the Social Security trust fund, and we are considering a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that says, by all means, we are never going to touch the Social Security trust fund. I don't think we can pull that off with a straight face. I think the American people are going to see through that. I think they understand what is happening. They understand we have not met our new year's deadline of October 1 and passed our spending bills. 
   But very few Congresses ever do, in all fairness. What is different about this Congress is, here we are on October 1 and we don't have a clue how to finish. We don't have a dialog between the President and Congress to try to bring us to a reasonable, bipartisan conclusion. Instead, as my old friend, Congressman DAVID OBEY of Wisconsin, used to say: ``Too many people are posing for holy pictures here.'' They want to be known as the person who ``saved'' this or that. 
   I think the American people expect candor and honesty from us. Candor and honesty would tell us several things. First, if we are so desperate now that we want to do across-the-board cuts in spending, why in the world were we ever discussing a $792 billion tax cut? That was the Republican mantra a few weeks ago. We have so much money, we can give away $792 billion. Well, the American people were  skeptical and folks on this side of the aisle were also skeptical, and they dropped the idea. But now they come back and say we are in such dire straits that we have to pass this sense-of-the-Senate resolution to discipline ourselves, keep our hands off Social Security. 
   Some of the schemes the Republican leaders are coming up with to try to end this budget debate are, frankly, not only greeted with skepticism by Democrats, but even by fellow Republicans. Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, yesterday, took a look at the House Republicans' proposal to end this budget impasse, and this is what he said:  
   I don't think they [Congress] ought to balance their budget on the backs of the poor. I am concerned for someone who is moving from near poverty to middle class.  
   The nominal front runner for President of the Republican Party has tossed congressional Republicans overboard because of their extremism and their budget policy. What is it they want to do? They want to cut the earned-income tax credit--a credit that goes to 20 million low-income working Americans to help them get by. That is their idea. Some would argue that is painless. I don't think anyone among the 20 million families would. They understand that can hurt a family when they are trying to meet the basics. 
   The balanced budget amendment which is being debated on the floor--and the reason I came over--passed in 1997, established caps on spending and wanted to make some cuts in areas such as Medicare to save money to move forward a balanced budget. It was a sensible thing to do. I supported it. I did not believe that I was in any way voting for the Ten Commandments. I thought instead I was voting for a reasonable legislative attempt to bring this budget into balance. 
   But I will tell you that at this point in time I don't believe Senators on either side of the aisle can ignore what is happening across America when it comes to health care. 
   I support the legislation introduced by Senator DASCHLE this morning. I have my own bill, introduced a few days ago, which is very similar which tries to come to the rescue of many of these hospitals across America. 
   I am worried about the sense-of-the-Senate resolution that is pending now before the Senate because it suggests we can ignore problems such as this. And we certainly cannot. 
   As I travel across my State, I find hospitals are really in trouble, particularly teaching hospitals. In Illinois, we have about 66 teaching hospitals. These are hospitals where young men and women are learning to be the doctors of tomorrow. It is not the most cost-efficient thing to do at a teaching hospital. You have to take extra time to teach, and many insurance companies don't want to pay for that now that Medicare is not reimbursing adequately for it. Hospitals come to me--St. Francis Hospital in Peoria, St. Johns Hospital in Springfield, hospitals in Chicago, and all across the State--and say: If we are going to meet our teaching mission, we need help. 
   I think Senator DASCHLE is right. Before this Congress pats itself on the back and goes home, we need to address this very serious problem--this problem that could affect the quality of health care, the quality of future doctors, and not only teaching hospitals as educational institutions but also because they take on the toughest cases. These are the academic and research hospitals which try to institute new procedures to deal with disease and try to find ways to cure people in imaginative ways. We don't want to in any way quell their enthusiasm and idealism. Unfortunately, these Medicare cuts are going to do just that. 
   I might also add that these teaching hospitals in my State account for 59 percent of charity care. In other words, the poorest of the poor who have no health insurance, who are not covered by Medicaid, who may be working poor, for example, come into these hospitals. They are taken care of free of charge. 
   If the Senator from Oklahoma thinks we can just walk away from this, make a 1-percent cut and go home and accept that as 
   the verdict of history, I think he is wrong. I think, frankly, whether you are in Texas, Oklahoma, Iowa, Nebraska, or Illinois, these hospitals are in trouble. Rural hospitals are in trouble, as well. 
   These hospitals have seen dramatic cutbacks in reimbursement. In my part of the world, these hospitals are a lifeline for farmers who are injured in their farming operations or in traffic accidents. These small hospitals keep people alive. If we turn our backs on them and say that because we are enmeshed in some theoretical budgetary debate we can ignore what is happening to these hospitals, we are making a serious mistake. Some of the hospitals may close, some will merge, some will be bought out, some may keep the sign on the door that you have seen for years, but what is going on inside the hospital is going to change. It is going to change for the worse instead of the better. 
   When we consider sense-of-the-Senate resolutions that try to strike some position of principle--and I respect the Senator from Oklahoma for his point of view--I say: Let's get down to the real world. 
   Let's be honest with the American people in the closing days of this budget debate. And I sincerely hope we are in the closing days of this debate. Let's tell them what is going on here. 
   We are no longer awash in red ink as we have been for 20 years. We are starting to move toward a surplus. The economy is strong. We feel good about that. We would borrow less from Social Security this year, if it is held to $5 billion, than probably any year in recent memory, and all of it will be paid back with the interest. We would use it to meet emergency needs of America--such as the farm crisis the Senators from Iowa and Nebraska have shown such leadership on--and we would be responsive to these crises at a time when what is at stake is, frankly, a major part of our economy and a major part of America. 
   Second, we would address the health care needs of this country. If we think we can go home and beat our chests about how pure we were in the budgetary process and don't lift a finger to help these hospitals that are struggling to survive, we will have made a very serious mistake. 
   I salute the Senator from Iowa and other colleagues, such as Senator BOXER of California and Senator MURRAY of Washington, who have tried to make sure this Labor-HHS bill does not lay off 29,000 teachers at the end of this school year. This bill would do it. The bill that some Republican Senators are so proud of would lay off 29,000 teachers across America because of cuts that are made in that bill and 1,200 teachers in my home State of Illinois. 
   Is that how we want to welcome the new century? Is that how we want to tell our kids we are going to greet a new generation, by laying off teachers and increasing class size? No. 
   There are important priorities for us to face. I sincerely hope before we get caught up in some theoretical debate, as Senator HARKIN has said, about whether the horse is out of the barn, that we talk about whether or not we are going to protect Americans in their homes and protect them in their communities. 
   I support Senator HARKIN's remarks. I support--maybe one of the few times--Gov. George W. Bush, who has reminded his congressional Republicans to keep their feet on the ground and to realize there are real people out there who, frankly, are going to be injured and damaged and their lives changed if congressional Republicans have their way in this budgetary process. Governor Bush is on the right track. We will stay tuned to see if he stays there. 
   I sincerely hope before we leave and before we think we have completed our responsibility that we will pass a budget we can explain to American families is in their best interests. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to call the attention of my colleagues to a column by Raymond Coffey which appeared in the Chicago Sun-Times on September 30, 1999. Mr. Coffey describes the efforts undertaken by Chicago White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf to improve literacy among children in Chicago's public schools. 
   Mr. Reinsdorf is assisting Chicago School Board President Gery Chico and Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas in the implementation and financing of Direct Instruction, a program that uses phonics to teach reading in the schools. This summer, Mr. Reinsdorf also designated White Sox manager Jerry Manuel and rookie sensation Chris Singleton to sign autographs for all fans donating books to Target Literacy, a joint initiative by Target stores and Sox Training Centers that is seeking to donate a million children's books to needy kids. Mr. Reinsdorf has also worked with Mr. Vallas to provide free tickets to public school students who have distinguished themselves through their academic achievements. 
   Mr. President, it is important to recognize individuals in our community who go beyond the call of duty to improve the lives of people who are less fortunate than them. Chicago can be proud of the winning efforts undertaken by Mr. Reinsdorf throughout the city. I ask that my colleagues join me in honoring Mr. Reinsdorf's charitable efforts by having Ray Coffey's column from the Chicago Sun-Times printed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.

   Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   I first acknowledge the leadership of my colleague from North Dakota, Senator DORGAN, who has called the attention of this Congress and this Senate to this important issue. I hope his efforts will prevail in bringing this issue to the floor of the Senate. 
   In my lifetime, it is interesting to look back and reflect on things which were so commonplace and now are so rare. I can recall, as a child in the 1950's, in my classroom when we were being instructed about the need to ``duck and cover,'' the possibility that there might be an attack on the United States of America. That was generated by the fact that the Soviets had detonated a nuclear weapon. We were technically emerging into a cold war, and there was a belief that we had to be prepared for the possibility of an attack. 
   In my hometown of Springfield, IL, when my wife and I bought a little house, the first house we ever owned--1600 South Lincoln Avenue; an appropriate name in Springfield, IL--we moved into the house and went in the basement and were startled to find a fallout shelter that had been built to specifications. Someone had believed in the 1960s this was an appropriate thing to put in a house in Springfield, IL, because of the possibility that we may face some sort of attack, a nuclear attack on the United States. 
   You can remember the monthly air raid sirens that used to call our attention to the fact that we had a system to warn all of America of a potential attack. You may remember, not that many years ago, movies on television and long debates about a ``nuclear winter,'' what would happen with a nuclear holocaust. 
   That conversation was part of daily life in America for decades. Then with the end of the cold war, and the disintegration of the Soviet Union, and the Warsaw Pact nations not only leaving the Soviet domination but gravitating toward the West--with countries such as Poland and Hungary and Czechoslovakia coming to join NATO--many of us have been lulled into a false sense of security that the threat of nuclear weapons is no longer something we should take seriously. In fact, we should. 
   In fact, we are reminded, from time to time, that the so-called nuclear club--the nations which have nuclear capability--continues to grow. That is why this particular treaty and this debate are so important. 
   One of the most compelling threats we in this country face today is the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. 
   Threat assessments regularly warn us of the possibility that North Korea, Iran, Iraq, or some other nation may acquire or develop nuclear weapons. Our most basic interest in relations with Russia today is to see that it controls its nuclear weapons and technology and that Russian scientists do not come to the aid of would-be nuclear proliferators. In other words, in a desperate state of affairs, with the Russian economy, we are concerned that some people will decide they have a marketable idea, that they can go to some rogue nation and sell the idea of developing a nuclear weapon, adding another member to the nuclear club, increasing the instability in this world. 
   Congress spends millions of dollars to fight nuclear proliferation, to stop the spread of nuclear weapons worldwide, and to support the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program. 
   For the past several years, I have been involved in an Aspen Institute exchange, which has opened my eyes to the need for our concern in this area. Senator LUGAR is a regular participant as well, and Senator Nunn has been there in the past, when we have met with members of the Russian Duma and leaders from that country and have learned of the very real concern they have of the stockpile of nuclear weapons still sitting in the old Soviet Union, a stockpile of weapons which, unfortunately for us, has to be minded all the time for fear that the surveillance, the inspection, and the safety would degrade to the point that there might be an accidental detonation. Those are the very real problems we face, and we vote on these regularly. 
   Yet we in the Senate, despite all of these realities, have had languished in the committee one of the most effective tools for fighting nuclear proliferation--the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, a treaty which, as the Senator from North Dakota indicated, has been ratified by over 130 nations but not by the United States of America. 
   The idea of banning nuclear tests is not a new one. It is one of the oldest items on the nuclear arms control agenda. Test bans were called for by both Presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy. Steps were taken toward a ban in the Limited Test Ban Treaty of 1963, but other incremental steps were eschewed in favor of a comprehensive treaty. 
   The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is a key piece of the broader picture of nuclear nonproliferation and arms control. Consider this: When nonnuclear countries--those that don't have nuclear weapons--agree they are not going to have a nuclear arsenal and sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, an essential part of that bargain for the smaller nations, the nonnuclear powers, and those that have it, was that nuclear countries were going to control and reduce the number of nuclear weapons. 
   An integral part of that effort is this treaty. It is virtually impossible to make qualitative improvements in nuclear weapons or develop them for the first time without testing. Just a few months ago, the Senate overwhelmingly voted to reorganize the Department of Energy because of our deep concern about what secrets may have been stolen from our nuclear labs. The potential damage from this espionage is disturbing. 
   In the case of China, the entry into force of this treaty could help mitigate the effect of the loss of our nuclear secrets. More than old computer codes and blueprints would be needed to deploy more advanced nuclear weapons. Extensive 
   testing would be required. In the cases of India and Pakistan, U.S. ratification of this treaty would pressure both countries to sign the treaty, as they pledged to do following their nuclear test last year. 
   In fact, the leadership role of the United States is essential to encourage the ratification of the treaty by many other nations. If the leading nuclear power in the world, the United States of America, fails to ratify this treaty to stop nuclear testing, why should any other country? The United States has a responsibility of moral leadership. Many who take such pride in our Nation and its role and voice in the world tremble when faced with the burden of leadership. The burden of leadership comes down to our facing squarely the need to ratify this treaty. 
   The United States has declared that its own nuclear testing program has been discontinued, but it is still absolutely in our national interest to be part of a multinational monitoring and verification regime. That way we can shape and benefit from that same regime. The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty says if the treaty has not been entered into force 3 years after its being open for signing, the states that have ratified it may convene a special conference to decide by consensus what measures consistent with international law can be taken to facilitate its entry into force. 
   Only those states that have ratified it would be given full voting privileges. The special conference is going to take place this fall. It will set up monitoring and verification of nuclear testing worldwide so the components will  be operating by the time the treaty does enter into force. This regime will include the International Data Center and many other elements that are important for success. 
   The United States should be part of that process, but it will not be, because the Senate has not voted on this treaty. This country certainly conducts its own monitoring for nuclear tests, but if we participate in an international regime, our country can benefit from a comprehensive international system. It is important to recall that if China or Russia were to resume testing, the United States, under this treaty, would have the right to withdraw and resume our own, if that is necessary for our national defense. 
   If the United States does not ratify the treaty in the first place, however, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty may never enter into force. We would be faced with the prospect, once again, of a major nuclear power's resuming nuclear testing. When President Eisenhower and President Kennedy called for a nuclear test ban, a major impetus was the public outcry over environmental damage caused by these tests. 
   I ask unanimous consent to print in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD at this point a letter I received from major national environmental organizations supporting the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and decrying the environmental damage to both our national security and our planet if the treaty is not ratified.

   Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the chairman of the subcommittee, the Senator from Pennsylvania. 
   This is a difficult choice which is offered to us by the Senator from Arkansas in terms of transferring money because hardly any Member of the Senate will argue that community health centers should have more resources. We opened a new one in my hometown. It is very important in many rural areas. In smalltown America, these community health centers provide health care that is not otherwise available. So in that regard I applaud his effort. I only take exception to his source. 
   The National Labor Relations Board has been a pain in the side of big business for over 60 years because it is a mechanism for dealing with disputes between employers and employees and employees and labor unions. 
   There has been an effort by those who cannot repeal the law creating this agency to reduce the resources of the agency and make the delays in the backlog so insufferable that the agency virtually was stopped in its tracks. Not that many years ago there was a hard freeze on this agency which resulted in slowing down the process for years. 
   As I travel around the State of Illinois, and I listen to my colleagues from other parts of the Nation, I find that if you are trying to organize a plant, for example, to bring in a labor union, and there is some dispute about whether both sides are following the law, it is almost impossible to turn to the NLRB and expect a timely decision on violations of the law. As a consequence, the whole effort of collective bargaining, which has been a recognized legal right in this country for decades, is jeopardized because of efforts to strangle this agency. 
   This is not a voluntary reduction in NLRB funds. This is an effort to stop its mission. Frankly, I think that is a serious mistake because we understand as well that some of the rights that are protected by the National Labor Relations Board were rights that were fought for over the years by many people who gave their blood and their lives to make certain that the concept principle of collective bargaining would be recognized. 
   Listen to this about the agency backlog currently facing the NLRB. Despite  the agency's success in screening out tens of thousands of public inquiries and voluntarily resolving the vast majority of its representation in unfair labor practice, backlogs continue to grow with no concomitant increases in staffing. 
   I salute the chairman of the subcommittee, the Senator from Pennsylvania, and his counterpart on the Democratic side, the Senator from Iowa. They have recognized it and put $25 million into the NLRB. 
   When you look to where this money is being spent, it is for things that are absolutely essential--training the people who work there, the attorneys, the hearing officers, and the like to make sure people get a fair chance and their day in court. 
   The Senator from Arkansas closes out that possibility. He takes the $25 million away. 
   Some of the funds here are used to modernize computer equipment to deal with the Y2K problem. The Senator from Arkansas, by cutting $25 million, makes that more difficult to achieve. A lot of the money is used for basic administration of the agency, relocating people where they are needed, where the workload is growing. The Senator from Arkansas steps in the path of that. I suggest to those listening to the debate on this amendment, don't just dwell on where the money is going. Look to the source of the money. 
   The Senator from Pennsylvania very eloquently has presented the fact that the backlogs are still a problem and, if we adopt the approach of the Senator from Arkansas, we are going to be, if not turning out the lights, dimming the lights in a very important agency where justice is part of the agenda; in fact, it is the reason for the existence of the agency. 
   Looking at what the NLRB has accomplished in a very short period of time, one understands why they need to be in business and fully staffed. Last year, the National Labor Relations Board cases resulted in reinstatement offers to 4,500 American employees who alleged unlawful firing or layoff. They also had cases that resulted in back pay and other monetary recovery to more than 24,000 American workers totaling more than $92 million. They also held nearly 3,800 representation elections affecting a quarter million American workers. 
   What the Senator from Arkansas does with his amendment is restrict the power of this agency to do its job, to say to America's workers from one coast to the other, they are not going to be able to call this agency and expect it to be there and be responsive. 
   If you decide in a democratic election by majority vote at your business to bargain collectively and to seek representation of a union, the Senator from Arkansas makes sure your telephone call goes unanswered at NLRB when you need a helping hand to resolve a dispute between employer and employee. If you are someone fired and fired illegally or unlawfully, who turns to the Federal legal network, the National Labor Relations Board, and says, I was discriminated against, I was unlawfully fired, the Senator from Arkansas makes certain your telephone call is not likely to be answered. 
   Mr. President, $25 million is taken out of the agency, including money for computer modernization. On the whole question of whether or not you are going to have union representation in a free and democratic process and whether you have the National Labor Relations Board to make sure both sides follow the rules, the Senator from Arkansas, with his amendment, takes the $25 million out of this agency which is necessary for them to keep up with their workload. 
   I say those who oppose the National Labor Relations Board and want to close it down should do it in a clean vote. Put your amendment on the floor to close it down, have it up or down, and decide whether American workers will have this forum for protection or not. But to bleed off from this agency $25 million they need to protect workers across the United States in the name of helping community health centers is a tactic that should be exposed for what it is. It is an effort to take away from a very important agency the resources they need to respond to the requests of American workers across the Nation. 
   I might add for those who think this is another labor amendment or antilabor amendment, those who dispute the treatment under their labor agreements, employees who believe labor organizations are not treating them fairly, have the National Labor Relations Board to turn to as well; it is not just the private sector companies. 
   American workers' rights are at stake here. This is not just a question of health care in rural areas, which I support; it is a question of whether or not we will protect the hard-fought-for rights of American workers across the Nation. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the efforts of the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. SPECTER, to table this motion, to stand by this subcommittee, and make sure the National Labor Relations Board has the resources it needs to do the job that is very important to American workers. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DURBIN. I am also a member of the Appropriations Committee, and, like the Senator, I was disappointed yesterday. We have a chance with this appropriations bill to define our priority and to say to the American people whether or not we think education is important. I was startled--I think the Senator from Washington, as a former classroom teacher, was surprised as well--when a successful program to reduce class size that put thousands of teachers in classrooms across America was not funded in this legislation. 
   In my home State of Illinois, we will lose up to 1,200 teachers; nationwide, 29,000 teachers. It strikes me as not only odd but maybe a little bit embarrassing that we are saying to the American people as we start this new century, the first thing we will do for education----

   Mr. DURBIN. I was reaching the interrogatory phase of this statement, and it was just about to come to me when the Senator reminded me of the Senate rules. I thank him for that. 
   Here is the question: Should we in the Senate be kicking off a new century by announcing to America, when it comes to education, we will lay off 1,200 teachers in Illinois? 
   I will ask another question: Should we announce to America that in terms of education as a priority in the new century, we will kick it off by laying off 29,000 teachers? Would the Senator from Washington respond to that question.

   Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator from Washington: We are struggling to encourage people to become teachers because so many of our current teachers are retiring. Would it not be a disincentive if there were uncertainty about the commitment by the Federal Government for a program to reduce class size? 
   If the Republican appropriations bill on education passes and lays off 29,000 teachers, what kind of impact will that have on a young person who is trying to decide whether to take up teaching as a profession?

   Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask the Senator from Washington the following question. It was my understanding it was the President's goal to try to recruit and train some 100,000 teachers across America in order to reduce the class size in virtually every community and school district in need of that.

   The Senator from Washington is not only a leader in education but is a former classroom teacher. I don't know that many of us--I certainly cannot--in the Senate can claim to have that background when we address this important issue. 
   So I would like to ask the Senator from Washington, as perhaps one of the  few, if not the only, classroom teachers on the floor of the Senate, whether there is any importance to the President's priority of saying, we are going to try to fund 100,000 new teachers and reduce class size, as opposed to some other way this money might be spent?

Is it not true--I would like to ask further of the Senator from Washington--that most, if not all, of us believe there should be accountability in education, accountability by students with their testing, by teachers in terms of the results, by parents in terms of their involvement, and that if we accept the Republican approach, which basically says, let's block grant the money, let's give it in large sums to the school districts, and not hold them accountable in terms of teachers and class size, we are not meeting this national goal?

The last question which I will ask of the Senator from Washington: Is it true, you are on the floor leading this debate because of one simple request, and that is that the Senate go on record--yes or no--with a rollcall vote printed for the RECORD to see whether or not we are going to continue this program to move toward 100,000 new teachers in America and lower class sizes, and at this point in time--I hope it changes--there is resistance to that up-or-down vote from the Republican majority?

   Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Washington. I support her amendment. 
   The basic issue is this: Will we give the pink slip to 29,000 teachers at the end of this school year, teachers who were hired to use their professional skills, to have reduced class size which helps kids along in kindergarten, first, and second grades? 
   The Republicans say yes; the Democrats say no. The Republicans say: Give them the pink slips. Give the money to the school districts. Let them do with it what they like. 
   I think Senator MURRAY, in supporting this amendment which I support as well, is supporting a concept that is tested and proven. 
   During the course of this debate, we have been visited in the galleries by many students--hundreds of them, perhaps. I think if you ask each of them whether it was a better classroom experience when they were in a small class where they got to know the teacher and worked with them or in some large study hall with 200 or 300 students, the answer is obvious. It is obvious on this side of the aisle but, unfortunately, not on the other side of the aisle. 
   The chart the Senator from Tennessee brought up must be passed to every Senator when they are elected. It shows how bad America's schools are and compares various grade levels of different nations and the United States. I have seen the chart over and over again. It is a chart they use to rationalize vouchers, taking money out of public schools and giving it to a few kids to go to private schools. It is a chart they use to 
   say public education doesn't work in America today. 
   There is something fundamentally flawed in that presentation. Virtually every other country we are compared to uses a selective system of bringing kids to school. But not in America. Our schools are open to everybody regardless of color, regardless of economic circumstance, regardless of whether you are gifted or have a learning disability. Yes, some of our test scores are  lower because our school doors are open to everyone. Some of the other countries, which the Republicans point to with pride, are very selective. There is the class that will become the leaders and the class that will always be the lower-class workers. That is not America. I hope it never is. 
   This commitment to this amendment is a commitment to public education, to 90 percent of the kids in America who go to public schools. I went to private schools, parochial schools, as did my kids, but I believed my first obligation in my community and in the Senate was to public education. That is why I support Senator MURRAY. 
   For those who say we don't care about or don't trust local educational officials, nothing could be further from the truth. Despite everything we do in this appropriations bill, 93 percent of the funds spent on local schools will come from local sources and will be administered by local officials, as it should be. The question that Senator MURRAY poses with this amendment is whether the Federal Government will continue to show leadership in certain areas where we have had proven success. 
   Looking back we can see it: vocational education, the School Lunch Program, title I for kids falling behind, the IDEA program for kids with disabilities, the National Defense Education Act, the Pell grants and others for higher education. We pick and choose those things that work at the Federal level and do our level best to work with local school districts to use them at the local level. 
   That is what the Murray amendment is all about. 
   Yes, we trust local officials, but we want to make certain they are held accountable to produce the teachers and reduce the class sizes that we know has proven results. 
   I say to the Senator from Washington, who offers an alternative: Have faith in the public school system, please. Have faith, if teachers are in the classroom with a smaller number of students they can succeed; kids that might otherwise fall behind have a fighting chance. 
   I close by saying it is sad, in one respect, that this is what the educational debate in Washington, DC, comes down to, a matter of 29,000 teachers. The No. 1 issue for families across America deserves a bigger debate and a lot more attention from the Federal Government. So far, this Congress, as we have seen in previous Congresses under Republican control, has continued to shortchange education. We cannot do that except at our own national peril. I support the Murray amendment.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we are facing a deadline this week--October 1. Every family in America knows about deadlines: April 15, you had better get your taxes in. A deadline is coming for shopping for Christmas, for Hanukkah. We are faced with many deadlines. October 1 is another deadline; that is our fiscal year. If Congress does nothing else during the course of a session, we are supposed to pass spending bills so when the fiscal year starts, the agencies know how much money they have and can go about the business of conducting their affairs and managing the Government. 
   Now, I will have to be honest with you; in the 17 years I have been on Capitol Hill, in the House and Senate, rarely, if ever, has any party in control of the Senate or the House really met that deadline, had everything in place by October 1. Sometimes it takes a little extra time to put it together. But I would have to tell you that in my experience on the Hill, I can never recall a time when we reached October 1, as we will this week, with such chaos. There appears to be no plan in place, no conversation between the leaders on Capitol Hill and 
   the White House, and we will be asked today to vote on what is called a continuing resolution; that is, an extension of about 3 weeks so we can continue the business of Government while the leaders of the House and Senate get down to the business of leading. I hope that happens because, frankly, to date, we have seen precious little leadership when it comes to the important issues facing our country. 
   I am going to yield the floor at this point to my colleague from the State  of Washington, Mrs. MURRAY, who is a member of the Labor-HHS appropriations subcommittee, a very important subcommittee when it comes to spending money for education. She comes to the Senate floor speaking not only as a Senator from Washington but as a former classroom teacher. So her perspective on education and what we are doing to either meet our obligations or fail to meet them is especially important. 
   At this point, I reserve the remainder of my time and yield to the Senator from Washington.

   Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair for that information. 
   Four years ago, we had a Government shutdown. Congress failed so miserably in its responsibilities to fund the agencies of Government, we actually shut down agencies. We sent Federal employees home. They were paid later on even for the time they missed. We barred the door when they wanted to come back to work, and the Republican leaders in Congress said: We're going to prove a point. 
   They certainly did. They proved they could not pass the spending bills on time; they could not maintain the orderly flow of Government services to the people of America. That was 4 years ago. 
   You would think that over time the Republican leadership in the House and Senate would have learned from that experience. Last year, we had a little different experience. In the closing minutes of the session, we were presented with a 4,000-page budget bill, an appropriations bill, which literally no Member of Congress was able to read, and we were told: Take it or leave it. We either pass this and go home or sit around here for weeks, if not months. 
   The bill passed. A lot of us, with regret, voted for it saying: What is the alternative? 
   This year, we are going into a new phase, a new chapter in the Republican congressional leadership when it comes to budgetary responsibility. October 1--this week on Friday--is the new fiscal year. It is, in fact, Republican Responsibility Day. As leaders in Congress, they are responsible for passing spending bills or at least charting out a course so we can see an orderly process to result in spending and budget bills that do serve America. 
   As I stand here today, we do not have it. We will pass a continuing resolution which says we will continue Government for another 3 weeks, with no end in sight. Neither the leaders on Capitol Hill nor anyone on the Republican side have suggested how we are going to end this. 
   Instead, to quote a friend of mine with whom I served in the House, Congressman DAVE OBEY of Wisconsin, we hear the Republican leadership posing for holy pictures as they stand and say: We will not breach the caps on spending which led to the balanced budget. And we certainly will never touch the Social Security trust fund. 
   The facts do not back that up. What we find is they have broken the caps already. They have already reached deep into the Social Security trust fund to fund their favorite projects, and we still have no end in sight. 
   It is one thing to beat your chest and say you are going to stand up for certain principles, but it is hollow rhetoric when you cannot produce the spending bills. 
   You heard the Senator from Washington and the Senator from California. Imagine, if you will, in this time of prosperity, when the Republicans have said we are so awash in money in Washington that we can offer a $792 billion tax cut--and thank goodness the President did not sign that and explained it to the American people--at the same time the Republicans are calling for a massive tax cut, primarily for wealthy people, they cannot fund education, sending 29,000 teachers home. 
   Imagine families across America that get a note from the school saying: Mrs. Smith will not be here next year. She may 
   not be here next month because Congress failed to continue a program to provide teachers in our school, teachers to make sure that class sizes are smaller. 
   Is that what this is all about, that we have gone on for month after weary month with all of this rhetoric in Washington, and at the end of the day we are going to send 29,000 teachers home and say to the schools: You have no choice but to increase the enrollment in each one of your classrooms. 
   That is as good as we can do for all the billions of dollars that we have to spend. I don't think so. I certainly hope the Republican leadership will sit down with the Democrats and the President and work out something that is good for the Nation and good for families across our country that are concerned about quality schools and quality health care. 
   I visited St. Francis Hospital in Peoria, IL, yesterday, a wonderful hospital that has faced Medicare cuts that, frankly, threaten this teaching hospital, this safety-net hospital, another item we have to address and should address before we go home. 
   I didn't run for the House and for the Senate to come here and punch the clock on my pension. I came here to work on the issues that are important to people in Illinois and across the Nation. To date, this Congress has failed miserably when it comes to addressing those issues, whether it is education or health care, the basic things we expect. 
   We had the Columbine School massacre a few months ago; it shocked the Nation. We passed a juvenile justice bill because Vice President GORE came and broke the tie. We said we need sensible gun control, background checks, to make sure fugitives, felons, and stalkers don't get their hands on guns. We passed that bill over to the House, and it disappeared, never seen again. 
   We are now in another school year. We still want safe schools. We still want sensible gun control. This Congress has failed miserably when it comes to bringing that issue through, passing a law, and sending it to the President. It hasn't happened. 
   Time and again we have made the speeches; we have punched the clock; we have gone home without meeting our responsibilities. If last year's Congress was a do-nothing Congress, this Congress has done less, less to meet the challenges the American people have given to us, challenges which include a responsible budget, education, and health care, challenges which include, of course, a Patients' Bill of Rights so those who have health insurance through managed care companies have a decision made by a doctor and not by an insurance bureaucrat.

   Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts, not only for his statement but also for his leadership on this issue. I do not think there is another Member of Congress, let alone the Senate, who could rival his commitment to education over the years. 
   I am happy it has come to this vote because I think between these two resolutions--one offered by the Republican majority leader, Mr. LOTT, and one offered, as well, on the Democratic side, an alternative by the Democratic minority leader, Senator TOM DASCHLE--we see a difference in approach and a difference in attitude when it comes to education. 
   It is curious, as the Senator from Massachusetts has noted, that we have left the education issue for last. After we have talked about every other appropriations bill, some 12 other bills, we are finally going to get around to talking about education. Our human experience tells us we usually leave to last the thing we do not want to do. But why in the world would this Congress not want to deal with education? What is our reluctance to deal with an issue which, on a Republican, Democratic, and independent basis, is judged to be the No. 1 issue in America today? The No. 1 issue with American families is dead last when it comes to Senate consideration. 
   We are only a few days away from the beginning of a new fiscal year. I will be very honest and concede that rarely, if ever, does Congress have all of its work done on time so we start October 1 with all the new spending bills. But I can never recall a time in the 17 years I have served on Capitol Hill when Congress has been in such utter chaos as we approach October 1. 
   If the Republican leadership has some master plan they have been holding back on how we are going to meet our responsibilities and do the right thing for the American people, I hope they will unveil it in the next 4 days because October 1 is Republican Responsibility Day. The leaders in Congress, Republican leaders, are responsible for, at a minimum, telling the American people what their plan is so we do not have another horrendous Government shutdown and we meet the priorities on which the vast majority of American families agree. 
   I look at these two resolutions on education and I can clearly tell there is a difference of opinion between the two political parties about an issue where there should be so much common ground. First, Senator LOTT's S. Res. 186--I assume it will be the first one voted on, but whether it is or not, it is interesting to note Senator LOTT goes through and recounts some of the things that have been done in funding education and finds many shortcomings with our public education system. Ninety percent of the children in America go to public schools, 10 percent to private schools and home schools, and I concede in many public school districts and systems there are schools and classes and teachers that, frankly, should be better. I think we ought to strive for accountability when it comes to education but also for a commitment to education from this Nation. 
   I think Senator LOTT, however, overlooks some of the more important progress that has been made in public education. I note that student achievement on a nationwide basis is definitely improving. Average reading scores have increased from 1994 to 1998 in all grades tested--4, 8, and 12. It is interesting to me the Republican Party generally opposes the idea of national testing so schools can be held accountable. They think this is all local and it should be done locally, 
   though the students, when they graduate, are going to compete far beyond their localities, probably their States, and maybe nationally or globally. But when we look at these tests we find things are getting better. 
   We have seen student access to modern computers increasing significantly, and we know the partnership we have been striving to establish between the Federal Government and local school districts has improved reading scores in many districts. In my home State of Illinois, which I am honored to represent in the Senate, we have done remarkable things in the public school  system. A system written off by Secretary of Education William Bennett a few years ago has now become a model for the Nation. It is because of a partnership--Federal, State, and local partnership. There is nothing inherently wrong with that. In fact, we are proving, in Chicago, that partnerships can make a difference. 
   So when Senator LOTT, in his resolution, says Congress has to recognize the need for significant reform in light of troubling statistics, I think this is clearly a case where we are either going to light a candle or curse the darkness. In Senator LOTT's situation I am afraid the candle isn't lit. 
   What we have in the resolution, in the ``resolved'' clause, which is where you get down to business, very little is said. Let me read it to you. This is Senator LOTT's Republican resolution:  
   ..... it is the sense of the Senate that--this Congress has taken strong steps to reform our Nation's educational system and allowed States, local schools and parents more flexibility and authority over their children's education.......  
   And he goes on in the second paragraph:  
   The reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 will enable this Congress to continue its efforts to send decision making back to States, local schools, and families.  
   What a contrast with the resolution that is being supported by Senator KENNEDY and offered by Senator DASCHLE which, for two pages, goes into specific detail as to what this Congress needs to do before we go home if we are going to be able to face families across America and say: Yes, we get the message. Education is critically important. 
   In the Daschle Democratic resolution, unlike the Republican resolution, he speaks out specifically for us to reduce class sizes so teachers in the early grades can pay more attention to kids who need a helping hand; 
   to increase support for the development and training of professional teachers, and that is something we know we will need as teachers are retiring and as school enrollments continue to work. 
   More afterschool programs, an issue I feel very strongly about. We can lament violence in our schools; we can lament juvenile crime; but if we do not invest money in afterschool programs, it is easily understood why these problems get worse instead of better. 
   An increase, and not a decrease, in funding for the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act of 1994. 
   An increase in funding so kids who come from the toughest neighborhoods and families with the most problems have a chance to succeed. 
   More money for kids who are disabled, so they will have a chance to prove themselves. 
   More money for Pell grants. Boy, if you are a parent who has sent any of your kids through college, you understand what kids coming out of college face: A diploma in one hand and the equivalent of a mortgage in the other; $20,000, $30,000, $40,000 for a bachelor's degree. If we do not accept the commitment that Senator DASCHLE challenges us to accept, these kids will have more and more debt when they graduate. That is clearly something we do not want to see. 
   We want to make certain that kids, particularly from working families, come out of the college experience and are able to take a good job and not worry, first and foremost, about paying back their school loans which have greatly increased in size. 
   The Daschle resolution calls for more money for technology in classrooms; also, that the school facilities be modernized. We have seen too many schools that are ramshackle and falling down. 
   What a clear difference between the Daschle resolution, which speaks in specific terms about the challenges ahead in education, and the resolution offered by Senator LOTT, who is now on the floor, which points, I guess, with some pride, to passing the Ed-Flex bill, which I supported, but says, I guess, in a way, that Congress has already taken strong steps. I think the steps taken by Congress can be a lot stronger and more specific. As we face Responsibility Day, October 1, just a few days away, the question most American families will ask us is, Have we addressed education? 
   I will close with this thought. At this moment in our history, with our economy the strongest, many say, that it has ever been, with more people, particularly in high-income categories, realizing more income and a better quality of life, with the general economy having weathered, endured, and experienced the most prosperous decade in our history, at a time when we are talking about a surplus in our Federal Treasury when only a few months ago we talked about deficits, at a time when the majority party, the Republican Party, has said, we have so much money in Washington, we have to give $792 billion away in a tax cut primarily to wealthy people, I have to say: Before we do that, let's get things right when it comes to education. I want to say to the American people: We got the message; we will start the 21st century committed to education to make sure the American century, the 20th century, is followed by the next American century, the 21st century. 
   We will not achieve that by holding to the standards 
   suggested in S. Res. 186. It is weak soup. Instead, we should be dealing with Senator DASCHLE's resolution which calls on this Congress in specific terms to meet its obligation not only to the families across America and the voters who sent us here but the future generations who count on us to be prepared to put education as our highest priority.

   Mr. DURBIN. It is a curious thing, I respond to the Senator from Massachusetts, that the Republican Party--and I believe it might have been in the party platform; it certainly has been a position taken by many of their prominent Presidential candidates that we should abolish the U.S. Department of Education and, in abolishing that Department of Education, give back responsibility for education to the local school districts and families. 
   The local school districts and the families should have the premier voice when it comes to educational decisions. But we should not overlook the fact, as the Senator from Massachusetts notes, that there are responsibilities we in Washington should accept. And one of those responsibilities is to gauge the demands of the global economy and to make certain that, as a nation, we are moving forward with the kind of educational system in general that will prepare kids for the future. 
   I have yet to run into a school district in my home State of Illinois that does not want to have Federal assistance in meeting that responsibility. I concur with the Senator from Massachusetts that the Daschle resolution really deals with that in specific terms. The Lott resolution, unfortunately, does not. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the KERRY amendment. Let me explain that, as a member of the Budget Committee, I understand the burden this appropriations subcommittee faced. The budget allocations were entirely inadequate for the demands of this very important budget--the Veterans' Administration, the National Aeronautic and Space Administration, and certainly for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, as well as other agencies. 
   The chairman of the subcommittee and Senator MIKULSKI of Maryland have done the very best they could under the circumstances to try to address these critical national needs. I believe Senator KERRY and others have said perhaps one of the areas that really needs more attention when this bill goes to conference relates to the section 8 voucher program--a program which takes working families and gives them a helping hand to find affordable housing. 
   It is hard to imagine why, in this time of economic prosperity, we would have people still searching for housing. In my home State of Illinois, in the city of Chicago, we have seen this booming economy bring rents up even higher, and so working families, particularly with the low minimum wage, which has not been addressed for several years, are striving to do their very best for their children while rents are rising in an otherwise prosperous economy. 
   In the city of Chicago, we can have some pretty powerful winters. I can recall not too long ago visiting the flat of a working family. The man had recently become unemployed, his wife was on dialysis, and he had two small children. They had no heat in the apartment they were living in. They were all huddled in one room with a space heater. All of the plumbing had frozen. It was a miserable living condition. They were within minutes of the loop of Chicago. 
   I think it is an illustration of families that are struggling to provide decent, safe, healthy housing for their families under the worst of circumstances. 
   This bill does not provide any additional money for section 8 vouchers. For over 20 years, we have put more money into section 8 vouchers to try to keep up with the demand of those who cannot find adequate housing. 
   I might also add that we are now going through a revolution in thinking on public housing, which probably started several decades ago in the city of St. Louis--represented by the chairman of this subcommittee--when they decided the vertical slums, the public housing projects, were to be torn down, and they were to try to build things which were more habitable and housing which was more decent for the families that needed them. 
   We are doing the same thing in Illinois and in the city of Chicago. But as these high-rise, public housing units are torn down, the people living there need a place to live. Section 8 vouchers give them money in hand to supplement with their own money to find something in the community. When this bill provides no new money for section 8, it reduces, if not eliminates, the possibility that these families can find that kind of housing. 
   When you take a look at the situation in the State of Illinois, when it comes to housing, it is an illustration, as my colleague from New Jersey noted earlier, of the problems they face. The number of families with unmet worst case needs for housing in the metropolitan area of Chicago is 151,000 families. The average time on waiting lists for public housing and section 8 vouchers in Illinois for public housing is 16 months. If you wanted to get into a public housing unit, the average wait is 16 months, if you are eligible. If you apply for a section 8 voucher to stay in the private market and rent a flat or a unit or an apartment, you wait 63 months--over 5 years to qualify for section 8 vouchers. 
   That will get worse if in conference we don't put money in for section 8 vouchers. 
   In addition, the number of families on waiting lists in the metropolitan area of Chicago is 31,000 families looking for public housing, and 30,000 for section 8 vouchers. If we don't put additional money for section 8 in this bill in conference, the number of families in my State that will not receive assistance for section 8 is over 12,733 families that, frankly, will be out on their own. 
   Why do we have such a crisis at this time of otherwise economic prosperity? Because, frankly, despite the fact that between 1977 and 1994 the number of HUD-assisted households grew by 2.6 million--an average of 204,000 additional households each year from 1977 through 1983, and an additional 107,000 households in 1984 to 1994--in 1995, we saw a historic reversal in Federal housing policy, freezes on new housing vouchers, despite a growing need. 
   If you travel through some cities in this country, even our 
   Nation's Capital of Washington, in the cold of winter, you will see homeless people. Some of these folks have serious personal problems. Others are desperate to find housing. What we do in this bill relates directly to the relief they need. 
   I salute the Senator from Massachusetts for his leadership. I hope in conference the Senators from Missouri and Maryland and other members of this subcommittee can find the resources and wherewithal to increase the number of section 8 vouchers in this bill. 
   The last point I will make is this: This bill also eliminates 400 employees in HUD for community builders who are generally young people who have decided to give 2 years of their life to leave a job or career and dedicate it to public service. These are people working in communities throughout the United States to provide housing and counseling, and their counseling is very good. 
   Ernst & Young, a very well-respected organization, did an audit of the Community Builders Program in HUD, and didn't stay in Washington to speak for the bureaucrats here. They went out in the communities and asked the people who served. They applauded community builders. They said community builders work. These are people doing a good job for the government, people with idealism and energy whom we  need to make this already good department an even better agency. 
   It is sad to me this appropriations bill eliminates these 400 community builders, and will close down offices in some 81 cities across America. 
   That is a disservice to the people who truly need their services. I hope in conference the conferees will reconsider this. 
   Let me close by commending Senator MIKULSKI and Senator BOND for their hard work. I understand the burden they face with the budget allocation. But we certainly have a burden, too, and the burden is to face the needs of working people who need help to find decent housing for their families. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from South Dakota. Of course, I join him in his tribute to our colleague from the State of Massachusetts. Senator KENNEDY has been a leader on education as long as he has served in the Senate. His speech about the demands of education in the 21st century and how we in Congress have failed to meet those obligations, I think, will become part of the permanent record of this body, and they should inspire us. 
   My question to the Senator from South Dakota is, if you go across America--any pollster, Republican, Democrat, or otherwise--and ask American families what is the No. 1 priority, they say the first priority in their lives is education--over and over and over again. It is almost a reflex response from American families. 
   I ask the Senator from South Dakota the following: How can this be the first priority of American families and the dead-last priority in this Congress? The Senator from South Dakota eloquently spoke earlier about the use of this budget for schools as an ``ATM machine.'' For months, we have seen appropriations subcommittee after subcommittee pulling billions of dollars out of the education budget for a variety of uses. Some of them are very good. But I question whether any of them meet the level of importance of education to the people of America and to the families. 
   I ask the Senator how we can find ourselves in these predicaments where the speeches say education is a first priority, the people say education is a first priority, and this Senate, this Congress makes it dead last in the priority list.

   Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield again. I ask the Senator this: This country has seen, unfortunately, episodes of violence in schools. It is a national tragedy. Columbine High School transfixed America as we focused on safety in schools. We considered a juvenile justice bill on the floor of the Senate and passed it, thanks to the vote of Vice President Gore, which would move us forward toward making our society and our schools safer. It died hopelessly in the House. We are still waiting for any indication of life on this bill. 
   Is it not true that if the Republican budget cuts go through on education, we will not only be cutting the money for schools to use for safe and drug-free schools, but we also will be dramatically reducing afterschool program opportunities? We don't live in a society any longer of Ozzie and Harriet and the Brady Bunch. Kids get off school at 3 o'clock and nobody is home. Are they going to be supervised? Are they going to have a meaningful experience? 
   The President wanted 1.4 million more students in America to have an afterschool program. Across the State of Illinois--and I bet in South Dakota--that is an immensely popular idea. It is my understanding that the Republican House bill on education would cut existing afterschool programs and turn 50,000 kids loose at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, with no supervision, no opportunity for doing homework or learning a new skill, or learning to use a musical instrument. How can we, on one hand, beat our breasts about what happens at Columbine High School, and then turn around in the budget and eliminate the resources needed so that kids can have a better and safer experience in school?

    Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to call the attention of my colleagues to an article published in the New York Times on September 21, 1999. The article describes the efforts by the people of East Peoria, Illinois, to combat racism and hatred in the aftermath of Benjamin Smith's shooting rampage during the July 4 weekend. Mr. Smith, a former member of the so-called World Church of the Creator, targeted Jews, African-Americans, and Asian-Americans, killing two and wounding nine before shooting himself. Matthew Hale, a self-proclaimed white supremacist who established the World Church of the Creator, set up its headquarters in East Peoria. 
   Mr. President, it would have been easy for the citizens of East Peoria to simply move on with their lives, dismissing this incident as an aberration and passively hoping that future acts of racial hatred would not plague their community. But the citizens of East Peoria are embracing a proactive approach to combating hatred, fostering tolerance, and celebrating diversity. Mayor Charles Dobbelaire recently announced the creation of a Human Relations Commission, which will guide East Peoria in their campaign to combat hate and teach tolerance. 
   While we can prosecute crimes motivated by hatred, we unfortunately cannot legislate hate out of the human heart. Each of us has a responsibility to speak out against racism and embrace our differences, rather than use them as a wedge to divide our communities. I ask that my colleagues join me in recognizing the commendable efforts made by the citizens of East Peoria to combat racial hatred and promote tolerance and that an article from the New York Times be inserted in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, many people who have followed this debate over the last weeks and months, I am sure, are curious why the Senate has been spending the amount of time it has on this particular issue. It is an issue which is of great importance to many of us. 
   First, let me salute my colleague, the Senator from California, Mrs. BOXER. She has led this fight, and it has been a difficult fight. It has involved many hours of debate. It has involved a lot of work on her part and that of her staff. I have been happy to join her and to add my voice to her cause. 
   We have had what might be called a symbolic vote earlier which suggests that ultimately the oil companies may prevail on this amendment. But I really believe in my heart, if my colleagues, particularly on the other side of the aisle, would just for a moment follow this debate and come to understand what is at stake, they might have a change of mind and a change of heart. Let me explain in the most basic terms, as I understand them, why we are here and why we are facing this debate. 
   Consider for a moment that we in the United States have many treasures. Visitors to the Nation's Capitol can see ample evidence of the legacy we have been given by previous generations. This magnificent building and all the monuments and statues and museums in Washington, DC, are not owned by any person. They are owned by America. They are owned by the American people. But when it comes to our national treasures, they also include public lands, many of them in remote places all across the United States, lands, frankly, that we as taxpayers own and lands that have value. 
   This bill which we are considering, the Department of the Interior bill, is one which takes into account these lands and how they are managed. The Senate and the House, each in its role, has a chance each year to make policy decisions about how we will manage these lands. This year, on the Department of the Interior appropriations bill, several of my colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle have offered what have been called environmental riders. 
   To put that in common words, it is an amendment offered by a Senator trying to limit, for example, the Department of the Interior in doing certain things in relation to these public lands. So we have had a parade of amendments involving these public lands and how they will be used. 
   There have been amendments, for example, to initiate the mining of lead in the Mark Twain National Forest in Missouri. It is a suggestion opposed by the two major newspapers in Missouri, by the Governor, by the attorney general, and by every environmental group. But a rider was proposed by a Senator from Missouri that would allow lead mining in this Mark Twain National Forest, an area that is used for recreation. That amendment prevailed. One Democratic Senator joined Republican Senators in what was an otherwise very partisan rollcall. 
   Another amendment was offered which related to the mining of minerals on public lands, so-called hard rock mining. This amendment, which was offered, I believe, by the Senator from Washington, said that when it came to the mining of those minerals, when companies, private companies, would come onto the land owned by America's taxpayers, we would change the rules and say when they dumped their waste after their mining, they could have more acreage to dump on when they wanted to leave the land behind. 
   Of course, the mining companies love to mine on public 
   lands because we charge royalties which are a joke. They date back to a law over 100 years old. It is not uncommon for a private mining company, some even foreign companies, to be able to mine for minerals on public lands owned by the taxpayers and to pay as little as $5 an acre--$5 an acre to mine for gold, for example. These companies can literally bring millions of dollars of profit out of the public lands owned by this country and pay to the Federal Government $5, $10, $15, $100, $1,000. 
   So the amendment proposed by the Republican Senator suggested that when they mine this land at these bargain basement royalty prices, they will be able to leave more and more acreage of waste dumped behind at the expense of future generations. 
   We had another amendment relative to grazing. Particularly in the West, grazing is an important use of western public lands. I support it. But the question was whether or not the ranchers who grazed on Federal lands would be able to renew their long-term leases, how much they would pay, and what restrictions they would have on how  much grazing would be allowed. A Republican Senator from New Mexico offered an amendment which said these leases for the grazing permits would be renewed almost indefinitely. Frankly, many of us thought that was something we should question--whether or not we should, from time to time, make environmental reviews of the use of grazing permits to make certain the public land ended up being used for the best purpose for America. 
   So time and time again, we have seen a clear difference in philosophy from the other side of the aisle, the Republican side of the aisle, and the Democratic side of the aisle when it comes to public lands. I will only speak for myself, but I will tell you what my philosophy is. I believe these public lands are a public trust. I have been honored to represent the State of Illinois in the Senate. I believe, in my actions and in my votes, I should never compromise the integrity of this legacy of public lands that have been left for my supervision, entrusted to me. I have tried my best to vote so I can say, whenever I leave this body, I took this treasure of public lands and returned it to the next generation in as good shape as, or better than, I received it. I think that is consistent with the idea of conservation. It is consistent with the idea of protection. 
   I concede, people can use public lands for profitmaking. That is done, of course, by ranchers for grazing and by the mining industry for minerals. It is done, as we have discussed earlier, by those who want to come in and, for example, drill for oil. I believe companies that do that, whether they are cutting wood or drilling for oil, should pay to the American taxpayers fair compensation for using the land so I could say, if ever held accountable: Yes, it is true, we did allow people to cut down trees on public lands; they paid for it; it was not something that was in derogation of the value of the land to be left for future generations. 
   That is my philosophy: Protect the public lands. If people use them, they should pay fair compensation to America and its taxpayers for the use of the public lands. 
   The philosophy on the other side--I will try to characterize as best I can--is that the public lands are in some way an intrusion of the Federal Government into many of these States. I think there is a general resentment that the Federal Government owns so much acreage in Western States. Yet the fact is, if the Federal Government had not owned this acreage, it is really questionable whether some of these States would have finally become populated or become part of the Union. The Federal Government took control of the lands in the initiation of our great country, and over the years many of these lands have stayed in our control. I can understand that if I lived in a Western State, I might have a different view. But, frankly, I do not believe they should be viewed as antagonistic. These lands are part of our national treasure. 
   Second, the view on the other side of the aisle is, if a private company wants to come in and make money off these public lands, we should bend over backwards to make it easy for them and subsidize them. That is why we have not changed that mining act for 100 years. That is why these companies are paying $5 an acre and taking thousands of dollars of profits, millions of dollars of profits, off that acreage and not paying more to the taxpayers. That is why they want to be grazing these lands without the oversight of departments which decide whether or not they are doing something that could harm the lands permanently. 
   So there is a real difference in philosophy between the Democratic side of the aisle and the Republican side of the aisle. And rider after rider, whether they talk about mining or logging or grazing or drilling for oil, comes down to this basic same debate. 
   The amendment of the Senator from Texas, Mrs. HUTCHISON, really calls in question the idea of how much oil companies should pay if they are going to drill for oil on public lands and which they turn around and sell at a profit. 
   Frankly, I have no objection if the drilling for that oil does not create an environmental hazard or environmental problem. These companies should be allowed to bid and to responsibly drill for oil. It is good for America's energy needs. It creates jobs in the area. It is something with which I do not have a problem. 
   The Senator from California, Mrs. BOXER, and I come to this Chamber to oppose an amendment being offered by the Senator from Texas. The amendment says this: The Department of the Interior, which is to establish the amount of money, the royalty, paid by the oil companies to drill on public lands, will be prohibited, by the Hutchison amendment, from revising that royalty to reflect the cost and value of the oil that is drilled. 
   I believe this is the fourth time we have gone through this where they have stopped the Department of the Interior from revising upwards the amount of money taxpayers receive in royalties for drilling oil on public lands, despite the fact the law clearly says: Yes, owner of the oil company, you can use public land, but you owe the taxpayers something; pay the taxpayers for profit you are taking out of their land. 
   Yet the Hutchison amendment says: No, we do not want to revise the royalty schedule; we do not want to make certain that the taxpayers receive fair compensation and the oil companies pay what they are required to pay under the law.

   Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator from California, this chart demonstrates what she has already stated. The percentage of companies affected by this rule is only 5 percent, 68 percent of the Federal production; 95 percent of the oil companies, particularly the small and independent companies, are not affected by this debate. We are talking about the big boys. We are talking about the big oil companies and whether they are going to use our Federal public lands to make a profit and pay the taxpayers a fair share of their profit back to our Treasury. 
   When I heard the debate on the floor that I heard earlier 
   suggesting that if these big oil companies have to pay their fair share of royalties, the price of a gallon of gasoline is going to go up at the pump, it is almost laughable. We are talking about such a small amount of money in terms of these multimillion-dollar oil companies but a significant amount of money which would come back to Federal taxpayers and to the States that are affected for very important purposes. 
   The Senator from California is correct.

   Mr. DURBIN. Just by coincidence, I happen to have a chart which illustrates this because this is a point we made during the course of the debate. The cost of this amendment, offered by Senator HUTCHISON, to the taxpayers of America is $66 million. The amount of money the taxpayers have lost to date is $88 million.  
   With both amendments, if this amendment prevails today, America's taxpayers will lose $154 million which these oil companies were required to pay for the purpose of drilling oil on public land, oil which, of course, has generated great profits for them and their companies. 
   This observation, that these companies have not paid their fair share for the royalties, has been backed up by lawsuits. States which receive the benefits of some of these royalty dollars have turned around and sued these oil companies and said they are not paying what they are required to pay under the law. In State after State, we have seen the oil companies basically concede, yes, we are underpaying the royalties we owe taxpayers. 
   Take a look at these recent oil undervaluation settlements. State by State: Alaska, $3.7 billion; Louisiana, $400 million; California, $345 million; Texas, $30 million. In all, we have collected $5 billion these oil companies have underpaid, their statutory obligation to pay royalties on this land. 
   For the proponents of this amendment to argue that it is fundamentally unfair to require private oil companies to pay these royalties and that these formulas for payment are unfair is to ignore the reality that time and time again, when the oil companies have been challenged, they have been found guilty of having cheated the taxpayers out of the fair share of money they were supposed to pay. 
   The Hutchison amendment says we will not change this formula; we will not update it; we will not hold these oil companies accountable. We will say to the Department of the Interior: Walk away from it; let the oil companies make the profit they want; do not let the taxpayers receive the fair compensation to which they are entitled. 
   A lot of this money, incidentally, that goes to States is used for purposes which are absolutely essential. One of them is education. What is $66 million worth in terms of education? That is how much this amendment will cost the Federal Treasury and how much it will leave in the hands of the oil companies. What can one do with $66 million? 
   By Federal standards, people say: Don't you people deal in 
   billions? What does $66 million mean? 
   With $66 million, you can hire 1,000 teachers. You can put 44,000 new computers in classrooms. You can buy textbooks for 1.2 million students. You can provide 53 million hot lunches for schoolchildren. 
   Mr. President, $66 million may be small change by some Senators' standards, but when it comes to running schools and providing good education, it turns out to be a very important part of the component of meeting our obligation. 
   Also, this has been an issue which has received a lot of attention. In fact, one of the articles which I think is extraordinary came from a publication which I rarely would run into, but it is Platt's Oilgram News. I cannot say as I have ever read it or subscribed to it. 
   On Thursday, July 22, 1999, a retired employee from ARCO, one of the major oil companies involved in this debate, said that his company deliberately underpaid the oil royalties to the Federal Government. This was not a miscalculation. This was not an accidental occurrence. A calculated decision was made by the oil company to shortchange America's taxpayers by refusing to pay the royalties required by law because they felt that some day they may be sued as a result of that decision and they would just as soon hold on to the money, declare it as profit, make interest on it, and run a risk they would have a lawsuit and a day of reckoning sometime in the future. 
   This gentleman, Mr. Anderson, is quoted at length in the article:  
   I was an ARCO employee, he said. Some of the issues being discussed were still being litigated. My plan was to get to retirement. We had seen numerous occasions, the nail that stood up getting beat down. 
   .....The senior executives of ARCO had the judgment that they would take the money, accrue for the day of judgment, and that's what we did. I would not have been there in any capacity had I continued to exercise the right they had given me to dissent to this process during the discussion stage. But once we made our decisions, ranks closed ..... I did not get to be a manager and remain a manager being oblivious and blind to signals.  
   A calculated corporate decision to underpay the Federal Government: Leave the money in the bank and earn interest on it and wait to be sued. 
   So the Hutchison amendment basically says: The Department of the Interior should ignore this, ignore the fact that oil companies are basically cheating the taxpayers out of the money to which they are entitled. 
   Recently there was a lawsuit filed, which the Senator from California brought to my attention, that raised the question of this effort by the oil companies. They came up, in that lawsuit, with what they call the seven schemes by which these oil companies were basically cheating America's taxpayers: 
   No. 1, misrepresenting the actual value received for oil; 
   No. 2, buying and selling crude oil at values less than what would have been received in an arm's length transaction; 
   No. 3, selling oil to their affiliates to mask the true value; 
   No. 4, claiming an artificially low value for oil refined by the company itself; 
   No. 5, falsely classifying high-valued sweet oil as lower-priced sour crude oil; 
   No. 6, paying royalties on the basis of lower-valued oil, then commingling it with higher-valued and selling it as high-quality oil; 
   No. 7, claiming payment of certain fees on commingled oil when such fees were never paid. 
   Those are schemes that have been used by these oil companies to avoid paying the royalty they are required to pay under law. 
   They want to drill on public lands. They want to make a profit. They do not want to pay back to America the cost we have incurred in allowing them to take this oil from the land. They have been caught time and time again with their hands in the cookie jar. 
   The Hutchison amendment says: We are not going to pursue these oil companies any further. We are going to say to the Department of the Interior: You cannot enforce the law. You cannot enforce the requirement that these oil companies pay their fair share in royalties. 
   There are many special interests at work on Capitol Hill. I would be the first to admit it, having served here for 17 years. This is one of the more blatant examples I have seen, where companies have basically come in and said: We want to be exempt from the law. 
   The Senator from California, Mrs. BOXER, has fought a valiant fight to bring this issue to public attention. Time after time, publications across America, which have taken a look at this issue, have reached the conclusion that the Senator from California is right and this amendment is wrong. 
   In the USA Today--and this is from last year; same issue, same type of amendment--the editorial is entitled ``Time to clean up Big Oil's slick deal with Congress.'' Let me read just a few words here from the USA Today editorial of August 26, 1998:  
   Imagine being able to compute your own rent payments and grocery bills, giving yourself a 3% to 10% discount off the market price. Over time, that would add up to really big bucks. And imagine having the political clout to make sure nothing [ever] threatened to change that cozy arrangement. 
   According to government and private studies, that's the sweet deal the oil industry is fighting to protect: the right to extract crude oil from public land and pay the government not the open market price but a lower ``posted price''--based on private deals--  
   The schemes I mentioned earlier--  
   the oil companies can manipulate for their own benefit. 
   They go on to talk about the fact that it is no secret that these oil companies are big players in Washington. They make contributions to Members of Congress. And, of course, when the time comes, they expect at least a day in court, if not some help, when their issues come to the floor. This is a classic illustration. 
   It just strikes me as odd that companies that otherwise enjoy positive reputations are willing to fight so viciously to protect what has been unmasked as a scheme to defraud America's taxpayers. 
   In the scheme of things, if this 5 percent of the major oil companies paid $66 million more a year to the Federal Treasury, can you believe that would affect their bottom line? I do not think the money is what is at stake here. I think what is at stake is the attitude, the attitude of these companies that  we have no right as Members of the Senate to defy their scheme and to say that the American taxpayers deserve a fair shake, that the American taxpayers deserve better. 
   They believe, as some do in this body, that these public lands are there as a disposable product to be used up, if necessary, and discarded, that future generations be damned. That is the philosophy they follow. 
   That troubles me greatly because I know that Republicans and Democrats alike understand that the law should be followed, understand that private citizens and families and businesses are required to follow the law as much as anyone, and, frankly, that even though we have a good economy, getting away from the days of deep deficits, we still have the need for money in our Treasury for valuable purposes such as, for example, education. 
   One of the things we will debate in the closing weeks of this session is whether or not this Senate, by the time we adjourn, will be able to point to anything we have accomplished in the field of education. 
   When the session started, the leaders on the Republican side, who are in control of the House and the Senate, made important speeches about how critical education was in the priorities of this Congress. Yet I will tell you, quite honestly, if we held a gun to the head of any Member of Congress and said, I am going to pull the trigger unless you can tell me something this Congress has done to help American families improve education, I would have to tell them, fire away, because we have done nothing. 
   This is an illustration, that we would walk away from $66 million, a portion of which goes back to the States for education, at a time when we realize there are critical priorities in education all across America. Our schools are becoming antiquated. They do not have the modern technology they need. We know more and more kids are on the horizon. They are going to be showing up and enrolling in schools. So the demands are there for education to be improved in every State, and certainly in Federal programs. 
   Why the Hutchison amendment would want to take away what the Federal Treasury is entitled to receive for the oil 
   companies drilling on public lands, taking that money away, shortchanging education, is beyond me. It is beyond me. 
   Certainly we can have a spirited debate about whether we want to increase taxes for given purposes. We have had that debate. I know it is one that is contentious. But this isn't about a new tax; this is about existing law that requires these oil companies to pay their tax, their royalty, for drilling oil. For some reason, certainly a large number of the Members of the Senate believe these oil companies should be able to walk away scot-free and not accept this obligation. 
   The Los Angeles Times editorial of July 20, 1999, characterized this effort, this amendment, the Hutchison amendment, and this scheme as ``The Great American Oil Rip-Off.'' I quote the first paragraph:  
   America's big oil companies have been ripping off federal and state governments for decades by underpaying royalties for oil drilled on public lands. The Interior Department tried to stop the practice with new rules, but Congress has succeeded in blocking their implementation--  
   With this amendment that is before the Senate today--  
   and will again if a Senate bill calling for a moratorium on the new rules, proposed by Senators HUTCHISON and PETE DOMENICI of New Mexico and scheduled for a floor vote ..... is enacted. 
   Let me read this paragraph:  
   Not since the Teapot Dome scandal of the 1920s has the stench of oil money reeked as strongly in Washington as it is in this case.  
   This amendment, frankly, brought to the floor may enjoy the support of a majority of Members and I am sure will enjoy the plaudits and praise of the oil companies benefited by it.

   Mr. DURBIN. I think the point of the Senator from California is well taken: We do demand of families and businesses that they pay their fair share of taxes. If they don't, they are held accountable. What we want to create with the Hutchison amendment is an exception for oil companies; to say to some of the most profitable companies in America that they don't have to pay their fair share as required by law. That is what the Hutchison amendment does. 
   It says the Department of the Interior cannot review the amount of money being paid in royalties by these oil companies and stop them from even considering implementing and enforcing the law. We know, as the Senator from California has indicated, that in the past, time and again, these companies have underpaid their required royalties to the Federal Government and to the States. 
   We have a letter, which was addressed to the Senator from California, from the Secretary of the Interior, Bruce Babbitt. He writes, on September 8, 1999:  
   I am writing to call on you and your colleagues to reject from the Fiscal Year 2000 Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill a Senate amendment extending the moratorium prohibiting the Department of the Interior from issuing a final rulemaking on the royalty valuation of crude oil until October 1st, 2000. A similar letter has been sent to the Senate Appropriations Committee. 
   Prior to a series of congressionally-imposed moratoria, the Department was prepared to publish a final rule on oil valuation on June 1, 1998. On March 4, 1999, I announced that the Department would reopen the comment period for the federal oil valuation rule. On March 12, 1999, we formally reopened the comment period and held a series of public workshops to discuss the rule. We believe that the process set in motion will assure full and open consideration of all new ideas for resolving the concerns that have been raised and will lead to a solution that best meets the interests of the American public. 
   Currently, we are reviewing the information gathered at the workshops and are confident that we will be able to address the outstanding issues raised by our stakeholders. The moratorium [as suggested by the Hutchison amendment] would simply delay our ability to implement a final rule until October 1, 2000, although we may have resolved these key issues well before then. This unnecessary delay will result in losses to the Federal Treasury, States, and Indians of an amount of up to $5.65 million per month. 
   We urge you to defeat any proposal to extend the moratorium prohibiting the Department from issuing a final rule during Fiscal Year 2000. 
   Sincerely, Bruce Babbitt [Secretary of the Interior]  
   Five point six million a month, owed to the Federal Treasury, owed to the  taxpayers for the use of public lands for private profit, that will not be paid if the Hutchison amendment passes. 
   As I look across the aisle, I see a chart the Senator from Texas has used repeatedly to explain how complicated this is to come up with this valuation. I haven't seen it in detail. I don't question the veracity of the Senator's statements about this process. 
   Let me suggest to my colleagues, when we are dealing with conglomerate oil companies, multinational, with large legal departments, large engineering departments, arguing over the value of oil, trust me, it is not something that is done over lunch, where they write a figure on a napkin and agree to it. You have to bring in all of the information, verify it, subject it to public comment, and then establish the right royalty to be paid by the oil companies. 
   I think it might be interesting to see a chart of how much the oil companies are paying to bring this amendment to the floor and pass it, all of their corporate and legal departments and government departments that are at work to try to save them over $5 million a month at the expense of the Federal taxpayers. 
   The other day, I was on an airplane flying to Washington, which is a big part of my life over the last 17 years. I sat on a plane next to a gentleman from Colorado who worked for MCI WorldCom. He quickly wanted to talk about politics, which is always a dangerous topic when one is captured on an airplane. He allowed as to how he was a libertarian and believed there was entirely too much government around and, frankly, that is the way he voted. 
   I said: Let me tell you about an issue. Let me describe to you because you live in Colorado--a beautiful State that has a lot of public lands--this issue about whether or not oil companies should be able to come on public land, drill on that land, take the oil out, sell it for a profit, and pay a royalty for that purpose. 
   He said: I don't have any problem with that; that's only fair. If they are going to use the public lands that they don't own, they ought to pay something for them. 
   I said: Well, that is what the debate is all about. 
   The Hutchison amendment stops the Federal Government from collecting the royalty these companies owe under the law. Whether you are a conservative, a libertarian, independent, liberal, this is just simple justice. It is fairness, as to whether or not these companies are going to get such a break 
   from the Senate, that we are basically wrapping up in a beautiful little package with a nice big bow on top, 5.6 million bucks a month to these oil companies. 
   They hold tag days in the city of Chicago, which I am privileged to represent, for a lot of people who are homeless, people who need food and clothing, folks who need a break in life. These tag days give you little things to put in your lapel to show that you helped. 
   They are never going to have a tag day for a major oil company. These companies are doing OK. Frankly, for us to give them an additional subsidy of $5.6 million a month is scandalous; that at this time in our history, when we know this money could be so well spent for education, for health care, for things every American expects us to respond to, we would literally turn our backs on $5.6 million a month, money that these oil companies have conceded in lawsuits they underpaid the Federal Government. 
   That is what this amendment is all about. It is a real test. The oil companies, at the end of this debate, will get the vote. Senators will be counted on: On one side, those who believe the oil companies need to be treated a little more gingerly, a little more lightly, they should not be required to make the payments they are required to make under law; on the other side, those of us who believe the public lands should be protected and those who use them should make fair compensation for the use of those lands. 
   Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time. 
   Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.

   Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair. 
   Those who stay glued to the screens watching C-SPAN and the Senate debate know what this is all about. Those who come to the gallery or tune in may not understand why we are on the floor today with a few Members very deeply involved in debate. 
   This is a debate over the use of America's public lands, lands owned by all of us as citizens of the United States. We have a lot of them, literally millions of acres. Some of them are beautiful, pristine parks, and some are national forests. 
   Many of these lands are used for a variety of purposes. Some are used for recreational and tourism purposes, our beautiful National Park System which was instituted by a famous Republican President, Theodore Roosevelt, who opened Yosemite National Park and started the park system, and many other aspects such as the National Forest System, of which we have in Illinois the Shawnee National Forest, one of the more beautiful parts of our State. We are very proud of it. 
   Then as you go out West, you find a variety of public lands. I am the sponsor of a bill, on which perhaps a dozen of my colleagues have joined me, for the so-called Utah Wilderness, an area much different from my national forest in southern Illinois, but as a desert, in its own way, it has a special beauty. It is a wilderness area owned by the Federal Government. 
   We say that many areas of public land are going to be protected, that literally no one can use them, or, if you do, it is in a very careful manner. But we say as well that there are some lands which can be used, public lands, by private individuals and companies for a fee. 
   So we invite onto some lands, like national forests, logging companies that come in and chop down trees. They make a profit off the lumber. They give money to the Federal Government to use that land to chop those trees down. 
   We also allow mining companies to come in on public land to mine for minerals which they turn around and sell. We say to western ranchers: You can let your cattle graze on public lands here, chew the grass, get fat to bring to market to make you a profit. You will pay us a fee to do it, but you are welcome to use the land. 
   This debate is about the use of public lands where oil companies come in and drill for oil. Keep it in perspective. The oil companies do not own the land. We do. The taxpayers do. The oil companies--private companies--come in and bid for the right to drill for oil. If they are fortunate and find oil they can then sell for a profit, they give us back a rental fee called a royalty. That is what this debate is all about. It is about 5 percent of the oil companies in America, the largest oil companies, and whether they will pay to us, as taxpayers, to the Federal Government, a fair rental payment, a royalty payment for extracting oil from our land and selling it for a profit. 
   Sounds like a pretty simple undertaking. We put a formula into law. The formula said: We are going to base the royalty that you pay the taxpayers for drilling oil on public lands based on what the price of the oil is. It sounds eminently sensible, reasonable, and easy. It is not. We found, over the last several years, that the oil companies have found ways to avoid coming up  with the real price of the oil. They have six or seven different schemes they use to basically pay less to the taxpayers than they are supposed to pay. 
   How can I say that? I can say it because a lot of States and the Federal Government have taken the oil companies to court and have said they did not pay the royalty required by law. The oil companies, over several years, have paid back $5 billion that was underpaid in royalties. We caught them with their hands in the cookie jar. They had not paid the taxpayers--State and Federal taxpayers--what they were required to pay under the law. 
   The amendment before us by the Senator from Texas, Mrs. HUTCHISON, says, the Department of the Interior cannot recalculate this royalty fee based on the new prices of oil. It would be the fourth time in several years that we stopped the Interior Department from recalculating the royalty. In other words, we are saying we do not care if the oil companies owe us more money, we are not going to collect it. 
   How much is it worth to us, to the taxpayers? It is $5.6 million per month. Some watching this will say: For goodness' sake, don't they lose that on the floor of the Treasury when they are mopping up at night? And $5.6 million a month, that isn't much by Federal standards where you talk about trillions and billions. 
   They have a point. But for the average person, the average family, the average business, $66 million a year is real money, real money that the oil companies should pay us and are not paying us and will not pay us if the Hutchison amendment passes because the Hutchison amendment insulates the oil companies from this recalculation of the royalty that they pay. Why? Why in the world would we take the oil companies and do this? 
   If this were the Little Sisters of the Poor about to have 
   their mortgage foreclosed on their convent, for goodness' sake, count me in. I will be ready to consider an amendment. We are talking about the largest oil companies in the world. They are being protected by this amendment. I think it is a bit unseemly, if you will, for these oil companies to come on our land--not their land--drill oil, an irreplaceable resource, sell it for a profit, and refuse to pay the taxpayers what they owe them for being on this land. That is what this amendment does.

   Mr. DURBIN. It does. I say further that it is a matter of whether or not we are going to be Uncle Sam or ``Uncle Sucker.'' Think about these oil companies. We are talking about $66 million a year. 
   Let me tell you, it is a bit unseemly for these oil companies to be fighting over $66 million a year, owed to the taxpayers, to come in and to support an amendment which insulates them from paying $66 million to the taxpayers. 
   Let me give you an idea why I think it is unseemly. And I agree with the Senator from California. Let's take a look at the oil companies involved. As I have said, you are not going to find the Little Sisters of the Poor Petroleum Company here. 
   No. 1, Shell Oil Company. The total revenues of Shell Oil Company in 1996 were $29 billion. Exxon Corporation, $134 billion; Chevron, $43 billion; Texaco, $45 billion; Marathon, $16 billion; Mobil, $81 billion; Conoco, $20 billion. The list goes on and on. 
   The reason I read those--and there are many more--you would recognize every name on the list. You know these companies. You have seen their gas stations. You have seen their stock printed in the paper. They have huge worldwide sales. And these multi-multibillion-dollar huge companies refuse to pay us, the taxpayers, Uncle Sam, America, a fair royalty, a fair rental payment for drilling oil on our land and selling it for their profit. 
   Can we conclude that these companies are in such perilous financial condition that $66 million would break the bank? Let me tell you, the royalty which they are refusing to pay, the royalty which this amendment insulates them from paying, represents, in every instance, less than one-tenth of 1 percent of the revenue of each of the companies--less than one-tenth of 1 percent, sometimes even smaller amounts. 
   Why in the world are we fighting this battle? Profitable companies, multibillion-dollar companies, coming on our land, drilling oil for their profit, have to come to the Senate to put on an amendment to insulate them from paying their fair rental, their fair royalty for drilling oil? 
   There are those who say: For goodness sakes, Senators, aren't there some other things you could debate? Yes, I suppose. When it gets down to it, the money, in the scheme of a $1.7 trillion national budget, may get lost, $66 million a year, $5.6 million a month. But there is something that won't get lost. That is the simple justice of this debate, a question of fairness, a question of common sense. 
   As much as those on the other side would like to obfuscate this issue and tell us it is certainly so complicated, beyond the ken and mind of any Member of the Senate, they are just plain wrong. We have received correspondence from the Secretary of the Interior. We have seen editorial support in USA Today, the Los Angeles Times, articles in the Wall Street Journal, learned, expert people who have said this is pretty simple. This is a rip-off for American taxpayers. 
   I have to say to the Senator from California, I am glad she is waging this battle, as uncomfortable as it may be to my colleagues in the Senate, to try, once and for all, to say that if we are going to hold individual Americans, families, and businesses responsible for their tax liability on April 15, then, for goodness sakes, these multibillion-dollar oil companies should pay their fair share under the law for drilling oil on our land. They have been tested in court time and again and found guilty. Whistleblowers have come forward. Yet this amendment, the Hutchison amendment, will perpetuate this rip-off. 
   I know some will argue that there are other issues of importance. I hope that in the boardrooms of these oil companies they would please reflect on this battle. Is this really worth it? Is this really worth it to the big oil companies. Sixty-six million in a multibillion-dollar company wouldn't make a  ripple on their balance sheet. But for them to be in a position, as they are today, of trying to defend the indefensible, a position where they have lost time and again in court, trying to say they can use up our Federal resources without paying for them, is just incomprehensible.

   My fear is, in the closing weeks of this session, if the Members of the Senate were accused of having passed legislation this year to help the families of America, we could not gather enough evidence to prove the charge. We are about to leave town in a few weeks emptyhanded, having done little or nothing on education, little or nothing on minimum wage, little or nothing on health care. Frankly, I think the American people sent us to this body to do things to make life better for families across America. The Senator from Massachusetts speaks about minimum wage and education. There are so many other items on the agenda that should be addressed by a Congress listening to the American people.

   Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   Today we are here to talk about the appropriations for the District of Columbia, a special city--the Nation's Capital--and our constitutional responsibility to oversee it. 
   As the Senator from Texas has already said, a substantial portion of tax dollars is involved in the D.C. budget, and for that reason and others, historically and legally, Congress has accepted the responsibility to oversee the budget of the District of Columbia. About 8 percent of the funds the District spends come from the Federal Government. As a result, we assume a responsibility in managing this city unlike any other city in America. 
   I have been puzzled over the years as I have dealt with this challenge about how many Members of Congress--House and Senate--who have never given a thought to running for mayor or city council anxiously play that role when it comes to the District of Columbia. I think that is unfortunate. I believe in home rule. 
   I have had some serious misgivings about policy changes made by the District of Columbia City Council--for instance, when it comes to tax cuts--but I have made those public. I have gone no further in this bill because I think it is their decision to make. 
   I also want to say at this moment that it has been a pleasure to work with my colleague from Texas, Senator HUTCHISON. It is the first time we have been in this role together in her position as the Chair of the subcommittee and mine as the minority spokesman. She has been honest, open, and professional in our dealings. Though we disagree on many issues, it has been a pleasure to work with her on this. 
   I also want to compliment her staff, Mary Beth Nethercutt and Jim Hyland for their cooperation. 
   I salute as well those on my side--Terry Sauvain, who is not only the minority clerk for this bill but who also serves as the minority deputy staff director for the Appropriations Committee. Our good friend and colleague, Senator ROBERT BYRD, was kind enough to lend Terry for our effort. And without him, we wouldn't be here today. 
   I also want to thank Marianne Upton, a member of my personal staff, who has been working on this tirelessly since we received this assignment. 
   Let me say a word or two about some others who are not members of the Senate staff but deserve recognition. My former House colleague, Congresswoman ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON has worked tirelessly for the District of Columbia. And a difficult job she has. Not being a voting Member of the House of Representatives, she has to use the powers of persuasion to be an advocate for the people of this city. I admire her greatly for the leadership she has shown. I also note that she opposes this conference report before us, as do many of the leaders in the District of Columbia. 
   Finally, let me say a word about the new Mayor. I have the greatest hope for this Mayor. I think he is an exceptional individual. I have known him for years in our professional relationship on Capitol Hill. He marks a real change in pace in the District of Columbia. I think he has done a great job to date with a very difficult assignment. I have  the greatest hope that he will continue and be very successful in those efforts to make our Nation's Capital a source of pride for everyone in America. 
   When people come to the District of Columbia to visit as tourists, or from other countries, there are certain impressions they leave with. The beautiful buildings of our Nation's Capital, perhaps the workings of our Government, but, of course, an image of the city. I am sorry to say that image is not always positive. I have cautioned people from Illinois and members of my family when they visit the District of Columbia to be careful. There is a lot of crime here, a lot of violent crime. You have to take care where you might not at home. That is not to say this is the most 
   dangerous city. That would be an overstatement. But it is an urban city with many urban crime problems. Frankly, I think we can and should do a better job in impressing them. 
   I also have to concede that there are problems in the District of Columbia that may not be obvious. But they go to the heart of these riders that have been put on the District of Columbia appropriations bills. Let me tell you what has happened. 
   Republican Members of Congress unable or unwilling to impose changes in legislation in their own home States or on the Nation use these appropriations bills as the happy hunting grounds for every extreme viewpoint you can find. It is the last recourse for scoundrels who will not impose on their own cities and States changes in the law but will do it to the District of Columbia. 
   Time and time again, limitations put on the District of Columbia are not being imposed on other States across the Nation. Members of Congress think they have free reign; it is a playground to introduce any amendment to any issue they would like knowing the District of Columbia is almost powerless in this process. They are victims of this congressional excess. 
   That is why the President should veto this bill and say to the Republican leadership and those on the Democratic side who have joined them that enough is enough. These riders are unfair to the people of the District of Columbia. Let me give you an example. 
   You may visit Washington, DC, and be impressed with many things. You probably would not know unless you were told that the District of Columbia faces a severe crisis. It has the highest rate of new HIV infections and deaths due to AIDS in the Nation. It is more than seven times the national average right here in Washington, DC. 
   Exhaustive scientific studies that have been underway by the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and others, have concluded that some programs can help to reduce the spread of AIDS and HIV in the District of Columbia. 
   One of those programs, controversial as it is, is a needle exchange program. This bill bans the District of Columbia from using any funds, Federal or local, to operate a program for needle exchange. To make it even worse, it says any entity which carries out such a program using private money is barred from eligibility for any Federal funding for any purpose. 
   I will tell you, there are 113 needle exchange programs across America. In virtually every instance they not only reduce the incidence of AIDS but they reduce the incidence of drug addiction. 
   I sat in that conference committee as my fellow colleagues in that conference said piously: We don't want to see this in the District of Columbia. I produced a map showing that many of these same Congressmen represent cities across America with similar programs and have never voted to bar or prohibit but they do in the District of Columbia where we have such a terrible epidemic of HIV and AIDS. That is sad. 
   Seventy-five percent of the babies born with HIV in the District of Columbia are due to the use of dirty needles by either their mother or their father. The District of Columbia has the highest rate of new HIV infections in the country. And yet we would put this provision in the law to stop even a modest effort to reduce this epidemic. I think that is awful. For that reason alone, I hope the President will veto this bill. But there are others. 
   There is also a ban in this bill to stop the use of any funds to implement a locally enacted law allowing District of Columbia employees to purchase health insurance or take family and medical leave to care for a domestic partner. The bill unfairly singles out the District of Columbia, discriminating against law-abiding citizens who happen to be unmarried but cohabitating. 
   Over 67 State and local governments, 95 colleges and universities, almost 70 of the Fortune 500 companies, and at least 450 other companies and not-for-profits and unions offer these same benefits. Not one Member of Congress is proposing to stop these programs anywhere other than the District of Columbia. That is basically unfair. 
   On the question of voting representation, another rider precludes the District of Columbia from using any funds, Federal or local, to finance a court challenge aimed at securing voting rights in the District of Columbia. This effectively means that the lawyers for the District of Columbia are prohibited from even reviewing legal documents on the question. I cannot imagine a Member of Congress or the Senate imposing a similar limitation on any municipality or unit of local government in their own State. 
   On the medical use of marijuana, I know it is controversial, but let me name some of the States which have decided if a doctor makes a decision that the operative chemical in marijuana is important for therapy, that it can be legal, if prescribed by a doctor. These States include the States of Washington, California, Oregon, Nevada, Alaska, and Arizona. All have voted for medical use of marijuana. Yet we have a situation where Members of Congress and the Senate have said to the District of Columbia: No, you cannot do the same. I think that is unfair. 
   There is a cap on attorney's fees in special education cases. If someone is trying to raise a child with a serious learning disability and wants that child in a special ed program, we have provisions in the law across America in terms of access to those programs and who will pay for the attorney's fees. It is only in the District of Columbia that some Members of Congress want to limit the amount paid to those attorneys to no more than $1,300 per case. It is basically unfair to do it only in the District of Columbia. The same Congressmen and Senators would never impose that limitation on their own States and districts. 
   My friends, those and many others are riders which I find objectionable. They are clear evidence of excess on the part of the conferees--primarily on the House side--who have insisted on keeping these provisions in place. I am going to vote against this bill. I refuse to sign the conference report. To my knowledge, I don't believe any Democratic Member did. Perhaps one did, I may be mistaken. For the most part, the Democrats decided this bill went entirely too far. 
   One thing I put in this bill which I hope will have some benefit if ultimately the President vetoes it and this provision survives is a requirement that the District of Columbia city council and mayor report to Congress on some very basic things which we think need to be addressed in the District of Columbia. The District of Columbia has decided they have so much money they will give away $59 million in tax cuts next year. They have declared a dividend in a city with a high murder rate, in a city with terrible public health services, a city overrun with rats in the street, and a city where the schools are deplorable. Despite all of these things, they have said: We have too many dollars. We are going to give them away, give them back, $100 to a family. 
   I think it is more important that families in the District of Columbia have protection in their homes, protection in their neighborhoods, that visitors to the city feel safe on the streets; that enough policemen are hired, and others are brought in to make certain that security is there. They are caught up in the notion that a $100 tax cut for each family will transform the District of Columbia. I think they should get to the basics first. 
   That is why I requested a quarterly report from the District of Columbia to Congress on very basic things, including the reduction in crime, providing the basic city services, the application and management of Federal grants,  and most importantly, to deal with the problem that children in the District of Columbia have been graded by many foundations as being worse off than any children in the United States of America. 
   When it comes to the basics, low-birthweight babies, infant mortality, child death rate, rates of teen death, teen birth rates, these things, unfortunately, the District of Columbia is doing worse on than any other State in the Nation. Wouldn't it be better to take some of the $59 million tax cut and put it back for the benefit of these children? I hope this quarterly report will demonstrate that the mayor and city council have proven me wrong. If they have, I will gladly concede. 
   In the meantime, I urge my colleagues on the Democratic side to oppose this legislation, to vote no on this appropriations bill, to urge the Republican leadership to give a clean bill, send it to the President so it can be signed, and the District can continue in their efforts to reform this government. 
   I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today joined by colleague Senator FITZGERALD, I am introducing a bill that will make two temporary federal judgeships in Illinois permanent. The Southern District of Illinois, and the Central District of Illinois each have 3 permanent judgeships and one temporary judgeship. 
   The Judicial Improvement Act of 1990 created these temporary judgeships to respond to a sharply increasing caseload, especially in the area of drug related crimes. President Bush appointed Judge Joe Billy McDade to fill the temporary judgeship in the Central District of Illinois and he was confirmed by the Senate in November of 1991. In September of 1992 the Senate confirmed another Bush nominee, Judge J.Phil Gilbert to fill the temporary judgeship in the Southern District of Illinois. 
   In 1997, Congress extended the temporary judgeships until 10 years after the confirmation of the judge appointed to fill the vacancy. As a result, the temporary judgeship in the Central District is due to expire in November of 2001 and the temporary judgeship in the Southern District will expire in September of 2002. Since the judges that serve in these positions are Article III judges with lifetime appointments, they will not be affected, but the next vacancy within each district after the expiration date will not be filled. 
   The Central District and the Southern District of Illinois are small courts and the loss of even one judgeship will have a dramatic impact on the caseload of the remaining judges. The statistics on this issue are compelling. 
   The Administrative Office of the United States Courts keeps statistics on the average amount of time that it takes a civil case to come to trial. Even with 4 judgeships, the Central District of Illinois has a substantial wait for civil litigants--24 months, which is five months longer than the national average. In the Southern District of Illinois, the numbers are equally convincing--22 months on average for a civil case to go to trial, which is three months longer than the national average. 
   If these courts lose one judgeship, which is the equivalent of 25% of their judges, justice for federal court litigants will be substantially delayed. This delay will be felt most by civil litigants because judges will give priority to criminal cases. At a time when Congress is seeking to expand Federal court jurisdiction, a loss of judgeships, even temporary ones is a step in the wrong direction. 
   Again, the numbers tell the story. Assuming court filings remain at the 1998 level, the number of cases per judge in the Central District would increase by 33% from 383 to 511. In the  Southern District, the remaining judges would be expected to take on an extra 135 cases a year, an increase of 33% from 406 cases per judge to 541 cases per judge. 
   The two temporary judgeships in the Central and Southern Districts of Illinois must be converted into permanent positions. This measure will prevent judicial overload and ensure the continued smooth functioning of the federal court system in Illinois. 
   Our independent judiciary is the envy of the rest of the world. The strength of our judiciary is a unique and distinctive characteristic of our government. We must ensure that our courts have the judges they need to perform their vital functions. 
   I encourage my colleagues to support me in this effort and ask that the Senate consider this bill without further delay.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Central American and Haitian Parity Act of 1999 with my colleague Senator KENNEDY. This legislation will provide deserved and needed relief to thousands of immigrants from Central America and the Caribbean who came to the United States fleeing political persecution. 
   In the 1980's, thousands of Salvadorans and Guatemalans fled civil wars in their countries and sought asylum in the United States. The vast majority had been persecuted or feared persecution in their home countries. The people of Honduras had a similar experience. While civil war was not formally waged within Honduras, the geography of the region made it impossible for Honduras to be unaffected by the violence and turmoil that surrounded it. The country of Haiti has also experienced extreme upheaval. Haitians for many years were forced to seek the protection of the United States because of oppression, human rights abuses and civil unrest. 
   Salvadorans, Guatemalans, Haitians and Hondurans have now established roots in the United States. Some have married here and many have children that were born in the United States. Yet many still live in fear. They cannot easily leave the United States and return to the great uncertainty in their countries of origin. If they are forced to return, they will face enormous hardship. Their former homes are either occupied by strangers or not there at all. The people they once knew are gone and so are the jobs they need to support their families. They also cannot become permanent residents of the United States, which severely limits their opportunities for work and education. This situation is unacceptable and requires a more permanent solution. 
   Before outlining how this bill will provide a permanent solution, it is important to review the evolution of deportation remedies. Prior to the passage of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Responsibility Act in 1996, aliens in the United States could apply for suspension of deportation and adjustment of status in order to obtain lawful permanent residence. Suspension of deportation was used to ameliorate the harsh consequences of deportation for aliens who had been present in the United States for long periods of time. 
   In September of 1996, Congress passed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Responsibility Act. This law retroactively made thousands of immigrants ineligible for suspension of deportation and left them with no alternate remedy. The 1996 Act eliminated suspension of deportation and established a new form of relief entitled cancellation of removal that required an applicant to accrue ten years of continuous residence as of the date of the initial notice charging the applicant with being removable. 
   In 1997, this Congress recognized that these new provisions could result in grave injustices to certain groups of people. So in November of 1997, the Nicaraguan and Central American Relief Act (NACARA) granted relief to certain citizens of former Soviet block countries and several Central American countries. This select group of immigrants were allowed to apply for permanent residence under the old, pre-IIRRA standards. 
   Such an alteration of IIRRA made sense. After all, the U.S. had allowed Central Americans to reside and work here for over a decade, during which time many of them established families, careers and community ties. The complex history of civil wars and political persecution in parts of Central America left thousands of people in limbo without a place to call home. Many victims of severe persecution came to the United States with very strong asylum cases, but unfortunately these individuals have waited so long for a hearing they will have difficulty proving their cases because they involve incidents which occurred as early as 1980. In addition, many victims of persecution never filed for asylum out of fear of denial, and consequently these people now face claims weakened by years of delay. 
   Mr. President, the bill I introduce today is a necessary and fair expansion of NACARA. It provides a permanent solution for thousands of people who desperately need one. Specifically, the bill amends the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act and provides nationals of El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Haiti an opportunity to apply for adjustment of status under the same standards as Nicaraguans and Cubans. While the restoration of democracy in Central America and the Caribbean has been encouraging, the situation remains delicate. Providing immigrants from these politically volatile areas an opportunity to apply for permanent resident status in the United States instead of deporting them to politically and economically fragile countries will provide more stability in the long run. Such an approach is the best solution not only for the United States but also for new and fragile democracies in Central America and the Caribbean. Immigrants have greatly contributed to the United States, both economically and culturally and the people of Central America and the Caribbean are no exception. If we continue to deny them a chance to live in the United States by deporting them, we not only hurt them, we hurt us too.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, one of the items previously discussed deserves further exploration; that is, the whole question of what we are going to do in the closing weeks to meet the Senate's obligation to the people of this country, to deal with the most basic responsibilities of this Chamber. 
   The most basic responsibility, of course, is to meet and pass the spending bills necessary for the orderly operation of the Federal Government. For those who are not students of the process, the fiscal year that we work under starts on October 1, and we are supposed to pass 13 different spending bills so that come October 1, the actions of Government can continue their business. This is our ordinary responsibility. 
   So we meet on September 14 to discuss a lot of issues of importance. But the American people have the right to ask us what we have done about our basic responsibility to pass the spending bills for the next year. The honest answer is, of 13 bills, we have only passed and had signed into law one bill, and that is the military construction bill. All of the other activities of the Federal Government, frankly, are still in play. They are being debated on Capitol Hill. It is a sad commentary on those who manage the House and the Senate that we have not made more progress. In fact, closer inspection suggests to us that there are some serious problems ahead. 
   Anyone who followed the proceedings last year knows that a similar situation led to a mountainous piece of legislation called a continuing resolution. If I am not mistaken, it was some 10,000 pages long and it was literally dropped in our laps with 48 hours to go and we had to read it, vote yes or no to continue the operations of Federal Government, and go home or stay here. It was chaotic. 
   At a time when we have a Federal Government and a Congress with a responsibility, a staff and resources, it is hard to imagine we are about to repeat that scenario of last year. But it looks as if we are headed in that direction. 
   The sad fact is that one of the more sinister games being played is that one of the most important spending bills for American families--the bill that contains, for example, education spending for the United States of America--is being held hostage as the last spending bill which we are going to consider. As each appropriations bill that needs money comes along, it is taken from this education and health bill and put into another bill. 
   The day of reckoning is upon us in the not-too-distant future where we will face the possibility of another continuing resolution. 
   I am disappointed the Senate has not responded to the challenge by the President in his State of the Union Address and, frankly, challenge by the people of this country to address some  of the serious problems which we face. Instead, we find ourselves tangled in a weave of budgetary deception where the suggestion has been made this morning that there is going to be an extension of the fiscal year to make it 13 months long as opposed to 12 months. 
   I believe it was Pope Gregory who came up with this calendar which we now use across the world. Now we have a suggestion that is part of their effort to extricate themselves from this budgetary maelstrom. The Republicans are going to somehow construct a 13-month calendar. I will not go into all the possibilities that were mentioned in the earlier debate, but I will say that it is, frankly, evidence of their failure to lead in the Senate and the House of Representatives because we are in the closing weeks of the fiscal year not having met our obligation to manage the Government and do it in an efficient manner. 
   The President came to us many months ago in his State of the Union Address suggesting some changes which we should consider in education in America. I am sorry to report that, to my knowledge, there has been no hearings on the President's proposals, nor is there any likelihood that the budgetary bills coming before us in the closing hours of the session will even address these changes in education. Most of these changes are widely accepted and embraced by the American people. Yet we find the Republican majority in both the House and the Senate refusing to even consider them. 
   The idea of increasing the number of teachers across America so classroom size is reduced is one that every parent understands. You walk into a classroom of 30 kindergartners and one of them is your child. You pray to God there will be a few minutes each day where the teacher might be able to pay special attention to your son's or daughter's particular problems. The same is true in the first, second, and third grades when children are learning the basics in terms of math and reading and such things that will build their education for the future. 
   The plebiscite President said 100,000 new teachers and reduce classroom size across America and we will have better students, better graduates, a better workforce, and a better country. The American people said: We agree. Do something about it. As we stand here in September of 1999, 8 or 9 months later, nothing has been done--nothing. 
   The President has already said--and I think he is right--address the needs to modernize classrooms across America. 
   We had a press conference in Illinois last week in Farmington, a small town near Peoria. 
   The school there was built in 1908. It is one of those battleship schools. I attended similar schools that reflect the turn of the century commitment to education in America. However, the school needs help. It needs a new fire escape. It needs new electrical service. It needs to be equipped for computers. It needs the basics. 
   It is not alone. There are schools across America in need of modernization. New schools need to be built. There will be more students than there will be classrooms. Will we help school districts across America? Will this Congress rally, as the President has asked, to help the school districts? The honest answer is no. We have not had any show of will by the Republican majority to even address this. When we bring it up, they say: There you go again, another new program. 
   Does this strike anyone listening to the debate as a radical suggestion, that our Federal Government lend a helping hand to school districts across America so schools are safer, that they are more modern, that in the 21st century kids have a better chance to learn? The honest answer is, that is not radical; that is as basic as it gets in the United States of America.

   Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from California. 
   The fact of the matter is, I managed to complete college because of the National Defense of Education Act, a bill passed by Congress, signed by President Eisenhower, that allowed me as a student from a working family to borrow money from the Federal Government to pay my college education and pay it back over 10 years at 3 percent interest. What a deal. I would sign up for it again. 
   I hope those who were supporting it and reflecting on it believe that investment in this kid from East St. Louis and a lot of other children like me paid off for the country in the long haul. 
   I think President Eisenhower and Congress were correct in calling this the national defense. When you talk about the national defense of America, I think it has a lot more to do with the people who live here than the hardware we purchase. The investment in education is such an investment. Think back to the turn of the century. If you had to go back 100 years and ask, Will America be a dominant country in the 21st century, most would guess no because in the 19th century we were a minor power. 
   The European powers captured the attention of the world. We made some threshold decisions at the turn of the century that made a difference. I love this statistic: Between 1890 and 1920, on average, we built one new high school every day in America. For 30 years, a new high school was built every day in towns across the country--no Federal mandate, just the understanding that if you had a town that was worth its salt, it would have a high school. High school wasn't just for rich kids; high school was for all kids. The kids of immigrants, the kids of farmers, and the kids of small business people all went to school together in a public school system. 
   What happened? We went from 6 percent of 17-year-olds graduating high school in 1900 to 1930, 30 percent, and today, over 75 percent. Make no mistake, that commitment by America to education, which created high schools, which were then called ``people's colleges'' because this was a chance for education beyond the eighth grade for just average kids, led to college education and a dramatic increase in the number of scientists, engineers, and doctors. It took America from Kitty Hawk to the space program. 
   The obvious question is, Do we have the same commitment to education in the future that the leaders in the 19th century, looking to the 20th century, had? I don't hear it as I listen to the debate in the Congress. I don't hear men and women of vision standing up  and saying in the 21st century our kids will have the same opportunities. 
   There are some things we have to commit ourselves to as a nation. That isn't being done here. Instead, we languish in this debate, lost in the minutiae about local control and forgetting the big picture. The American people expect Congress to understand the challenges our Nation faces for the next century. It is not reflected in the debate on the budget or in the appropriations bills. 
   We have talked about school modernization, we talked about smaller classroom sizes in K through 4. Let me discuss another critically important topic: Quality teachers, men and women who will become professional teachers who are good at it--not to take what is left over from college or high school, but to take 
   the very best and brightest and put them in a classroom to spark in each kid that feeling of creativity and learning which those who are blessed to have such teachers have experienced. Yet we don't have that commitment. 
   The President has said: Invest in teachers. Make sure they have a chance to have their skills improved. Hold them accountable for what they do in a classroom. But make sure to bring these young men and women into the teaching profession. 
   We can turn on the television almost any night and see the expos&#233;s about education in America where, unfortunately, some people are in classrooms and they shouldn't be there. The vast majority of teachers are good, hard-working men and women. We can help them improve their skills and keep those who are not good out of the classroom with a commitment in Washington that we just haven't seen during the course of this year. 
   The last point I will make is on afterschool programs. I have been mystified by the fact we are still caught up in a mindset that is, frankly, old fashioned, a mindset that says children start school at the age of 6 and school lets out at 2:30 or 3:00 in the afternoon and we take 3 months off in the summer. This might have made sense at some point in time. It doesn't make sense in today's America. Six years of age is a good age to put a child in a classroom, but 5 is better; 4 may even be better. There might even be learning experiences for those younger who are now in a day-care setting. 
   Ask any teacher, if they could add a year in education, where would they add it. It isn't at the end of 12th grade but at the beginning, kindergarten or before. The teachers say: Give me a chance to mold that child before they come into the classroom, and I will show you a better person and a better student. 
   Yet our commitment to preschool programs, our commitment to programs for the earliest ages, just isn't there. We ignore it. We act as if it isn't a reality. We know it is. A younger child in a learning situation is a child more likely to be a good student. 
   Classrooms adjourning each day at 2:30 or 3 o'clock in the afternoon made sense when Ozzie and Harriet were at home with milk and cookies waiting for the kids, but not in today's America. More parents are working; kids are going home to empty houses and getting in trouble after school. 
   One might ask, Why doesn't the schoolday reflect the family day where parents might get home at 5:30, 6 o'clock, or after? Some schools adjust to that. Some schools provide that. Some schools need help. We have yet to come up with any suggestion here on Capitol Hill about afterschool programs responsive to the needs of today's working families. 
   I suppose taking summer vacations off was an idea that made sense in my home State of Illinois. After all, the kids did have to go work on the farm. But out of a State of 12 million people, we only have 75,000 farm families. Those children should be in another learning experience, another supervised experience so they are better students. If they are falling behind in reading and math, let them have remedial work during the summer. If they are good students, give them enrichment courses, teach them a musical instrument, or something new about science. Introduce them to computers. All the options and possibilities are there. Yet when you bring that up on Capitol Hill, you would think you were speaking a foreign language. People just cannot quite understand what we have to do with it. 
   I think we have a lot to do with it. That this Congress has been so derelict when it comes to the issue of education is a suggestion to me that we just don't get it. We are not listening to American families who identify education as their highest priority. We certainly are not reading history, which tells us education made the 20th century the American century because of our commitment to education. 
   Make no mistake about it; other countries around the world, in Europe, in parts of Asia, are starting to move forward. These are tomorrow's competitors. These are the people with whom our children will have to be ready to do business and with whom they will have to compete. If we are not prepared, they will pass us by. I don't want to see that happen to my children. I don't want to see that happen to this country. 
   The honest question we have to ask ourselves is, Does Congress get that message? If you look at the budget debate, it is pretty clear to me we have missed the point completely. We are now entangled in this terrible budget debate with the President. Thank goodness the Republican Party has abandoned this $750 billion or $800 billion tax cut for wealthy people. They took that out in August. They were going to go home with it and explain to the American people why this was the real important thing to do for America's future. It fell on its face. It had about as much popularity as the new Coca-Cola. They came back and said: We have given up on that idea. Maybe we will do it next year. 
   I hope they have walked away from it. But in abandoning that bad idea, why don't they pick up on a good idea like education? Why don't they join us in making certain the education funding bill is one that really is a source of pride rather than a source of embarrassment. At this point, unfortunately, we have seen that bill delayed. There have been absolutely no hearings on it and absolutely no effort being made, no initiative being shown, when it comes to improving education for the next generation. 
   I think the American people rightly give us that responsibility and ask us to meet it. It is a responsibility that should be shared on a bipartisan basis. The things I have suggested are not radical Democratic ideas. The things I have suggested I think would appeal to families of Democrats, Republicans, and Independents--all families who care about the future of their children. 
   I yield the floor hoping the debate soon will turn to these issues such as education, issues which most American families consider to be one of our highest priorities.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I urge colleagues to oppose the Bond amendment. This sets the stage for lead mining in the Mark Twain National Forest, one of the most beautiful recreational areas in the Midwest. This is opposed by the Governor of Missouri, the attorney general of Missouri, every major newspaper in the State, a score of different groups of citizens living in the area, as well as environmental groups. 
   To open this area to lead mining is to run the risk of making an industrial wasteland out of one of the most beautiful recreation areas in Missouri. It is an area shared by those of us who live in Illinois and in many other States. At the current time, the Department of the Interior has the authority to review this. What the Senator from Missouri is attempting to do is to circumvent that process. That should not happen. Please, preserve this land owned by the taxpayers of America, which should not be exploited for lead mining purposes.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered by Senator TORRICELLI. I listened carefully to the statement of my colleague from the State of Alaska. Having visited his State several times, I acknowledge they have an extraordinary situation that is unlike perhaps any other State across this Nation. I hope he will take into consideration what Senator TORRICELLI's amendment seeks to do is to really limit the use of this trap on national wildlife refuges. 
   I am not sure exactly how one would define a refuge, but in my way of thinking, it is akin to a shelter. It is something that has really been designed by law to provide a special kind of protection that might not otherwise be available to wildlife. That is why Senator TORRICELLI's amendment, I believe, is so appropriate because it is limited to the wildlife refuge and, secondly, it makes exceptions. 
   I understand what Senator STEVENS has said, that the subsistence exception would not cover commercial trapping on wildlife refuges, but I say to the Senator from Alaska, I think perhaps other forms of trapping should be used rather than this form. 
   I know the Senator from New Jersey is going to take the floor again and make a part of the RECORD a letter which was received after the letter quoted by the Senator from Alaska. I have a copy of it, and I will read from it. It is a letter from the Secretary of the Department of the Interior, Bruce Babbitt. It is written to the House sponsor of this legislation. It is very brief, and I will read it into the RECORD:  
   Dear Mr. Farr: 
   I am responding to your letter requesting the Department's position on your amendment relating to the use of certain kinds of traps on national wildlife refuges. The letter dated July 20, 1999, from Mr. John Rogers and the enclosed effect statement do not represent the position of the Department of the Interior. After careful consideration, I can advise you that your amendment--  
   The Farr amendment--  
   and the Torricelli amendment, which is identical, would not impact the ability of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to manage refuges under the Organic Act of 1997. Accordingly, the Department does not take a position on your amendment.  
   I say to those who are following this debate, the earlier reference to a letter of July 20 was superseded by a letter on July 23 from the Secretary of the Department of the Interior who said they will not take a position on the amendment and the Torricelli and Farr amendment do not in any way impact their ability to manage wildlife refuges. 
   I also remind those following the debate of Senator TORRICELLI's statement that some 88 nations across the world have already banned this form of trap. Many people are critical of Senators from New Jersey and Illinois who try to make comment on the way people live in the West. My friend from Montana, Senator BURNS, occasionally calls me aside when I offer these amendments related to Montana and the West and speaks of his Midwestern friends who do not quite understand the lifestyle of the West. I will concede, by classic definition, I am from a sodbuster State. I may not understand all the things that are part of the lifestyle of the West, but I call the attention of those who are considering this amendment to statements made in the press in Western States about these steel-jawed leghold traps. 
   Arizona, the Arizona Republic, February 7, 1993:  
   Outlawing the barbaric, needlessly cruel steel trap--a device that tortures animals to death--should no longer be a matter of serious dispute.  
   The Arizona Tribune, 1994:  
   No need for extremists to exaggerate what happens to an animal when a trap's steel jaws slam shut on it. It's more than inhumane; it's heinous.  
   Colorado, October 15, 1996, the Boulder Daily Camera:  
   The trapper hides the equivalent of a land mine in wildlife habitat and ``harvests'' whatever has the rotten luck to step in it.  
   From the Californian, October 8, 1998:  
   Laying a trap that statistically is more likely to maim or kill an animal other than the one being hunted is wasteful, inhumane, and cruel.  
   The Tucson Citizen 1993, Arizona:  
   Steel-jaw traps are cruel devices that subject animals--sometimes family pets--to mutilation or slow and painful death. And they pose a threat to people who use public lands for recreation. ..... Steel-jaw traps have no place in a civilized world, particularly on public lands.  
   Those were statements not from some bleeding heart eastern journals but from newspapers from the West--Arizona, Colorado, California--areas where I think they have even more familiarity with this than some Members of the Senate might themselves. 
   I have a couple photographs to demonstrate how these traps are used. You can see from this photograph that the  cat has had the misfortune of coming across a steel trap and its paw has been trapped inside. From what we have been told, it might be a day or two or maybe even more before the person who set this trap comes to decide what to do with the animal that is included. I don't know if this was the target animal this trapper was looking for. My guess is that this animal will be in pain and suffering until that trapper shows up on the scene to either release it or kill it. 
   Here is another photograph. It appears to be a fox trapped as well. There is evidence that many of the animals that are caught in these traps, in pain, in desperation chew off their own limbs to try to escape. Of course, as they hobble around the wilderness, they may not last long either. 
   These are basically and fundamentally inhumane. For us to allow them in wildlife refuges, I think, is a serious mistake. The amendment by the Senator from New Jersey is a reasonable one. It allows exceptions for research, subsistence, which the Senator from Alaska has alluded to, conservation, and facility protection. 
   When the Senator from Montana, Mr. BURNS, told the story of those in Montana who were trying to protect their flocks of sheep from coyotes that came out of the wildlife refuge, as I understand the amendment of the Senator from New Jersey, there would be no prohibition against their setting these traps on their own property to protect their flock from these predatory animals. The Torricelli amendment alludes only to putting these traps in wildlife refuges. I think, frankly, that is a line that should be drawn and one that I support. 
   As I have said, Secretary Bruce Babbitt has written to the Senate indicating the Torricelli amendment would have no adverse impact on the management of the Fish and Wildlife Service on refuges. The House has approved this amendment overwhelmingly on a bipartisan basis. Eighty-eight nations and a number of States have made it clear that this barbaric device has no place in wildlife management. 
   I urge support for the Torricelli amendment and yield the floor.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this is an amendment which addresses the question of grazing on public land. If you followed the debate on the Department of Interior appropriations bill over the last few days, and the weeks when we were in session before our August recess, you would see that we have an issue primarily between the Republican side of the aisle and the Democratic side of the aisle, a question of stewardship of public land. In virtually every amendment offered from the Democratic side there has been an attempt to make certain that the public lands are protected, that the value of the public lands are protected, and that America's taxpayers, who in fact own these public lands, are not shortchanged by those who would come in and use them. 
   Consistently on the other side the position has been, if someone wants to take the land of America, the land belonging to all Americans, our public land, and use it for grazing, drilling, mining, or logging, that there should be few or any restrictions and, second, that they should not pay an extraordinary amount of money for the privilege of taking profit off our public land. 
   This has been a clash of philosophy that has been visited on every single amendment in one form or another. It is a clear difference of opinion, primarily between the Republican side of the aisle and the Democratic side of the aisle. 
   There are those of us on the Democratic side who understand that these public lands, first and foremost, are a legacy that we inherited from previous generations and must leave in good shape for future generations. First and foremost, that is our obligation. 
   Second, if the lands are to be used for a practical purpose such as deriving income from logging or mining or grazing or drilling, the taxpayers of this Nation are entitled to fair compensation from those who would use the lands for commercial purposes. 
   We have had a lot of arguments about various aspects. This particular amendment goes to the question of grazing. The Bureau of Land Management, BLM, is an agency within the Department of the Interior which is entrusted with an extraordinary responsibility--to administer literally millions of acres of our Nation's valuable and diverse public lands located primarily in 12 Western States, including Alaska. 
   The BLM has an extraordinary responsibility when it comes to land management. It manages more Federal land than any other Federal agency. This agency, BLM, oversees 40 percent of our Nation's Federal lands, roughly 264 million acres of surface land. 
   But acres do not really tell the story. Our Nation's public lands contain a wealth of natural, cultural, historic, and economic resources that literally belong to every American. The natural and ecological diversity of BLM-managed public lands is perhaps the greatest of any Federal agency. The BLM manages grasslands, forest lands, islands, wild rivers, high mountains, Arctic tundra, desert landscapes, and virtually the spectrum of land primarily in the western part of the United States. As a result of this diversity of habitat, many thousands of wildlife and fish species occupy these lands. These fish and wildlife species represent a wealth of recreational, natural, and economic opportunities for local communities, States, and the Nation's hunters, sportsmen, and families. So the responsibility of the BLM is not only to watch this land but to 
   make certain that they preserve the resources given to them in the lands. 
   Grazing is the most extensive use of BLM lands in the lower 48. Of the roughly 179 million acres of BLM public lands outside of Alaska, grazing is  allowed on almost 164 million acres, and millions of these acres also contain valuable and sensitive fish, wildlife, archeological, recreation, and wilderness values. 
   At the present time, BLM authorizes, through the issuance of grazing permits, approximately 17,000 livestock operators to graze on these 164 million acres of public lands. These permits and the public land grazing they allow are important to thousands of western livestock operators who literally make their living by grazing their cattle on the public lands. Many of these operators use the permits they receive from the BLM to secure bank loans that provide important financial resources for their operations. 
   The BLM typically issues grazing permits for a 10-year period of time. Many of the current grazing permits were issued in the late 1980s and now are starting to expire in large numbers during a 2- or 3-year period. These permits, numbering in the thousands, present the BLM with an unusually large and burdensome short-term renewal workload. 
   The BLM reports that they face a workload of renewing some 5,300 grazing permits which will expire in fiscal year 1999. While the BLM will be able to handle the majority of these renewals during this fiscal year, it is anticipated that 1,000 of these expiring permits will have to be held over until the next fiscal year. In addition, the number of permits due to expire in that fiscal year is greater than average. As a result, the BLM will have a fiscal year 2000 workload of approximately 3,000 permit reviews. 
   I raise this point because we are trying to balance, with this amendment, two or three things: First, to make sure that those who make their livelihood by grazing livestock on public lands have an opportunity to renew their permits to secure the bank loans to continue their operations in a responsible way. That is reasonable. This amendment that is offered is consistent with that, and I think it will achieve that end. 
   On the other side of the ledger, and equally important from a public policy viewpoint, we believe that this Federal agency, the BLM, has a responsibility to look at the permits and view the land that is being used, the public land being used by private people, to make certain it is being adequately protected, protecting America's natural resource, the millions of acres of public land that we as a nation own. How does the BLM do that? 
   When they reissue these permits for grazing, they take a look at the land to determine what has been the impact of the grazing: Is there too much grazing in one particular area? Are there things that need to be changed in terms of the terms and condition of the grazing to protect America's natural assets, these public lands? 
   Superimpose over this balance this workload I have just described. BLM now has more permits to renew than is usually the case, and there is some uncertainty among those who are asking for permits as to whether BLM can do their job in an expeditious fashion. It is my understanding that last year we extended permits by a year. We decided because of the workload that we wanted the permit holders to know they could continue to have their permits even if they had not been individually reviewed by the BLM. 
   My amendment says that the extension will be for 2 years or, if the BLM is able to do the review, sooner, which gives assurance to the landholder that they will have the permit and they can go to the banker and say: We have at least 2 years on this, perhaps longer. 
   At the same time, it says to the BLM: Don't shirk your responsibility; you are supposed to review these permits, guard America's natural assets, and make sure the public land is not exploited. 
   The purpose of my amendment is to strike this balance to give to the permit holders the additional 2 years and to say to the BLM: Still do your job, protect these assets, make the environmental reviews that are necessary, and open it for public hearing as required. 
   The on-the-ground, permit level decisionmaking that should legally accompany BLM's permit renewal process is fundamentally important to the ecologically sound, multiple-use management of our Nation's public lands. The BLM must conduct what is known as National Environment Policy Act compliance--shorthand, in Federal jargon, NEPA, National Environmental Policy Act--and land use plan performance reviews before reauthorizing the permits. 
   To meet the review requirements of NEPA and other existing Federal laws and regulations and to meet the diverse demands of the American public, the BLM uses interdisciplinary teams composed of agency professionals in wildlife, range, wild horse and burro, cultural, recreation, wilderness, and other areas. The BLM also solicits public comment and relevant information from the wide array of the public interested in range management, including hunters, fishermen, and others who enjoy our public lands. 
   The simple fact is this: On most public land grazing allotments, all the important decisions that determine the condition of public rangeland resources are contained in the terms and conditions of the grazing permits and in the annual decision about the amount, timing, and location of livestock grazing. 
   These decisions determine whether streams and riparian areas will flourish or be degraded, whether the wildlife habitat will be maintained, protected, or destroyed. Public involvement in this process is essential for balanced public land management. Without the application of NEPA and related laws, the American public literally has no voice in public rangeland management. 
   The unusually large number of permits that need to be 
   renewed have created a dual dilemma for the Bureau and for its many public constituents. Western livestock operators who currently hold these expiring permits are worried that delays in the Bureau's processing time may cause them to lose their permits or otherwise threaten their ability to use them to secure loans and make a living. 
   Conservationists meanwhile believe the Bureau ought to perform responsibly the environmental stewardship and analysis aspects of its grazing management and permit renewal activities. 
   It is not the ranchers' fault that such a large number of permits are expiring at once. If anyone were to blame, it would be BLM, the agency, which should have recognized this and addressed the problem sooner. 
   I am not certain whether we provided the resources, incidentally, so they could do that, but certainly it should have been called to the attention of Congress. 
   BLM has a duty to all public land users, ranchers, conservationists, and others to provide orderly and balanced management of our public land resources. 
   It is entirely understandable to me, being from the State of Illinois, that ranchers are concerned about the issues of security and predictability. My farmers face the same thing. Likewise, we require the BLM to wisely manage and protect our public lands for all Americans. In the face of these concerns, a balance must be struck. The good news, I submit, is that these two concerns can be handled in a mutually inclusive fashion. 
   The substitute language I am offering addresses the ranchers' needs for the Bureau to process grazing permits in a timely fashion and in a manner by which ranching operations and financial operations will not be needlessly disrupted. 
   I want to hold BLM's feet to the fire, make them do their job right. I want them to solve the backlog of expiring permits. I want them to deal in a fair and forthright way with ranchers. And I want them to apply our Nation's environmental laws so that public rangelands are protected for all to use and enjoy. 
   As I seek to protect ranchers from operational uncertainty due to bureaucratic delays, I also want to address the concerns raised by conservationists that the Bureau's equally necessary environmental analysis and resource protection duties move forward. 
   The current language in the bill, if I am not mistaken, was inserted by Senator DOMENICI of New Mexico. This language, unfortunately, provides an unnecessarily controversial, open-ended, and uncertain response to this problem. Clearly, the language in the bill, which I seek to change, is pitting conservationists against ranchers, and that is needless. 
   Ironically, I am concerned the language in the bill at this time, as drafted, will actually undercut both the  ranchers and the conservationists. The actual permit renewal and environmental protection problem at hand is tightly defined and should be remedied with a tightly defined and effective solution. 
   Nevertheless, section 117 in the bill, as drafted, would apply to permits that have or will expire in ``this or any fiscal year''--any fiscal year. 
   Consider that for a moment--not just those that would expire during the term of this appropriations bill, but any fiscal year. Given the tightly defined 2- to 3-year nature of 
   the current issue, this section provides an open-ended timeframe that is excessive and unnecessary. Instead of responding to the current real and specific crisis, section 117 in the bill virtually writes a new policy for permits that expire in this or any fiscal year. 
   I think that goes way beyond what we need to accomplish in this legislation. Section 117 provides a loosely drafted, open-ended delay of application of NEPA, the environmental law, and many other laws. 
   Given the facts of the issue at hand and the importance of maintaining adequate environmental protections and reviews for public land management decisions, section 117 is far too sweeping in its effect. As written in the current law, section 117 would actually provide the Bureau of Land Management with an incentive to delay the application of NEPA and other laws. 
   Because the Senator from New Mexico does not put a time certain as to when these permits will end, putting pressure on BLM to do its job, I am afraid we are going to have literally no review, and that is not in the best long-term interest of protecting America's public lands, which is the second half of this equation that we have to balance if we are going to be fair both to ranchers and to conservationists and Americans at large. 
   Section 117 also undercuts meaningful opportunities for public involvement in the range management process. Because it requires the BLM to reissue permits under their current terms and conditions for an indefinite period of time, it effectively eliminates effective public input. As a result of these and other problems, the existing section 117 is adamantly opposed by a wide array of groups that include the National Wildlife Federation, Defenders of Wildlife, Natural Resources Defense Council, and the Wilderness Society. 
   If enacted as written, section 117 could well cause the Bureau to maintain expiring grazing permits in sort of a bureaucratic limbo indefinitely. Ranchers might find themselves holding a permit of uncertain tenure instead of ultimately receiving the clearly defined permit that would be required under my amendment. Section 117, therefore, could well create a situation that would actually harm the economic certainty of ranching operations in the West. 
   We need to find a workable solution. We must not give the BLM the ability to delay its important permit renewal activities indefinitely. Congress must act to place the Bureau on a schedule to accomplish its work in a timely fashion to renew the permits. We need not--we must not--create a system that sacrifices either legitimate rancher concerns or environmental protection. We have to hold the BLM's feet to the fire. We must treat public land ranchers fairly, and we must protect the environment. We do not need to sacrifice one for the other, and I fear the existing language of section 117 does just that. 
   My intent is to ensure that the Bureau will be able to bring the current permit renewal situation under control by the end of fiscal year 2001, 2 years from now. 
   Additionally, I propose we extend the tenure permits which have expired in fiscal year 1999, or will expire in fiscal year 2000 or 2001, until the end of fiscal year 2001 or until the necessary environmental analysis under NEPA and other laws is completed, whichever comes first. This says to a rancher, you know with certainty if the Durbin amendment is adopted that your permit will be extended at least to the end of fiscal year 2001, and if in the interim BLM has done its job, it could be extended longer. 
   That gives them something to go to the bank with, that they can, in fact, secure loans and continue their ranching operations. This amendment provides the ranching community and financial institutions certainty that these permits will not lapse during reprocessing. This amendment will provide continued assurance to the American public that their lands are being protected. It provides a real solution, not a controversial stopgap approach. 
   I based my proposal on the permit language that Congress adopted as part of the Interior appropriations law for fiscal year 1999, as well as current House and Senate versions of this bill. My language closely resembles a solution that Congress passed as part of the 1995 rescissions bill to address a similar permit renewal problem faced by the Forest Service. In the rescissions bill, Congress placed the Forest Service on a fixed-year schedule to bring their grazing permits into compliance with NEPA. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this balanced approach to the management and protection of our Nation's public lands. 
   I understand the backlog and the workload faced by the BLM. As I said, it is extraordinary in its scope. I also understand the challenges that face the ranchers and those who depend on these permits for their livelihood. I think we have struck a balance, a balance which should give some assurance on the one hand to the ranchers about the future of their permits, and give assurance to the public and conservationists that these natural resources are being protected. 
   I have two illustrations of why this is a particularly important issue. These photos were taken on BLM land and give a good indication of what can happen with proper land management and what happens when it doesn't occur. Notice on the left-hand side this overgrazed riparian area, Road Canyon in southeast Utah. There is hardly anything left, sand and gravel. 
   On the other side is Grand Gulch, where it has been properly managed. There is a good stand of grass. This is important for many reasons. If we are going to protect these lands and make certain that we have grazing opportunities for years and years to come, we have to manage them. My farmers in the Midwest have to manage their lands every year, decide what to plant, where to plant, what to apply to make certain the land will be ready after this crop for another crop. Basically, the Bureau of Land Management has that responsibility when it comes to our public lands. 
   They allow these ranchers to come and graze but under terms and conditions so they can say to the American people: Next year, 10 years from now, we will have protected your assets, your resources, for your use as well as the use of future ranchers. Overgrazing has severely degraded riparian areas in Comb Wash. As a result of many years of overgrazing, much of the natural streambank vegetation has been stripped away, leaving either bare soil or undesirable plants such as snakeweed and tumbleweed that invade overgrazed areas. Because of the overgrazing, severe stream channel erosion has occurred, and water tables have dropped. 
   Annual grazing permits issued by BLM allow this degradation to occur. If they keep renewing the permits on an annual basis instead of stepping back from time to time and looking at the impact, you can see that, frankly, we are going to have bad results. The language in the bill, which I amend, section 117, would continue this degradation indefinitely. Once we have run these resources down to bare rock, what good is it to the 
   ranchers? Literally, they have to be certain they have a resource to turn to in decades to come so they have some assurance of their own livelihood. It is in their best interest to protect this resource as well with reasonable permits. 
   When you take a look at this healthy riparian area, as illustrated in the other photo, Grand Gulch, you can see the difference. This area had, again, been arrested from grazing for 20 years. In Grand Gulch, there was a healthy streamside ecosystem. The stream channels are stable, protected from erosion by vegetation. Sound grazing management decisions by BLM would allow more riparian areas across the West to return to healthier conditions. 
   This has been a controversial area and is a clear illustration of why we need to have the annual review by BLM consistent with NEPA standards.  
   The second photo shows a similar story. The ecological condition of the Santa Maria River in western Arizona has improved dramatically as a result of permit management practices under the National Environmental Policy Act. It is important to note the BLM continues to allow grazing in this area. However, it has changed the timing of this grazing. BLM is not at war with the ranchers but trying to make sure that it manages the Nation's resources on these public lands in a responsible fashion. 
   As a result of environmental reviews, the grazing permits on the Santa Maria River now contain terms and conditions requiring livestock to be kept out of the riparian areas during the spring and summer growing seasons. 
   The Santa Maria River is a rarity: a free-flowing river in the midst of a vast, hot, low-elevation desert. The riparian corridor provides essential habitat for dozens of species of wildlife, including 15 species that are listed by Federal or State agencies as threatened, endangered, or other special status. The riparian area of the Santa Maria and its ability to support wildlife were severely degraded by many years of uncontrolled, unmanaged livestock grazing in the river corridor. The vegetation was stripped away. The water was polluted. Streambanks were trampled. Miles of riparian area were nearly as barren as the surrounding desert. 
   For decades, the BLM issued and renewed grazing permits to ranchers along the Santa Maria River with no terms and conditions to protect riparian areas. Even though the BLM developed a land use plan that required the river to be arrested from livestock grazing, the requirement was never incorporated in grazing permits. 
   It illustrates the point to be made: The existing language in the bill, which I seek to amend, extends indefinitely these grazing permits under the terms and conditions currently existing. If there is a need to step in and to protect an area such as this from being degraded and destroyed for future generations, the language of the bill does not provide for it. My amendment does. It says the permits will be extended to 2 years; if there is an intervening environmental review, even longer but under terms and conditions consistent with good environment and public input. 
   In the late 1980s, a portion of the Santa Maria River received an unplanned reprieve from grazing because the rancher holding the permit went bankrupt and had to sell his cattle. The result of 3 years of rest from grazing can be seen in this second photograph. It is night and day between this dry river 
   bed and this creek, which we can see, this riparian area, which has good growth and a stand of grass. 
   The riparian vegetation has returned. The streambanks are starting to rebuild. The water is cleaner, as are other portions of the river. In the early 1990s, the bankrupt rancher sold out to a new rancher who wanted to restock the river corridor with cattle. The BLM proposed to transfer the grazing permit to the new rancher with no NEPA analysis, no public review. The transferred permit would have had the same terms and conditions as the old permit: year-round grazing in the riparian area with no measure to protect or restore riparian vegetation and wildlife habitat. 
   A number of individuals and organizations challenged the BLM decision to renew the permit without a NEPA review. As a result, grazing permits on the Santa Maria contained terms and conditions requiring that livestock be kept out of this area during spring and summer growing seasons. 
   If section 117 is enacted as written in the law, such permit level management changes will be much more difficult to achieve. 
   I see other Members wishing to speak to this amendment. I can certainly return to this debate after they have had their opportunity, but I do believe it is in the best interest of those who value these public lands as a natural resource of assets for America and those who see them as a livelihood to come together and reach a commonsense agreement. 
   The existing language in the bill, which I would amend, gives the ranchers the upper hand. It says: Your permit is renewed indefinitely. We may never return to the question of whether or not your grazing rights should be changed to protect this particular creek bed from becoming part of the desert. That is not in the best interest of the rancher involved, nor in the best interest of the people of the United States who literally own this land. It is another question, another environmental rider which addresses the basic philosophy I mentioned at the beginning of this debate. 
   There was an unusual breakdown in point of view between the Republican side of the aisle and the Democratic side of the aisle. It is hard for me, as I study history, to believe that the party of Theodore Roosevelt, which, frankly, initiated the creation of such things as the Yosemite National Park and our National Park System, would now take such a different point of view when it comes to guarding the value of these resources. It would seem to me to be bipartisan, nonpartisan, for us to agree that if these public lands are to be used, they should be used safely, responsibly, and in a way so that future generations could have that benefit. 
   But time and again, these environmental riders that come to us, whether they are for logging, drilling, mining, whatever it happens to be, have come to us with the suggestion that the public interest should be secondary to the private exploitation of the land. I think that is wrong. I think the balance should be struck. It is not only in the best interest of this country, it is in the best interest of everyone living in the western part of the United States. The amendment I have offered has been supported by virtually every major environmental group: The Wilderness Society, National Wildlife Federation, Natural Resources Defense Council, Trout Unlimited, Friends of the Earth, American Land Alliance, and others. 
   I sincerely hope my friends from the West, the Senator from New Mexico, and the Senators from Idaho and Wyoming, will look carefully at this amendment and realize that it is a positive one; it is not negative in nature. It is an attempt to resolve this in a fair and balanced way.

   Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I know the Senator from Idaho can use those 9 seconds very effectively, as we have seen in the past. 
   I readily acknowledge to my colleagues from the Western States that their knowledge of the subject is greater than mine. They live in these areas. They deal with these problems on a regular basis. I have tried to make it clear with this amendment that I am not seeking to end this part of the western economy, the use of public lands for grazing purposes. I am not one of those. 
   Someone in the course of the debate said there are some environmental organizations so radical that they would stop grazing on public lands. That is not my position. I do not know if it is a position of any of the groups that have endorsed this amendment. 
   What I am trying to do is find a consistent way of 
   protecting the privilege given to private people to use public lands for grazing while still protecting the value of those public lands. 
   There are several things that have been said during the debate which just baffle me. I want to at least express myself on those and invite my colleagues during the course of my comments to perhaps ask a question or make a comment if they care to. 
   The first is the argument that unless a rancher can go to a bank and say to the bank, I have the right to graze on this land for at least 3 years or more, that rancher cannot secure a loan for his operation. We have heard this repeatedly. My amendment would extend these permits for 2 years. 
   Critics of the amendment have stood up and said that is not enough; no rancher can secure the money for his ranching operation with only 2 years of certainty. Yet, isn't it odd, as we listen to the debate, that those on the other side have conceded that many of these ranchers are dealing with 10-year permits which do expire. So these ranchers have faced this time and again. There has always been the second to the last year and the last year of the permit when they had to finance their operations. This is nothing new. What we are saying is give them 2 years with certainty. 
   We have also heard it said that the Bureau of Land Management could step in under extraordinary circumstances and amend the terms and conditions of the permits. One of the suggestions was to reduce the number of animal units or cattle that could be grazing on a certain piece of land because of environmental concerns. I hear in that suggestion that the terms and conditions of these permits can also be changed unilaterally during the course of the permit and that these ranchers continue to do business, continue to secure loans. 
   Those who argue on the other side against my amendment, saying we need drop-dead certainty of 3 years or more or we cannot do business, really, I think, have in the course of their own debate put a mockery on the table when it comes to that argument. We know these permits expire, and we know they expire in short order, 1 or 2 years to go, and these ranchers stay in business, as they should. 
   I also suggest someone has said: We are not about the business of putting pressure on the BLM to do their job. I disagree. I believe it is our responsibility as Senators entrusted with these assets of the Nation, these public lands, to say to the Bureau of Land Management: You have a job to do here as well, not just to give a permit to a rancher but to make certain that permit is consistent with protecting public lands, and if you do not do that, we are going to be on your case, we are going to put the pressure on you. 
   Let me step back for a second and tell my colleagues what I think the real concern is. I think there are many who hope the BLM will not do their job. They would just as soon renew the permits, the terms and conditions, indefinitely and not take into consideration these environmental concerns. That may be their point of view; it is not one I share. 
   What I try to achieve by this amendment in a 2-year extension is to say to the BLM: Get your job done, too; protect the ranchers for 2 years, but get your job done, too, to make sure that permit is consistent with the environmental laws of the land. I do not think that is wrong. 
   Let me also add, the Senator from New Mexico has read 
   letters into the RECORD of ranchers of humble means who write to his office concerned about their future. I have farmers in similar circumstances. I know that type of plaintive letter. I receive them in my  office, and I have sympathy for men and women working hard for a living who ask those of us in Washington: Don't make anything more difficult; try to help us if you can. 
   Remember last year when we addressed this problem what our solution was? A 1-year extension. The Durbin amendment is a 2-year extension. I do not think this is hard-hearted or heartless on my part. In fact, it is an effort to offer twice as much in terms of certainty as was offered by this Congress last year. So say to the BLM at the same time, do your job and renew these permits in the right way. 
   For those who argue that I just do not understand it, I am not sympathetic, I do not have sufficient compassion for the situation, I suggest that last year a 1-year extension was considered sensible, reasonable, and compassionate. Now a 2-year extension is not. I do not follow that logic, that reasoning on the other side. 
   The final point I will make is this: My concern is that in this debate the environmental issue is an afterthought, it is secondary. There are many who are determined to renew permits for ranchers to continue to use public lands and care not when or if BLM meets its responsibility. I do not agree with that point of view. I think both sides have to be taken into consideration. There has to be a balance, as offered by this amendment. 
   For those who argue the existing language which Senator DOMENICI put in the bill preserves this environmental protection, I tell them that virtually every major environmental group in America endorses the Durbin amendment because they understand that it puts in place a mechanism which not only gives the ranchers a new permit and extends for 2 years those that are expiring but says to the BLM: Do your job, too; you have a responsibility of stewardship as well. 
   That is why the environmental groups support this amendment. That is why those who vote to table this amendment are basically saying: We believe the needs and requirements of the ranchers are paramount to the needs and requirements of the American people in the future of their public lands. I disagree with that, and I hope those on both sides of the aisle will take a close look at it when it comes up for this vote. 
   I conclude by saying this amendment strikes a balance which is reasonable, which acknowledges that private individuals and their families and businesses can continue to use public land for grazing and can do it for 2 years if their permit is expiring but says at the same time to the BLM: Do your job; make certain that you supervise those lands in a way that we can say to future generations, those lands will be intact long after we have come and gone so the American people will realize we met our obligation of stewardship of their natural assets. 
   I yield the floor.

And the language we have in the bill is consistent with the language which was passed last year by those who wanted a 1-year extension. It is consistent with the language in the House as well. So we have not changed any of the language in the bill in that regard.

<DOCNO>106-durbin-il-7-19990908</DOCNO>

   Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator from California, let's consider two possibilities. If the royalty is based on the price of oil, there is a possibility that the royalty payments might go down if it is recalculated; there is a possibility that it might stay the same, or it might go up. 
   But I take it from this amendment that the oil companies that are pushing this amendment are so certain that their payments to the Federal Government are going to go up that they want to stop the Federal Government from recalculating the royalties. 
   The net impact of this, and the Senator from California can correct me, is that the oil companies are being protected from paying their fair share of rent or royalties for using public lands, and the taxpayers, because of this amendment, are the losers. We are the ones who do not get the royalties back from those who want to drill all the oil out of land that we own and not pay the taxpayers of this country for the right to do so.

   Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator, it is my understanding from her previous statement that many of the States have sued the oil companies saying: You didn't pay enough. You owed us more in royalties. You underpaid the amount you were required to pay for drilling for oil on federally owned public lands for profit.

   Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator from California, as a followup question, so I understand it completely, these private oil companies go on to public lands, drill for oil which they sell for a profit. They are charged a royalty based on the price of the oil. The impact of this amendment by the Senator from Texas would be to say to the Department of the Interior: You cannot recalculate the royalty to raise it. So we are protecting these oil companies from an increase in what they are going to pay taxpayers for drilling on public land, which means more money in their pocket. The losers are not only Federal taxpayers but States such as Texas and California and their taxpayers who lose the benefits of the money that might come back to them from these royalties?

   I ask the Senator from California, isn't it odd that on an appropriations bill we are considering a string of riders that are of such import and controversy, putting them on a spending bill instead of having a hearing so the oil companies could come in and try to defend, if they would like to, so the Department of the Interior can come in and basically explain why they think taxpayers across America are ripped off by this amendment? It seems to me to be an odd state of affairs that we have seven, eight, or nine different riders on this bill which really go to important, substantive issues that have not been addressed by this Congress during the course of this year. Does the Senator agree with me that this is an exceptional procedural issue to be taking up on a spending bill?

We are talking about welfare ``tankers'' here--$11 million--or $66 million going to these major oil companies. I say to the Senator from California, how many times have we done this? How many times have we postponed this decision by the Department of the Interior to give to the taxpayers of this country the fair share they are entitled to for these oil companies to use our lands--the lands of people who live in Illinois, California, Idaho, and Texas--to drill oil. How many times has the industry come in and, with an amendment similar to the one before us, tried to stop this recalculation?

<TEXT>
   Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair for recognition. I misspoke earlier. I wish to speak to the Bond amendment, not the Robb amendment. 
   The Bond amendment is another one of these legislative riders on spending bills. It is an attempt to change environmental policy with an amendment to the appropriations bill for the Department of the Interior. The reason it is being done this way, of course, is it avoids any committee hearing, any opportunity for any witnesses or public input. 
   There are seven, eight, or nine different environmental riders that have been attached to this spending bill. The administration has indicated that unless they are removed, there is a strong likelihood that an otherwise good bill will be vetoed by the President because riders, such as the one I am about to address, go way too far. 
   One might wonder why I am addressing the issue of a national forest in Missouri since I represent the State of Illinois. I am from downstate Illinois. I was born in East St. Louis, and the Ozarks are an important recreational area for everyone who lives in the region. It is not only a regional treasure but a national treasure which has been recognized by a designation as a national forest. 
   Last year, the attorney general of Missouri, Jay Nixon, joined environmental groups in petitioning the Secretary of the Interior asking him under his authority, under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, to remove from access to mining 400,000 acres in the Mark Twain National Forest. 
   Those of us who live in that region know this is an especially popular area of the Ozarks. The watersheds of the Current, Jacks Fork, and Eleven Point Rivers are in this region. Many of my friends and family go to the Ozarks for canoeing. They love it because of its pristine beauty, and they believe the attorney general, Jay Nixon, was correct when he petitioned the Secretary of the Interior to preserve this area and to stop it from being used for lead mining. 
   This is Federal public land that a private company, a lead mining company, wants to come in and mine for profit. The Interior Department has the authority to say no, it is important environmentally and we should not allow this kind of commercial use. That is what they would do were it not for the amendment being offered by the Senator from Missouri. 
   The Senator from Missouri, Mr. BOND, wants to remove the authority of the Department of the Interior to protect the Mark Twain National Forest from lead mining. Is this a popular concept? It probably is with some companies. Not only the attorney general of Missouri but the Governor of Missouri has written protesting this action being taken by this Bond amendment. 
   Governor Mel Carnahan from Jefferson City, MO, has written and said:  
   I believe you will agree the watersheds of the Current, Jacks Fork and Eleven Point rivers are among the most beautiful and pristine areas of Missouri. These crystal clear streams are great recreational assets which should be protected for future generations to enjoy.  
   He goes on to say:  
   The environmental risk of lead mining and potential for toxic contamination of these pristine waterways are well understood. The Interior Secretary's authority to protect sensitive public lands should be preserved.  
   He says to my colleague from Missouri:  
   I respectfully request you withdraw your amendment.  
   But that amendment has not been withdrawn. It will be voted on tomorrow. 
   I can say further there are groups across Missouri that oppose this invasion of a pristine area, a watershed of the Mark Twain National Forest, for the purpose of lead mining. The St. Louis Post Dispatch, the largest newspaper in the State, has editorialized against this and has said, frankly, that this is an effort to allow this company to come in and mine an area which is of critical importance to the people of Missouri. 
   The Kansas City Star, an equally influential paper, has come to the same conclusion that the Bond amendment is a mistake, a mistake which threatens the watersheds of the crystal clear streams of the Current, Jacks Fork, and Eleven Point Rivers. 
   For those who believe this lead mining operation is somehow antiseptic and will not leave a legacy, I say they are wrong, and the scientific studies have proven that. We know what is going to happen if we allow these companies to come in and mine lead in this beautiful area. We know the potential for contaminating the streams. We know the potential for leaving behind the waste from their mining operations. 
   Some might argue that it is worth it because it creates jobs, and yet study after study reaches the opposite conclusion. 
   This is primarily a tourist area, a recreational area recognized all around the Midwest. To defile it with lead mining to create a handful of jobs for mining purposes is to jeopardize the attraction of this area for literally thousands of people in the Midwest and across the Nation. That is why it is such a serious mistake. I daresay if this amendment had been offered on an ordinary bill, there would have been a long line of people to come in and testify, not only environmentalists who  oppose the Bond amendment, but certainly those who are in authority in the State of Missouri, Governor Mel Carnahan, Attorney General Jay Nixon, as well as many other groups of ordinary citizens who believe this is a national treasure that should not be defiled so one company can make a profit. 
   On the spending bill for the Department of the Interior, this is another one of the environmental riders designed to benefit a private interest at the expense of American taxpayers who own this public land, at the expense of families who enjoy this recreational area, at the expense of people who look forward to a weekend on the Current River because of its beauty. 
   Frankly, this is a big mistake, and I hope the Senator from Missouri will have second thoughts before he calls it up for a vote tomorrow morning. I hope he will listen carefully to the leaders in the State, as well as the environmental groups, who are standing up for one of the most precious resources in Missouri. 
   I hope he will join them in saying the Mark Twain National Forest and the watershed of these great rivers are worth protecting, worth preserving, and should not be allowed to be invaded by a lead mining company that wants to come in and mine on Federal public lands at the expense of this great national resource. 
   Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this amendment. In a way, I am grateful this amendment has come to the floor. I think this Senate should go on record: Will we decide to go on the course suggested by Senator ASHCROFT of Missouri and Senator SMITH of New Hampshire and say there will be no funding of the arts in America, that we have decided now at this moment in our history that we will walk away from governmental assistance to the artists across America who are starting out and trying to develop their own skills? 
   I think that is an important question. I know as well as those listening to the debate that over the last 10 or 12 years there has been a lot of controversy about the National Endowment for the Arts. There have been some controversial grants, grants for art projects which I personally found reprehensible. 
   The bottom line is, it is as wrong to condemn the National Endowment for the Arts because of one or two grants as it is to condemn any Member of the Senate for one or two votes. Each Member can make a mistake. Each Member can do something unpopular. Each Member can do the wrong thing in the eyes of the public. Yet to condemn Members as individuals is just not fair, just, or American. Nor is it fair for Members to condemn the National Endowment for the Arts for things that were done many years ago. 
   Over the last several years, it has been my good fortune to be a nonvoting member of the National Council of the Arts, meeting every 6 months to review the applications for assistance to the NEA. Several Members of the Senate and the House of Representatives have shared in that responsibility. It has been an eye-opener to sit as I have with men and women from across 
   America and to consider those who come to the National Endowment for the Arts asking for assistance. 
   Listening to the speeches on the floor, one would think that these are people who come in with some grand political agenda or they are looking for some big government seal of approval. That is not the case at all. By and large, these are creative people looking for an opportunity. Some of the opportunities which they have presented as a result of the National Endowment for the Arts are amazing in their scope. 
   Think of the impact if we eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts.  Let me tell Members about one particular program. I am sorry the Senator from Missouri cannot hear this because I think he would appreciate it since he was born in the city of Chicago. I think he would understand the importance of this program. 
   In my home State of Illinois there is a program called the Merit Music Program. The Merit Music Program is an exceptional effort inspired by one lady who decided that she would try to reach down to the poorest schools in the city of Chicago and find those kids who had music potential. What she has done over the years is to literally bring in hundreds of kids each year who learn how to play a musical instrument. These are kids who live in some of the poorest housing in Chicago, and their most prized possession will be a violin, a clarinet. They will develop musical skills. 
   Each year, I try to attend their recital on Saturday while kids from kindergarten on up play their musical instruments. It is an amazing performance from kids who come from the poorest families. It is a performance that is made possible by the National Endowment for the Arts. 
   These kids get a chance to learn to play a musical instrument. One might say, well, that is a nice hobby; what can it mean? When we follow these kids through their music education, what do we find? Every single one of these kids goes to college. These kids, given a chance at artistic expression, not only have wonderful fulfillment, they have ambition. They decide they can rise above what they have seen around them in their neighborhoods. That is what art and music can do. 
   I am almost at a loss for words--which is something to say for a Senator--when I hear those on the other side of the aisle stand and say: Well, what good is this? Why would we do this? Why would we encourage this? 
   In downtown Chicago we have a block that has become known as Gallery 37. In the Loop in Chicago it stands out. It is ultimately going to be developed by some big company, I am sure. Over the last several years, we have decided that Gallery 37 will be an artistic opportunity for kids all across Chicago, kids who can show their artistic wares, who can learn skills in art, and perhaps even be trained for jobs in art. It really has become a magnificent undertaking of that community that reaches out all across Chicago. The rich, the poor, the black, the white, the brown, all come together--Gallery 37, National Endowment for the Arts. 
   If you go home to your community in your State, whatever it might be, I guarantee you will find the recipients of the grants from the National Endowment for the Arts are not some people living in these ivory towers but, rather, the folks living in your community. Does your city have a local symphony orchestra? My guess is, if not this year, then at some year in the past, the National Endowment for the Arts has helped that symphony orchestra. Does your school system have an art program that encourages kids and moves them along? Many of those programs across America receive assistance from the National Endowment for the Arts. 
   The National Endowment for the Arts last year received $98 million out of a Federal budget of about $1.7 trillion. We took $98 million to give to the National Endowment for the Arts. That is a lot of money; I will concede that point. In the context of the big Federal budget, though, it is a very tiny piece. But it is a piece of Federal spending that is used to encourage artistic creation and expression. 
   Of what value is that expression to those of us who are simply art consumers? Let me tell you a personal story. My mother was an immigrant to this country. She came at the age of 2 from Lithuania with her mother and grew up in East St. Louis, IL. She made it to the eighth grade, and that is when she had to stop and go to work as a switchboard operator at a telephone 
   company. She raised me and my two brothers, and she was a woman who was always trying to learn and to appreciate things. I would like to tell the Senator from Missouri, Mr. ASHCROFT, she used to put us in the family car on a Sunday afternoon and we would go across the bridge to the St. Louis Art Museum, and my mother and I would walk through there looking at paintings. Frankly, she had no knowledge of art, but she knew what she liked and appreciated. How many Sunday afternoons we walked through there and I looked at those paintings. As a kid, I was totally bored. As I got a little older, I came to appreciate them. But here she was, a simple woman, immigrant woman, a blue-collar worker, who thought it was important her son see art and what it stands for. 
   So when I hear the arguments made that this is unfair to blue-collar workers across America, to ask them to take a tiny fraction of their Federal taxes and devote it to the arts, I think those critics miss the point. Visit museums on The Mall here in Washington or in any city across America, and I guarantee you will see a cross-section of American life, the rich and the poor, the educated and the uneducated, all appreciating what art can bring to our lives. This is not something for which we should apologize. It is something we should be proud of. The legacy we will leave in America for future generations is not just a legacy of concrete and steel; it is a legacy of art as well. 
   Those who visit countries around the world, wherever they may be, usually stop first at the art museums because they want to see the collections. It says something about the value of art when it comes to civilization. To think we would take a step backwards on the floor of the Senate today and decide we will no longer, after years and years, provide assistance and money for the arts is unthinkable. It is unthinkable. In a way, I appreciate the opportunity to have this amendment. Let's have a record vote. Let's see how many people here want to join a group which basically says that the United States of America, with all of its richness, with all of its diversity, cannot afford $98 million to encourage the arts. 
   Let me tell you about another art project that received a decoration, an award from the National Endowment for the Arts. It is called Street Level Art, and it is an amazing thing. It is in the city of Chicago again. Two young men who worked for advertising agencies decided they just didn't quite like going to work 9 to 5 every day. They wanted to do something more. So they gathered together equipment from people who were getting new versions of computers and videotape machines and the like. They put it in a little storefront on Chicago Avenue, and they invited kids from junior high and high school across Chicago to come after school to learn how to make documentary films and to do animation for cartoons. 
   I met a young lady there who lived on the south side of Chicago who literally had to take three buses after school to get to the Street Level Art Program, but she was so excited at the prospect of developing her skills, her creativity in art. This is another group that received an award from the National Endowment for the Arts. For Senators to come to the floor and say get Government out of this business is to basically say do not get the seed money to Street Level, don't give the seed money to Gallery 37, don't give the seed money to Merit music. If we did, if we said we are going to close the door and turn out the lights on Government involvement for the arts, 
   would we be a better nation for that? I do not think so. 
   I think, frankly, the National Endowment for the Arts has done an excellent job. It has learned some valuable political lessons over the last several years. It is unfortunate the sponsors of this amendment do not concede that point and they cannot join the other Members of the Senate to come with me to these meetings twice a year to see what is involved because not only education programs but children's festivals, literary programs, orchestras, museums, dance companies, all receive a helping hand from this National Endowment for the Arts. 
   I see Senator SESSIONS from Alabama on the floor here. He has joined me at meetings of the National Endowment. The President has proposed a program. It is called ``Challenge America.'' A point made by Senator SESSIONS at one of our meetings, and a valid one, was that the National Endowment for the Arts should reach out into communities which have not traditionally been served and helped by the National Endowment, and they are doing that. I think that is the right thing to do because we can encourage artistic expression in the rural areas of Alabama and the rural areas of Illinois. I think we will be better for it.  
   Unfortunately, this bill does not provide a great deal of funding for that, but the bottom line is that it is a concept we should pursue in this country. As it stands, this is still in the concept stage, but it is an important concept, particularly when it comes to educating and reaching out to young people at risk of dropping out of school or becoming delinquent or abusing drugs. 
   We spend so much time here on the floor wrestling with problems that American families are worried over, not the least of which was the shooting at Columbine High School in Littleton, CO. We are trying to read and study and speak among ourselves and say: What is going on in the minds of these children that they would become so violent, grab a gun, and shoot at their classmates? 
   Even though I am a parent and proud of the three children my wife and I raised, and our grandchild, I do not consider myself a specialist in this area. But I do remember from my own life experience, watching my kids grow up, if you give a young person a chance for fulfillment, that young person sometimes will show you that chance has not been squandered and will make something good of it. Some of them will be the best students in the class. Others may not be great when it comes to grades, but they may turn out to be excellent artists or excellent musicians. 
   If we close down the NEA and turn out the lights, as this amendment suggests, we are turning out the lights on a lot of young children in America who just need an opportunity to express themselves, to prove themselves. Without that opportunity, they will certainly be frustrated; I hope not worse. But it really would be a loss for this Nation. 
   I sincerely hope this amendment is defeated, and I hope it is defeated overwhelmingly because I believe, in defeating this amendment, we will make it clear that when it comes to freedom of expression and encouragement of arts, even though our investment is relatively small in terms of the larger Federal budget, it is still important because it says what we are about in America. We are about encouraging diversity of opinion, encouraging artistic expression, encouraging our young people to fulfill themselves. 
   I hope my colleagues will join me in defeating this amendment, and I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DURBIN.  President, under the Conventional Demilitarization Program, the Department of Defense sells .50 caliber ammunition that has been on the shelf too long and could misfire or is otherwise unserviceable to a private company. That company refurbishes some of that ammunition and sells it to civilian buyers. 
   Our colleagues in the House, Representatives ROD BLAGOJEVICH and HENRY WAXMAN, asked the General Accounting Office to investigate the availability of armor-piercing .50 caliber ammunition in the United States. GAO investigators found that ``U.S.-made armor piercing fifty caliber ammunition is readily available in the United States and that this widespread availability is directly attributable to the little-known Conventional Demilitarization Program within the Department of Defense.'' 
   I want to be sure that my colleagues know what .50 caliber rifles and ammunition can do. They can rip through bullet-proof glass, armor-plated limousines, tanks, helicopters, or aircraft from more than a mile away with deadly accuracy. They can hit targets from four miles away. Their shells can pierce five or six walls with no problem. That is just what the armor-piercing variety can do. The armor-piercing incendiary .50 caliber ammunition can do everything I just mentioned, but then can also start a fire or explode on impact. So if the sniper missed the person inside the limousine or tank or airplane with an armor piercing shell, he could instead shoot an incendiary shell and cause the target to catch fire or blow up. 
   Nobody goes deer hunting with a .50 caliber rifle. No one shoots a bear with .50 caliber rifle. There would be little left of the hapless 
   animal, although I suppose fragments of it could come already barbecued if a .50 caliber incendiary shell were used. 
   What is this weapon good for? It is an appropriate and necessary weapon for the United States Armed Forces and has some important law enforcement uses. Its usefulness was demonstrated time and again in the Gulf War to shoot Iraqi tanks, armored vehicles, and bunkers. It is terrific for blowing up land mines and other small unexploded ordnance. The tracer variety is important for military targeting at night. 
   Otherwise, it is extremely useful for assassins, terrorists, drug cartels, and doomsday cults. Since 1992, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms has initiated 28 gun traces involving .50 caliber semiautomatic rifles. Many of these traces led to terrorists, outlaw motorcycle gangs, international and domestic drug traffickers, and violent criminals. 
   The General Accounting Office conducted an undercover investigation that revealed that ammunition dealers use an ``ask no questions'' approach to the purchase of .50 caliber ammunition. Even after undercover GAO investigators made clear to ammunition dealers that they wanted to be sure the ammunition could pierce an armor-plated limousine or could shoot down a helicopter, the dealers were perfectly willing to sell it. 
   In fact, there are fewer restrictions on the sale of .50 caliber weapons than on handguns. Yet a leading manufacturer of new .50 caliber ammunition, Arizona Ammunition, Inc., says it does not sell .50 caliber armor piercing, incendiary, and tracer ammunition to the general public ``because they have no sporting application.'' That leaves  the U.S. Department of Defense demilitarization contract as the source of U.S.-made .50 caliber ammunition for the civilian market. 
   Today I have introduced a bill that would require DoD contractors for the disposal of .50 caliber surplus military ammunition to agree not to sell the refurbished ammunition to civilians. The Defense Department must include in its contract a provision that refurbished .50 caliber may not be sold to non-military or law enforcement organizations or personnel. The Defense Department should no longer be the indirect source of ammunition that could be used for assassination, terrorism, or drug trafficking.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I was prepared at this time to offer an amendment, but I will not be offering an amendment because Senator COCHRAN, Senator KOHL, and myself have worked out an agreement on an amendment which will ultimately be part of the bill, and I will leave it to the chairman of the subcommittee to decide the best course to bring it into the bill. I am happy we have been able to work this out because I think it is a critically important issue and to which I want to take a few minutes to alert the membership. 
   I happened to read a few months ago an article in Forbes magazine which was an eye opener. It really disturbed me, and I asked my staff to take a look at it a little more closely. The article is entitled ``Blood Money.'' It documented that many medical devices that were approved and manufactured for a single use had been cleaned and reused on patients without any demonstration to the Food and Drug Administration that the devices are, in fact, safe and fully functional after this reprocessing. 
   When I tell you these devices, it may give you some pause to consider the types of things that have been manufactured and labeled for a single use and are being reprocessed and used over and over again. Here are some of the most commonly recycled disposables: electrophysiology catheters for heart catheterizations; sequential compression devices; biopsy forceps; pulse--this is where my liberal arts education will fail me--oximeter sensors; laparoscopic instruments. Think of all the laparoscopic procedures going on now. One of the things we find is that many of the instruments that are being used have been labeled single use and are being so-called cleaned and reprocessed and used again. 
   Continuing with some of the most commonly recycled disposables--drills, bits, blades, catheters, and many other things. 
   At least a third of the hospitals ignore the manufacturer's warnings and recycle these so-called disposable products for their patients without telling their patients. 
   As you can see, we are not talking about bedpans here. We are talking about highly invasive and high-risk devices, devices that come in contact with the patient's blood or other bodily fluids. This reuse is happening without the knowledge of patients and without a requirement that the devices be shown to still be safe and effective after reprocessing. 
   Here in the United States we have a Food and Drug Administration which oversees the safety of drugs, medical devices, biologics, foods, and cosmetics. Let me say that I am one of the biggest fans in Washington of the Food and Drug Administration. 
   Dr. Jane Henney, who is now the head of that agency, is an extraordinarily talented person. Though she and I have had some debates on various issues, I am grateful that she has left the private practice of medicine to give these years of public service to the Food and Drug Administration because this FDA literally inspects and approves devices, instruments, prescription drugs--all sorts of things--that we take for granted in our everyday life. 
   FDA approval is considered the gold standard all around the world. Yet that gold standard is only being applied to devices when they first come on the market. The FDA takes a look at these various devices as they are being sold to determine whether or not they are safe and effective, as they should. With that approval, they are sold to hospitals around America. 
   But when it comes to the issue of reprocessing this disposable device, which is used a second, third, or fourth time, I am afraid the FDA has not been as effective as they should be. The Los Angeles Times ran an article 2 days ago reporting a bacterial outbreak in a Colorado hospital due to contaminated reused cardiac catheters. One of the patients involved died because of that outbreak. 
   This chart makes reference to the Federal MEDWATCH program which is an effort to get a report from any hospital if it shows that a device has resulted in some problem. One of the adverse event reports that was reported to FDA's MEDWATCH shows that the tip of a catheter that had been reused six times broke and lodged in a 32-year-old man's right atrium--if you recall from biology, that is inside the heart--where it is still lodged today. 
   The Los Angeles Times article also talks about another incident where a 4-inch-long tip traveled from a patient's heart to his stomach, leading to additional surgery in which the doctors opened the man's stomach in an attempt to remove it. 
   I find this shocking. You or I could be admitted to a hospital tomorrow, and without our knowledge we could be exposed to a device of completely unknown standard. 
   I have here some charts that depict some reused devices that were retrieved from hospitals in exchange for new devices. They show that many of the devices had either remaining blood or tissue on them or were damaged, so they could not have met the standards FDA had for original manufacturers. 
   This is an example of a cutting device. It shows, unfortunately, that it was still contaminated when it was removed from the hospital. 
   There are other photographs as well, each one raising a question as to whether or not these devices, when used, were sufficiently cleaned or up to the job that they were called to do. We have several other photographs. I think they all demonstrate that. 
   The amendment which I have offered, and which has been accepted by both the majority and minority, is supported by various consumer groups--Public Citizen, the Consumer Federation of America, and the Consumers Union--and patient groups such as AIDS Action, the Alzheimer's Association, the National Organization for Rare Diseases, the National Women's Health Network, and by health professionals, such as the American Nurses Association, that say we should reserve a very small amount of FDA's medical device money--in this case $1 million --out of the $154 million allocated for medical and radiological devices to provide oversight for these reused medical devices. 
   One has to wonder why we spend any money on device safety if the device only has to be safe when it is used initially. In the case of the catheter that is now lodged in a patient's heart, it was reused six times. This was supposed to have been used once. 
   When you go in for heart surgery or these diagnostic treatments, it never crosses your mind to ask the doctor: Incidentally, will all the devices you are going to use in the course of my treatmment be used for the first time only? Has someone else used this catheter before? Has it been reprocessed? Is it being reused? 
   That never dawns on the patient, but in fact we find a 
   third of the hospitals are reusing these devices. That is why I think this amendment is so necessary. 
   I think we can do a lot better. In fact, I believe we can go a lot further than my amendment goes. I will be introducing a bill shortly that will completely overhaul this system to provide patients with assurance that all medical devices used on them are of a high standard and that we can accurately track injuries and infections due to reprocessed devices. 
   My amendment attempts to take a small step to encourage the FDA to provide necessary oversight of reprocessed devices. America uses the FDA to make sure that products, including medical devices, are safe. It does not make sense to have safety equipment for devices when they are brand new but to turn a blind eye thereafter. All medical devices should be required to be safe. 
   I might add, in closing, that at a recent hearing before the Governmental Affairs Committee, I asked Dr. Henney about the efforts being made by the Food and Drug Administration to deal with this problem. She referred me to Dr. Jacobson. Dr. Jacobson is currently the acting director of the Center for Devices. He acknowledged my question about reusing medical devices was a difficult one. He also acknowledged that the FDA is in the process of establishing standards and procedures to  make sure that these reused devices are safe. I am heartened that, when brought to his attention, the FDA was responsive. Frankly, I think we need a lot more. That is the purpose of this amendment. 
   I thank the Chair for the time. I also extend my thanks to Senator COCHRAN of Mississippi and Senator KOHL of Wisconsin for agreeing to this amendment which will be made part of the bill, so that $1 million in the Food and Drug Administration is going to be directed toward the efforts to clean up the reuse of these medical devices. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for his graciousness. There will be more to the debate if we take turns expressing our points of view. 
   I rise in support of the amendment offered by the Senator from California and my colleague, the Senator from Illinois. I am happy to join both of them as cosponsors of this amendment. 
   First, when we talk about methyl tertiary butyl ether, which we are familiar with in the Midwest, we have to put it in perspective of what role it has played in terms of providing energy and whether or not it adds to problems with pollution, because that is the bottom line. 
   We are talking about additives to gasoline that we hope will clean up the environment. That is why we have the program. That is why we are using ethanol with MTBE because the bottom line is we want to say to Americans: When you use your automobiles, the gasoline you use should contain additives that make America a cleaner place--cleaner air and cleaner water. That is why the amendment of the Senator from California is so important because we no longer can trust MTBE to meet that mission goal. 
   The findings of the EPA blue-ribbon panel on oxygenates in gasoline was reported last week. The panel confirmed  my long-held belief that MTBE poses a risk to ground water and to the health and safety of the American public. 
   I hope those who are following this debate will listen carefully to the pervasive nature of MTBE when it occurs in the natural environment. MTBE, a petroleum-derived chemical, does not biodegrade. In 5 years of widespread use, MTBE has become the second most commonly found chemical in ground water. It is second only to chloroform. One gallon of MTBE is enough to 
   pollute 26 million gallons of water. 
   So when the Senator from Texas stands and says the problem is in the storage tanks, I suggest to him, no, it goes far beyond that. The problem is in two-cycle engines, for example, as you find on many boats which use MTBE additives in their fuels, and as they spray out the back of those engines, because of their fuel inefficiency, what they are spraying into reservoirs and water supplies across America is MTBE which is not biodegradable. When they test these water supplies, it is not alone from leaking storage tanks but from the fact that this additive is particularly sinister when it comes to the clean water goals that we all share. 
   It has been labeled by the U.S. EPA as a carcinogen. If this additive did not biodegrade and was benign, did not cause any health problems, we would not be here. The fact is, whether it is a leaking storage tank or a two-cycle engine spraying it into Lake Decatur or Lake Springfield in Illinois, which also serve as water supplies, it increases the risk of cancer. That is why it is a particularly sinister additive, and that is why the amendment of the Senator from California is so important. 
   Let me give an example in my home State of the dangers of MTBE. Ten years ago, a gasoline spill occurred in Kankakee, IL. To this day, MTBE still contaminates that area's drinking water supply. It does not go away, and it causes cancer. It is carcinogenic. 
   With MTBE's future clearly in doubt, now is the time for us to really make clear that corn-based ethanol, or many other crops which can be used as a base for ethanol, should step up to fill this void. Ethanol currently comprises about 15 percent of the reformulated gasoline program, including a successful effort in Chicago and Milwaukee. That is the top RFG, reformulated gasoline, market in the Nation, accounting for 400 million gallons of ethanol demand, or approximately one-third of the industry's production. 
   Many of the arguments against the amendment of the Senator from California suggest since we do not have enough supply of ethanol at this moment to replace MTBE, we ought to stick with it. As the blue-ribbon panel found, and I think common sense tells us, you would not stick with an additive that is this dangerous, one that is so pervasive, not biodegradable and carcinogenic. It is far better for us to set out a national program to expand ethanol production. 
   Naturally, many people are listening and we expect to hear: DURBIN, you are from Illinois where they produce most of the ethanol and primarily from one company. 
   I will concede that fact. I am open to suggestions for legislation to increase ethanol nationwide from a variety of sources. I think it is good. It will create better competition and may develop better standards for manufacturers to bring down the cost. I will certainly support it whatever State wants to engage in ethanol production. 
   It is also important to note that recent studies have found that ethanol and MTBE are essentially equivalent in terms of their effect on ozone; that is, in reducing air pollution, so we are not losing in this tradeoff moving from MTBE to ethanol. In fact, we are holding our ground with a much safer additive. 
   Ethanol has lower carbon monoxide emissions and reduced reactivity, along with a lower incidence of environmental contamination when compared to MTBE. 
   Instead of shelving the RFG oxygenate requirements--that additive that makes it safer for the requirement--it would be in our country's best interest to expand the use of a safe oxygenate such as ethanol. The U.S. Department of Agriculture and industry data demonstrate that adequate supplies of ethanol would exist to meet the oxygenate requirement in a cost-effective manner with a gradual phaseout of MTBE. 
   I say to my friend--a man I also respect--from the State of Rhode Island that we are not talking about an instantaneous ban on MTBE. Instead, we are talking about a phaseout of the use of this additive as we increase the production of the safer additive, the oxygenate ethanol. 
   In fact, ethanol blends with reformulated gas would be more cost effective than nonoxygenated gasoline. 
   We need to look no further than rural America to understand the benefits an ethanol-based RFG program would have on our ag economy. The USDA is predicting a bumper corn crop of 9.7 billion bushels. Farm prices are in a free-fall, and we need to find alternative uses for our agricultural bounty. 
   Illinois annually produces about 40 percent of the nearly 1.5 billion gallons of ethanol. Illinois corn accounts for about 17 percent of the crop use for ethanol. As you drive or fly over the Midwest and look down on those cornfields, one out of six of those cornfields is dedicated to go into processing and come out as ethanol, which we burn in our automobiles. This allows ethanol to gradually replace MTBE as a great benefit to our fragile rural economy. 
   I am pleased to join Senator BOXER and Senator FITZGERALD on her amendment and urge my colleagues from both rural and urban States to support this important effort to encourage the phaseout of MTBE and the promotion of ethanol as an alternative.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this Saturday, August 7 will mark the tenth anniversary of the death of Congressman Mickey Leland, who was an extraordinarily effective advocate for the hungry people here at home and throughout the world. In remembering his tireless work for the hungry, I think it is fitting to redouble our own efforts to fight hunger and malnutrition. 
   The United States recently released its plan to reduce hunger. I am offering an amendment today to ask that the President include in his budget request next year specific proposals to implement the U.S. plan. 
   In November 1996 the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization convened a World Food Summit in Rome. The goal of the conference was to ``renew the commitment of world leaders at the highest level to the eradication of hunger and malnutrition and the achievement of food security for all, through the adoption of concerted policies and actions at global, regional, and national levels.'' Summit participants pledged to cut the number of undernourished people in half by 2015. Each participating country was to decide independently how it could contribute to the goal of food security for all. 
   This March of this year, the U.S. Department of Agriculture published the U.S. government's plan to meet the goals of the 1996 World Food Summit, entitled U.S. Action Plan on Food Security, Solutions to Hunger. The plan outlines how the United States will fight hunger both at home and abroad. The plan is broad and involves a number of U.S. agencies and policies. It aims to reduce both U.S. and world hunger by addressing the ``policy environment,'' promoting trade and investment, strengthening food security research and educational capacity, integrating environmental concerns into food security efforts, improving the ``safety net,'' better identifying ``food insecure'' individuals and populations, and addressing food and water safety issues. 
   The USDA report was issued after the President had already submitted his budget. Many of the recommendations in the report are policies already in place and so already addressed in the President's budget. The report has some specific recommendations, but many are broad principles that need to be fleshed out to lead to specific actions. 
   I want to be sure that this report does not become one of the many government reports that leads nowhere, that fulfills the requirements of an international conference with lofty goals but little follow-through. 
   I am offering this amendment today, which simply says that it is the sense of the Senate that the President should include in the fiscal year 2001 budget request funding to implement this plan, to encourage the Administration to submit specific proposals and budget requests to follow through on our fight against hunger.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we are coming to the end of one segment of this Congress. We are about to break for an August recess which is an opportunity for Members to be back in their States and with their families. I am looking forward to that, as I am sure are many of my colleagues. But it is a good time for us to reflect on what we have done and what we have failed to do in the last several months. 
   Each of us is elected with a responsibility to come to Washington and try to respond to some of the challenges facing families and individuals and businesses across America. I am sad to report as of this moment we have little to show for our efforts this year. The Columbine shooting, which focused the attention of America on violence in our schools, rallied the Senate in a rare bipartisan fashion to deal with violence in schools. We passed the Juvenile Justice Act, which had sensible gun control provisions contained in it, and tried as well to attack this culture of violence which is becoming more dominant in our society. 
   If you will recall, it was a tie vote, 50-50. The tie was broken by Vice President GORE, the bill passed, it went over to the House, and was hopelessly mired down by the efforts of the gun lobby because of their resistance to any changes in gun control. So we are here today, the first part of August, with literally nothing to show for this whole issue of school safety. By the time we return, our kids will be back in school, another school year will have started, and this Congress will have failed to react to a problem that is on everyone's mind. 
   The second issue, one that continues to haunt us, is the issue of the Patients' Bill of Rights. Yesterday, I was in Bloomington, IL, and met with a group of doctors and nurses at hospitals to talk about what is happening with health insurance, how families feel so helpless when health insurance clerks are making decisions that doctors should make. When we tried to address it on the floor, sadly, we were defeated by the health insurance lobby, a lobby which continues to spend millions of dollars to overcome our efforts on behalf of patients and families. That, again, is another issue with which we failed to deal. 
   Finally, of course, we will be talking a lot this week about the tax break as well as the whole question of the budget. There are many of us who think the action by the Senate last week was not a very wise one. We have a chance now, if our economy recovers and continues to grow, to generate a surplus. Then we have to decide what to do with it. First and foremost, I think we should do no harm to this economy. The economy moves forward, creating jobs and businesses and new housing starts. Yet Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve Chairman, warns Congress on a weekly basis not to pass the Republican tax cut package, a $800 billion tax cut primarily for wealthy individuals, which could fuel the fires of inflation and raise interest rates, jeopardizing home mortgages, business loans, and family farmers, who are trying to stay in business. 
   First and foremost, we ought to be cautioned that Alan Greenspan, who has no partisan interest in whose ox is gored in this battle, has warned us do not do it. Second, even when I go home and speak to the most conservative Republicans in my home State of Illinois, they say: If you have a surplus, Senator, for goodness' sake, the first thing you ought to do is get rid of the national debt, the $5.7 trillion we have amassed in debts over the last, well,  two centuries plus, most of it in the last 10 or 15 years. That debt costs us $1 billion a day. All across America we collect payroll taxes and income taxes--for what? To pay the interest on the debt, not to do something good and new for this country; not to improve education or the safety of our streets or to build new highways or mass transit. No, it is interest on the national debt. 
   So on the Democratic side, we think the highest priority, if there is to be a surplus, is to eliminate that debt. What legacy do we want to leave to our children? Wouldn't it be great to leave them a debt-free America and say to them: You have it here, the best country in the world, a history and tradition you can be proud of, and you do not have to pay for the debts of our generation. 
   That to me is so basic, so sound, in opposition to the concept that we are somehow going to give tax breaks to the wealthiest people among us as an alternative. 
   If we are going to do that and reduce the debt, we can do it in a fashion that is fair to everyone and do it in a way that preserves Social Security and Medicare. Many senior citizens are not even aware of the fact the Medicare system is in trouble. Yet it is. They would like to see Medicare expanded, as I would, to cover prescription drugs and to be even a better program so seniors can remain healthy and independent for a longer period of time. But, sadly, the Republican approach to this includes no money for Medicare, no money for Medicare out of this surplus. 
   Do you know what that means? Seniors who are striving to be independent and healthy will not get a helping hand when they should. That is what this budget and tax debate has been about. 
   Sadly, that is where we find ourselves as we head toward the August recess--our failure to enact the juvenile justice bill to make our schools safer; our failure to enact the Patients' Bill of Rights so that people across America who have health insurance can believe they have a doctor they can trust and a doctor who is making decisions for them and their family; our failure to enact a bill to deal with our surplus which is responsible, a bill that will not jeopardize the economy, a law which, in fact, will make sure we reduce our debt and reduce these interest payments which we have to pay; and something that deals with the whole question of the solvency and future of Social Security and Medicare. 
   When I look at this Congress, it is sad, with all the talent we have on both sides of the aisle, Republican and Democrat alike, that we have been unable to come to any conclusion where we can go home in the month of August and point with pride to what we have accomplished. 
   Unfortunately, there is little we can point to.

   Mr. DURBIN. That is a fact. It has been a sad commentary that we know in the year 2015, if I am not mistaken, the Medicare system, as we know it--this current system--is going to go bankrupt, be insolvent. Many seniors want additional benefits to help them stay healthy and independent, like the prescription drug program which we support. When we made an effort on the floor, in a vote just last week we could not rally any support from the Republican side of the aisle for the prescription drug program so that seniors can stay independent and healthy. That, I think, is a shame. 
   I would like to go home this August and say to seniors and those of us soon to be in the program: We have done something positive. You can live a longer, more independent, and healthier life. But we can't even point to that. Instead, the Republicans suggest we can give tax cuts to wealthy people and special tax breaks to certain businesses.

   Mr. DURBIN. In response to the Senator from California, I agree with her. The sad thing is, if we give these tax cuts to the wealthiest among us, as proposed by the Republican bill, we are going to ultimately shortchange, in the outyears, some critically important programs for America, such as education. 
   Think about it. As we go into the 21st century, with all the demands on our children, what they need to learn to be competitive and succeed is the very best educational system. The Republicans, with their tax bill to create shortfalls in spending on education, are really shortsighted. 
   So as you look at it, here we stand on the third day of August, about to adjourn at the end of this week, with precious little to point to. We have been here for months. We have not listened to the American people. We have not responded to them. As we go home, I hope that we can build up some bipartisan approach as we conclude this year to address safety in schools, the Patients' Bill of Rights, and a sensible approach to using any budget surplus that is good for the long-term needs of America. 
   I thank the Senator from California for joining me on the floor.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I stand in support of the amendment offered by the Senator from Missouri, Mr. ASHCROFT. I have listened to the arguments of both sides to this point and have found them interesting. I certainly join Senator FITZGERALD in noting that Illinois is a great agricultural State. I have visited that State regularly over the past several months, including most recently on Monday, in Lincoln, IL, meeting with farmers who are, in fact, suffering from perhaps one of the worst price depressions that they have witnessed in decades. They need help. That is why the underlying bill, the Agriculture appropriations bill, and the emergency bill that is part of it, is so important. 
   It has been portrayed during the course of this debate that addressing the question of unilateral sanctions involving food and medicine exports from the United States will be of some assistance to the farmers. I think that is possible. But I have to concede that the countries we are talking about are generally so small as to not have a major impact on the agricultural exports of the United States. 
   I believe the Senator from New Jersey, who opposes this amendment, mentioned that we are talking about a potential export of 1.7 percent of our entire agricultural export budget. That is not the kind of infusion of purchasing in our agricultural economy that will turn it around. So I don't believe this amendment, in and of itself, is a major agricultural amendment, although it clearly will have some impact on agriculture. But I do believe it stands for a 
   proposition that is worth supporting. Let me tell you why. 
   First, I believe that we have learned over the course of recent history that unilateral sanctions by the United States just don't work. When we decide on our own to impose sanctions on a country, it is usually because we are unhappy with their conduct, so we will stop trade or impose some sort of embargo to show our displeasure. You can understand that because some of the actions we have responded to were horrendous and heinous. The bombings of embassies and other terrorist acts raise the anger of the American people, and through their elected representatives, we respond with sanctions. That is understandable, and it is a natural human and political reaction. 
   I think we would have to concede that over time those unilateral sanctions have very little impact on the targeted country. In the time I have served on Capitol Hill, for about 17  years, I can only think of one instance where the imposition of sanctions had the desired result, and that, of course, was in the case of South Africa. It was not a unilateral sanction by the United States. We were involved in multilateral sanctions with other countries against the apartheid regime in South Africa, and we were successful in changing that regime. 
   But as you look back at the other countries we have imposed unilateral sanctions on, with the United States standing alone, you can hardly point to similar positive results. So I think we have learned a lesson well that merely imposing those sanctions alone seldom accomplishes the goals that we seek. 
   I do note, in reviewing this amendment by Senator ASHCROFT, as has been noted by others, he makes allowances for the United States to continue to impose unilateral sanctions under specific situations. Of course, if there is a declaration of war, and certainly if the President comes to Congress and asks that we impose sanctions for products which may in and of themselves be dangerous, such as high technology and the like, products which have been identified by the Department of Commerce as being dangerous to America's best interests. 
   I applaud the Senator from Missouri for making those provisions. It gives any administration the wherewithal to impose unilateral sanctions in extraordinary cases. But I understand this amendment to suggest that if we are not dealing with extraordinary cases, we should basically be willing to sell food and medicine to countries around the world. 
   I have found it interesting that my colleagues who oppose this amendment have come to the floor to describe these potential trading partners as tyrants, dictators, and terrorist states. One of the Senators came to the floor with graphic presentations of some of the dictators in these countries. Not a single person on the floor this evening would make any allowance for the terrible conduct by some of these terrorist regimes. But I must remind my colleagues during the course of this debate that, after World War II, we were engaged in a cold war that went on for almost five decades, which involved the Soviet Union and China. During that cold war, some terrible things occurred involving those countries and the United States. 
   We expended trillions of dollars defending against the Soviet Union and trying to stop the expansion of communism. We decided they were our major target, and so many debates in the Senate and in the House were predicated on whether or not we were stopping, or in any way aiding, the growth of communism. 
   Despite this cold war's intensity, which more or less monopolized foreign relations in the United States for half of this century, we found ourselves during that same period of time trading and selling food to Russia, the Soviet Union, and selling foodstuffs to China and other countries. I guess we adopted the premise that former Senator Hubert Humphrey used to say should guide us when it comes to this economy. We asked him whether he would sell food to the Communists and he said, ``I will sell them anything they can't shoot back at me.'' I think it was a practical viewpoint that, when it gets down to it, we are not the sole suppliers of food in the world. For us to cut off food supplies to any given country is no guarantee they will starve. In fact, they can turn to other resources. 
   So those who would say to us we should impose unilateral sanctions on a country such as Cuba, I think, have forgotten the lesson of history that, not that long ago, we were selling wheat to Russia at a time when we were at the height of the cold war. I think that is a lesson in history to be remembered. 
   The second question is whether or not we should, as a policy, exempt food and medicine when it comes to any sanctions. I believe that is the gravamen of the amendment offered by the Senator from Missouri. I think he is right. I say to those who believe that by imposing unilateral sanctions involving the sale of food and medicine from the United States on these dictatorial regimes we will have some impact, please take a look at the pictures of the dictators that you presented for us to view this evening. 
   Now, I have been watching Mr. Castro in the media for over 40 years and I don't see him thin and emaciated or malnourished. He seems to be finding food somewhere, as do many other people in states where we have our differences. But I do suspect that when you get closer to the real people in these countries, you will find they are the ones who are disadvantaged by these sanctions on food and medicine. 
   Let me tell you, there was a report issued 2 years ago by the American Association for World Health, ``Denial of Food and Medicine: The Impact of the U.S. Embargo on Health and Nutrition in Cuba.'' It concluded that:

   Mr. DURBIN. I suggested that the amendment being offered by the Senator from Texas, which as I understand it, is the House version of the tax cut, is even worse than the Senate version when it comes to helping working families, and frankly, I think, gives the  word ``conservative'' a bad name. I ask the Senator if he would consider the following: 
   In this Nation where we revere free speech, we basically let people say what they want to say. Some people have gone so far as to suggest that tomorrow will be the end of the world. Well, when tomorrow comes and goes and the world doesn't end, most of those people shrink away. 
   The people who are offering this amendment, in 1993, said 
   the Clinton plan for deficit reduction was the end of the economic world for America. We would see deficits as far as the eye could see. We would have unemployment, high inflation, the economy was in terrible shape. As a result, not a single Republican would vote for the Clinton plan. 
   I ask the Senator, did the world end, as Senator GRAMM and others suggested, with this Clinton plan? The same group is suggesting to us today that Alan Greenspan is wrong, Bill Clinton is wrong again, and that we have to pass this tax break for wealthy people which will endanger our economy.

   Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator from North Dakota: Is it true or not true that in the last 2 weeks Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, has testified before Congress several different times warning us that this kind of tax proposal that is coming from the Republican side could jeopardize the economic expansion? Is it not true that it is within the power of the Federal Reserve Board, by their monetary policy, to raise interest rates if they see indications of inflation, and by raising these interests rates, put an additional economic burden on families who are paying for their mortgages, family farmers who are trying to stay in business, and small businesses alike? Is it not true that if we see inflation come on the scene and interest rates go up, that a $22 tax break for working families will disappear in a heartbeat?

    Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to salute the Sanders/Cunningham family as they celebrate their fifth annual reunion. This extended family of more than 100 members has traced its roots back to a Georgia plantation in 1750, and before that to Ghana and Sierra Leone. 
   As descendants of Wiley and Annie Cunningham Sanders of Aberdeen, Mississippi, they will gather together this weekend, July 30th through August 1st, in Springfield, Illinois, to celebrate their history, their common bonds, and their future. 
   The Sanders/Cunningham family considers their reunion to be an Empowerment Summit, an opportunity to dispel false stereotypes, reject negative images, and celebrate who they are. They have noted Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s statement that ``when the history books are written they will tell of a Great People, a Proud People, a Black People.'' They know they are part of that people and that their heritage is a cause for joy. With an extended family that includes doctors and lawyers, business owners and farmers, educators and blue collar workers, they come together to celebrate their unity. 
   This 6th generation family is diverse, unique, and special. The Sanders/Cunningham family's unity and strength is an example of what an American family should represent. Additionally, this family is full of rich history. The family matriarch is 94 years young, Edna Sanders Brandon. She is a mother of five, a grandmother of 12, a great-grandmother of 16, an aunt, and a great aunt to many. Edna has witnessed events spanning the invention of the automobile to man's walking on the moon, to the birth of the Internet. 
   All of us can benefit from an appreciation of our roots and our place in history. Knowing where we came from can be a helpful step in knowing where we are going. I applaud the Sanders/Cunningham family for their sense of heritage, their oneness, and their sense of empowerment. I wish them all the best as they gather in Springfield to celebrate who they are, where they have come from, and what they have become, and as they look forward to what they are yet to be. 
   In closing, I would like to pay special recognition to Steven E. Richie, a 4th generation member of this family who has spent countless hours researching and preparing for this grand family event.

    Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a historic institution in the State of Illinois and the nation. On July 30, 1999, the Galena Post Office will celebrate its 140th anniversary making it the longest continuously owned and operated post office in America. 
   When the post office was founded, Galena was a thriving mining and port community in northwestern Illinois. The streets were bustling with miners, traders, dock workers, and trappers. Though a great deal has changed since then, many of the original buildings remain standing in Galena's historic downtown district. Among these structures is the post office. 
   The idea of the Galena Post Office was initiated by Congressman Elitu B. Washburne, a pre-Civil War era politician from Illinois. The funds for the facility were authorized and appropriated by Congress on August 18, 1856. Construction of the building began in 1857, when the first limestone shipments for the edifice arrived via tow-boat. Upon the completion of the building's structure on August 3, 1859, the Weekly Northwestern Gazette predicted, ``it will last 1,000 years with only two forces capable of destroying it, one being an earthquake and the other a mob.'' This newspaper was prophetic. The Galena Post Office has outlived every other United States post office. It continues to thrive today with a delivery area of more than 2800. 
   One hundred and forty years later, the Galena Post Office stands proudly in the center of town in the same condition as it was in 1859. Its 5947 square foot interior was the grand vision of architect Arni B. Young. The two-story building is highlighted by an impressive limestone exterior. Mr. Young's plans included a civic meeting place with a grand cast-iron stairwell, mahogany interior, and arched windows to complement the lobby area. 
   The Galena Post Office served as not only a post office and a social center but also as a vital part of the community. The Smithsonian National Postal Museum has bestowed Galena's post office with yet another honor, The Great American Post Office Award. This month the museum will host an exhibit commemorating Galena's Post Office for its outstanding architectural features, historical significance to the community, and outstanding record of service. 
   Mr. President, on Friday I will have the honor to share in the celebration of the 140th anniversary of the Galena Post Office. It is truly a remarkable accomplishment.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, during the course of this week, we will debate in this Chamber one of the most important issues in terms of the future of our economy. 
   Most of us can remember it was not that many years ago that the Federal budget was swimming in red ink. My Republican colleagues came to the floor of this Senate 2 years ago begging for the passage of a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. They were so distraught and despondent over deficits that they said the only way to bring this House into order was for us to have the Federal courts impose their will on Congress: The Federal courts must stop Congress from spending. 
   The so-called balanced budget amendment failed by one vote. There were great tears shed on the floor of the Senate by Republican Members and even a few on the Democratic side that we had missed the opportunity to end the era of deficits. 
   Barely 24 months later and how this world has changed. We are now in the world of surpluses, or at least anticipated surpluses. President Clinton's deficit reduction plan of 1993 accounts for about 80 percent of this deficit reduction and surplus creation, and the other part came from bipartisan agreements since that time. 
   My Republican colleagues have shifted from this debate about amending the Constitution, saying we are so awash with money in Washington that we have surpluses to be given back to  people in the form of tax breaks, primarily for the wealthiest of Americans. 
   Many on the Democratic side take a more conservative view. It is hard, I am sure, for our Republican friends to stomach this, but we are the conservative party when it comes to fiscal issues because we believe if there is to be a surplus, it should be dedicated first to making certain Social Security is strong for decades to come; second, to make certain Medicare receives an infusion of capital so we don't see an increase in premiums or a reduction in services; and third and most important, buy down the national debt. 
   We can speculate for hours on end on the floor of the Senate about the state of America and its economy. However, certain things are obvious. We have more than $5 trillion in national debt that costs $1 billion a day in interest. We have a Social Security system that needs money. We have a Medicare system that does, as well. We should take care of those three items before we go off on some lark of spending $1 trillion in tax breaks for wealthy people. 
   One might expect to hear that from a Democratic Senator and expect to hear the opposite from a Republican Senator because that is the nature of this debate. I appeal to the American people to step back for a second and look for a credible, objective arbiter. Let me make a suggestion: Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, who is credited as much as the Clinton administration with bringing about the economic prosperity that has brought down inflation, increased employment, increased the number of new businesses, increased housing. What does Alan Greenspan say about the $1 trillion tax cut? He says it is not wise, not good policy. He said there may be a time in a recession when a tax cut makes sense but to put this tax break for wealthy people on the books now is to fuel an economy too much, to create inflationary pressure. 
   What would be the response of the Federal Reserve Board? Obviously, raise interest rates. What happens when interest rates are raised? The cost of a mortgage payment goes up for people who have an adjustable rate mortgage. People who have equities in mutual funds for retirement find those equity values falling as interest rates go up. Chairman Alan Greenspan, the objective arbiter, says to the Republicans: Please, stop; don't do this. You are overreacting to what we hope is the good news of a surplus. 
   That is the critical difference. 
   We know the Republican tax breaks are primarily geared for wealthy people. We know after 5 years, the Republicans have to dip into the Social Security trust fund to pay for their tax breaks. We know they provide no money whatsoever for Medicare. 
   We know that if we follow their scenario we will be forced on the floor of the Senate and the House of Representatives to make dramatic cuts in education, in environmental protection, in the basics that Americans expect from our Federal Government. 
   It is a recipe for economic disaster and a recipe for fiscal irresponsibility.

   Mr. DURBIN. I think the Senator from California has once again identified the Achilles' heel of Republican tax policy. They just cannot help themselves. Whenever it comes time for a tax break, they always want to give it to Donald Trump. I think Mr. Trump is doing well. I think Mr. Gates is doing very well. I don't think they need a tax break to be inspired to go to work tomorrow. The Republicans insist that is the case. 
   Look what it does: For the top 1 percent of wage earners in America, the Republican plan, the Republican tax breaks give an average of almost $23,000 a year. Of course, for those bottom 60 percent, people with incomes below $38,000 a year, they receive $139 a year. 
   The Republicans say: Wait a minute, the rich are paying all the taxes; they should get the tax break; it should come back to them. 
   Yet when you look at it, they are taking them at the expense of working families who are concerned about the future of Social Security, concerned about the future of Medicare, and want to make certain we keep up with our basic commitments to education and environmental protection.

   Mr. DURBIN. Over the course of the last several months we have had a lot of debate on the floor about a lockbox, a Republican lockbox that is going to protect Social Security and Medicare--lockbox, lockbox, lockbox. I think what we are dealing with when we look at the Republican tax break bill is the Republican ``loxbox''--it smells fishy--because in the year 2005 they start dipping right into Social Security. They are taking money out of the Social Security surplus to give tax breaks to wealthy people. 
   I ask the Senator from New York--I am sure I can speak for people from Illinois as well--as you go around the State of New York and ask people what our priorities should be, if we are going to have a surplus, how many of them have said to you: Well, let's give tax breaks to Donald Trump and let's take money out of the Social Security surplus?

   Mr. DURBIN. As a member of the Judiciary Committee, I am sure the Senator from Delaware remembers 2 years ago on the floor of the Senate our despondency over the deficits, which led some Members on the Republican side to call for a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, where the Federal courts would force Congress to stop spending. We were so despondent that we were going to really change the constitutional framework. That failed by one vote. 
   Two years later--the Senator from Delaware is right--somehow or another, the Republican Party is searching for its roots and searching for its identity. It has now gone beyond the era of Gingrich and Dole, and it is trying to find out what it stands for anymore. As the Senator from Delaware said, they used to stand for fiscal conservatism. We have a trillion-dollar tax cut, primarily for the wealthiest people, that will divert funds that could be spent to retire the national debt, a debt of over $5 trillion, which costs us a billion dollars a day in interest. We collect taxes from American families--payroll taxes--for a billion dollars a day in interest. 
   Would the Republicans join the Democrats and say our first priority is to eliminate this debt? No. Instead, they are saying our first priority is tax breaks for the higher income individuals, which could endanger the economy. 
   I think this Republican Party is searching for identity. I think the Democrats have a situation that I would like to test 
   in an election. If this were a referendum, as in parliamentary forms of government, I would like to take this question to the American people: Do you want a trillion-dollar  tax break for the wealthiest people over the Democratic approach to take whatever surplus we have and put it into Social Security, put it into Medicare, and bring down the national debt? 
   I think ours is a sounder approach. I ask the Senator from Delaware, in his experience in history and in American politics, has he ever seen the world turn so upside down that we Democrats are now the fiscal conservatives?

<TEXT>
   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this morning we devoted most of the morning business to a discussion of an item which will come before us soon, and that is the whole question of how our economy is to look for the next few years. There are two very different visions of that future which will be articulated on the floor--one on the Republican side and another on the Democratic side. 
   The Senator from Wyoming was kind enough to speak and to tell us earlier about his concerns over taxes. Certainly, his concern is shared by many on both sides of the aisle. He made a point which I think is worth noting and explaining. Yes, it is true that Federal tax receipts are higher than they have ever been from individuals and families, but it is also true the tax rates on individuals and families, in every income category, are at some of the lowest levels they have been in modern memory. 
   The reason why taxes and tax receipts are higher reflects the fact that the economy is strong, people are working, they are earning money in their workplace, as well as in their investments, and they are paying some tax on it. 
   If you look at the dynamic growth in taxation on American families, you will find it is not from Washington but, rather, from State capitals and local sources, local units of government. That, to me, is an important point to make as we get into a question of whether we should cut Federal taxes. 
   I, for one, believe we can cut Federal taxes and do it particularly for the lower and middle-income families and really enhance our economy--if they are targeted; if they are contained. Because people who get up and go to work every day, 
   and sweat out the payroll tax, which is usually higher than their Federal income tax liability, are the folks who need a helping hand. 
   Sadly, the Republican proposal before us, which will be about a $1 trillion tax cut over the next 10 years, does not focus on the lower and middle-income families. It reverts to the favorite group of the Republican Party time and again in tax policy--those at the higher income levels. So we see dramatic tax cuts for the wealthiest American families and ``chump change,'' if you will, for working families. 
   That in and of itself is an injustice. The Republican Senator who spoke before me made the statement that he could not see why giving more money back to people to spend could possibly hurt the economy. In fact, it is a source of concern. 
   You notice that about once a month, or once every other month, we wait expectantly for news from the Federal Reserve Board as to whether they are going to raise interest rates. It is an important issue and topic for many Americans. If you have a mortgage with an adjustable rate on it, the decision by Chairman Greenspan of the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates will hit you right in the pocketbook. Your mortgage rate will go up. The payment on your home will go up. 
   Most people think this is a decision to be made looking at the overall economy. I suggest most American families look at interest rate decisions based on their own family. What will it do to my mortgage rate? What will it do, if I am a small businessperson, to the cost of capital for me to continue doing business? These are real-life decisions. 
   If the Republicans have their way this week and pass a tax break, primarily for wealthy people, injecting money into the economy, it will increase economic activity. It is expected, then, that some people will buy more. It may mean Donald Trump will buy another yacht or Bill Gates will buy something else. 
   That money spent in the economy creates the kind of economic movement which the Federal Reserve watches carefully. If that movement seems to be going too quickly, they step in and slow it down. How do they slow it down? They raise interest rates. 
   So the Republican plan, the tax break for wealthy people, the $1 trillion approach, is one which runs the risk of heating up an economy, which is already running at a very high rate of speed, to the point where the Federal Reserve has to step in. And once stepping in and raising interest rates, the losers turn out to be the same working families who really do deserve a break. 
   It has been suggested that if we, instead, take our surplus and pay down the national debt, it not only is a good thing intuitively that we would be retiring this debt, but it has very positive consequences for this economy. 
   Consider for a moment that in the entire history of the United States, from President George Washington through President Jimmy Carter, we had accumulated $1 trillion in debt. That means every Congress, every President, each year, who overspent, spent more Federal money than they brought in in taxes, accumulated a debt which over the course of 200 years of history, came to $1 trillion, a huge sum of money, no doubt. 
   But after the Carter administration, as we went into the Reagan years, the Bush years, and the early Clinton years, that debt just skyrocketed. It is now over $5 trillion. That is America's mortgage. We have to pay interest on our mortgage as 
   every American family pays interest on their home mortgage. What does it cost us? It costs us $1 billion a day in interest to borrow the money, to pay off our national debt--$1 billion a day collected from workers through payroll taxes, from businesses and others just to service the debt. 
   So the question before us is whether or not a high priority should be reducing that debt. Frankly, I think it should be one of the highest priorities. You know who ends up paying that interest forever? The young children in our gallery here watching this Senate debate: Thank you, mom. Thank you, dad. Thanks for everything. Thanks for the national debt, and thanks for the fact that we are going to have to pay for it. 
   We have some alternative news for them that may be welcome. We have a chance now to help you out. We have a chance to take whatever surplus comes into the Federal Government because of our strong economy and use it to retire the national debt, to bring it down. 
   That is the proposal from the Democratic side, from President Clinton, and most of my fellow Senators who share the floor with me on this side of the aisle. It is a conservative approach but a sensible one. 
   The alternative, if we do not do it, I am afraid, is to continue to pay this $1 billion a day in interest on the debt and not bring it down. 
   If we stick to a disciplined, conservative approach, we can bring down this debt. 
   Chairman Alan Greenspan said last week: Yes, that is the highest priority. You want this economy to keep moving? You want to keep creating jobs and businesses, people building homes, starting new small businesses, and keeping inflation under control? He said the worst thing you can do is create new programs and spend it, going back to the deficit days. The second worst thing you can do, as the Republican proposal suggests, is give tax breaks to wealthy people. The best thing he said to do is to retire the national debt. 
   It is eminently sensible on its face. We step forward and say bringing down that debt is good for the economy, will not overheat it, will not raise interest rates. You see, if we can have interest rates continuing to come down, it helps families. How does that happen?  
   The Federal Government is a big borrower. Because of our $5 trillion-plus debt, we have to borrow money from all over the United States and around the world to service that debt. If we start getting out of the borrowing business, there is less demand for capital, and the cost of capital--interest rates--starts going down. 
   What would a 1 percent reduction in the interest rate mean to families across America over the next 10 years when it comes to their mortgage payments? Savings of over $250 billion. Frankly, taking the conservative approach, paying down the national debt is not only good to keep the economy moving forward but, over the long term, the lower interest rates are good for everyone: good for families who want to buy homes; good for businesses that want to expand and hire more employees, and good all around. 
   That is the bottom line of this debate. The Republican approach is to spend it on tax cuts, give it to wealthy people. The Democratic approach is pay down the national debt, invest the money in Social Security and in Medicare. That, I think, is the more responsible course of action. What the Republicans would do in the second 5 years of their tax cut is actually mind-boggling, because they would be reaching into the Social Security trust fund to pay for these tax breaks for wealthy people. So folks today who are paying a high payroll tax, putting money in the Social Security trust fund so it is there for the baby boomers and others in the future, would actually be funding a tax cut for some of the wealthiest people in America instead of leaving that money in the Social Security trust fund where it belongs to meet the obligations of that system that is so important to millions of families. 
   I yield to the Senator from California for a question.

   Mr. DURBIN. I agree with the Senator from California. I will say this only one more time on the floor. She may have missed it earlier, when I characterized this whole discussion about the lockbox. There is this proposal that comes forward that we create a lockbox for Social Security and for Medicare. In other words, you can't get your hands on it if you want to create a new program or whatever it might be. It is going to be separate, locked away from the grasping hands of any political leaders. So those who follow the debate will hear this: lockbox, lockbox, lockbox. But as we look carefully at the Republican tax break proposals, they reach into that Social Security lockbox in the year 2005 and start taking money out for tax breaks for wealthy people. 
   I said on the floor earlier, at that point it is no longer a lockbox, it is a ``loxbox,'' because it smells a little fishy. This is no lockbox, if you can reach in and take from it. That is, frankly, what we are going to face with the Republican tax break proposal. 
   I also say to the Senator from California and the Senator from South Carolina, who is the acclaimed expert when it comes to budget--and we are anxious to hear his comments and contribution--the other thing that is interesting is the Republican tax break plan is based on the theory that we are going to stick with spending caps forever. We are going to keep limitations on spending and appropriations forever. And with those limitations, the surplus grows, and they give it away in tax breaks primarily to wealthy people. 
   Look what is happening around here. The so-called caps are being breached and broken even as we speak. They came up last week and said--what a surprise--it turns out we have to take a census in America every 10 years. That is an emergency, an unanticipated event. 
   A census an unanticipated event? We have been taking the decennial census for centuries--not quite that long but at least for a long time. Now they are calling it an emergency to 
   pay for the census so they can go around the caps, so they can spend the money. 
   It is my understanding that within the last few hours, the House of Representatives has also decided that spending for veterans hospitals is an emergency, and, therefore, we will go around the caps. Frankly, funding the census and funding veterans hospitals would be high on everyone's list here, but to call this an unanticipated emergency--most of the men and women who are being served by those hospitals served us and our country in World War II and Korea. We know who they are, and we know the general state of their health. It is predictable that they would need help at veterans hospitals. It is not an unanticipated emergency. 
   We are dealing in fictions; we are dealing in doubletalk, in an effort to get around the spending caps, which is the premise of the Republican tax break, that we are going to have spending caps forever. They are violating their premise even as they offer this tax break proposal. 
   I will make this last point to the Senator from California. She really addresses, I think, one of the basics. There are many on the Republican side who believe that, frankly, Government just gets in the way of a good life for Americans. I disagree. I think in many respects Government is important to a good life for many Americans and their families. 
   The Senator from California and the Senator from Illinois can certainly  agree on the issue of transportation. In Chicago, which I am honored to represent, virtually any radio station will tell you every 10 minutes the state of traffic on the major expressways around Chicago. I am sure the Senator from California can tell the same story. It is getting worse, more congestion, more delays, and more compromise in the quality of life. 
   We don't want to step away from a Federal contribution to transportation, not only highways but mass transit. Frankly, if we move down the road suggested by Republicans, it would jeopardize it. The same thing is true about crime. It ranks in the top three issues that people worry about. The COPS Program, which Democrats supported along with President Clinton, has created almost 100,000 new police. That brought down the crime rate in America. We want to continue that commitment to making our neighborhoods, streets, and schools safer across America. 
   Finally, education. I am glad the Senator from California noted this. The Federal contribution to education is relatively small compared to State and local spending, but it is very important. We have shown leadership in the past and we can in the future. It really troubles me to think we are now at a point in our history where, if no law is changed and everything continues as anticipated, we will need to build, on a weekly basis, for the next 10 years--once every week for the next 10 years--a new 1,000-bed prison, every single week for the next 10 years because of the anticipated increase in incarceration. 
   I think dangerous people should be taken off the street and out of my neighborhood and yours. But I don't believe Americans are genetically inclined to be violent criminals. I think there are things we can do to intervene in lives, particularly at an early stage, to make kids better students and ultimately better citizens. That means investing in education. The Republican plan steps back from that commitment to education, as it does from the commitments to transportation and fighting crime. That is very shortsighted. We will pay for it for many decades to come. 
   So this debate, some people say, is about a tax break. It is about a lot more. Will the economy keep moving forward? Will we make important decisions so the next generation of Americans is not burdened with paying interest on our old debt, and will we make good on our commitment to American families when it comes to important questions involving transportation, crime, education, and the quality of life?

   Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from California for her observation. Yes, many years ago when we were on the Budget Committee in the House, we worked together on medical research 
   and dramatically increased the amount of money for it. It was one of the prouder moments serving on Capitol Hill. I have found, as I have gone across Illinois and around the country, that virtually every American family agrees this is an appropriate thing for the Federal Government to do--initiate and sponsor medical research. 
   A family never feels more helpless than when a disease or illness strikes somebody they love. They pray to God that the person will survive, and that they can find the best doctors. In the back of their minds they are hoping and praying that somewhere somebody is developing a drug or some treatment that can make a difference. And that ``somewhere,'' many times, is the National Institutes of Health in Washington, DC, in the Maryland suburbs nearby. 
   If we take the Republican approach of cutting dramatically the Federal budget in years to come for a tax break for wealthy people, we jeopardize the possibility that the NIH will have money for this medical research. That is so shortsighted. 
   It is not only expensive to continue to provide medical care to diseased or ill people, but, frankly, it is inhumane to turn our backs on the fact that so many families need a helping hand. I sincerely hope before this debate ends, we are able to bring Republicans around to the point of view that when we talk about spending on the Democratic side, it is for the basics--transportation, fighting crime, helping education, and medical research. I would take that out for a referendum across this land. I think that is the sensible way to go. 
   I yield the remainder of my time.

   Mr. DURBIN. Let me say at the outset to my friend, the Senator from Ohio, what a breath of fresh air he is. I commend him. I believe his statement is as forthright as any given on the floor concerning the state of the economy, whether we have a real surplus or we do not, and what is the prudent thing to do. Because what the Senator from Ohio learns when he goes home is the same thing I have learned as a Democratic Senator going home to Illinois: People do not have this passion for tax cuts or brand new spending programs. 
   The first thing they say to me is: What are you going to do to get rid of this national debt, this debt that started off at $1 trillion at the end of President Carter's administration and is now over $5 trillion? I say to the Senator from Ohio, it is my understanding that that debt costs us, as taxpayers, $1 billion a day. They net it out, because we earn interest as taxpayers, and state it is only $600 million. But the debt itself costs us about $350 billion a year. 
   The businesspeople and families I speak to in Illinois have the same response that the Senator from Ohio has spoken to on the floor: What are you going to do to get rid of this debt so our children are not burdened with these interest payments? We are really trying to square away the books from the last 20 years. 
   What the Senator from Ohio said on the floor, I think, is a very wise course of action. That should be our highest priority: reducing the debt and keeping our obligations to Social Security and Medicare. 
   I do not want to put words in the mouth of the Senator from Ohio, but my fear is those who anticipate surpluses that may not materialize could put us on a bad track. We could be headed back toward deficits, toward red ink, and toward an economy we do not want to see. 
   The same business people I speak to say, there may come a time, if we have a recession, when a tax cut is the right medicine because it would give the American families more money to spend and bring us out of a recession. But certainly we are not in those days now. 
   We have a strong economy, a vibrant economy; and, if anything, the fear is it may overheat with too much demand. If that happens, the Federal Reserve Board steps in and raises interest rates, which penalizes every family with an adjustable mortgage and business people who are trying to keep and expand their business. 
   The Senator from Ohio has really laid the basis for a sensible bipartisan approach. I hope we can work together, as we have in the past. I have admired his independence and the fact that he has been very forthright in his views. I listened carefully to what he said during the course of his statement. I think it really provides a common ground for a bipartisan approach that really is good for the economy and good for future generations. 
   As I see the Senator from Louisiana is prepared to speak, I yield back the remainder of my time.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from West Virginia. His has been a lonely struggle on the Senate Finance Committee in the minority. I know what he has said today on the Senate floor is an expression of his personal commitment and philosophy in the Senate Finance Committee. 
   It is such an alluring possibility for politicians to vote for tax cuts. Can you think of two more exciting words for politicians to say other than: I'm going to cut your taxes--tax cuts? Yet we know it may not be the most responsible thing to do on behalf of families across America and the state of our economy. 
   What the Senator from West Virginia has said during the course of his remarks bears repeating. Look to the question of fairness. We have heard statements on the floor from Members of the Senate who have suggested that taxes have gone up on American families. 
   It is interesting that when looking at facts we find something different. A median-income family of four currently pays less Federal taxes as a percentage of its income than at any time in the last 20 years. 
   This data comes from the Treasury Department and the Congressional Budget Office. Lower-income families at one-half the median income level face a Federal tax burden which is the lowest in 31 years, according to the Treasury Department. A family of four can make up to as much as $28,000 a year without paying Federal income taxes. For a family of four at twice median income, that would put them in the middle-income category. The average Federal tax rate will be its lowest in over a decade. 
   That is not to suggest families do not face a tax burden. They do. Many still pay the payroll taxes, some Federal income taxes, and State and local taxes. 
   The general increase in revenue to the Federal Treasury really is evidence of a strong economy where people are working, making more money, and perhaps doing better in the stock market than they had in previous years. 
   When we talk about tax fairness, many of us believe if there is to be any tax cut, it should be directed to the people in the lower- and middle-income groups. Those are the first who should be served. 
   This chart illustrates what I mentioned earlier.

   Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from West Virginia hits the nail on the head. If we were to abandon our commitment to education, for example, in the country, it would be the most shortsighted thing in the world. It may reduce Government spending; yes, it may reduce taxation; but does anyone believe America would be a better country for it? I certainly do not. 
   When we say to families we can give them a tax break this year, a tax cut this year or we can take the money and reduce the national debt, and by reducing that debt say to their children and their grandchildren, you are going to have less to pay in taxes for interest on the debt we accumulated in our lifetime, that to me is the most popular thing I have found as I have gone around the State of Illinois. 
   People are saying: Senator, before you start talking about new programs or massive tax breaks primarily for wealthy people, shouldn't you accept your responsibility to bring down this national debt that is over $5 trillion, a national debt that costs us $1 billion a day in interest payments that are paid primarily to foreigners who hold the national debt of the United States in Treasury securities and the like? 
   That to me is eminently sensible because when that debt comes down, we reduce the need for $1 billion a day in taxes being collected across America for interest and we reduce the 
   Federal demand for money. When the Federal demand for money goes down, the cost of money--that is, the interest rate--comes down. Families benefit twofold: There is less of a burden when it comes to taxes for interest and paying off the national debt and lower interest rates, which means homes are more affordable and small businesses and farmers can at a lower cost borrow money necessary for their businesses. That to me is a sensible approach. In fact, let me go out on a limb and say it is a conservative approach. 
   The Democratic plan we are putting forward is the fiscally conservative approach to deal with the national debt. I am heartened by the earlier statement of the Republican Senator from Ohio when he agreed with us. He believes, as I do and as Chairman Alan Greenspan of the Federal Reserve Board has said, that our first priority should be the elimination of that debt and keeping our commitment to Social Security and Medicare. 
   Do not be misled as you hear some of my colleagues say we have $3 trillion in surplus and we ought to be able to at least give a third of it back to the American people. They do not tell you the whole story. Almost $2 trillion, $1.9 trillion of the $3 trillion, is really money that we virtually all agree should be dedicated to Social Security. We do not want to raid the Social Security trust fund. People have that money taken out of their payroll for the purpose of making certain Social Security is there in the future. Those who are counting that as some sort of surplus really are not dealing fairly with the most important social program in America. So take off the table of this $3 trillion surplus $1.9 trillion, leaving you a little over a trillion dollars. 
   Of that amount, how much are we going to dedicate for some very important things--paying down the debt or  Medicare? The Medicare system, if we do not touch it, by the year 2015, is going to be out of money. We have to decide whether or not we will dedicate a portion of our surplus to Medicare. Do we need to do more for Medicare? Of course, we do. Beyond giving money to retire the debt and Medicare, we have to make some structural changes that may be painful, but they will be ever so much more painful if we do not dedicate a portion of our surplus to Medicare. 
   Also, we have to look to the basic needs of Government. The Senator from West Virginia has made this point. Every American expects the Federal Government to meet certain responsibilities: 
   National defense, of course; transportation. 
   We know what the Interstate Highway System has brought to America and the demands for a more modern transportation system in every State--better highways, mass transit. 
   Fighting crime: The Federal Government played an important role with 100,000 new cops, and we will continue that. 
   The whole question of what we are going to do in the area of medical research. 
   I commend my colleague, the Senator from West Virginia. It is an area near and dear to the hearts of everyone with whom I have spoken that the Federal Government press forward looking for cures for asthma, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, AIDS, and the many things that challenge us and our families. 
   We expect that Federal commitment and other regulatory responsibilities. When we open that medicine cabinet, we hope, the Food and Drug Administration has done its job, that every prescription drug there is safe and effective and that they have 
   money to do it. The food we eat is still the safest in the world and will continue to be. 
   If we go down the track that is proposed by the Republicans in their trillion-dollar tax cut, we literally will imperil these programs. It is a fact of life. It will be Pollyanna-ish to suggest we can make a cut of $180 billion a year, as the Republicans have proposed, without having some impact on veterans programs, on Head Start, on transportation, and medical research. That becomes a major part of this discussion. 
   Let's take a look for a moment, if you will, at what some of the economists have said about the Republican tax bill. Fifty economists, including six Nobel laureates, have said:  
   An ever-growing tax cut would drain Government resources just when the aging of the population starts to put substantial stress on Social Security and Medicare.  
   That, of course, means as we have more and more people reaching retirement age and wanting to live their lives comfortably and independently, Social Security and Medicare absolutely have to be there. 
   The Republican approach to this, sad to report, not only does not protect the Social Security trust fund; if you will look at this chart, when it gets into the red ink, it means the Republican tax break plan has finally broken through and started using money from the Social Security trust fund. At the year 2005, the Republican tax breaks would raid the Social Security surplus. After all of the speeches they have given about lockboxes and protecting Social Security, they in fact turn to that money and pull it out in 2005, for what? To give tax breaks to the wealthiest among us. 
   There is a commentator named Kevin Phillips who for years was identified as a Republican. I do not know what his partisan identification is, honestly, but I can tell you what he had to say yesterday on National Public Radio. It is something that every American should hear. He was introduced by Bob Edwards, a familiar voice on National Public Radio, who said:  
   The Republican Party last week had its tax reduction proposal passed by the House of Representatives. Commentator Kevin Phillips says it's the most unsound fiscal legislation of the last half century.  
   I go on to read quotes from Mr. Phillips.  
   ..... that's because the cuts are predicated on federal budget surpluses so far out, six, eight or ten years, that it would take an astrologer, not an economist, to predict federal revenues.  
   He goes on to talk about the fairness of the tax cuts. Kevin Phillips:  
   ..... Democrats are certainly correct about the imbalance of benefits by income group. Treasury figures show that the top 1 percent of families, just 1 percent, would get 33 percent of the dollar cuts, the bottom 60 percent of families get a mere 7 percent.  
   So if you are in the category of a Donald Trump or a Bill Gates, or someone else, this is worth a lot of money. The Republican tax break plan literally could mean $10-, $20-, or $30,000 a year. But if you are a working family, struggling to make ends meet, putting some money together for your kid's college education or your own retirement, it turns out to be in the neighborhood of $20 or $30 a year. That, unfortunately, says a lot about what the Republican proposal would mean to the average family. To endanger our economic expansion, to possibly raise interest rates on home mortgages, business loans and farmers' loans, and to provide tax breaks which are amusing, at best, for average working families, that does not sound like a very sound deal. 
   The Senator from West Virginia made the point, and effectively. We should be dedicating these funds to retiring this national debt. It is still hard to believe that only 2 years ago we were talking about amending the Constitution for a balanced budget amendment because we were so hopelessly ensnared by deficits--it was the only way out. Now we are talking about giving money away at such a fast pace that we can endanger the economic recovery we have seen in the United States. 
   Let me read Kevin Phillips' conclusion in his remarks on National Public Radio's ``Morning Edition'' on Monday, July 26:  
   We can fairly call the House legislation the most outrageous tax package in the last 50 years. It's worse than the 1981 excesses, you have to go back to 1948, when the Republican 80th Congress sent a kindred bill to President Harry Truman. Truman vetoed it, calling the Republicans bloodsuckers, with offices on Wall Street.  
   Not my words--Kevin Phillips'.  
   Not only did [Truman] win reelection, but the Democrats recaptured Congress.  
   I think that puts it in a perspective that we should all be willing to acknowledge. If we are going to deal responsibly with tax cuts for working families, we have to do it in a way that does not tip the scales too heavily on the side of the wealthiest in America. 
   This is a good illustration: For the top 1 percent of wage earners in America, under the Republican tax break plan, a $22,964 average payment; for the bottom 60 percent, families making less than $38,200 a year--hold on to your hats, America--the Republican tax break plan gives you $139. That is a little over $10 a month. But look what Bill Gates and other folks are coming out with. It is the same old story. 
   Take a look at when the Republican tax break plan starts to bite. If you are in the baby boom generation, thinking about an idyllic retirement someday, right about the time you start to retire, the Republican tax breaks explode. 
   What does it mean? It means that, frankly, there will be less money around for the basics of life that we expect from the Federal Government. It is hard to imagine that we are in a position, as we are today with this economic expansion, of jeopardizing it with this kind of a tax break plan. I think it is far better for us to take an approach which the President and the Democrats support--I am beginning to believe some Republicans support--which suggests that our priorities should include Medicare, Social Security, and paying down the national debt. 
   The Republican approach literally provides no money, no money whatsoever, for us to take care of our Medicare obligation. I think it is just disingenuous for the Republicans to argue that they are only spending 25 percent of the surplus because we know that the unified surplus is, in fact, including the $1.9 trillion in Social Security trust funds. They talk a lot about lockboxes and protecting Social Security, and yet when it comes right down to it, when you look at the money available outside of Social Security, the actual surplus that we hope to imagine, 97 percent of it goes to the Republican tax cut and little or no money for Medicare and other national priorities. 
   This debate this week is critically important for all American families to  sustain the economic expansion which we have seen for the last 7 years. 
   I yield back the remainder of my time.

The administration said that it is 1 of the 13 riders--I think there are 9 remaining--which would be the basis of a veto of the legislation. I want to make sure the Record is clear and ask the Senator from Washington several questions. 
   In every instance when she referred to mining, are we talking about mining on public land?

   Mr. DURBIN. Let me ask the Senator from Washington, section 336 of this bill, the so-called environmental rider, called a prohibition on mill site limitations, if I read this correctly--I would like to read it to the Senator from Washington for her response--says:  
   The Department of Interior and the Department of Agriculture, and other departments, shall not limit the number or acreage of mill sites based on the ratio between the number or acreage of mill sites and the number or acreage of associated load or placer claims for any fiscal year.  
   I want to ask the Senator from Washington, as I read this, the 1872 mining law put a limitation of five acres on those who mine on our Federal lands to use as a dump site for their mill tailings. If I understand this environmental rider, this says there is no limitation whatsoever--that if this is enacted, these mining companies paying $2.50 an acre and literally taking millions of dollars of minerals out of our land and not paying us for it can then turn around and dump their waste in every direction with no limitation on the number of acres they can cover with this waste.

I am amazed. I would like to ask the Senator from Washington if she can tell me why. It is my understanding that when it comes to the selection of the mining site, there has to be approval by the Bureau of Land Management through a leasing process for the mining of coal on Federal lands.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DURBIN. I rise in opposition to the motion that has been filed by the Senator from Nevada, Mr. REID, on behalf of himself, Senator CRAIG, and Senator BRYAN.  
   As I read the amendment that has been proposed by the Senator from Nevada, there is virtually no change in the 
   original language offered by Senator CRAIG. 
   What the Senator from Nevada seeks to do is to say those mining operations currently in operation, those which have the plans of operations submitted to the Bureau of Land Management prior to October 1 of the year 2000, will not be subject to limitation on the acreage that can be used for their dumping of their mill site. I would suggest to the Senator from Nevada it is a slightly different approach, but the net impact is the same. 
   I have the greatest respect for the Senator from Nevada. I understand his knowledge and familiarity with this subject is certainly far better than my own. But I can tell the Senator, if he drives across my home area in down State Illinois, he will see the legacy of mining which we continue to live with. 
   In years gone by, in the State of Illinois, and many other States, mining companies literally took to the land, extracted whatever was valuable, and left the mess behind for future generations. You can see it, not only in the areas where we had shaft mining, but you have on our prairies small mountains of what was left behind, often toxic in nature, that now have to be reclaimed by today's taxpayers. Or you might visit Fulton County or southern Illinois and find areas that were strip mined. What is left behind is horrible. It is scrub trees, standing lakes, but, frankly, uninhabitable and unusable--left behind by a mining industry that had one motive: Profit. 
   It is interesting to me this debate really focuses on a law which was written 127 years ago. Not a single Member of the Senate would suggest that our sensitivity to environmental issues is the same today as it was 127 years ago. We know better. If you want to mine coal in Illinois today, you are held to high standards. The same is true in virtually every State in the Union. You can no longer come in and plunder the land, take out the wealth from it, and leave behind this legacy of rubbish and waste, this lunar landscape. That is today. That is the 20th century. That is 1999. 
   But when it comes to hard rock mining, we are driven and guided by a law that is 127 years old. It is interesting that the hard rock mining industry has not really worked hard to bring about a real reform of the law. I think that has a lot to do with the fact they have a pretty sweet deal. 
   For $2.50 an acre, they can take taxpayers' land--owned by Americans--and use it for their own profit, leaving their waste and mess behind, and move on. 
   For hundreds of dollars, they can extract millions of dollars of minerals and not pay the taxpayers a penny. 
   The Senator from Nevada says: Don't beat up on the mining industry. 
   I think that is a fair admonition. I don't believe we should beat up on the environment either. We certainly shouldn't beat up on taxpayers. The 1872 mining law does just that. 
   What is this all about? You will undoubtedly hear in a few minutes from the Senator from Idaho and others that some bureaucrat in the Department of the Interior in November of 1997 took it upon himself to decide what the law would be and all this amendment is about is to try to say to that bureaucrat: It is none of your business. We will decide how many acres you can use to dump your waste after you have mined on Federal land. 
   What is it all about? On November 7, 1997, the solicitor of the Department of Interior, Mr. Leshy, issued an opinion enforcing a provision of the 1872 mining law which restricts the amount of public land that can be used to dump waste from hard rock mines. 
   Now, some of those who support this amendment believe that the 1872 mining law is open to interpretation. Interestingly enough, the other body, the House of Representatives, by a margin of almost 100 Members, said that that interpretation is wrong. They go along with the position supported by the Senator from Washington and myself. With respect to mill site claims, the law states: ``No location made on and after May 10, 1872, shall exceed 5 acres.'' The law allows one 5-acre mill site claim per mineral claim. It means that if you buy, at $2.50 an acre or $5 an acre, the right to mine for these minerals, you can only use a 5-acre plot to dump your waste on the so-called mill site. 
   The effect of the amendment offered by the Senator from Nevada and the Senator from Idaho is to say: No, you can dump on as many acres as you want to, unlimited. Go ahead and leave the waste behind. Let the taxpayers in future generations worry about the environmental impact and what it does visually to America's landscape. 
   The Leshy opinion in 1997 simply reaffirms the plain language of the law and prior interpretations by Congress and by the mining industry. 
   I have in my hand citations of the mill site limitations under the 1872 mining law. I ask unanimous consent to have this printed as part of the RECORD.

   Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair. 
   I have quoted the specific words from the mining law of 1872. I can tell Senators that year after year, the 5-acre limitation was restated. There is nothing new about it. In 1872, again, the General Land Office refers to the law expressly limiting mill site locations made from and after its passage to 5 acres. 
   Twelve years later, in 1884, Secretary of the Interior J.B. Hoggin provided that the aggregate for lode claims is not more than 5 acres. In 1891, similar references; 1903, the same reference is made by the Acting Secretary of the Interior; the area of such additional tract is, by the terms of the statute, restricted to 5 acres. He goes on. In 1914, a treatise on mining by a gentleman named Curtis Lindley:  
   Lode proprietors may select one tract per mill site if the aggregate does not exceed 5 acres.  
   In 1955, Denver mining attorney John Shireman writes in the First Annual Rocky Mountain Mineral Law Institute:  
   Each lode claim is entitled to 1 mill site for use in connection therewith.  
   In 1960, Congress amended the mining law to allow location of mill sites in connection with placer claims. In its report on the bill, the Senate Interior Committee explained that it modified the language of the bill ``so as to impose a limit of one 5-acre mill site in any individual case, preventing the location of a series of 5-acre mill sites.'' 
   The references go on and on. The American Mining Congress has acknowledged the 5-acre limitation, and of course the branches of government have done the same. 
   What is in dispute here is, in the minds of a few Senators and the mining industry, the mining process has changed. They want to be able to use more acreage to dump what is left over from this mining process. 
   It is interesting that the mining industry is so confident that a court would hold up the 5-acre limitation that they have not in any way tested the solicitor's decision in court. They would rather find their friends here in the Senate. That opinion was issued by the solicitor almost 2 years ago. 
   You will hear a lot of comment--I have heard it in committee--that what Mr. Leshy did in this situation was unfair, illegal, and we are going to stop this bureaucrat from overreaching. 
   The obvious question is, If it is so unfair and illegal on its face, why didn't the mining industry go to court? They didn't go to court. They went to Congress because they know that their interpretation, their opposition to Mr. Leshy, can't stand up in court. 
   The Craig rider and now the Reid amendment will allow more dumping of toxic mining waste on public lands and undermine efforts to reform the last American dinosaur, the 1872 mining law. 
   What can we find in this mined waste? Lead, arsenic, cadmium, in addition to heavy metals. Because of irresponsible mining practices and poor regulation, the mining industry has left behind a legacy of 557,000 abandoned mines in 32 different States. The cost of cleaning up these sites is estimated to be between $32 billion and $72 billion. According to the U.S. Bureau of Mines, mining has contaminated more than 12,000 miles of rivers and streams and 180,000 acres of lakes in the United States. 
   Let me speak for a moment about the environmental damage. For those who say this is an industry which, frankly, may not cause environmental damage, I hope they will listen closely to what I am about to say: 16,000 abandoned hard rock mine sites have surface and ground water contamination problems that seriously degrade the water around them--16,000 of them. Over 60 of these abandoned hard rock mines pose such severe threats to public health and safety that the EPA has listed them as Superfund priority sites. 
   There are two or three things that I found incredible that I want to share and make a part of the RECORD. 
   Each year the mining industry creates nine times more waste than all of the municipal solid waste generated and discarded by all of the cities in the United States of America. In 1987, mines in the United States dumped 1.7 billion tons of solid waste onto our land while the total municipal solid waste from all cities in America totaled 180 million tons. 
   The second point--and this is hard to believe--each year the hard rock mining industry generates approximately  the same amount of hazardous waste as all other U.S. industries combined --one industry, hard rock mining, generating the same amount of hazardous waste as all other U.S. industries combined. You would think when you listen to the arguments from those who would make this dumping unlimited that this is somehow a passive thing, that it is no threat to the environment. 
   According to the EPA, the U.S. hard rock mining industry generated approximately 61 million tons of hazardous waste in 1985 compared to 61 million metric tons for all other American industries. And what the Craig and Reid amendment says is, for this dangerous waste, we will now give to the mining companies an unlimited landscape of taxpayer-owned land to dump it. 
   Although the mining industry claims that modern mines employ state-of-the-art technology that prevents contamination, it is not consistently used or managed properly. Some have said our references to contamination are ancient. In 1995, reporting to Congress on mine waste, the EPA stated not only had past mining activities created a major waste problem, but some of the very waste practices that contributed to these problems were still being used by the mining industry. 
   What kind of mining pollution? Acid mine drainage generated when rock which contains sulfide minerals reacts with water and oxygen to create sulfuric acid. Iron pyrite, fool's gold, is the most common rock type that reacts to form acid mine drainage. Acid leached from the rock severely degrades water quality, killing aquatic life and making water virtually unusable. 
   Second, heavy metal contamination 
   is caused when metals such as arsenic, cobalt, copper, cadmium, lead, silver, or zinc contained in excavated rock or exposed in an underground mine come in contact with water. Heavy metals, even in trace amounts, can be toxic to humans and wildlife. When consumed, the metals can bio-accumulate. 
   Processing chemical pollution occurs when chemical agents used by mining companies to separate the target mineral from the ore--cyanide, sulfuric acid, or liquid metal mercury--spill, leak, or leach from the mine site into nearby waters. These chemicals can be highly toxic to humans and wildlife. 
   The purpose of the amendment before us now is to expand the opportunity for dumping this kind of waste on public land, creating the opportunities for more environmental disasters and hazards to wildlife and humans as well. 
   A teaspoon of 2 percent cyanide solution can be lethal to humans; over 200 million pounds of cyanide is used in U.S. mining each year. 
   I have a lengthy list of examples here.  
   Gilt Edge Gold and Silver Mine, South Dakota: Shortly after opening in 1988, the Gild Edge gold and silver mine cyanide leaked into the groundwater and nearby streams as a result of torn containment liners, poor mine design, and sloppy management practices. Beginning in 1992 the mine began generating acid mine drainage. As a result of acid drainage from Gilt Edge waste piles, pH measurements in nearby steams in 1994 and 1995 were as low as 2.1 (battery acid has a pH of approximately 1; pure water has a pH of approximately 7.0). Due to pollution from the Gilt Edge Mine, area streams are unable to support viable populations of fish and bottom dwelling invertebrates 
   Summitville Gold Mine, Colorado: In 1986 Canadian based Galactic Resources opened the Summitville Gold Mine in Colorado. The company characterized the mine as a ``state-of-the-art'' cyanide heap leach gold mine. Immediately after gold production began, the protective lining under the massive heap of ore being treated with a cyanide solution tore, allowing cyanide to leak into the surface and groundwater. The cyanide, acid, and metal pollution from the mine contaminated 17 miles of the Alamosa River. Galactic declared bankruptcy and abandoned the site in 1992. The State of Colorado which had provide scant regulation of the mine asked the Environmental Protection Agency to take over the site under the Superfund program. As of 1996 taxpayers had spent over $100 million to clean up the site. 
   Iron Mountain, California: Until production was halted in 1963, the Iron Mountain mine produced a wealth of iron, silver, gold, copper and zinc. It also left a mountain of chemically-reactive ore and waste rock that continues to leach enormous amounts of acid and heavy metals pollution into nearby streams and the Sacramento River. 
   Despite expensive efforts to reduce pollution--Iron Mountain is now on the Superfund National Priority List--enormous amounts of contaminants continue to wash off the site. Each day Iron Mountain discharges huge quantities of heavy metals including 425 pounds of copper, 1,466 pounds of zinc, and 10 pounds of cadmium. Acid waters draining from the site have decimated streams, where the acidity in the water has been measured as low as minus 3 on the pH scale--10,000 times more acidic than battery acid. Streams downstream from the mine are nearly devoid of life. Experts have estimated that at present pollution rates the Iron Mountain site can be expected to leach acid for at least 3,000 years before the pollution source is exhausted. 
   Oronogo Duenweg Superfund Site, Missouri: Drinking wells near this sprawling complex of lead and zinc mines in Southwestern Missouri have been contaminated by past mining activities. 
   Chino Copper Mine, New Mexico: The mine has been plagued by spills, leaks and discharges of contaminated mine waste material. Much of the pollution has spilled into Whitewater Creek which runs through densely populated communities. In several incidents in 1987, the mine spilled more than 327,000 gallons of mine wastewater off the site. In 1988 another spill discharged more than 180 million gallons of mine wastewater. More than 90,000 gallons of wastewater were spilled in 1990, and another 120,000 gallons were spilled in 1992. 
   Brewer Gold Mine, South Carolina: Nearly 11,000 fish were killed in 1990 when heavy rains cause a containment pond to breach, dumping more than 10,000 million gallons of cyanide-laden water into the Lynches River. 
   DeLamar Mine, Idaho: The DeLalmar silver and gold mine in Idaho has repeatedly dumped heavy metal laced wastewater into nearby streams. Migratory waterfowl have been poisoned by cyanide from its ponds. 
   Stibnite Mine, Idaho: The Stibnite gold mine has leaked cyanide into nearby groundwater and the East Fork of the Salmon River, an important salmon spawning run. 
   Ray Mine, Arizona: The Ray Mine was polluted nearby groundwater with toxic levels of copper and Beryllium. In 1990, rainwater washed more than 324,000 gallons of copper-sulfite contaminated wastewater from the mine into the Gila River.  
   Mr. President, what we are doing today--and I am supporting the amendment of the Senator from Washington, Mrs. MURRAY--is asking the mining industry to take responsibility for their actions, to follow the law as it is clearly written, which limits to 5 acres the mill site, or dump site, they can use for their mining activities. Some of the pictures here--I am sure the Senator from Nevada and others think this picture, as graphic as it is, is ancient. I don't know. There is no date on it, and I won't represent that it is a modern scene, but it shows what unregulated mining has led to. It is a clear indication of a stream that is still in danger because of the pollution from the mining activities. 
   Modern mining techniques are represented in these photographs, and although they are hard for those following the debate to see, they suggest that when we get into hard-rock mining, we are talking about literally hundreds, if not thousands, of acres that become part of the dump site of this activity. A mining operation, after it has derived the valuable minerals from this Federal public land owned by taxpayers, got out of town and left this behind. So for generations to come, if they fly over, they will look down and say: I wonder who made that mess. 
   That is as good as it gets under the 1872 mining law. That is a sad commentary. Those who support the Craig-Reid amendment would like us to expand the possibility that these dump sites near the mines would basically be unlimited. They could go on for miles and miles, and we, as taxpayers, would inherit this headache in years to come. There is clearly a need for comprehensive mining reform. 
   About $4 billion worth of hard-rock minerals--gold, copper, silver, and others--are taken annually from public lands by mining companies without a penny paid to the U.S. taxpayer in royalties--not one cent. That is $4 billion each year out of our land, and not a penny is paid back to the taxpayers. 
   What would you think about it if your next-door neighbor knocked on the door and said he would like to cut down the trees in your back yard, incidentally, and said he will give you $2.50, and I am sure that is no problem. Of course, it is a problem. It is our property. On that property are treasures of value to us. We are talking about public lands that are our property as American citizens. Those who live in some States believe that that land belongs to them, for whatever they want to use it for. Some of us, as part of the United States of America--``E. Pluribus Unum,'' as it says above the chair of the Presiding Officer, ``of many one''--believe that as one Nation we have an interest in this public land,  an interest that goes beyond giving somebody an opportunity to profit and leave a shameful environmental legacy. 
   Since 1872, there has been more than $240 billion of taxpayer subsidies to the mining industry. 
   In 1993, the Stillwater Mining Company paid $5 an acre for 2,000 acres of national forest lands containing minerals with an estimated value of $35 billion. I will repeat that. They gave us, as taxpayers, $10,000 for access to $35 billion worth of minerals. Pretty sweet deal for the mining company. Not for the taxpayers. 
   In 1994, American Barrick Corporation gained title to approximately a thousand acres of public land in Nevada that contained over $10 billion in recoverable gold reserves. Now, 
   for access to $10 billion on Federal public lands, America's lands, how much did they pay? Five thousand one-hundred and forty dollars. A pretty sweet deal. 
   In 1995, a Danish mining company--not an American company--successfully patented public lands in Idaho containing over $1 billion worth of minerals, and this Danish company paid the American treasury $275--for $1 billion in minerals. 
   Due to irresponsible mining practices and poor regulation, the mining industry has left behind a legacy of 557,000 hard-rock abandoned mines in 32 States. As the Senator from Washington said earlier, the estimated cost of cleanup is $32 billion to $72 billion. 
   If this amendment passes that is being pushed on us today, it means there will be more land to be cleaned up. The estimate of $32 billion to $72 billion will grow as the profits are taken out of America's public lands. 
   There is one case I would like to tell you about: the Zortman-Landuski Mine. The Pegasus Gold Corporation operated these mines for years using Federal and private lands for mining and waste dumping, accumulating numerous citations for water quality violations. In January of 1998, Pegasus Gold Corporation filed for bankruptcy. The mines are now in the hands of a court-appointed judge. But the story gets better. Cost estimates for reclamation of these lands range from $9 million to $120 million. In other words, if we want to clean up the mess they left behind, it will cost taxpayers $9 million to $120 million. 
   Keep in mind, the amendment before us wants to expand the opportunity to leave that waste behind. More bills for future taxpayers to pay. 
   I know you are going to like this part. There are questions about whether the mine's reclamation bonds will be sufficient to pay for the cleanup. Here is where it gets good. In the meantime, Pegasus Gold Corporation has petitioned the bankruptcy court to provide $5 million in golden parachutes for departing executives. The same executives who left this trail of contamination now want to take out of the bankrupt corporation $5 million in golden parachutes because they have done such a fine job for the shareholders. They certainly didn't do a fine job for the taxpayers. They didn't do a fine job when it came to the environment. 
   If this amendment in the Interior Appropriation bill passes, it is an invitation for more greed and more environmental disasters. The mining industry has to accept the responsibility to come to Washington, deal across the table in a fair manner and in good faith to revise this law so they can pay royalties to the taxpayers for what they draw from this land. Instead, what they have done is try to force-feed through the Interior Appropriations bill a change in the law that will say that the number of acres used for disposal of waste and tailings is unlimited--unlimited. 
   So we will see further environmental disasters which undoubtedly will occur as a result of it. 
   The Senator from Washington started with the right amendment, an amendment which recognizes our obligation to future generations. It is not enough to make a fast buck or even to create a job today and leave behind a legacy for which future generations will have to pay. We don't accept that in virtually anything. Businesses across America understand that they have an obligation to not only make a profit, to not only employ those who work there, but to also clean up the mess and not contaminate the environment. 
   We have said that in a civilized nation it is too high a price to pay for those who just want to glean profits and to leave behind pollution of our air and water and other natural resources. For some reason, many people in the mining industry haven't received that message. They believe they can take the minerals from public lands and leave the environmental contamination behind.

   Mr. DURBIN. I say in response to the Senator from Nevada that I think there is a good starting point. It is existing law that has been there for a long time. They should look at the current law as it applies to those who would mine coal on Federal public lands. If they would follow the standards that apply to the mining of coal, here is the difference. We would have approval by the BLM through a leasing process for the selection of mining sites.

   Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator that I stand by my remarks. We could certainly resolve this later when we look 
   more closely at the law. 
   The second thing I would suggest is they pay a royalty. I think it is an outrage that they would pay $2.50 or $5 an acre and not pay a royalty to the taxpayers when they take millions, if not billions, of dollars worth of recoverable minerals out of our federally owned public lands.

   Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Nevada, because I believe the statements he made are in good faith and reflect where we should be. We should be sitting down and rewriting this law that is 127 years old instead of having other environmental riders in an Interior appropriations bill. We should be looking to the royalty question, which is a legitimate question that every taxpayer should be interested in instead of saying we are going to take the limitation of the acreage used by mining companies that dump their waste. 
   I think that is a legitimate concern. Maybe 5 acres isn't enough. But I also think it wouldn't be unreasonable to say to the mining companies: If we give you additional acres for mill sites, we will also require you to reclaim the land so that you can't leave the mess behind. 
   That is part of the law when it comes to coal mining on Federal public lands. Why shouldn't it be the case when it comes to hard-rock mining? 
   How can they step away from this mess and say: Frankly, future generations will have to worry about it, and we will not. Mandatory bonding, detailed permitting reclamation, mandated inspections--things that are part of the law when it comes to mining coal--should be part of the law when it comes to 
   hardrock mining. 
   I reject the idea that we will come in with this bill and make amendments friendly to the mining industry but not hold them to any new standard when it comes to reclamation or royalties. I think the taxpayers deserve better. I think the environment deserves better. 
   That is what is necessary in this debate. We have seen it, first, on the emergency appropriations bill, where a similar provision was put forward for one mining operation in the State of Washington. Now, if this amendment goes through, we have literally opened the door for mining operations across the United States to literally use as much acreage as they want for their mill sites.

   Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator from Montana, I think he knows well the environmental laws which we mentioned are not applied seriatim to all of these mining claims, and that is why we have the environmental contamination which we have today. That is one of the reasons why it is there. If we are going to have a mining law, I think we need one that talks not only about the profitability of the venture but about the environmental acceptability of this venture. That is the difficulty we run into. 
   I suspect that the mining industry may want to talk about more acreage for mill sites and dumping but may not be as excited about an environmental response bill. That is part of the discussion, as I see it. Sadly enough, this amendment, which has been added to the Interior appropriations bill, addresses the profit side of the picture and ignores the environmental and taxpayer side of the picture. That, to me, is shortsighted and something that should be defeated. 
   The fact that this was done in committee and has at least been attempted in the past is a suggestion to me that the mining industry, even with the Republican majority in the House and the Senate, really hasn't gone to the authorizing committees for the changes which have been suggested on the floor. I think they should. I think it is certainly time, after 127 years, to update this law. 
   In closing, if we are going to change this law and change it in a comprehensive and responsible way, let us do it through the regular authorizing process. 
   It is interesting to me that yesterday we had a fierce debate on the floor about rule XVI, and we said of rule XVI: We will not legislate on appropriations bills. 
   Of course, there are always exceptions to every rule. 
   In this case, because there was a reference to the mining act in the bill coming over from the House, they were allowed to offer this amendment. As Members may glean from the length and breadth of this debate and its complexity, we should not be putting this environmental rider on an appropriations bill at the expense of the environment and the taxpayers. 
   I say to the mining industry, a legitimate industry employing many hard-working people, certainly the things which are done are important to America's economy and its future, but it is not unreasonable for Americans to think that we have a vested interest in our own public lands. Companies cannot leave behind this legacy of waste. Unlimited acreage being used for dump sites is not being held accountable. 
   This amendment, if it passes, will say to these mining companies: These hard rock mining companies will not be held accountable. Use as much of America's land that is needed to dump your waste after you have mined the minerals. As taxpayers, we will accept it. 
   For this Senator from Illinois, the Senators from Washington and California and many others, that is unacceptable. 
   I yield back the remainder of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington for her leadership on this important issue. 
   I have listened carefully to this debate. I will gladly acknowledge that many of the Senators, including the Senator from Alaska, have more personal knowledge of the mining industry than I do. But I believe that the environmental issues here are clear-cut issues, whether you live in the East, West, North, or South. 
   What we are talking about here is public land--land owned by every taxpayer. The people in a certain State with public land have no more claim to it than those in every other State. That is why this is a national issue. 
   Allow me, if I may, to put this in a political context. It is my understanding that this was based on a decision in 1991--I underline 1991--in a manual that was issued by the Department of the Interior, which has now become the handbook, or so-called ``manual,'' which has now become the basis of this debate. This so-called manual, or handbook, was neither a regulation nor a law. It was an interpretation which varied from interpretations which had been in existence since 1872. 
   For the first time since 1872, in 1991 in the closing days of the Bush administration, someone working in the Department of the Interior raised a question as to whether we would limit these mill sites to 5 acres. That limitation had not been questioned seriously at any point in the promulgation of the Surface Mining Act or in any other law until that date. 
   The mining industry seized that interpretation in 1991, in the closing hours of the Bush administration, and said: Now the lid is off. We can use as many acres as we want to dump next to our mining sites. 
   When Mr. Leshy came back in 1997 and said there is no basis in law for  that handbook decision, that is when the industry went wild, came to Capitol Hill, and said what we cannot overturn it in the courts and we want you to overturn it with riders on appropriations bills. 
   Those who talk about the sacred law in this handbook, let me tell you, one person in 1991, and one variation on the 5-acre limitation, and that is the basis for all of the argument that is being made by the other side. 
   Let me raise a second point. The Senator from Alaska, as well as the Senator from Idaho, said that the Clean Water Act applies to those who are involved in hard rock mining. 
   For the RECORD, I would like to make this clear. The Clean Water Act--I quote from ``Golden Dreams, Poisoned Streams'' by the Mineral Policy Center, certainly an organization which has an environmental interest in this, and I am proud to quote it as a source. If there are those who can find them wrong, make it a part of the RECORD. But I would gladly quote them as they say:  
   The Clean Water Act, for instance, only partially addresses oversight surface water discharge. While the act sets limits on pollutants which can be discharged from surface waters from fixed point sources, like pipes and other outlets, it fails to directly regulate discharge to ground water, though ground water contamination is a problem at many mine sites. The Clean Water Act does not set any operational or reclamation standard for a mine to assure that sites will not continue to pollute water sources when they are abandoned.  
   So for those who are arguing on the side of the mining industry to come to this floor and argue that the Clean Water 
   Act will guarantee no environmental problems, let me tell you, it does not do it.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I thank the Senator from South Dakota. 
   Yogi Berra, one of the greatest ``political philosophers'' of all time, may have said, ``This is deja vu all over again.'' If he didn't say it, he should have because this debate that you are hearing on the floor of the Senate is almost a carbon copy of the debate of 1981. Think about that for a moment. We were in the first year of the Reagan Presidency. We had accumulated, in the entire history of the United States of America, $1 trillion in debt, and the Republican Party came to the floor and said now is the time for a massive tax cut. Their supporters cheered, they enacted their massive tax cut, and what happened? Two significant things: 
   First, we saw a dramatic increase in the national debt. A $1 trillion accumulated debt in the entire history of the United States grew into more than $4 trillion over the span of the Reagan and Bush Presidencies because of that 1981 decision. 
   Second, it was such a bad decision that the American economy struggled from recession to recession. That is what happened the last time the Republican Party brought their vision of America to the floor of the Congress. 
   In 1992, the American voters said: Enough; this isn't working. We want a change. And they elected the Clinton-Gore administration, which, in 1993, came to Congress and said: Let us try to get back on the right track; let us try to reduce the deficits on an annual basis, and let us try to get the economy moving again. 
   You should have heard the Republican Senators who came to the floor--the same ones who begged for a tax cut when the Clinton plan was debated.  
   Remember, not a single Republican Senator or House Member 
   voted for that plan. Some of the things they said are absolutely classic. The Senator from Texas, PHIL GRAMM, who is very outspoken in favor of this tax cut, said of the Clinton plan:  
   I want to predict tonight that if we adopt this bill, the American economy is going to get weaker and not stronger, the deficit 4 years from today will be higher than it is today.  
   That was PHIL GRAMM of Texas, August 5, 1993. Completely wrong. Completely wrong. 
   The Clinton plan passed, and two things happened. Annual deficits started to come down, and, in addition to that, the economy started moving forward. Just look at the news. You don't have to believe a politician. Unemployment is down. Housing starts are up. Business starts are up. Inflation is under control. America is moving forward, and we can feel it. Consumer confidence and business confidence is at an all-time high. 
   Two years ago, if you would have come to this Senate Chamber, the Republican Members were so despondent over the deficits that they wanted to amend the Constitution. That isn't done very often in America, but they said: We need to pass a balanced budget amendment. Why? So the Federal courts can force Congress not to overspend. A constitutional amendment to give a Federal judge the power to stop Congress from spending because deficits were out of control. That was only 2 years ago. 
   Now what debate do we hear on the floor? It isn't about deficits and constitutional amendments; it is about the surplus and tax cuts. And I have to tell you, quite honestly, the Republican agenda is out of control. What they are suggesting now is a $1 trillion tax cut that, frankly, will not only imperil the state of our economy but also could drive us right back into deficits again. How will we pay for that? 
   I would like to yield to the Senator from California because she made an observation that I think should be part of the record of this debate. I yield to her for a question.

   Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from California is right because we are not dealing with a real surplus. We are dealing with a surplus in the Social Security trust fund which the Republican Party now wants to give away as a tax cut. Does that make sense? Does it make sense to any of us paying into Social Security, or those who hope to derive some benefit from it, at this point in time to decide to spend Social Security funds to give a tax cut? 
   I might say to the Senator from California: Look at the tax cut. There they go again. The Republicans cannot leave well enough alone. The economy is moving forward. Annual deficits are coming down. They want to put a tax cut package in place. 
   And look carefully at the winners under the Republican tax cut plan. For Mr. Bill Gates, good news. If you are in the top 1 percent, for the Republican tax, a cut of $22,000 a year--not bad. Will he notice? 
   But, look, if you are in the lowest 20 percent of average wage earners in America, under the Republican tax cut plan, listen to this, $22 a year--not bad--$22 a year for the average working family in America, and $22,000 for Mr. Trump and Mr. Gates. 
   There they go again.

   Mr. DURBIN. The answer is clear. Zero. Medicare is a word about which the Republicans don't want to talk. They don't want to use it. Yet we all know that, unless we do something significant for the Medicare program, by the year 2015 this program will be bankrupt and 40 million Americans, elderly and disabled, who rely on Medicare for their health insurance have a time of reckoning that is just over the horizon. 
   We on the Democratic side believe that if there is going to be any surplus, as the President has suggested, we should dedicate it, first, to any surplus we realize to Social Security; second, to Medicare; and, third, to reducing the national debt. 
   I ask you: Which is the party of fiscal conservatism? 
   Listen to this debate: $1 trillion taken out of funds such as the Social Security trust fund to give away to the wealthiest of Americans, which is the Republican plan, or the Democratic plan, which says to take care of priorities--reducing our debt, reducing our need to appropriate money each year for interest on the debt, and making sure that Medicare and Social Security are strong enough to survive. 
   I think our position is not only fiscally conservative but I think it is fiscally sane. Others will characterize an alternative.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, one of the important items contained in the Commerce-Justice-State appropriations bill is the appropriation for the Census Bureau. 
   I think we all agree, a fair and accurate census is a fundamental part of our representative democracy and good government. As required by the Constitution, census results will determine how many members of the House of Representatives will come from each of the states. Those results will also determine how many federal dollars, funding a wide array of important programs, will return back to the state. We're talking about over $180 billion that will go to state and local governments and the distribution of additional billions in state funds. This same data is a vital component in determining where to build roads, hospitals, schools; even your local Wal-Mart or McDonald's location is based on this same information. 
   The Census Bureau projects that the U.S. population will near 266 million in  2000. Cost estimates for administering Census 2000 were projected to be anywhere between $4 and $4.8 billion. Those projections were based on the assumption that ``sampling'' would be used to provide the fairest and most accurate count to date.

   Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator from Minnesota a question. I listened carefully to his presentation and asked for a copy of the amendment to read it more closely. 
   One of the things I have found in working with law enforcement officials--I think the Senator from Minnesota has highlighted it--is they come upon a scene where a violent crime, maybe a very serious violent crime has been committed, and among all of their concerns, preserving evidence, making certain, if possible, to save any victim who might be battered or injured, there is that tiny little person who has just witnessed this scene. 
   When I spoke to the International Association of Chiefs of Police, one of the things which we discussed was to put on each investigative report from a violent crime a section that would indicate that the police know that minor children witnessed the violent crime and perhaps a method, then, of providing confidential information to counselors or social workers who would know. Then there is a heads-up, there is a red flag, that there has been a child involved. That child may be so young as to be overlooked as part of the investigation report, and they have suggested--and I think it is valuable, and perhaps at some point we can make it part of this effort--that law enforcement officials would be looking for this because, as the Senator from Minnesota has so eloquently given to the Senate today in his presentation, these kids witnessing violence can have their lives changed dramatically. An intervention at that point could not only make things better for them but could ultimately save their lives. 
   I ask the Senator from Minnesota if he would be kind enough to consider that either as a suggestion as part of this legislation or in separate correspondence with those who would administer the programs he has suggested.

   Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from California for her leadership on this issue. It is late at night. People do not want to talk about this. They want to go home. Some of us will go home and eat tuna salad. And if you eat tuna in your household, you bear some responsibility. You hope that your children will have that opportunity, and you hope that the fisheries around the world are going to be handled responsibly. 
   We passed a law here in 1997 and said: We are going to do what we can to conserve the dolphin which have become victims of those who are fishing for tuna--international convention, international agreement, dolphin conservation. And we said: If you happen to be one of the countries fishing for tuna that may endanger the dolphin, we are going to make you participate, spend some money to make sure this program works based on the percentage of your catch. That is a very reasonable program, conserving the dolphin, saying to each country: Pay your fair share based on what you catch. 
   I live in the Midwest. I do not live near an ocean. But I get it. I understand this. I just cannot understand why in this bill--before the amendment by the Senator from California--that we are suggesting the United States should pay more than its share. 
   There are countries here, for example, that are paying nothing.

   Why aren't these countries paying their fair share, their fishery industry fishing for tuna, signatories to this agreement? They should be paying their share instead of being subsidized by the United States. 
   I think we should take the money saved by the Senator from California and dedicate it to a lot of other international fishery efforts that are listed within this legislation. 
   I am happy to support her amendment. I think it is eminently fair. I hope those listening to the debate will join us in making certain that every country lives up to its obligation.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senator DORGAN today introducing legislation which would make it easier for a family to hold onto a small business or farm when the head of the family passes away. I am especially pleased to be joined by Senator DORGAN on this bill as he has been a good friend and colleague for almost two decades and a real leader on small business issues since his election to Congress in 1980. 
   Mr. President, ownership is a powerful force. Anyone who has gone from renting to owning a home will tell you how much more work you put in as an owner. Suddenly, problems with the plumbing or the roof that used to be the landlord's problems are now your problems. Developments in the neighborhood take on new meaning and you tend to spend more time working with neighbors to figure out ways to make your community stronger. 
   The trade-off for all this work is that whatever improvements we make to our homes and our communities, they're ours. And if our homes increase in value, we get to keep the difference. 
   The same is true for small businesses and family farms. Most people who have gone from being an employee to owning a small business or farm will tell you that they work harder as an owner, save more, and take more pride in their work. As with homeowners, small businesspeople and farmers are willing to put in the extra work it takes to run a business because they know it will come back to them in the form of more customers and higher profits. It is this industrious spirit that has defined our nation for more than two centuries and allowed us to enjoy a level of prosperity unknown in any other part of the world, in any other era of human history. 
   The bill we are introducing today makes a simple change in the tax code that will help families pass down the legacy of business ownership from one generation to the next. 
   Mr. President, the federal estate tax is one of the most controversial provisions of the tax code. Whatever the merits or shortcomings of the estate tax, I believe most of my colleagues would agree that a family should not have to sell a small business or family farm just because the head of the family passes away. Unfortunately, small business owners face a very real concern that the estate tax may force their families to do just that, particularly families whose business' principal assets consist of machinery, real estate, equipment, and inventory . Those families fortunate enough to avoid selling their business or farm are often frustrated by having to finance their estate tax burden at the expense of needed investments in the business. 
   Recognizing this problem, Congress worked on a bipartisan basis in 1997 to include provisions in the Taxpayer Relief Act which provide targeted assistance to estates with family-owned businesses and farms. Among its provisions, the Taxpayer Relief Act provided an immediate increase in the estate tax exemption from $600,000 to $1.3 million for estates with businesses that are kept in the family, and improved the terms for installment payments made by estates with businesses by reducing the interest rate from 4 percent to 2 percent for the first $1 million in taxable value of the business in excess of the $1.3 million exemption. 
   The bill that Senator DORGAN and I are introducing today builds on the 1997 Taxpayer Relief Act by simply doubling the $1.3 million exemption for family-owned businesses and farms to $2.6 million. This new level would mean that a typical business with up to 25 employees would face no estate tax liability if the business is kept in the family after the owner dies. Somewhat larger businesses would enjoy a significant reduction in their estate tax burden. 
   Mr. President, we should be doing what we can to promote small business and farm ownership in America. This bill does just that by simply making it easier for families to continue their tradition of small business ownership. I urge all my colleagues to join Senator DORGAN and me in supporting this legislation.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I want to say a word about the tragedy which has befallen the Kennedy family and the Bessette family, as we learn about the terrible circumstances involving the plane crash last Friday. When my wife came in in Springfield, IL, Saturday morning and said that she had just heard on the radio that John Kennedy's plane was missing, our reaction was the same: Could this be another tragedy for this family? 
   The Kennedy family means so much to America, so much to the Democratic Party, and so much to many of us personally. As a young student just starting at Georgetown University in 1963, I arrived weeks before the assassination of President John Kennedy. I stood on Pennsylvania Avenue and watched the funeral cortege leave the White House for this Capitol Building, where President John Kennedy's body was held in reverence for visitation by the American people. 
   Then I can recall, as a college student, sitting in this gallery and looking down on this floor to watch as Senator TED KENNEDY and Senator Robert Kennedy talked about the war in Vietnam, and in the gallery across the way was Ethel Kennedy and other members of the Kennedy family. Little did I dream that the day would come when I would serve with Senator TED KENNEDY and come to know him personally. Each of us who serves with him understands what an extraordinary person he is. He, in my mind, is the best legislator on the floor of the Senate. He is so well versed, so well prepared, and so hard-working, that he is an inspiration to all of us. 
   We are reminded from time to time, as we were this weekend, that his obligations go beyond the Senate and certainly to a large family who looks to him for guidance and leadership in times of trial. This week, TED KENNEDY is bringing together the Kennedy family in mourning over the death of John Kennedy, his wife Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister Lauren. Our hearts go out to him and the entire family and to the Bessette family as well. 
   Those of us who remember that 1963 assassination graphically can recall exactly where we were at the moment that we heard President John Kennedy was shot. As we watched all the scenes unfold afterwards, one of the most poignant was that of little John Kennedy saluting his father as the casket passed in front of the church. I guess we had always hoped that because Caroline and John Kennedy had endured this tragedy so early in life that God would find a special place for them and they would lead normal, happy, and secure lives. They certainly set out to do it and did it well, both of them. Then again, a tragedy such as this will occur and remind us again of our vulnerability and fragility as human beings. 
   Our hearts and prayers go out to both families, and certainly to Senator KENNEDY in his leadership role in the Kennedy family. We will be remembering them as this week passes and as we address our concern and sympathy on the floor of the Senate.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I wish to address an issue which is topical and one that most Americans will be hearing about during the course of this week and the next. It is an issue involving tax cuts. Can there be two more glorious words for a politician to utter than ``tax cuts''? 
   People brighten up and their eyes open and they look in anticipation, and they think: What is this politician going to bring me by way of a tax cut? 
   Our friends on the Republican side of the aisle have decided that they will make the centerpiece of their legislative effort this year a tax cut, a tax cut which, frankly, will have an impact on America--positive in some respects but overwhelmingly negative in other respects--for decades to come. So I think it is important for us to come to the floor and discuss exactly where we are today and where we are going. 
   First, a bit of history: 
   In the entire history of the United States of America, from President George Washington and through the administration of President Jimmy Carter, our Nation accumulated $1 trillion in debt--a huge sum of money over 200 years. But at the end of the Carter administration, and the Reagan and Bush administrations began, we started stacking up debts in numbers that were unimaginable. In fact, today we have over $5 trillion in national debt. Think about that--200 years, $1 trillion, and, just in the last 20 years, another $4 or $5 trillion in debt. 
   What does it mean to have a debt in this country? You have to pay interest on it, for one thing. The interest we pay each year on that debt we have accumulated is $350 billion out of a national budget this year of about $1.7 trillion. You see that each year about 20 percent of our national budget goes to pay interest on the debt we have accumulated. 
   The new President came in--President Clinton--in 1992 and said: We have to do something about this. We can't keep going down this path of accumulating debt and paying more money in interest. It isn't good for our current generation to be paying out that money, and certainly we shouldn't saddle our children with that added responsibility. 
   In 1993, he came to the Congress and said: Let us take from what we have been doing over the past 10 years and do something new. The President proposed a new budget plan--a plan that was determined to bring down this debt. That plan passed without a single Republican vote. In 1993, the Clinton plan passed without a single Republican vote in this Chamber. Vice President Gore came to the Chair and cast the deciding vote to pass the plan. 
   It was a big gamble. Some Members of Congress on the Democratic side lost in the next election because they voted for the Clinton plan. Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky, one of my colleagues from the State of Pennsylvania, cast a courageous vote for that plan and lost in the next election. 
   But was the President right? History tells us he was dramatically so because in the last 6 years we have seen not only our economy grow dramatically in terms of the creation of jobs and businesses--low inflation, new housing starts, and all the positive things we like--but we have finally seen us turn the corner and move toward balance when it comes to our annual Federal budget. 
   Now, if you will, we are not discussing what to do as we swim through this sea of red ink but, rather, what to do with an anticipated surplus. In 6 years, we have moved from talk of a deficit to speaking of surplus. 
   There are two different views on what to do with this future surplus. The Republican side of the aisle is suggesting a $1 trillion tax cut over a 10-year period of time. I am sure that is appealing to some, particularly if you are in the higher income groups in America who will benefit from this tax cut. But certainly we ought to step back for a second and say: Is that the responsible thing to do? Should we be giving away $1 trillion in tax cuts over the next 10 years at the expense of virtually everything else? 
   Our side of the aisle, the Democratic side of the aisle, working with President Clinton, has a different approach, one which I think is more responsible and more consistent with the leadership which the Democrats showed in turning the corner 
   on these Federal deficits. It is basically this: 
   First, let us meet our current obligations to Social Security and to Medicare. 
   It is amazing to me, as I listen to the Republicans talk about all of our future challenges, that there is one word they are afraid to utter--the word ``Medicare,'' the health insurance program for over 40 million senior and disabled Americans, a program which needs our attention and help. 
   What the Democrats and the President propose is to take a portion of the future anticipated surplus as it comes in to solidify Social Security for another 50 years and to make sure Medicare can start to meet its obligations past the year 2012. 
   We will have to do more, believe me. But at least by dedicating that portion of the surplus, I think we are accepting the responsibility, before we give money away for any new program or give money away for any tax cut, to take care of the programs that mean so much to American families and in the process bring down the national debt and start paying off this $5 trillion national debt. 
   Is that important? It is critically important because not only by bringing down this debt will we reduce our annual interest payments of $350 billion, but we will free up capital in America for small businesses, large businesses, and families alike to borrow money at a low interest rate.

   Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from California. 
   I point to this chart. I hope this can be seen because the Republican tax cut plan of $1 trillion over the first 10 years leaves nothing for Medicare--not a penny for Medicare, as if the Medicare program itself is self-healing. It is not. 
   If you were going to deal with the Medicare problems--and they are substantial--you have only two or three options: raise payroll taxes and increase the amount paid by those under Medicare or cut benefits. We may face some combination of those, as painful as they will be. But they will be much worse if, in fact, we don't dedicate a portion of the surplus to the Medicare program.  
   The Senator is right. If you take a look at this, there is not a penny of the Republican tax cut plan for Medicare and other priorities.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from California. 
   I think we should take this a step further. It is not only a disservice to seniors who are covered by Medicare but to their families as well. 
   Those of us who have dealt with aging parents and their medical problems understand that a family often has to rally together to try to figure out how to help a mother, a father, a grandmother, or a grandfather. If the additional expenses that are being shouldered because of the refusal of the Republicans to deal with the Medicare challenge end up falling on the shoulders of the frail and elderly, they will be expenses shared by many members of the family. 
   I think it is an element that has to be brought to this basic consideration. It is one thing to say we are giving you a tax cut on the one hand and yet we are going to increase the cost of Medicare to you on the other. 
   I want to make two points which I think are important as well. I am, I guess, right on the age of what is known as the baby boom generation. I took a look at this Republican tax cut not just for the first 10 years. This isn't a tax cut where they want to change the law for 10 years and then go back to the old one. It goes on indefinitely. We have a right and a responsibility to chart out what the Republican tax cut means beyond the first 10 years, 
   to see what it means in the next 10 years and the following 10 years. 
   Look what happens. It explodes from the years 2000 to 2004, $156 billion; $636 billion in the next 5 years; $903 billion in the following 4 years, and over $1 trillion in the last. 
   What does it mean? For the so-called baby boomers such as myself, when the time comes for retirement, the debt is going to start exploding again. The service of that debt, the interest paid on the debt because of the Republican tax cut proposal, will be a new burden to be shouldered by that future generation. It is not responsible. The Republican approach is not responsible. Not only does it ignore Medicare but it drags America right back into the sea of red ink. They are so determined to give these tax cuts to wealthy Americans that they are going to do it at the expense of fiscal sanity. Haven't we learned a lesson over the last 10 or 20 years, that we cannot do this without jeopardizing the possibility that we are going to have some kind of fiscal sanity for decades to come? 
   Think about this in the private sector. My friends on the Republican side say run government like a business. Microsoft is a very profitable business. Would Microsoft give shareholders huge dividends based on expected future profits? Of course not. They declare a dividend when the money is in the bank. 
   The Republican tax cut programs wants to declare a national dividend in anticipation of money coming into the bank; the Democratic alternative says no, dedicate a portion of that surplus to Social Security and to Medicare, and if there is to be a tax cut, let it be a reasonable, affordable tax cut to help middle-income families first. That is the difference. It is an important difference. 
   We also have to take into consideration that if the Republican tax cut is enacted, it is going to put pressure on Congress to cut spending in future years. Some people say Congress should cut spending; we ought to live within our means. The amount of money that will be taken from the Treasury by the Republican tax cut in the outyears would have a dramatic negative impact on America. 
   This chart illustrates that. If the Republican budget passes, and the tax cuts which they have propose are enacted, here are the cuts we will face. The Head Start Program--a program for the youngest kids in America, in some of the most vulnerable families, who are given a chance to start school ready to learn--will be cut for 375,000 children. The Republican tax cut leads to a cut in Head Start of services to 375,000 kids. 
   What will happen to these children? They will show up for kindergarten and the first grade and they may not be ready to learn. So school districts will have added responsibilities and society will have added responsibilities. We see it reflected in crime statistics, in welfare statistics. When we cut back in early childhood education, which the Republican plan leads us to, we will pay for it dearly. 
   Veterans, VA medical care. If the Republican plan passes, forcing the budget cuts which inevitably follow, they will cut treatment for 1.4 million patients, veterans who come to hospitals asking for the care they were promised when they served our country. Is that a reasonable alternative? I think it is not. 
   Under title I, education for the disadvantaged, cutting services for 6.5 million children; The FBI, eliminating over 6,000 agents. 
   The Republicans smile and say, come on, we can give tax cuts, we can cut the budget, and none of this will occur. 
   We have lived through that era, that era of overpromising, that era that built up the red ink in this country to the point where we faced a national crisis and pleas from the Republican side to enact a constitutional amendment so that the courts could force Congress to spend its money responsibly. We don't want to return to that again. 
   This morning I had a meeting with the superintendent of the Office of Education from the State of Illinois, Max McGee, and the chairman of the State board of education, Ron Gidwitz, a businessman from Chicago. They came in asking for more Federal dollars. They want to have early childhood programs so kids get a better start at learning. They want the schoolday to go from 3 o'clock in the afternoon until 6 o'clock where kids have added adult supervision. They want school extended in the summer so kids have an added chance to learn. 
   These are all wonderful consensus ideas in education, and each one of them costs money. Naturally, our State education officials come to us asking for more Federal dollars. I told them they came at exactly the right moment because the debate starts across the Rotunda in the House today on whether or not the Republican tax cut plan will pass. If it does, and if it is enacted--which I doubt the President would see in the future--we will face the possibility of fewer dollars available for education at a time when most people believe if the 21st century is to be another American century, we need to dedicate resources to education and to our kids. That is the choice. It is stark. It is difficult. It is politically treacherous. 
   We must do the responsible thing. The responsible thing is to take whatever surplus comes in the future, dedicate it first to Social Security, then to Medicare, and then to retiring the national debt so that families across America and businesses alike can enjoy continued prosperity, a responsible approach which guards the prosperity for the future. 
   I don't think the American people will be deceived in believing this tax cut is their deliverance from concern in the future.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maryland who has been recognized for his work with the Budget Committee and the Joint Economic Committee. He is a thoughtful analyst of our Nation's economy. I certainly agree with his conclusion. 
   I would like to make two points, though, that we have not raised so far, to take a closer look at the tax cuts proposed by the Republicans. 
   The Citizens for Tax Justice have done an analysis of the House tax cut proposal, and they have found that 44 percent of all the benefits in that tax cut bill will go to the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans. I am sure Mr. Gates, Mr. Trump, and all the others who have done so well in this economy would love to see a tax cut. But I am not sure they need a tax cut. 
   Take a look at this. Mr. President, 60 percent of the Republican tax cut would benefit the wealthiest 5 percent, three-quarters of it to the wealthiest 20 percent. Whom have they left behind? Working families--working families who will see little or no tax relief as a result of this Republican plan. 
   I think about Governor Ann Richards of Texas who used to make comments  about the other party, the Grand Old Party, and say: They just can't help themselves. When it comes to tax cuts, they just can't stay away from giving tax cuts to the wealthiest people in America at the expense of working families, at the expense of Medicare, at the expense of paying down the national debt, and at the expense of our current economic prosperity. 
   The Republican Party is adrift, searching for an issue. The one they think they can coalesce behind is a tax cut, the one thing that brings every wing of their party, from extreme right to right and everything between it, together. Yet every time they do it, it turns out they have tipped the scales so heavily to the rich that the American people say we do not want any part of this. If this is just going to be a cheering section of people from country clubs who think the tax cuts are really going to be something for the future, so be it, but it is not good enough for the country.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I think it is fundamentally unfair. I agree with the Senator from California. Most people who are in these high-net-worth situations would not miss a decimal point in their net worth, but the Republican tax cut plan wants to give them more money. Yet when we try to bring up an issue such as increasing the minimum wage from $5.15 an hour, the Republicans just will not accept that. So we are going to have that fight later this year, I am sure, on the floor of the Senate. 
   That gives me an opportunity to summarize, if I may, my view of this Congress and the difference between the two parties. Take a look at the Senate over the last 2 months if 
   you want to know the difference between this side of the aisle, the Democratic side, and the Republican side. 
   On the issue of gun control, sensible gun control, after the shootings in schools across America, the Democrats pushed a sensible gun control plan which attracted the support of six Republican Senators. I salute their courage for joining us, giving us finally enough votes, as a minority, to bring in Vice President GORE casting the tie-breaking vote for sensible gun control--trigger locks for guns that are safer for kids, trying to make sure people buying guns at gun shows are not criminals or children, trying to make sure we do not keep importing these high-capacity ammunition clips of 240 rounds of ammunition. Who needs that for hunting or safety in their homes? 
   We passed it, sent it over to the Republicans in the House, and they just beat it to pieces. There is nothing left. We have to get back and pass sensible gun control--a clear difference between Democrats and Republicans. 
   On the Patients' Bill of Rights, we on the Democratic side came in and said what is going on is scandalous; doctors should make decisions, not insurance companies; and insurance companies should be held accountable when they make the wrong decision. The Democrats stood for that position. The Republicans, with the exception of two Senators, opposed us. The difference between the Democrats and Republicans: We believe in the Patients' Bill of Rights, the Republicans oppose it. 
   When it comes to this issue, what a change of hats. The Democrats are in the role of fiscal conservatives. The Democrats are saying mind our own business when it comes to Social Security, the future of Medicare, and retiring the national debt; the Republican side says at least $1 trillion in tax cuts the first 10 years, and then watch it explode in the outyears. 
   For the American people following this debate in the Senate, they have a choice. If you buy into the Republican philosophy of runaway tax cuts and irresponsible spending in the future, if you buy into the idea of standing up on the floor of the Senate for the health insurance companies and opposing the efforts of families and doctors and hospitals to bring some sanity back to health care, if you buy into the Republican position supporting the National Rifle Association and the gun lobby, then that is your party, that is where you should turn, and be proud of it. 
   But if you think there is a better choice, if you think coming together on a bipartisan basis for sensible gun control, for the Patients' Bill of Rights, and for a fiscally responsible approach to our budget in the future, I think that is the better way to go. That is the clear choice, and politics is about choices. 
   I thank my colleagues from California and Maryland for joining me in the morning business, and I yield the remainder of my time.

   Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Nevada. 
   Mr. President, this is the heart of the debate. This is what the Patients' Bill of Rights is all about. The insurance companies hate the idea of being sued in court as the devil hates holy water. They do not want to be held accountable for their actions. They want to be protected so they can make the wrong decision when it comes to medical care for American families and never be held accountable. 
   The amendment being offered on the Republican side is an effort to take away from 123 million Americans the right to hold health insurance companies accountable. That is the bottom line: 123 million Americans will be denied an opportunity to go to court when a health insurance company makes a decision which costs them their health or their life. 
   Most people are stunned to know that you cannot take a health insurance company to court. Since 1974, a Federal law has protected health insurance companies from being sued. 
   What does that mean? When your doctor wants a certain procedure, a certain medicine, a certain specialist for your good or the good of your family, and that doctor is overruled by a health insurance company bureaucrat, the doctor is the only one who will be taken to court, not the health insurance company. 
   If we pass nothing else in this Patients' Bill of Rights but this section which says health insurance companies will be held accountable in court, it would be a major victory for America. I trust the judgment of 12 citizens of this country in a jury box to decide the fairness and legality of an issue. Obviously, the Republican side does not. They do not want the health insurance companies to go to court. They do not want 
   them to face a jury. They do not want them to be held accountable. 
   This party, which parades and triumphs values and responsibility does not want to hold the health insurance companies responsible in the most basic form of adjudication in our country: a jury of your peers. 
   Oh, they make a lot of arguments about, oh, we are just gilding the lily and feathering the nests of all these trial lawyers. That is not what it is all about. You know it and all America knows it. 
   The health insurance companies, with the Republican majority, are determined to stop 123 million Americans from ever having a day in court. Ever. 
   For the last 2 days, Senator KENNEDY, Senator REID, and all of my colleagues have brought stories to the floor--chilling, heartbreaking stories. Here is one. Florence Corcoran. Let me quote Florence Corcoran:  
   They let a clerk thousands of miles away make a life threatening decision about my life and my baby's life without even seeing me and overruled five of my doctors. They don't get held accountable. And that's what appalls me. I relive that all the time. Insurance companies don't answer to nobody.  
   That is what Florence Corcoran says: ``Nobody knows about ERISA,'' this Federal law that protects health insurance companies. 
   If you are listening to the debate, you would think: Well, surely there must be a long roster of companies in America that receive the same kind of immunity from liability that cannot be brought to court. No. This is it, folks. This is the only sector of the American economy--maybe the only sector in America--that is going to be allowed to be held above the law. 
   The Republican majority and the health insurance industry are determined to protect their immunity from a lawsuit so that Florence Corcoran, when her life and the life of her baby were threatened by the decision of a health insurance company, can't even take that health insurance company to court. 
   The Senator from Alabama gets up and talks about: Oh, this legal system, it is so expensive. It takes so long. Let me tell you, when it is your life or the life of your baby, and this is the only place to turn, this is where you will turn. Yes, you will go to a lawyer because you are not wealthy, who will charge a contingency fee, meaning if he wins he gets paid; if he loses, he does not. That is part of the American system. 
   How many times, day in and day out, do we hear about these cases--simple, ordinary Americans, living their life, doing what they are suppose to do, paying their taxes, going to work every day. They get caught up in a situation where someone's negligence or wrongdoing hurts them. It could be an accident; it could be medical malpractice; it could be a decision by a company that was just plain doing wrong. 
   Where do you turn? You write a letter to your Senator. That isn't worth much, I will tell you. We will read it. We will write a reply. But if you want justice in America, then you have a chance to go in the court system. But the Republican majority says, no, close the door to America's families so that they cannot hold health insurance companies accountable in court. 
   For the last 2 days, we argued about all the outrages in these health insurance policies, that you can't go to the nearest emergency room when someone in your family is hurt, that you can't go to the specialist your doctor wants you to go to--the cases go on and on and on--and we try, item by item, to make these health insurance plans more responsive to the reality of life and more responsive to the medical needs of Americans. 
   But let me tell you this. All of those amendments, all of those votes notwithstanding, this is the bottom line. This will change the mentality of these health insurance companies that say no, because they are driven by the ambition for greed and profit, say no over and over, regardless of the outcome. 
   The Cortes family from Elk Grove Village, IL, their tiny little baby, Rob, who is now 1 year old, has spinal muscular atrophy. For a year they tried to keep their family together 
   with this little boy on a ventilator at home--on a ventilator at home. They have been fighting this disease, and every week they fight the insurance companies. Will they cover this care? Will they cover this drug? The battle goes on and on. 
   Mark my words--and I say this to my Republican colleagues--if that health insurance company knew their decisions would be judged by 12 of their  peers, 12 American citizens, sitting in a jury box, I bet the Cortes family would get a lot better treatment. You know they would. They know they would be held accountable. 
   But the health insurance industry and the Republican majority does not want the 123 million Americans to ever have a day in court when it comes to these health insurance decisions. Their arguments are as weak as they can be. 
   The State of Texas passed a patients' bill of rights. They said you could take the health insurance company to court for certain insured people in Texas. You would think, from the arguments on the Republican side, that the sky fell on Texas 2 years ago. It did not happen. You know how many lawsuits have been filed since this law was enacted, a law which Governor Bush vetoed, but the legislature overrode his veto? Three lawsuits--three lawsuits in 2 years. Does that sound as if we are flooding the courts? 
   But I will tell you something. In that State, for those who are protected by that law, I will bet you there has been a change in the way they do business. 
   Let me give you a quote from a health insurance executive. This is from the Washington Post.  
   ......currently, ``We would charge the same premium to a customer with the ability to sue as we do to those who do not have the ability to sue.''.....  
   This is from Aetna. Have you picked up the Washington Post lately? Two-page ads every day begging us not to vote for the Patients' Bill of Rights--Aetna sponsors them, full-page ads. But their spokesman said:  
   Why? Those judgments to date have been a very small component of overall health care costs.  
   That is what Mr. Walter Cherniak, Jr. of Aetna said. 
   So the argument that this was going to flood the courts did not happen. It did not happen in Texas. As to the argument that it is going to raise premiums, according to a man who does this for a living, it makes no difference in the premium charged for those insured who have the right to sue and those who do not. 
   Take a look at some of the numbers that have come out in terms of the estimated costs of increases in premiums if there is a right to sue. How much is it going to go up? The Republicans argue it is going to skyrocket. The Congressional Budget Office estimated the impact on premiums to be 1.4 percent; Multinational Business Services, less than 1 percent; Muse and Associates, a private firm, they say .2 percent. 
   Is it worth a quarter a month to you as an American with a health insurance policy to have the right to go to court when it is your baby's life?

   Mr. DURBIN. I say to my colleagues, this is the key vote on the Patients' Bill of Rights. This is a vote about whether 123 million Americans will be precluded from court by the Republican majority and the health insurance industry.

   Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair. 
   Let me say at the outset that the Senator from Pennsylvania misstated this amendment. This amendment says an employer can be held liable only when that employer uses his discretionary authority to make a decision on a claim. If a decision is made by an insurance company hired by the employer, the employer cannot be held liable. That is what this language says clearly. 
   Is there a time when an employer could be held liable? We found two cases. You decide whether they should be brought into court. 
   The employer collected the premiums from the employee and did not turn them in to the insurance company. When the employee had a claim, the insurance company said: You are not on the books. 
   In the second situation, the employee was a full-time employee and had worked 9 months at this firm. He filed a claim with the health insurance company. The insurance company said: No; we see you as a part-time employee. It is a dispute over part-time/full-time. 
   Those are two instances under law where employers are brought into court. Employers do not make these medical decisions. They would not be subject to this lawsuit. 
   Please bear with me for a minute. This is the most important amendment we will consider on this bill. 
   The Senator from New Hampshire corrected me. He is right. It does not keep 123 million Americans out of court. It keeps 120 million Americans out of court. I stand corrected, I say to the Senator. He is right. It is only 120 million Americans and their families who will be denied a day in court by the Republican amendment, an amendment which is a Federal prohibition against State lawsuits against health insurance companies. 
   Across the street at the Supreme Court building, you will find the phrase, ``Equal Justice Under Law.'' This amendment says to that phrase: Denied; denied. Equal justice under law is denied for those families who want to take health insurance companies into court and hold them accountable for their wrong decisions. 
   The Senator from New Mexico said: What are we doing taking contract questions into courts? I do not know where that Senator went to law school, and I do not know whether he follows law and order in other programs, but that is what courts do. Courts decide questions like contract coverage. That is part of the law of the land for every business in America, except health insurance companies. 
   The Republicans have come forward with this amendment, an amendment which the insurance industry wants dearly so that they cannot be held accountable in court. What this means is that families across America, when decisions are made, life-or-death decisions, will not have their day in court. The Republicans want to continue to prohibit American families from holding these health insurance companies accountable for their bad decisions. 
   From USA Today: The central question is, Should HMOs, which often make life or death decisions about a treatment, be legally accountable when their decisions are tragically wrong? Right now the answer is no. 
   If we pass the Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights, finally the courthouse doors will open to families across America. If the Republicans and the insurance industry prevail on this amendment, those doors are slammed shut. What will that mean? It will mean not just fewer verdicts, not just fewer settlements, but the continued attitude of this health insurance industry that they are held unaccountable, they cannot be held accountable to anyone. They will make decisions--life and death decisions--for you and your family and never face the prospect of going to court. 
   This is an internal memorandum from an HMO. This memorandum says it as clearly as can be. What they conclude is: Stick with the current law that keeps us out of court. This gentleman, who is in charge of management, said: We identified 12 cases where our HMO had to pay out $7.8 million. If we had it under the ERISA provisions that the Republicans want to protect, we would have paid between zero and $500,000 to those 12 families. 
   This is what it is all about. Someone who is maimed, someone who loses their life, their family goes to court and asks for justice. Equal justice under the law, that is all we are asking for. 
   The Republican majority and the insurance industry do not want to give American families that opportunity. 
   Vote to make sure we have equal justice under the law.

   Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Nevada. 
   Mr. President, for those who have followed the debate this week, there have been some very clear-cut issues decided on the floor of the Senate. Sadly, I must report that the Republican majority and the insurance industry have prevailed on every single effort by Democrats to provide protections to families across America when it comes to their health insurance. 
   Take a look at the scoreboard. On the Democratic side, we offered protection to 113 million Americans who were left high and dry by the Republican side and the insurance industry. We lost. 
   We offered an amendment saying that every woman in America could choose her OB/GYN as her primary care physician and could not be overruled by an insurance company. We lost. 
   We offered an amendment saying that emergency room care could be at the hospital closest to your home instead of that dictated by the health insurance policy. We lost. 
   We offered an amendment saying that doctors should make medical decisions and not the health insurance companies. We lost. 
   We offered an appeal process that gave families a fighting chance when the health insurance company turned them down for coverage. We lost.  
   We offered an amendment for access to specialists, when your doctor says that is in your best interest, in order to come out of a process healthy and well. We lost. 
   We offered the latest treatments, clinical trials, prescriptions that doctors recommend to save the life of someone in the most perilous of circumstances. We lost. 
   I have to give credit to the insurance lobby because, through their efforts on the floor this week, they have rejected every effort we have made to provide protection for America's families when it comes to health insurance. I used to think the gun and tobacco lobbies were the big ones on the floor of the Senate. My hat is off to the insurance lobby. They have really done a job. With the Republican majority, they have defeated us time and time again on 11 different amendments, 11 different efforts to protect American families. 
   There may be dancing tonight, when this is all over, in the boardrooms of the health insurance companies in America, but there won't be any dancing in the family rooms for those American families who realize that tomorrow they are just as vulnerable to a decision made by a health insurance company clerk as they were yesterday. There won't be any dancing in the emergency rooms across America, as the nurses and doctors there respond to emergencies, never knowing whether or not the insurance company will reimburse them for their heroic efforts to save lives. And there won't be any dancing in the doctors' offices, as they leave the room with the patient to go to a backroom and call an insurance company and beg them for the right to make the best medical decision for an individual. 
   I know the Republican side has criticized us for bringing pictures of real people to the floor of the Senate. I know it scalds their conscience to see these pictures, pictures of kids such as Rob Cortes, a little 1-year-old, a little boy I met last Sunday. Every time I voted on an issue this week, I thought about this little boy and his family in the Chicago area. This little 1-year-old breathes with a ventilator, as my colleagues can see. He has spinal muscular atrophy. His mom and dad fight every day so he can live, and they fight the insurance company every day to make sure they have an opportunity and access to the miracle drugs they need to give this little boy a chance. 
   The Republicans tell us this is unfair. Don't bring us pictures of real people. We want to talk about statistics. We want to talk about the 1993 Clinton health care bill. Give me a break. 
   I say this: If doubletalk were electricity, the Senate floor would be a powerplant after the debate that we have had this week on health insurance. I think the American people know what is at stake. They realize they had a chance, with the Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights, to have some rights and some protections when it comes to their health insurance, but they have lost. 
   There has been a decision made by the Republican side of the aisle and the insurance companies that they are going to create and protect a privileged class in America, the health insurance companies. They won't be answerable to the law, and they will not have to provide the kind of medical protection that every family counts on in America. Time and again, as we have offered these amendments, the Republican majority has defeated them. It is true that two or three of them have crossed the aisle from time to time to join the Democrats, but never enough to make a difference. 
   Sadly, that is how this debate is going to end. But it isn't going to end today. This debate will continue because we are calling on American families across this Nation to join us, to let the Senators on the other side of the aisle know that there are more important things in this town than the health insurance industry. Let them realize that this is the only building in America where health insurance reform is a partisan issue, because in every house I have visited in Illinois, families have told me time and again, whether you are a Democrat, Republican, or independent, you are vulnerable to an accident or illness that can leave you at the mercy of a health insurance clerk who will overrule your doctor and make a decision that can make your life miserable. That is what this is all about. 
   Vice President GORE came up here today with a last-minute plea to the Members of the Senate to pass a bipartisan bill to protect families. He told the story of a doctor who was working in the emergency room and a man came in and had a cardiac arrest before him. This doctor used a defibrillator and brought the man back to life. When the hospital turned in the charges, the HMO rejected him, saying it wasn't an emergency, it was only a cardiac arrest. 
   Let me tell you, this issue is not cardiac arrest; it is alive and well, and we will continue to fight it.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, yesterday was a banner day on the floor of the Senate for the insurance industry. Three different amendments were considered, amendments which the insurance industry of America opposed. The first of those amendments said a woman could keep her OB/GYN as her primary physician no matter what the HMO said. The Republican majority and the insurance industry defeated that. 
   The second said you should have access to the emergency room closest to your home when you have a family emergency. That amendment was defeated by the insurance industry and the Republican majority. 
   The third amendment said if you have a dispute with your insurance company about coverage, we are truly going to have an independent panel decide who is right and who is wrong. That amendment was defeated by the insurance industry and the Republican majority. 
   They may be dancing in the board rooms and the canyons of K Street, but I can tell you the people of America understand this debate, and they know they lost on the floor of the Senate yesterday. 
   We are now debating an issue of equal importance. If you have a health insurance plan and your doctor says: You have a serious condition; we need to try a new drug; it has been approved by the FDA; it may work and it may not; in that situation many health insurance companies say: No, we will not pay for it because it is ``experimental.'' 
   Have you walked into a convenience store in your hometown and seen those little canisters on the counter asking you to leave 50 cents or a dollar to help that local family pay for a medical bill they cannot afford? Many of these same people are paying for drugs, reimbursement for which was turned down by health insurance companies because the treatment was experimental. People literally on the brink of life or death, following doctors' orders, using FDA-approved drugs, have been turned down by these insurance companies. 
   Senator DODD offers an amendment to protect our rights to use these drugs as doctors call for them to save our lives. The Republican majority and the insurance industry oppose it. We will face another vote today and another question as to whether American families will win or lose. 
   Last Sunday in Chicago, I met this little fellow in this picture. His name is Rob Cortez. He will melt your heart. He is about a year old. He suffers from spinal muscular atrophy. For a year, his family has been fighting to keep him alive, trying to keep their own courage together, trying to fight his disease, and every day fighting another insurance company decision that would turn off the ventilator which would be the end of his life. Imagine what that family goes through. 
   They had a drug that was prescribed by a doctor to fight infection in this poor little guy, and the insurance company said: No, it is experimental. We will not pay for it. 
   The battle goes on day after day in households across America. The Republicans can come to the floor with their cartoons and their slogans, but America's families understand this debate. What is at stake is our health and our health insurance. If people across America do not wake up to the reality of this debate, we are going to lose an opportunity to give piece of mind to families all across Illinois, all across the Nation, and to protect the lives of other vulnerable little kids. 
   That is what the debate is all about. 
   I also want to make it clear that this clinical trial approach is cost-effective. Sloan-Kettering and M.D. Anderson have made it clear it is money saved. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this amendment really gets to the heart of the debate: how many Americans will we leave behind when it comes to reforming our health insurance protection. 
   Senator KENNEDY and Senator DASCHLE offer an amendment which will reform health insurance plans across the country. The Republican side of the aisle would leave behind 113 million Americans. They argue that these families should not be protected by a national standard. Just by accident of birth or residence, some people would be disqualified. 
   Who are we talking about? We are talking about people such as the self-employed, small businesspeople, and farmers, those who have a tough enough time securing health insurance. They pay higher premiums for it, and they are not in a good position to really bargain when it comes to buying their health insurance. 
   This amendment gets to the heart of which party and which approach really care for American families and the challenges they face. I support Senator KENNEDY and Senator DASCHLE in this effort. 
   I just left the chatroom right off the floor of the Senate, where people have been, through the Internet and by telephone, calling in from across the United States. I think many people on the Republican side of the aisle have not really taken into consideration how important this issue is to Americans. They can vote with the insurance industry, and a Republican majority can defeat us on these amendments, but eventually they will have to go face the same families who I have spoken to and who write to my office--families who worry on a daily basis about whether their doctors are making medical decisions or the decisions are being made by insurance company professionals. 
   This amendment, which is about protecting all insured Americans, is one I am proud to support. The idea of picking and choosing the winners and losers across America is inconsistent with the policy that we should have coming out of this Chamber. 
   I hope a handful of Republican Senators will come forward and join the minority on the Democratic side and enact a bipartisan approach that is sensible.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today on behalf of the current President of Lithuania, His Excellency Valdas Adamkus. President Adamkus is a Lithuanian native and a former U.S. citizen with more than a quarter century of distinguished service to our nation. His election last year to the Lithuanian presidency made necessary his renunciation of his U.S. citizenship. My legislation provides an exemption for President Adamkus from several consequences associated with his renunciation. More specifically, my bill exempts President Adamkus from any expatriate taxes, restores President Adamkus' Social Security benefits, ensures his right to his federal pension, and grants President Adamkus the right to travel freely throughout the United States. 
   Valdas Adamkus was born on November 3, 1928 in Kaunas, Lithuania. Before immigrating to the United States in 1949, he was involved with Lithuanian resistance efforts against both Nazi Germany and Soviet Russian invaders. Settling in Chicago, President Adamkus remained active in Lithuanian Emigre organizations and helped raise public awareness of Lithuania's occupation by the Soviet Union. Following the return of independence to the Baltics, President Adamkus served as a Coordinator for the United States Aid to the Baltic States, specializing in environmental issues and academic coordination. 
   President Adamkus is a graduate of the Illinois Institute of Technology, where he earned a B.S. in civil engineering before spending ten years as a consulting engineer. In 1970, President Adamkus joined the newly-created United States Environmental Protection Agency where he initially served as the Deputy Regional Administrator of the fifth region--which includes Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota and Ohio. In 1981, President Adamkus was promoted to Regional Administrator for the fifth region, a position he held until his retirement in 1997. 
   In a distinguished EPA career which stretched 27 years, President Adamkus held a number of leadership positions, including Chairman of the Great Lakes Water Quality Board and Chairman of the United States group that worked with the Soviet Union on water pollution issues. In 1975, he was appointed Advisor to the UN World Health Organization and represented the EPA on environmental issues in the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, Japan, and China. 
   In 1985, President Reagan personally presented President Adamkus with the Executive Presidential Rank Award--the highest honor for a civil servant. Other honors he earned include the EPA's highest award, the gold medal for exceptional service, and the EPA's first Fitzhugh Green Award in 1988 for outstanding contributions to environmental protection internationally. 
   To President Adamkus, the collapse of the Soviet Union in the late 1980s and subsequent liberation of the Baltics marked the successful culmination of his lifelong commitment to Lithuania's freedom. As Lithuania began the long and painful transition from a communist totalitarian system to a free-market economy, Mr. Adamkus emerged as an ideal candidate for the Lithuanian presidency, not only because of his past work for Lithuanian freedom, but also because of the experience he gained through his career as a U.S. civil servant. 
   Mr. Adamkus was elected President of the Republic of Lithuania on January 4 of last year and took office on February 25. Before assuming the Lithuanian presidency, Mr. Adamkus was required to renounce his U.S. citizenship. As I mentioned at the beginning of my statement, the bill I am offering today provides a limited exemption for President Adamkus from some of the negative consequences associated with renunciation. More specifically, my bill:

   Mr. DURBIN. There was a historic event that just occurred on the floor of the Senate. Those who look through the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD are going to find something truly amazing has just occurred. This debate on health insurance reform started at 1:10 p.m. It wasn't until 3:59 p.m., almost 3 hours later, that the first Republican Senator referred to our amendment as ``socialized'' medicine. Almost 3 hours passed on the Senate floor before the Republicans turned to that old, beat up shibboleth--socialized medicine. That may show there has been some progress. In years gone by, that would have been raised in the first 5 minutes. 
   However, I think it is important my friends on the Republican side of the aisle, who were supporting the approach favored by the insurance industry, stop and consider for a moment that the world has changed dramatically since we used to simplify debate into terms of socialized medicine and the medical practice that most Americans want.  
   I say to Senators on the floor for the Republican side, do the Senators not consider it odd, if State regulation--which you are lauding--is so effective, that the American Medical Association is suggesting they may have to unionize across America to deal with these health insurance companies? Isn't it strange, if State regulation and State bills of right for patients are so effective, that over 200 medical organizations and others support the Democratic approach for a national standard of protection for all American citizens? If the States are doing such a great job protecting so many people, why are so many medical professionals unhappy? Why are so many families across America calling our office, writing letters, telling these horror stories which we have recounted on the floor of the Senate and will recount during the course of this week? 
   There may not be a more important debate on the floor of the Senate this year for America's families. We are going to decide this week whether or not you can count on your health insurance. A lot of people across America can't count on it. When it comes down to the tough time, a 12-year-old boy with cancer, as Mr. and Mrs. Ray Cerniglia discussed this afternoon, they had to fight their HMO. A couple, facing the tragedy of a 12-year-old with a rare, dangerous cancer, summons the courage to deal with it. They go for the best medical help they can find. That isn't enough. Now they have to worry about fighting the insurance company. 
   The Republican approach is: So what. That's business. That is the way things are. 
   We on this side of the aisle disagree. We believe, along with the medical professionals in America, that American families deserve better. The Republican approach is an approach supported by one group: the insurance industry. The insurance industry is spending millions of dollars on television ads distorting what this debate is all about. 
   I heard my Republican colleagues talk about States rights; we should leave it to the States to decide whether or not America's families should have good health insurance protection. 
   Take a look at what the States have already done: 
   Twelve States haven't done a thing about access to emergency services. If you have a serious accident in your backyard, you can take that little boy who fell out of the tree and broke his arm to the nearest emergency room and not fumble around looking at your insurance policy, wondering if you will be covered. 
   Thirty-one States have not enacted laws for independent appeals. If an insurance company denies coverage, you have an opportunity for an independent appeal. The Republican approach is an in-house appeal by the insurance company. 
   Thirty-eight States have not protected families that want to make certain they have access to the right medical specialists. But the Republican bill is one that doesn't guarantee that right to literally over 100 million Americans. 
   The list goes on and on. 
   Many of the Republicans who oppose this plan to protect America's families and their health insurance argue ``States rights.'' It is an old argument. 
   Senator KENNEDY, Senator DASCHLE, and others have said: Yes, if you bring these new protections into law, as we would like to have for every American regardless of where they live, the cost of health insurance will go up--$2 a month. 
   I see crocodile tears on the floor of the Senate as they bemoan the increased costs of health insurance policies if we pass our bill--$2 a month. Isn't it worth $2 a month to have access to a specialist when you need it? Isn't it worth $2 a month to know your doctor is giving you the best medical advice and his decision is not being overridden by some health insurance clerk? I think it is worth that and more. 
   They on the other side argue that our approach is too much government. It isn't empowering government. We are empowering families across America to have negotiable rights with the insurance companies, that they can stand up and say these are our rights, this is for what we stand. 
   This isn't a right for government. It is a right for families--families in the most precarious situations in their lives, facing the most serious illnesses. That is what we are doing here. We are empowering families and individuals to stand up to these health insurance companies. 
   We have seen from the letters--I have seen them from Illinois; every Senator has--how helpless people feel when they have someone in their family who is near death and they are sitting there fighting with some faceless clerk at an insurance company, begging for the care their doctor says their little boy or their little girl needs. 
   We give these families power with this Patients' Bill of Rights. Why the Republicans oppose this, I don't know. I can understand why the insurance industry opposes it. They have a pretty good thing going on. They make the decisions and they can't even be sued when they are wrong. You can't even take them to court. 
   I had an interview the other day in Chicago. One of the reporters afterwards said: Let me get this straight. We can't sue these health insurance companies when they make the wrong decision? I said: That is right. It is the only business in America that can't be held accountable for its wrongdoing. 
   Think about their wrongdoing. It is a matter of life and death. A health insurance company denies a basic treatment and someone can die as a result and they wouldn't be held accountable. 
   The thing that troubles me, too, is the Republicans leave so many people behind. What they call ``our Patients' Bill of Rights'' is an empty promise. Mr. President, 113 million Americans without health insurance--no protection in the Republican bill; no protection in a bill supported by the insurance industry. 
   Look what it means in some of the States of the Senators who have been on the floor today. I say to the Senator from Oklahoma, 1,574,000 people in Oklahoma are not protected by the Republican bill; 79 percent of privately insured are not protected under the Republican plan. Who are these people? They are farmers. They are self-employed people, wheat growers in Oklahoma. 
   Look at the State of Maine, the potato growers. Farmers there, 557,000 of them, are not protected by the Republican bill; 70 percent of the privately insured are not protected by the Republican bill. 
   State of Texas: We have heard a lot about big government there, haven't we? Over 6 million residents of Texas are not protected by the Republican bill, 59 percent of them. 
   Yes, it is true. There is a State Bill of Rights in Texas. Governor George W. Bush vetoed it, and it was overridden by the State legislature. It is on the books. But basically we say everybody in America--Texas, Illinois, you name it--deserves the same kind of protection. If the Republicans had their way, in my home State of Illinois, almost 5 million people would not be protected, would not receive the benefit of the reforms we are talking about in health insurance; 59 percent of those privately insured not protected by the Republican plan. 
   Who are those folks? Let me show you a picture of some of them. This is my home State, farmers left unprotected by the Republican ``Patients' Bill of Wrongs.'' This is a gentleman I know by the name of Tom Logsdon. His 24-year-old daughter was diagnosed with breast cancer. She has gone through a lot. The Republicans would not protect her, would not protect her family because they are self-employed people. They are farmers. They do not believe there should be this kind of protection for those folks. I disagree. I think these families and families across America deserve the same continuity of care, the same protection. I think, frankly, when you look at the choice in this bill, you can understand why the insurance companies support the Republican bill and oppose the Democratic bill. 
   Here is the only way we are going to get this bill passed. We have to hope that five or six Republican Senators will break ranks and decide to join us in a bipartisan effort to really provide coverage and protection for people across America. If that does not happen, if this breaks down along partisan lines, we will spend a week in debate and the American people will say: What happened? Nothing will have happened. I hope before this debate is concluded we have that bipartisan support.  
   I yield the remainder of my time.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the amendment proposed in the second-degree amendment by the Republican side states a principle which is universally popular in the Senate. It is this: If you are a self-employed person buying health insurance, you should be able to deduct the cost of that health insurance from your taxes like other Americans do. 
   I introduced legislation along these lines more than 10 years ago in the House. I introduced it in the Senate with Senator BOND of Missouri and Senator COLLINS of Maine. It is bipartisan. It is universal. It will easily pass. And it is a diversion from the debate. It is a diversion. 
   The Republicans want to talk about access to health insurance, which is important; the Democrats believe it is equally important to talk about the quality of the health insurance that you are buying. 
   It is ironic as well that the Republicans offer this amendment so that the self-employed people in America can buy insurance. When I take a look at their underlying bill, which you might find surprising, it says those same people who will now be able to buy insurance will enjoy none of the protections of the Republican bill. On the one hand they say: Buy the insurance. But on the other hand they say: We can't guarantee that it is worth buying. 
   The Democratic approach is consistent: Help families buy insurance, make sure the insurance policy is worth owning, make sure that in time of family crisis you are protected. 
   The Republican approach is: We will help you buy it, but we cannot tell you whether it is worth buying or not. 
   They argue it is a matter of States rights. This is such a weak argument when you consider the 200 different organizations--the American Nurses Association, the American Medical Association, all of the different groups for medical professionals--have said that State regulation is not enough; we do not have a consistent national standard of protection for American families. That is what the Democratic side is offering: a consistent national standard. 
   It bothers those on the Republican side. They do not want to see this consistency. They think people who live in Oklahoma deserve perhaps more rights than those who live in Maine. They think people who live in Nevada should be treated differently than people in Illinois. I disagree. Wherever you live in America, if you buy health insurance, you ought to know that it protects your family. To leave it to State legislatures and to leave over 113 million Americans behind, as the Republicans have done with their approach, is not fair. 
   This second-degree amendment, which allows self-employed people like farmers and businesspeople to buy health insurance, is so universally popular we can accept it with a voice vote. But let it not divert us from our mission at hand: to make sure the insurance that every American buys is worth owning. 
   I yield back the remainder of my time.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me say this is a new assignment for me as a ranking Democrat on the subcommittee on D.C. appropriations. I served in a similar capacity in the House and it has become a subject which I am more familiar with each time the appropriation process begins. But it has been a special pleasure to work with the chairman of this committee, Senator KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON of Texas. This is the first time we worked this closely together. It has been a very professional relationship, and I think a very productive one for the people of the District, as well as the Senate. 
   I salute, as well, Mary Beth Nethercutt and Jim Hyland of her staff, for their cooperation. I thank, on my side, Terry Sauvain, who is not  only the minority clerk for this bill but who also serves as the minority deputy staff director for the Appropriations Committee. I appreciate very much Senator BYRD making him available to help me on this my maiden voyage on the Senate Appropriations Committee. 
   My staff member, Marianne Upton, of the D.C. authorization subcommittee of the Governmental Affairs Committee has worked tirelessly as well, and I extend my gratitude to her, as well as Liz Blevins and Suzanne Bailey of the committee staff. 
   May I say at the outset that I am heartened at the election of Mayor Williams in the District of Columbia. I do believe it is a new day for the District. The District has a better chance for a better future than it has had in many years. Those of us who had lost faith in the future of the District of Columbia have had it renewed by the earliest days of his administration. He is a man who is honest. He is a man who is dedicated. He truly wants the very best for the District of Columbia and I am anxious to work with him. 
   People whom he has hired to this point in his administration include some for whom I have a high regard. Police Chief Ramsey, who was a member of the Chicago police force, was well respected there and I am certain will do a good job here. Terry Gainer, who was the Superintendent of the Illinois State Police, works as an assistant to Chief Ramsey, and he, too, brings extraordinary expertise in the field of law enforcement. 
   Mr. President, having said that, Senator HUTCHISON has explained this unusual situation where the Congress of the United States, the Federal Government, appropriates money to give to a city government, the D.C. government. Of course, that is why we are here this evening. We have a special interest in the District of Columbia, not just because the Capitol is located here, but because we believe, as every American does, that this is our city, too. Whatever our hometowns happen to be, the District of Columbia, Washington, DC, is our capital city, and we are very proud of it. 
   The millions of visitors who come each year really come to enjoy the institutions, the landmarks, the monuments, and all of the things that make this such a wonderful city and respected across the face of the Earth. The building we work in, the U.S. Capitol, is one of the most recognizable buildings in the world, and we are proud to work here, to be part of it, and we understand that Washington, DC, is part of the future of this country and part of our heritage. 
   Having said that, though, I have to be very candid. When my friends in Illinois and others tell me they are going to visit the District of Columbia, I tell them: Be careful. You have to be careful because, sadly, the crime in the District of Columbia is the worst in the Nation. The murder rate in the District of Columbia is more than twice any other city in the United States and certainly more than any other city in the world, from all the information I have been given. The number of auto thefts is higher in the District of Columbia than anywhere else in the United States of America. The schools, sad to say, are some of the worst. They may be getting better, and we hope they will, but, unfortunately, there are many problems. 
   When the mayor of the city came to testify before our committee, he said the Annie E. Casey Foundation has done an evaluation of children in the District of Columbia on how our kids are doing in Washington, DC. Time after time, we find they are doing worse than virtually every city in the United States or any State in the Union. As good as the District of Columbia may be, as inspiring as the monuments may be, there are endemic problems in this city which are horrible. 
   I am happy the revitalization plan has really given the District more voice in its own future. I have tried throughout the years to overcome the temptation to meddle in the politics of the District of Columbia and to let them govern themselves as much as humanly possible. 
   I can tell you as a person who has spent a good part of his adult life in the District, it has been tempting sometimes to speak up. Tonight I will speak up on an action taken by the D.C. City Council which I think is absolutely irresponsible. I will get to that a little later. But this appropriations bill tries to strike that balance where the Federal Government comes in with its contribution to the District of Columbia and respects the right of this city to make its own decisions, even if, in the judgment of some Senators here this evening, we think those decisions are wrong. 
   I, once again, salute Senator HUTCHISON. I know during the course of the debate on the amendments before us we will have a chance to get into more specific issues. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DURBIN. Thank you very much, Mr. President. 
   This is a tough topic. I not only don't care to talk about intravenous drug injection, I can't stand watching it on television. 
   I find myself in the middle of a debate where you have to face the reality of what this is all about. The reality is that too many people in the District of Columbia--wait a minute--too many people in America have become IV drug users. We are trying to reduce that number, not only because addiction to drugs can ruin your life but also because there are other dangers associated with it, such as HIV and AIDS and hepatitis, and so many other things that cause problems. 
   I find it interesting that the Senator from Georgia, together, I understand, with the Senator from Missouri, comes here to try to stop the needle exchange program in the District of Columbia, because as we look at a map of the United States showing the States that have needle exchange programs, we see there is a needle exchange program in the home State of the Senator from Georgia and there is a needle exchange program in the home State of the Senator from Missouri. 
   As you look across the Nation, you see that many States are trying these programs. I am certain that the Senator from Georgia has spent a great deal of time trying to overturn the decision in his own State. That is probably why he comes here in this crusade against the D.C. needle exchange program. 
   But before we dismiss this as something that might encourage drug use, please, let's look at the facts.  
   The highest rate of new HIV infections is in [Washington, DC.] AIDS kills in the District like no other cause of death for residents between ages 30 and 44.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DURBIN. I will continue:  
   [Washington, DC] has the distinction of having an AIDS death rate seven times the national average. As if this weren't tragic enough, the city also has to contend with needle-exchange opponents attacking a program that has--through the Whitman Walker Clinic--reduced the spread of HIV by causing a 29 percent drop in the number of drug injections.  
   So we have a terrible scourge of HIV and AIDS right here in the Nation's Capital--seven times the national average. We have a program that tries to convince HIV users, through a needle exchange, to stop it, to go through drug rehab, to end their addiction. And it is successful. 
   As a result of the program, there was a 29-percent drop in the number of drug injections. The Senator from Georgia--and he is going to withdraw the amendment, in fairness to him--the Senator from Georgia says the best thing we can do is eliminate that program. That is an invitation for more HIV and AIDS and more addiction. 
   Mr. President, 75 percent of the cases of babies born with HIV are due to the use of dirty needles by either the mother or the father, and 70 percent of the cases of women with HIV are due to their own or their partner's use of contaminated needles. 
   That is what the debate is all about. It pains me to even talk about this topic. I am not comfortable with it. But I think we have to be honest if we want to deal with public health issues. We should say--and I think it should be a standard--that we will not support a needle exchange program unless it fits two criteria: First, it has a valid public health purpose--and I certainly believe that the elimination or reduction of HIV and AIDS in the District of Columbia is such a valid purpose--and, secondly, it must not encourage addiction to drugs. 
   There is absolutely no evidence that this program in the District encourages addiction. In fact, just the opposite is true. Those who come to these clinics end up getting in programs where they finally--perhaps after a lifetime of addiction--find themselves drug-free so that their babies can be born drug-free. 
   I am glad that the Senator from Georgia is going to withdraw this amendment. As difficult as it is to talk about some of these issues, we must face the reality that it is part of our responsibility. 
   The needle exchange program, which he would have restricted, is supported by many groups that I think have great stature in our country: The American Medical Association, the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Bar Association, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, and many others. 
   Again, I am happy the Senator is going to withdraw his amendment. 
   I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, a bipartisan group of legislators, Congressmen from this region, came up with an idea that is a very good one. It is an effort to try to promote higher education among the residents of the District of Columbia. 
   Washington, DC, does not have a major public university. The young people in D.C. are disadvantaged. People living in the State of Texas, young people living in the State of Illinois can consider a number of public universities and colleges and qualify for in-State resident tuition, which is usually much lower than those out of State. 
   That same benefit is not available for the young people in the District of Columbia by and large, and this scholarship idea, which was promoted by the Clinton administration, as well as local Congressmen and many others in this area, has come forward. It is one that I wholeheartedly support. I think this tuition assistance program is an excellent idea. The estimated cost is about $17 million a year. That sum is appropriated in this bill. 
   Having said that, though, I have taken exception to a fact of life in the District of Columbia. I mentioned at the outset that the District of Columbia is going through major reform, major revitalization. We have changed the Federal contribution to help the District in some regards. For example, we are paying more Medicaid in the District of Columbia than in my home State of Illinois. We are paying for certain benefits, like a $5,000 tax credit for those first-time homebuyers in the District, things to encourage the District of Columbia to stand on its own feet. 
   They have made progress. I give credit to Mayor Williams and the city council for a lot of positive things that have occurred in a very short period of time. 
   Having said that, though, there is an action by the D.C. City Council which I consider to be the height of irresponsibility. That was a decision by this city council this year to give $59 million in tax cuts to D.C. residents. 
   Mark my words, any politician would like to stand up and say: I am going to give you a tax cut. Everyone applauds. That is a natural applause line. But when you take a look at the District of Columbia and the situation that it faces, it is almost incredible that they would decide at this moment in history that they have $59 million they can't figure out how to spend; $59 million they want to return in tax cuts, some of them in the neighborhood of $100 or $150 a year, $2 a week, $3 a week, for a total of $59 million. This is a tax cut in a city that has serious infrastructure problems and serious problems when it comes to the very basic things. 
   Let me give you an example. Here we are at the Capitol Building. A lot of my staff members live nearby. One of my staffers said to me the other evening: I am going home. 
   I said: Do you need a ride? 
   He said: I just live five blocks away. He paused and said: But come to think of it, a woman was stabbed and murdered in my neighborhood last week. I will take a ride, if you don't mind. 
   I said: Do you know what you need in your neighborhood, where murders are occurring? You need a tax cut. 
   Well, I think we know better. The people in the District of Columbia, more than anything else, need police protection. They need protection because we have the highest murder rate in the Nation right here in the District of Columbia, more than twice the next city in any State in this entire country. 
   I had some time to look over what has happened with the D.C. Police Department. The D.C. City Council can't seem to see any need there beyond the current budget. In fact, they want to give away $59 million. 
   Let me tell you a little bit about the D.C. Police Department. I think it has a good chief. Chief Ramsey comes from Chicago. I 
   think he is making changes. But they wanted to have 3,800 policemen in the District of Columbia, and they can't find them. They found about 3,500, so they are short of the mark of even having the force in the city that they hope to have. 
   When the new chief took over a year ago, he looked around the District of Columbia Police Department and learned that 75 percent of the telephones in the D.C. Police Department were rotary phones. This is like traveling in Eastern Europe after the wall came down and discovering what is left of the Soviet empire. You travel around the D.C. city government and wonder how in the world did it get so bad. 
   This D.C. City Council can look beyond that. They can look beyond the  fact that the policemen in the District of Columbia were not receiving firearms training a year ago. They can look beyond the fact that the D.C. policemen were not even trained for conducting sobriety tests. Can you imagine that? They didn't pull over speeders who were drunk because only 200 of the policemen, out of 3,800, had been trained in giving a basic sobriety test. In most cities in the Nation, 100 percent of the force receives that training. 
   The deficiencies, one after another, stack up until the people in this poor city worry more about getting hit in the head than whether they are going to get a tax cut. This is really, in my mind, quite a tragedy. If it were a family situation and you were trying to draw an analogy, the D.C. City Council decided to go out and buy a big screen TV although it couldn't afford to buy a lock for the front door of the house. That is what the tax cut is all about. 
   Give away $59 million in a city with these problems? That is not it alone. As I mentioned earlier, the D.C. public schools really need help. They have brought on some new people in an effort to try to deal with that. I hope it works. But the belief by the D.C. City Council that putting money into summer programs, early childhood development, afterschool programs is unnecessary, really strikes me as insensitive to the reality of the need for improving public education in the District of Columbia. 
   When the Mayor came and spoke to us, incidentally, he told us something which was troubling--I have a chart that demonstrates it--on children in the District of Columbia. The Casey Foundation took a look at kids in the District of Columbia, kids in Washington, DC. With one exception--and they looked at all the different criteria for children, and that was the high school dropout rate--the District of Columbia ranked worst in the Nation in every category involving children. 
   D.C. City Council, are you listening? The children you represent in these wards out here are the worst in the Nation in every single category. You can't figure out where to put $59 million, so you want to declare a dividend and give it away. 
   Why don't you consider, for a moment, the percent of low-birth-weight babies in the District of Columbia, the worst in the Nation, worse than any other State; the infant death rate in the District of Columbia is the worst in the Nation, twice the national average; the child death rate; the rate of teen deaths by accident and homicide; the teen birth rate; the percent of teens not attending school and not working; the percent of children living with parents who do not have full-time, year-round employment is last place in the District of Columbia; the percent of children in poverty; the percent of families headed by a single parent is the worst in the Nation.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am going to withdraw the amendment. I received a telephone call from the White House today, and it is very clear that this college tuition assistance program is very important to the President, and I understand it. It is something that was part of his budget, something that he believes would be very good for the children of the District of Columbia. 
   I have asked and received the assurance of the administration that when the District of Columbia makes next year's budget request, we are going to hold them to a very sensible yardstick. We are going to ask them whether their experiment worked. We are going to ask them whether or not this idea of a $59 million tax cut did, in fact, not only improve the quality of life in the District, but address the most basic problems--whether or not the crime  rate has come down, whether or not children are better off, and whether or not the schools are improved. 
   The District of Columbia will be held accountable. With that assurance, I can assure those who are listening that if I am still serving on the subcommittee, as I expect to be, I will apply the same standard. To the D.C. City Council, I say: I don't think you can have it both ways. I don't think you can give away the money in a tax cut and meet basic needs in the city. You have 12 months to prove me wrong. I will be watching. 
   I will be offering a sense-of-the-Senate resolution in a few moments that addresses some of the yardsticks and criteria we hope to use in measuring the performance of the D.C. City Council.

   Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   I respect what the Senator from Texas has said. I agree with much of what she said. I certainly agree the college tuition assistance program is a good one. I support it.  
   I hope you can tell from the debate that our point of disagreement is on the tax cut, and my belief is that tax cut money--at least a portion of it--should be dedicated toward making the District a safer place to live, and making D.C. schools better schools--and addressing some of the serious problems the children in this District face, problems which are, frankly, of a third world nature and seem to be ignored by this D.C. City Council. 
   Let me tell you, you shouldn't take the word of a Senator from Illinois, nor a Senator from Texas, about what D.C. residents are interested in; you should take their own word. 
   When you look at the surveys of the people of the District of Columbia, Washington, DC, and their priorities, you search down that list for a long way before they start talking about taxes. High on the list is their concern about safety and crime in their neighborhoods. How low could you bring taxes to attract a person into a neighborhood where they felt as though they were not safe? 
   So many members of my staff who would love to live on Capitol Hill where I live have finally reached the conclusion that they can't. One member of my staff, after she was mugged a second time on Capitol Hill, and her face was swollen for about a week, gave up and moved out of Washington, DC, to a neighboring suburb. The taxes had nothing to do with that. 
   I talked to another young couple, just the kind of people who should be living in the District to make a great contribution. They said it finally just wore them down--their concern about crime, their concern about the filth they saw in the streets, and the rats running across the streets as they came home in the evening. It finally just wore them down, and they picked up and moved to a neighboring suburb. They didn't mention taxes. I am sure it is a concern. Nobody wants to pay any more taxes than they have to. 
   But I think if this District were more livable when it came to the basics of protecting families in their own homes and neighborhoods that you would attract more people to live in what is otherwise in many places one of the most beautiful cities in America. 
   The Senator from Texas said she wants Washington, DC, to be family friendly. I couldn't agree more. But first it has to be family safe. Unfortunately, it isn't close. 
   When they did a survey of the people in the District of Columbia, 48 percent said they live in fear of crime in their neighborhood. When they asked people in the District of Columbia, they had the highest percentage of residents among 12 cities surveyed indicating the presence of abandoned cars and rundown buildings. When they asked the residents in the District of Columbia whether or not they had problems of public drug sales, they had the highest response in the Nation. Panhandling and begging was the highest in the Nation. 
   These are quality-of-life issues that need to be addressed by the city council that should get its head out of the clouds and down on the street, talking to the people they represent.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, as part of last October's Omnibus Appropriations bill, a provision (Section 130) in the District of Columbia's FY 99 appropriations placed a $50 per hour/$1,300 per case cap on attorney's fees in cases brought under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) in the District. 
   In signing the bill, President Clinton singled out the cap in his remarks, calling it ``unacceptable'' and he  pledged to eliminate the cap this year. However, it has again been included in this bill to fund the District. (Sec. 128) 
   This cap has made it virtually impossible for local special education attorneys to accept cases on contingency, which is required for indigent parents and court-supervised children. Attorneys are forced to demand retainers from these residents, which precludes low-income parents from obtaining legal representation at all. In the end, the poorest kids in the District receive inadequate services from DCPS. 
   Federal law under the IDEA provides for the recovery of reasonable attorneys' fees at market rates. IDEA was passed with the understanding that it applied to cases in all jurisdictions. Congress, however, has singled out the District of Columbia and in effect has singled out poor families and children who struggle to get even a basic education. 
   DCPS spends $165 million per year on about 12,000 special education students. The average per-pupil cost comes out to be $17,000 per year. One in 10 District students are in need of special education program services. 
   Yet, services rendered to these students are substandard at best. Disabled children wait months, and in some cases years, to have their special education needs evaluated by DCPS. Since DCPS doesn't have nearly enough special education programs to accommodate its students, students wait lengthy periods of time to be placed in an appropriate classroom setting where they can receive essential related services. 
   In order to get these deserving kids assessed, parents have had to resort to litigation to get their children the services the law allows them. The tangled system of DCPS is unnavigable without an experienced attorney and most parents can't afford to hire and retain counsel for their children. 
   So for years, lawyers have sued the system on behalf of thousands of children with physical, emotional or learning disabilities who have not received proper assessments or services. The school system is required to pay legal fees when the child's case prevails--which has occurred most of the time. 
   The Washington Times reported in March that DCPS has committed funds to hire eight private attorneys to defend the school system in special education cases. It is disconcerting that the District is willing to pay the prevailing rate to ``defense'' attorney's to oppose parents, but it claims it can't afford to pay the prevailing rate to attorneys to represent parents seeking to have their children assessed. 
   Three class action suits have been filed against DCPS and recently, two of those lawsuits were settled. Under the terms of the settlement, the school system has agreed to hold hearings or otherwise resolve the backlog of hearing requests, estimated at more than 700, by the end of summer. The backlog of some 400 unimplemented decisions will be cleared up in stages, with the goal of reaching compliance with all decisions and agreement by the end of the first semester of the 1999-2000 school year. One more class-action suit against the division remains unresolved. 
   In one of those cases, Federal District Court Judge Paul Friedman ruled on May 11 that: 
   $4 million assessed for failure to comply with past court orders ``has to be paid''; 
   The school system violated legal provisions by trying to apply the congressional cap on fees for work performed before the cap was set; 
   The school system must pay more than $400,000 to one law firm, Feldman, Tucker, Leifer, Fidell & Bank, which has been handling a class-action lawsuit for several years and has not been paid in more than a year; and 
   Nothing in the law prevents judges from awarding attorney fees in special-education cases that continue longer than the one-year cap imposed this year. The city would simply be liable to pay the rest next year, or whenever the cap is lifted [``The statute doesn't tell me I can't award more than $50 an hour. It tells you can't pay more that $50 an hour.''] 
   The special education problems are an embarrassment and need to be resolved. The school system has to address this and the kids are entitled to counsel and counsel deserve to be paid fairly and reasonably for their work and the time.

   Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Texas. I will make it brief because I have spoken on my concerns about the District of Columbia. My reason for withdrawing the last amendment is my belief that not only is it a high priority of the White House, it is fundamentally a sound program, as I said from the start. 
   My quarrel is what I consider to be the irresponsible action of the D.C. City Council with the so-called tax cut they have enacted. The sense of the Senate, which I make a part of this appropriations bill, says the D.C. City Council has a chance to prove their theory; they have a chance to prove the $59 million in tax cuts is more important than $59 million spent on police protection; $59 million, a part of which could be spent on the schools; $59 million, a part of which could be spent to try to help these poor babies who are dying because of low birthweight and other problems. 
   You have your chance. That is what home rule is all about. The sense of the Senate says it is a sense of the Senate that in considering the District of Columbia's fiscal year 2001 budget, the Senate will take into consideration progress or lack of progress in addressing the following issues: crime, including the homicide rate; implementation of community policing; the number of police officers on local beats; and the closing down of open-air drug markets. 
   Second, access to drug abuse treatment, including the number of treatment slots, the number of people served, the number of people on waiting lists, and the effectiveness of treatment drugs. Remember that HIV-AIDS is seven times more prevalent in the District of Columbia than in other city. 
   The third item on the sense of the Senate is management of parolees and pretrial violent offenders, including the number of halfway house escapees, and steps taken to improve monitoring and supervision of halfway house residents to reduce the number of escapees. 
   Pick up the paper with regularity and you will find that the so-called halfway houses have revolving doors. Those accused of felonious conduct and violent crime are back on the street, walking in the neighborhoods of the District of Columbia, shoulder to shoulder with the people who live here and those who come to visit the Nation's capital. 
   That has to change. It is one of the criteria which I will personally use, and I hope others will use, during the course of this consideration of criteria for future appropriations for the District of Columbia. 
   Fourth, education including access to special education services and student achievement. 
   Fifth, improvement in the city's basic services, including rat control and abatement. 
   Six, the application for and management of Federal grants. This D.C. city government has not even applied for the money it is eligible for from the Federal Government. They have to reach a level of competence and it may mean achieving some in phases. I hope the Mayor is listening, and I hope the members of the D.C. City Council will be responsible for that. 
   Finally, the indicators of child well-being, which I mentioned earlier. Let's see next year, when we gather to debate this appropriation, whether the District of Columbia is still in last place among all the States in the Nation in so many categories which reflect the well-being of the children who live here.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if I might just take a moment of time here to thank the Senator from West Virginia. His kind words are high praise indeed. 
   This Washington, DC, has many museums which contain many national treasures, but the Senate has its own treasure in the Senator from West Virginia, and his dedication to this institution is just unparalleled. The fact that he would praise us for staying after 9 o'clock to do our job of course is belied by the fact that he is still here, prepared to say a few words as well, doing his job, as he always does, for the people of West Virginia. 
   I thank the Senator from West Virginia, as well as my colleague from Texas, for their kindnesses during consideration of this bill.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce legislation to improve the efficiency and protect the integrity of Federal procurement and assistance programs, by ensuring that the Federal Government does business with responsible contractors and participants 
   The United States General Accounting Office [GAO] has found that billions of dollars in Federal procurement contracts and assistance are going to individuals and corporations which are violating our nation's labor and employment laws. In 1995, the GAO reported that more than $23 billion in Federal contracts were awarded in fiscal year 1993 to contractors who violated labor laws. That is 13 percent of the $182 billion in Federal contracts awarded that year. Part of the reason for this, the GAO found, is that the National Labor Relations Board, which enforces our nation's labor laws, does not know whether violators of the law are receiving Federal contracts. And the General Services Administration, which oversees Federal procurement, does not know the labor relations records of Federal contractors. 
   In 1996, the GAO reported that $38 billion in Federal contracts in fiscal year 1994 were awarded to contractors who had violated workplace health and safety laws. That is 22 percent of the $176 billion in Federal contracts of $25,000 or more which were awarded that year. The GAO found that 35 people died and 55 more people were hospitalized in fiscal year 1994 as a result of injuries at the workplaces of federal contractors who violated health and  safety laws. These contractors were assessed a total of $10.9 million in penalties in fiscal year 1994--while being awarded $38 billion in Federal contracts. 
   The GAO concluded that, although federal agencies have the authority to deny contracts and federal assistance to companies that violate Federal laws, this authority is rarely used in the case of safety and health violations. The GAO found that federal agencies do not normally collect or receive information about which contractors are violating health and safety laws--even when contractors have been assessed large penalties for egregious or repeat violations. 
   The Federal Government should not ignore the health and safety records of companies that apply for federal contracts and assistance. A report published this week in the Archives of Internal Medicine concludes that job-related injuries and illnesses in the United States are more common than previously thought, costing the nation more than AIDS, Alzheimer's, cancer or heart disease. The report, which analyzed national estimates of job-related illnesses and injuries in 1992, states that more than 13 million Americans were injured from job-related causes in just one year--more than four times the number of people who live in the City of Chicago. The report concluded that the cost to our country from workplace injuries and illnesses was $171 billion in 1992. 
   The Federal Government has a responsibility to taxpayers, working Americans and law-abiding businesses, to ensure that federal tax dollars do not go to individuals and corporations that violate safety and health, labor and veterans' employment preference laws. About 26 million Americans are employed by federal contractors and subcontractors. They deserve to know that their Government is not rewarding employers who violate the laws that protect American workers and veterans. The legislation I am introducing today will improve the enforcement of our nation's health and safety, labor and veterans' employment laws, and provide an incentive to contractors to comply with the law. This legislation will allow the Secretary of Labor to debar or suspend a person from receiving Federal contracts or assistance for violating the National Labor Relations Act, the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act or the disabled and Vietnam-era veterans hiring preference law. It will require the Secretary of Labor and the National Labor Relations Board to develop procedures to determine whether a violation of law is serious enough to warrant debarment or suspension. And, as recommended by the GAO, this legislation will require ongoing exchanges of information among Federal agencies to improve their ability to enforce our nation's laws. This legislation is identical to a bill introduced in the House of Representatives by Congressman Lane Evans of Illinois, and it is similar to legislation introduced in previous years by former Senator Paul Simon. 
   Mr. President, it is important to note that the vast majority of Federal contractors obey the law. This legislation is only directed at those who are violating the law. It will deny Federal contracts and assistance to individuals and companies that violate the law and ensure that Federal contracts are awarded to companies that respect the law.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am joining with Senator LEAHY to introduce a resolution calling for the immediate release of three CARE International workers in Yugoslavia. The three humanitarian workers committed no crime and are being held prisoner unjustly. Coercion was used in extracting a televised ``confession'' from one of the workers and the judicial proceedings held against them were a sham, preventing them from mounting a serious defense. 
   The men, Branko Jelen, Steve Pratt, and Peter Wallace, are three humanitarian workers employed in Yugoslavia by CARE International, which has been providing food, medicines and fuel to more than 50,000 Serbian refugees in Serbia and to displaced ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. 
   On March 31, 1999, Steve Pratt and Peter Wallace, two Australian nationals, were arrested and later accused of operating a spy ring. Branko Jelen, a Yugoslav, was arrested a week later on the same charges. Yugoslav officials forced Steve Pratt to appear on Serbian television on April 11, when he was coerced into saying that he had performed covert intelligence activities. The three were held without access to outsiders for 20 days. 
   On May 29 a military court dismissed the original indictment, but then convicted the three CARE International workers on an entirely new charge of passing on information to a foreign organization, their employer, CARE International! This charge was introduced at the reading of the verdict, denying lawyers for the three any opportunity to mount an appropriate defense. Pratt was sentenced to 12 years, Jelen to 6 years, and Wallace to 4 years in prison. 
   These humanitarian workers apparently were convicted of providing ``situation reports'' to their head office and other CARE International offices around the world, based on legitimately gathered information. Such reports are necessary to enable CARE International management to plan their humanitarian assistance and to inform CARE International management of the rapidly changing security situation faced by their staff. 
   The convictions of these three humanitarian workers raise serious questions regarding the ability of humanitarian aid organizations to operate in Yugoslavia, with implications for their operations in other areas of conflict around the world. Humanitarian workers must feel secure enough to do their work and must not be at risk of going to prison on false charges. Since that is not now the case in Serbia, CARE International regretfully was forced to stop its operations there. 
   The resolution we introduce today urges the United States and the United Nations to try to secure the release of the three humanitarian workers and calls on the Yugoslavia government to release them. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me say at the outset that I agree with Senators MCCONNELL and BOXER. Senator BROWNBACK calls for normalizing relations with Azerbaijan. Certainly that makes sense. We want to move toward the day when we have those normal relations. But we cannot overlook the fact that, for over 10 years, Azerbaijan has in fact imposed the blockade on Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh, at great suffering to the people of that region. 
   It has stopped the transport of food, fuel, medicine, and other vital commodities to Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh. 
   Our foreign policy is basically premised on the belief that if we are going to have normal relations with Azerbaijan, they have to have normal relations with Armenia. 
   As Senator MCCONNELL said, Senator BROWNBACK has a vision for the future that we may share someday, but first we must address the concerns that Senator MCCONNELL addresses in his amendment. I support him. I think it is a very sensible approach. To waive section 907 in the absence of any progress toward lifting the blockade would reward the Government of Azerbaijan for failing to remove it. 
   Keep in mind that even though we have this section 907 restriction, we provide humanitarian and democracy-building assistance to Azerbaijan, and in fact the businesses of the United States do business there involving a lot of international agencies. But before we really normalize relations, let us demand a normalization of relations when it comes to the treatment of the Armenian people. 
   I don't need to remind anyone in this Chamber of the long and sad history of the Armenian people and the genocide which they endured. They have asked us to stand by them until they can resolve this peacefully. I think the United States is right to do so. 
   I object to the approach used by Senator BROWNBACK and fully endorse the efforts by Senator MCCONNELL.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the bill before us includes increased Foreign Military Financing funding to help Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania improve their militaries. The Baltic countries need to improve their military posture whether or not they join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). But the fact is that they do aspire to join NATO, and all three countries will be working to meet goals in NATO's Membership Action Plans for each country. 
   My colleagues Senators BINGAMAN, ROBERTS, BOB SMITH, and CLELAND have offered an amendment that says that nothing in the bill ``should be interpreted as expressing the will of the Senate to accelerate membership of those nations into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).'' However, the Senate can do nothing to invite the Baltic countries or any other  aspiring country to join NATO. Only NATO can invite countries to join. When they are ready to join, and if they are invited to join, the Senate would have to vote to approve amending the NATO treaty to accept further NATO expansion. 
   The Foreign Military Financing funding can serve to accelerate the Baltic countries' efforts to meet NATO criteria, but the decision to invite them to join NATO remains a political one that will be made by NATO's nineteen member states. The Baltic states could do nothing to become NATO ready and be invited--or they could become modern-day Spartas and still not be asked to join NATO; that decision is up to NATO. 
   The Senate has already expressed its opinion in Section 2703 of the European Security Act of 1998 that was included in last year's Omnibus Appropriations bill that ``It is the sense of Congress that Romania, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Bulgaria ..... (C) upon complete satisfaction of all relevant criteria should be invited to become full NATO members at the earliest possible date.'' In other words, the Senate and House of Representatives have already said that when the Baltic countries are ready to join NATO, they should be invited to join. 
   Thus I fail to see the usefulness of the amendment offered by my colleagues today. I particularly regret that the amendment has singled out Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia when in fact there are many NATO aspirants, including Romania, Bulgaria, Slovenia, Slovakia, Albania, and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. 
   The Baltic countries have made enormous strides in transforming themselves into free market democracies. They have embraced civilian control of their militaries, have participated in international peacekeeping, and have demonstrated their ability to operate with the military forces of NATO countries under NATO standards, spending precious resources to do so. I believe we must follow through and do all we can to convince our NATO allies that the Baltic states should be invited. 
   The United States' position on further expansion is that NATO should have an open door policy and that geography should be no barrier to membership. Russia need not feel threatened by the NATO membership of the three tiny Baltic states--they can do nothing to threaten the enormous and powerful Russian Federation. And right now Russia has no hostile intent toward them. But should Russia turn away from democracy, and if an expansionist autocrat were to come to power once again, NATO membership for Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia would make a powerful statement that the United States and Europe will never again accept buffer-state subjugation of the Baltic states.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am happy to join my colleague Senator SCHUMER in introducing the ``Targeted Gun Dealer Enforcement Act of 1999.'' This bill will give law enforcement the tools they need to prevent suspect gun dealers from supplying firearms to criminals and plaguing our communities with gun violence. 
   Guns kill 34,000 Americans every year--thirteen children every day. They kill more teen-agers than any natural cause. 
   This bill allows the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) to closely monitor those gun dealers who they should be monitoring--the dealers who have had more than 25 crime guns traced to them in the last year. 
   The facts in Illinois are particularly compelling on this issue. In Illinois, 26 gun dealers account for more crime guns than the remaining 3,700 Illinois federally licensed gun dealers combined. 
   These figures show that while most gun dealers are law abiding and responsible, some shops have become ``convenience stores'' for criminals. Twenty-six dealers were the source of more than 1,600 crime guns with each dealer responsible for selling at least 25 guns used in crimes in 1998. 
   This bill will help law enforcement find out why these dealers are the source of guns later used to commit crimes. The bill will require high volume crime dealers to report handgun sales to ATF and local police. Law enforcement can then use these records to more effectively trace crime guns. 
   The bill will also encourage gun dealers to sell guns more responsively. In the Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative, ATF found that many guns used by youths to commit crimes are purchased from licensed dealers by individuals acting as ``straw'' purchasers. A ``straw purchaser'' is a person who illegally purchases a firearm for another person, such as a juvenile or a felon. 
   This bill seeks to address that problem by prohibiting the sale of a firearm when a seller has ``reason to know'' that such firearm will be used to commit a crime of violence or a drug crime. Current law requires actual knowledge on the part of the dealer that the buyer will use the firearm to commit a crime of violence. This change will make it easier for law enforcement to target dealers who they believe are turning a blind eye in supplying guns to buyers under questionable circumstances. 
   In 1998, Chicago police officers conducted ``Operation Gunsmoke,'' an investigation to target gun-sellers just outside the city limits. Seven undercover officers purchased 171 guns from 12 suburban gun stores in a three month period. Not one dealer refused to sell the agents weapons even as the agents openly violated laws needed to purchase firearms. This investigation was key to the City of Chicago's  groundbreaking lawsuit against the gun industry on the theory of public nuisance. 
   We must act now to keep guns from getting into the hands of criminals. I applaud Senator SCHUMER's leadership on this issue and hope my colleagues will join us in this important effort to make our communities safer. The statistics show most gun dealers are responsible, but a few unscrupulous dealers are supplying criminals with guns that plague our communities.

    Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is with pride and pleasure that I take a moment today to recognize the Anti-Cruelty Society of Chicago on the occasion of their 100th anniversary. The society's centennial celebration is entitled ``1999--The Anti-Cruelty Society Centennial: A Legacy of Caring, A Vision of Hope for the 21st Century,'' and is truly an appropriate description of the organization's valuable impact on the lives and treatment of the nation's animals. 
   One hundreds years ago, the society's founders, led by Illinois resident Mrs. Theodore Thomas, were concerned with inhumane butchery in slaughterhouses, the treatment of old sick workhorses, and hundreds of thousands of malnourished homeless dogs and cats. In their efforts to eliminate cruelty to animals, to educate the public on the humane treatment of animals, and to create a refuge for stray animals until they could be placed in good homes, the society achieved impressive accomplishments in Illinois and across the nation. In fact, the group gave rise to an organization so dynamic that it has impacted and continues to impact public policy and set the standard of humane treatment for animals worldwide. 
   Once again, I congratulate the Anti-Cruelty Society in Chicago on their remarkable first 100 years of service, and wish them the best of luck as they continue to make a positive impact upon the lives of animals and humans in the many years to come.

   Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield, I would like to ask a question of her. I think it is important to remind those who are following this debate why we are here. We are here trying to bring this issue to the floor of the Senate. We want there to be a debate between Democrats and Republicans on giving patients and families across America some rights when it comes to dealing with these insurance companies. The Republican leadership does not want this debate. We think the American people do. We think that is why we were elected--because families across America know there is real concern when you take your child to the hospital. 
   I literally ran into a doctor from Highland Park, IL, Sunday night who told me a terrible situation that just happened to him a week before. He is a cardiologist. A woman came in to see him in his office on a Thursday complaining of chest pains. He was worried and said: I want to get you into the hospital 
   tomorrow morning for catheterization. It is a diagnostic process to find out what was wrong with her heart. She said: Fine. He said: We will do it tomorrow morning. 
   He called her insurance company. The insurance company said: No, we don't approve of the hospital where you want to send her. Let us call our hospital under her insurance policy, and we will see when we can get her scheduled. 
   They told that to the doctor on Friday. They never had a chance to schedule it. She passed away on Sunday. That was a decision made by the insurance company not to let this woman go to a hospital on a Friday morning to get the catheterization. They did not understand her problem. 
   Is this not what this debate is all about?

   Mr. DURBIN. If I can ask the Senator, isn't it true that, as Senator EDWARDS of North Carolina just said, the example I gave where the lady didn't get the catheterization and passed away--if her family hears of this and they are upset and want to go to court and believe there has been medical malpractice and negligence--the only exposure and the only thing they can sue the insurance company for is the cost of the catheterization, or for the procedure? That is it under the law. And that our bill says health insurance companies, as every other company in America, will be held accountable for their actions. If they are guilty of negligence, they can be held accountable. But under current law, a law being protected by the Republican bill, the patients will not have that right of recovery. 
   Is that not the fact?

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, there has been a breakthrough which observers in the galleries and others watching might not be aware of; that is, after 2 weeks of effort on the floor, we now have an understanding that after the Fourth of July recess when we return, we are going to debate the Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   That is the bill that talks about reforming health insurance in America so that families have a better chance of getting quality health care so that when you visit a doctor, and the doctor makes a medical decision for you or someone you love, it will be less likely that some bureaucrat and insurance company will overrule the doctor. 
   We want to make certain, as well, that if you have a picnic in the backyard on the Fourth of July, and your little boy climbs up the apple tree and falls out and breaks his arm, you can take him to the closest emergency room without fumbling through your papers to figure out which hospital is under your health insurance plan. That is just basic common sense.  
   We want to make sure that if a doctor decides that a specialist is needed for your problem that the health insurance company just can't overrule them; that you go ahead and get that specialist and get the best care that doctor recommends. 
   If a woman would like to keep an OB/GYN as her primary care physician, we don't let the insurance company come in and second-guess her on those sorts of things. 
   Fundamentally, this bill will also argue that health insurance companies, just like every other company in America, should be held responsible for their decisions. 
   Each of us is responsible for our decisions in life. If you proceed to drink too much and drive and something terrible happens, you could be held accountable in court. 
   The same thing is true for businesses that make bad decisions or good decisions. They can be held accountable in court. 
   There are only two groups that are above the law: Foreign diplomats who can't be brought into court in America, and health insurance companies--companies that make decisions every day that are literally life and death decisions. 
   We believe with the Democratic version of the Patients' Bill of Rights that these health insurance companies should entertain the possibility that if they make the wrong decision they will be held accountable. 
   I told this story on the floor before. I think it is one that illustrates exactly what is happening. 
   Sunday night, I was back in my home State of Illinois and met a cardiologist from Highland Park, IL, who a week before had a woman come into his office complaining of chest pains. This was on a Thursday. He said: I want you in the hospital tomorrow morning, Friday morning, for a catheterization to determine what problem you might have. 
   She checked with her health insurance company, and they said, no, she cannot go in for that catheterization because that isn't an approved hospital. We have to find a hospital that is approved under your health insurance plan. We will check over the weekend and call you back. 
   There was no need to call back. She passed away on Sunday over that weekend. And the doctor said to me: What am I supposed to tell that family? This woman came to me for the best advice. I had an appointment made in a hurry for what I 
   considered to be a serious situation, and it was overruled by an insurance company clerk. 
   That sort of thing happens too often. We believe in the Patients' Bill of Rights to be offered on the Democratic side, and that the patients and families across America deserve better treatment. 
   The bottom line, of course, is that you are never more vulnerable in your life than when you are sick and go to a doctor, or someone you dearly love is sick and you bring them to a doctor. You really want the best care, and you don't want a decision made on the bottom line of a profit statement of an insurance company to guide decisions. You want the decisions made by the professionals involved. 
   We spent the last 2 weeks kind of twisted in knots not moving forward very quickly on a lot of other matters because we couldn't agree between the Republican side and the Democratic side on how we might approach this issue. There has been a breakthrough today. I am happy that it has happened. Now we have an agreement that the week following the Fourth of July recess, we will come back and devote the entire week to this debate. 
   I think of all the things that we have talked about in the 106th Congress--and some of them are very important--there is hardly an issue more important than the peace of mind which American families want when it comes to medical care. They want to have affordable, accessible health insurance. They want to be able to speak to a doctor in terms where they are confident that the real focus of the attention is on the health of the member of the family and not the health of the profit and loss statement of the insurance company. That, unfortunately, has become the case. 
   It wasn't that many years ago in Washington that we had this big debate. President Clinton brought in health care reform. I am sure you remember it. It was a hotly debated issue. The insurance companies opposed it. There were a lot of efforts to derail it. And they were successful. That health insurance-health care reform was swept aside. 
   But most Americans would believe that we did something because of all the changes that took place within the last few years. There are more and more Americans under so-called managed care plans and fewer and fewer Americans with health insurance. Fewer employers are offering it. People in rural areas whom I represent in Illinois are finding it increasingly difficult to even find, let alone afford, health insurance. 
   All of these things have been happening over the last several years in a swirl of activities. 
   They tell me that last night Jay Leno, on his television show, talked about the fact that Stephen King, after this unfortunate accident and the experience he had in the hospital, was going to write his next horror novel about managed care insurance companies. I hope that is not the case. But it might be. It drew a rise from the audience, as I am sure it would almost everywhere. 
   You may remember the movie, ``As Good as it Gets,'' with Helen Hunt and Jack Nicholson. I enjoyed it a lot. At one point in the movie--she was raising an asthmatic son--she expressed her frustration in very dramatic words about dealing with health insurance companies. And in the movie theater in which I was sitting in Springfield, IL, people started applauding. That doesn't happen much. 
   But that kind of spontaneous reaction tells you that the people of this country have been waiting for Congress to catch up with the needs of American families. 
   I think we can do it. I think this debate this week that we have set aside, if it doesn't get bogged down in a lot of parliamentary hassles--and I don't think it will--could result in an honest debate where the Republican Party puts forward its best proposal for health insurance reform, and the Democrats do the same, and we vote on it. 
   When it is all said and done, perhaps we will then have a bill that really sets us on a track to help families across America get a break when they deal with these health insurance companies. 
   Last Saturday I met with a group of farmers in downstate Illinois. I heard an interesting story from one farmer about the problems his wife faced because of her medical condition. These farmers in many ways are the most vulnerable of all. They don't have the benefit of group health insurance, in most instances, nor can they bargain with insurance companies. They find themselves, many times, facing outrageous premiums and arbitrary decisions by the insurance companies. 
   This farmer had driven about 100 miles to the meeting because he wanted to tell his story about what he and his wife had been through with the health insurance companies. These stories, repeated over and over and over again, suggest to me that it is our responsibility to deal with this. 
   I hope when this Congress comes to an end, at least this year we can point back to the fact that we were sensitive to the issues that America cared about. There was a time, for example, on the Senate floor when there was a serious question as to whether we would do anything--anything--about the horrible shooting that occurred at Columbine High School in Littleton, CO. Fortunately, a debate was scheduled on the floor. After a week of debate, we passed a gun control bill--a modest bill, I might say, but one that was designed to keep guns out of the hands of kids and criminals. 
   We sent it to the House of Representatives. Sadly, the National Rifle Association, the gun lobby, used the 2 weeks before it came up for a vote to lobby away, and they were very effective. They watered down the bill until it was a joke. The bill ultimately was even defeated in the House of Representatives. 
   I haven't given up on that issue, because I think most people across the country--gun owners and not--believe we can do things to keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn't use them for a variety of reasons. The bill we passed was a very modest bill,  which said, for example, that those who purchased guns at gun shows would be subject to a background check. I don't think that is an outrageous idea. 
   We passed the Brady law. We said, if you want to buy a gun, we want to know if you have a history of committing a crime, a violent crime, because if you do, we are not going to sell you a gun; or if you have a history of violent illness, mental illness, we won't sell you a gun. That has worked. It has kept guns out of the hands of hundreds of thousands of people. At least it slowed them down, at a minimum, but maybe it stopped them from owning a gun. 
   It turns out that a substantial portion of firearms are sold outside the law. They are sold at gun shows. We have them all over Illinois, all over the United States. People who own guns and collect them get together and sell them to one another, no questions asked. Because no questions are asked, it has become a supply operation for a lot of criminal elements. 
   In Illinois, the State police found that 25 percent of the guns used in crime came out of those gun shows. One of the things we put into law in the Senate was that there would be a background check, similar to the Brady law, to find out if a person purchasing at a gun show had, in fact, a criminal background or a history of mental illness. 
   The National Rifle Association doesn't like that. When they got the bill over in the House, they said, you can't take more than 24 hours to do the check. The gun shows occur on weekends, of course, and the wheels that are spinning forward to 
   check the backgrounds of people may not be as available on weekends. As a consequence, they watered down the bill until it was meaningless. 
   A second provision we put into law--Senator HERB KOHL of Wisconsin was the author--suggested we not sell guns in America unless they had a trigger lock, a child safety device. Thirteen kids every day in America are killed by guns. Some are gangbangers who shoot away in Washington, DC, in Chicago, IL. Others, though, are kids who go out and get a gun off a shelf from their father's closet, start to play with it, discharge it, and shoot themselves, a brother, sister, or playmate. Thirteen kids a day die that way. 
   We want to lessen the likelihood of those tragic accidents. Trigger locks, safety devices on guns, do that. That was in our bill. That was sent to the House. That was rejected. 
   The final point is one that Senator DIANNE FEINSTEIN of California proposed, a proposal that tries to close a loophole in the law. When we passed gun control a few years ago, we said, we are going to prohibit the manufacture of these high-capacity ammunition clips, clips that can literally hold up to 240 bullets. Unfortunately, we left a loophole and didn't stop the importation of these clips from overseas. So we stopped the domestic manufacturing, and they started flooding in from overseas. 
   Frankly, it raises a serious question: Who needs a gun with a 240-bullet high-capacity ammunition clip? If you need an AK-47 and 240 bullets to shoot a deer, you ought to stick to fishing. 
   Unfortunately, they are coming into this country for no purpose other than to be used for criminal purposes. 
   Senator FEINSTEIN was successful. She passed that amendment in the Senate. We sent it to the House. It got nowhere. 
   Those are the kinds of things we did to try to deal with some of the problems we have identified. Having done those things, and having seen the National Rifle Association do its work in the House, we have a lot more work to be done. 
   I hope when the debate is concluded at the end of this 106th Congress, we can point with pride to having succeeded in passing import elements in law that improve the quality of life in America, that reduce the likelihood of violence in schools, that reduce the likelihood of guns getting in the hands of criminals, that increase the opportunities for families across America to have good health insurance and be able to trust their doctor's decisions, and several other things that I think are very important as part of the agenda. 
   One of them has to deal with increasing the minimum wage of $5.15 an hour. Imagine, if you will, trying to raise a family or even take care of yourself for $5.15 an hour. It has been years since we have increased it. It is time we bring that up to a wage that more accurately reflects the cost of living in America. I hope before we leave this year we can address that. 
   We cannot leave, as well, without addressing the future of Medicare. This has been a banner week for Medicare with the President's announcement that we now have a reestimate of the budget. We believe if the economy continues to grow, as we believe it will, we are going to have an additional surplus. With that surplus we can do some extraordinary things. 
   I first came to Congress 17 years ago. When I came, we were facing all sorts of red ink and all sorts of deficits. We have been through a lot of tortuous effort to try to reduce. Now we have reached the point where we can honestly see a surplus in our future. I think we can use that surplus to solidify Social Security and Medicare and, most importantly, while we do that, eliminate the publicly held national debt in America. To move from the point where a large portion of our budget is being spent on interest on the debt to the point where virtually none is being spent on interest on our debt is a great legacy to leave our children. I hope we can achieve that on a bipartisan basis. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I have just arrived from Illinois, and I have come at the right moment because we are considering something called cloture in the Senate. The reason you file a motion for cloture--as Senator BYRD knows because he knows the Senate rules better than anyone, and probably wrote most of them--is to bring to an end to debate and to force the Senate to go forward on a vote. 
   The Republican strategy, as enunciated by Senators LOTT and NICKLES, is to bring an end to this debate. Which debate would they like to see end? The debate about reforming health insurance in America. They do not want us to move forward with amendments pending by Senators FEINSTEIN of California, KENNEDY of Massachusetts, and others, which address the issue of health insurance reform. They do not want to face votes on these amendments. They do not want us to bring the Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights to the floor and ask Members on both sides of the aisle to vote their conscience, up or down, yes or no, on how we can change health insurance in America. 
   For several days last week, the argument was made that ``we don't have time to debate health insurance reform.'' But as one day flowed into a second day, and now into another week, we are spending a lot of time on the issue without voting on it. We are spending time finding ways to avoid voting on health insurance reform--a Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   Now my Republican colleagues have their own version of the bill and, of course, they are very proud of their version, as we are of ours. We have suggested: Bring your bill to the floor 
   and bring your amendments to the floor. We will bring ours, and then we will assume the role of Senators. We will debate and we will vote. Ultimately, we hope to put together a good bill. But whatever the outcome, we will then go home and explain to the people we represent why we voted one way or another. This is not a radical strategy or policy.

   Mr. DURBIN. I will yield for a question in a moment, if the Senator will allow me to complete my thought. 
   What we are suggesting here is reminiscent of what most people expect to occur on the floor of the Senate--that Senators of differing viewpoints come forward and present their points of view and vote on them. We have gone on day after weary day with the Republican leadership trying to find ways to stop us from debating and stop us from voting. 
   Over this weekend, I made a tour of my State of Illinois, which is a big State. I ran into some people who told me an interesting story about their experience with health care. One group was in a machine shed on a farm near Farmington, IL. About 30 farmers gathered. I asked them about the farm crisis and I asked them about health insurance. They were equally animated on both subjects, concerned about their loss of income and also concerned about the jeopardy they and their families face because of health insurance. 
   Last weekend, I was in Peoria and I met with Henry Rahn. He raises soybeans and corn. If you go to most Illinois farms, you will find that is the case. He was quoted a price of $17,000 a year for health insurance for himself and his wife. What really wrangled Mr. Rahn was that in spite of his paying top dollar, the insurance companies were always trying to get out of paying for his health care needs. Recently he suffered a heart attack, and his coverage was threatened when he went to an emergency room because he had not called 24 hours in advance to notify the insurance company. 
   Another farmer, Bob Zinser--he is a farmer in Peoria and is also a chiropractor--told me in no uncertain terms that the HMO and PPO plans were total garbage. Mr. Zinser says, ``It seems like insurance companies have infinite wisdom on what's right and what's wrong.'' 
   These farmers I met were angry about how they were treated by insurance companies. They wanted action. 
   Under the GOP version--the Republican version--of managed care reform, these farmers I have just spoken about are not protected. They have written a bill which literally leaves behind 115 million Americans and provides no insurance reform. They do some things for small groups. But unlike the Democratic bill, which covers the vast majority of people with health insurance, the Republican bill leaves many behind, including the farmers and other self-employed people I just mentioned. 
   When I described this to the farmers at the gathering, they couldn't believe it: You are talking about health insurance reform on the floor of the Senate, and yet it won't help us and our families? I said: The Republican version of the bill will not; the Democratic version will. 
   Last night I flew to the Chicago area and went to Highland Park and met with a cardiologist. His story was chilling. Let me tell you exactly what he told me last night. 
   He said a patient came to his office--a woman--on Thursday complaining of chest pains. He didn't think she was in an emergency situation but he wanted her to go to the hospital the next day--the next morning--for a catheterization, a 
   very common diagnostic procedure used in cardiology, to determine just what her heart problem might be. 
   So they called her insurance company, and the insurance company said: No, we will not let her have a catheterization on Friday, because that hospital that you want to send her to is not covered by her health insurance. So the doctor said: What would you have her do? They said: Let us make an appointment for her. We will call on Saturday to see what we can find. 
   She passed away on Sunday. A decision about a hospital ended up jeopardizing this woman's health and her life. 
   This doctor said to me: What am I supposed to tell her family? 
   Think of how vulnerable each and every one of us is, going into a doctor's office hoping to get the very, very best diagnosis or treatment but always wondering if we will be second guessed by some bureaucrat at an insurance company. That is what this debate is all about. 
   I understand the frustration of the Republican leadership. Those of us on the Democratic side for 2 weeks now have been pressing to bring this issue to the floor. We have said we will take the outcome of the vote, whatever it might be, but let us have this debate. America is looking for us to initiate that debate. But, sadly, there are those on the Republican side who do not want to face these votes. They don't want to have to vote yes or no. They don't want to have to decide between the insurance companies' agenda and the agenda of families across the Nation. 
   That is a sad commentary on the state of affairs in the Senate, because the men and women I spoke to in that machine shed at the farm in Farmington, IL, and the doctor I spoke with in Highland Park understand full well  that this is an issue that can't be delayed. 
   There are certainly important bills for us to consider. We have a myriad of important appropriations bills to consider. I hope we can come to them soon. But we have taken the position on the Democratic side that we are only prepared to move to the appropriations bills once we have an agreement from the Republican side that we will debate health insurance reform, we will debate the Patients' Bill of Rights. Unfortunately, as of this moment we do not have that agreement. 
   There is also a question of accountability. I think this is a bottom line thought: The doctor who told me the story about the woman he wanted to refer for a heart catheterization but was told she couldn't go to the hospital that he wanted and the insurance company would come up with another one, I hope that doctor is never sued by anyone because of that decision. But those things do happen to doctors and hospitals. Despite the fact that the insurance company made the decision--the insurance company took her out of that doctor's care and said she had to go to another hospital--under current law in the United States of America, that health insurance company is protected from liability in court except for the cost of the procedure. If there is suffering, if there is pain, if there is loss of income, or if there is death, the insurance company, having made the decision which it did, will not be held liable. 
   You say, well, certainly there must be other companies in America which enjoy this kind of special privilege. And the answer is no--not any; none. No other company in America enjoys this protection from liability or enjoys this exemption from accountability like health care insurance companies. 
   Some on the Republican side have argued, oh, you Democrats just want to bring the health insurance companies in court to make lawyers wealthy. Of course, lawyers would be involved. It would be naive to say they wouldn't be involved. But the bottom line is, if you do not believe that your corporate decision--your insurance company decision--is something you can be held accountable for, how careful will you be? You will make a decision based on the bottom line profit: What is good for my company? How much money will be there at the end of the year? If you make the wrong decision in the interest of the patient, will you be held accountable? Not under the law as written today. 
   The Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights says no; health insurance companies, as every other company in America, will be held accountable for their conduct. Currently only foreign diplomats and health insurance companies cannot be brought into court in America. We think that should change. When it changes, we think health insurance companies, as in the example I used of the cardiologist, will think twice: Well, Doctor, perhaps you send that letter for a catheterization at the nearest hospital on Friday morning. No. We will not play with the insurance policy. We will work it out later. Let's take care of her health condition. 
   But they didn't. They decided, let's stick to the letter of the insurance policy. 
   How frustrating it is for doctors who face this. The doctors I talk to feel helpless. 
   You read in the paper last week that the American Medical Association is talking about forming a union--the ``International Brotherhood of Physicians'' or something. What would bring what is typically viewed as a conservative political group such as the AMA to a moment in time where they have decided they have had enough, that they have no voice when it comes to medical decisions, and they have to come together and bargain collectively with insurance companies? 
   I will tell you what has brought them to this point--the example that I used, and some others, where they realize that they have been overruled time and time again. They are frustrated. They are angry. That is why they have decided to start exploring the possibility of forming a union. 
   The message is here, America. This is an issue which cannot wait. When the Republican leadership comes to the floor and accuses us of stalling tactics, we are not trying to stall this process; we on the Democratic side are trying to accelerate this process. 
   Let's bring this bill to the floor. This is our last week before the Fourth of July recess. Let's dedicate this week to the Patients' Bill of Rights. Let's make sure that when we go home on Independence Day and walk down the parade route, the people we are looking at, who are waving sometimes at us, realize we have done our best, we have done our best to address an issue that is critical to every American. 
   The Rand study said that 115 million Americans have had a bad experience with a health insurance company or know someone in their family, or close friend, who has. The cases I have cited to you are not isolated examples. The letters stack up in our office from people all across my State of Illinois and all across this Nation. I have been speaking on the floor the last couple of weeks on this issue, and I have started receiving these letters. I have asked people to send letters to me in my office and to tell me about their experience with health insurance. 
   Every single letter tells the same story--letters where women who have chosen an OB/GYN as their primary care physician, a person they are confident of, a person they want to work with, have been overruled by insurance companies that said: We have a new doctor for you; situations where people, as I described earlier, will go into an emergency room only to learn that they are denied coverage because they picked the wrong hospital or they didn't call in advance for an emergency room. 
   Can you imagine, racing to the hospital with a son who has just fallen out of a tree in the backyard, trying to remember the number of the insurance company? Is that the last thing on your mind? It certainly would be on mine. I can remember taking my son to an emergency room when he decided to catch a baseball with his teeth instead of the glove. Those things happen. And you race off to the emergency room. You don't want to fumble in the glove compartment to find the insurance policy. You are worried about that little boy whom you love like everything in this world, and you want to get him to a good doctor as quickly as possible. You don't want to get tangled up in an insurance company bureaucracy. 
   Many times we find that the people, for example, who need specialists for medical care learn that they are being overruled by insurance companies that say: No; even though a doctor told you you needed a certain specialist, we don't approve of it. 
   One doctor who kept calling insurance companies and receiving frustrating answers finally asked the clerk on the phone: Are you a doctor? The voice at the insurance company said no. 
   He said: Are you a nurse? The voice said no. 
   He then asked: Do you have a college degree? No. 
   Do you have a high school diploma? Yes. 
   What qualifies you on the other end of this telephone to overrule me after years of education and medical school? The clerk said: I've got the rules in front of me. They are in writing. They are very clear, and we disagree. 
   That is what it comes down to. That is how the decisions are made. That is what this debate would be about. The debate will decide how many Americans will be protected by quality health care, debate will decide whether health insurance companies, as every other company in America, can be held accountable in court if they make a decision which takes away the life of a loved one, causes pain or loss of income--decisions as to whether or not medical necessity will rule when doctors make decisions, including the procedure you should have, what emergency room you can use, things that most Americans think are just common sense. That is what this debate would be about. 
   At 5 o'clock, we will start a series of four cloture votes. It is an effort by the Republican majority to stop this side of the aisle from offering this debate on the floor of the Senate. They are trying to stop this side from amending any bill so we can bring up these issues. They do not want to talk about these issues. They do not want to face these votes. If they can prevail--and on this side of the aisle hope they will not--if they can come up with the requisite votes, they can shut down the debate  and move on to some other issues. If the Republicans are successful in stopping this debate on health insurance reform, they will, as will Senators on this side of the aisle, one day soon have to go home. When they go home, they are going to face families such as those I faced over the weekend, living and dying with this problem every day and every week. 
   They will have to answer possibly the hardest question posed to any Senator: Why didn't you do something? What stopped you, Senator? Don't you understand? Don't you care about people like us? 
   That is what it is all about. I say to my friends on the Republican side of the aisle, please join in this debate. Don't be afraid of these votes. Try to look for some opportunities where, frankly, Republicans might find a Democratic amendment they like. I will look for Republican amendments I might like. Let's try to put something together. Let's put politics aside. Let's realize the families across America are not just Democratic families; they are Republican families, Independent families, and families who couldn't give a hoot about politics. But they are hopeful that this system of government and the men and women serving in this Senate care about them, care enough to bring this debate forward. 
   At 5 o'clock I will vote against the motion for cloture, to keep on the floor this debate on health insurance. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator for raising this. 
   In just a few moments, we will go to the Appropriations Committee and consider the D.C. appropriations. I ask my friend from North Dakota to follow with me for just a moment on some of the facts that we will face. 
   I do love the District of Columbia. I went to college and law school here, and it is a beautiful city. I think anyone who has been here more than 15 minutes knows that it has serious problems when it comes to the crime rate, when it comes to the status in schools. The District of Columbia has an annual budget of about $5 billion; $1.8 billion comes directly from the Federal Government. We are big players when it comes to the District's budget. 
   The District of Columbia's city council has decided that things are going so well in this city, when it comes to crime and schools, they have $59 million that they are going to give back to the residents in tax cuts. 
   To a staffer of mine the other day, at the end of the day, I said: Do you need a ride home? 
   He said: I only live 5 blocks from the Capitol Building of the United States. I ordinarily walk, but last week a woman was stabbed to death in my neighborhood 5 blocks from the United States Capitol Building. 
   I said: Do you know what you need in your neighborhood, according to the D.C. city council? You need a tax break. 
   Let's get serious about it. The first thing the residents of the District of Columbia want is safety in the streets and quality schools. This D.C. city council has turned its back on that. They said: We are going to acknowledge the fact that we are the worst in the Nation when it comes to infant mortality, the worst in the Nation when it comes to the basic standards of judging children, and yet we are going to stop spending money and helping these kids. We are going to give it back in a tax cut. 
   Then they turn around, wanting an additional $17 million for a scholarship program, money that is going to be taken out of the Labor-HHS appropriations. 
   What could that money do? It is money that goes to the National Institutes of Health for medical research. They want $17 million of that to spend on a scholarship program, while they give away $59 million. 
   I concur with the Senator from North Dakota. I have never felt it was my congressional responsibility to be the mayor of this 
   town or a member of the city council. But when they are absorbing Federal money, we have the right to say: You have done something which is shameful. To give away $59 million worth of problems that this city faces is just unconscionable. 
   If you walked into any Senate office or any House office and asked the staff members: Has anybody here been mugged, has your home been broken into or your car? You would be shocked. It is a common occurrence in this town. 
   We have to do something about it. I salute the Senator from North Dakota. I hope that he is aware of the debate we are about to have in a few moments.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that would replace the current fragmented federal food safety system with a single, independent agency responsible for all federal food safety activities--the Safe Food Act of 1999 (S. 1281). I am pleased to be joined by Senators TORRICELLI, MIKULSKI, and CLELAND in this important effort. 
   Make no mistake, our country has been blessed with one of the safest and most abundant food supplies in the world. However, we can do better. Foodborne illness is a significant problem. 
   The safety of our nation's food supply is facing tremendous pressures with regard to emerging pathogens, an aging population with a growing number of people at high risk for foodborne illnesses, broader food distribution patterns, an increasing volume of food imports, and changing consumption patterns. 
   The General Accounting Office (GAO) estimates that as many as 81 million people will suffer food poisoning this year and more than 9,000 will die. Children and the elderly are especially vulnerable. In terms of medical costs and productivity losses, foodborne illness costs the nation up to $37 billion annually. The situation is not likely to improve without decisive action. The Department of Health and Human Services predicts that foodborne illnesses and deaths will increase 10-15 percent over the next decade. 
   In 1997, a Princeton Research survey found that 44 percent of Americans believe the food supply in this country is less safe than it was 10 years ago. American consumers spend more than $617 billion annually on food, of which about $511 billion is spent on foods grown on U.S. farms. Our ability to assure that the safety of our food and to react rapidly to potential threats to food safety is critical not only for public health, but also to the vitality of both domestic and rural economies and international trade. 
   Many of you are probably following the dioxin crisis in Belgium. Days before the national elections poultry, eggs, pork, beef, and dairy products were withdrawn from supermarket shelves. Butcher shops closed and livestock farms were quarantined. Since then countries, worldwide, have restricted imports of eggs, chickens, and pork from the European Union. Public outrage in Belgium over the dioxin scandal led to a disastrous showing by the ruling party in the national and European elections on June 14, and the government was forced to resign. Food safety concerns and fears are global. 
   Today, food moves through a global marketplace. This was not the case in the early 1900's when the first federal food safety agencies were created. Throughout this century, Congress responded by adding layer upon layer--agency upon agency--to answer the pressing food safety needs of the day. That's how the federal food safety system got to the point where it is today. And again as we face increasing pressures on food safety, the federal government must respond. But we must respond not only to these pressures but also to the very fragmented nature of the federal food safety structure. 
   Fragmentation of our food safety system is a burden that must be changed to protect the public health from these increasing pressures. Currently, there are at least 12 different federal agencies, 35 different laws governing food safety, and 28 House and Senate subcommittees with food safety oversight. With overlapping jurisdictions, federal agencies often lack accountability on food safety-related issues. 
   Last August, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) released a report recommending the establishment of a ``unified and central framework'' for managing federal food safety programs, ``one that is headed by a single official and which has the responsibility and control of resources for all federal food safety activities.'' I agree with this conclusion. 
   The Administration has stepped forward on the issue of food safety--the President's Food Safety Initiatives and the President's Council on Food Safety have focused efforts to track and prevent microbial foodborne illnesses. I commend President Clinton and Secretaries Glickman and Shalala for their commitment to improving our nation's food safety and inspection systems. Earlier this year in response to the NAS report, the President's Council on Food Safety stated its support for the NAS recommendation calling for a new statute that establishes a unified framework for food safety programs with a single official with control over all federal food safety resources. 
   An independent single food safety agency is needed to replace the current, fragmented system. My proposed legislation would combine the functions of USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service, FDA's Center for  Food Safety and Applied Nutrition and the Center for Veterinary Medicine, the Department of Commerce's Seafood Inspection Program, and the food safety functions of other federal agencies. This new, independent agency would be funded with the combined budgets from these consolidated agencies. 
   With overlapping jurisdictions, federal agencies many times lack accountability on food safety-related issues. There are simply too many cooks in the kitchen. A single, independent agency would help focus our policy and improve enforcement of food safety and inspection laws. 
   The General Accounting Office has been unequivocal in its recommendation for consolidation of federal food safety programs. GAO's April 1998 report states that ``since 1992, we have frequently reported on the fragmented and inconsistent organization of food safety responsibilities in the federal government.'' In a May 25, 1994 report, GAO cites that its ``testimony is based on over 60 reports and studies issued over the last 25 years by GAO, agency 
   Inspectors General, and others.'' The Appendix to the 1994 GAO report lists: 49 reports since 1977, 9 USDA Office of Inspector General reports since 1986, 1 HHS Office of Inspector General report in 1991, and 15 reports and studies by Congress, scientific organizations, and others since 1981. 
   Again, earlier this year, GAO in its 21-volume report on government waste, pointed to the lack of coordination of the federal food safety efforts as an example. ``So many cooks are spoiling the broth,'' says the GAO while highlighting the absurdity of having one federal agency inspecting frozen meat pizza and another inspecting frozen cheese pizza. 
   Over 20 years ago, the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs advised that consolidation is essential to avoid conflicts of interest and overlapping jurisdictions. In a 1977 report the committee stated, ``While we support the recent efforts of FDA and USDA to improve coordination between the agencies, periodic meetings will not be enough to overcome [these] problems.'' This statement is just as true today as it was then. 
   It's time to move forward. Let us stop using multiple federal agencies to inspect pizza. Instead let us ``deliver'' what makes sense--a single, independent food safety agency. 
   A single, independent agency with uniform food safety standards and regulations based on food hazards would provide an easier framework for implementing U.S. standards in an international context. When our own agencies don't have uniform safety and inspection standards for all potentially hazardous foods, the establishment of uniform international standards will be next to impossible. 
   Research could be better coordinated within a single agency than among multiple programs. Currently, federal funding for food safety research is spread over at least 20 federal agencies, and coordination among those agencies is ad hoc at best. 
   New technologies to improve food safety could be approved more rapidly with one food safety agency. Currently, food safety technologies must go through multiple agencies for approval, often adding years of delay. 
   In this era of limited budgets, it is our responsibility to modernize and streamline the food safety system. The U.S. simply cannot afford to continue operating multiple systems. This is not about more regulation, a super agency, or increased bureaucracy, it's about common sense and more effective marshaling of our existing federal resources. 
   With the incidence of food recalls on the rise, it is important to move beyond short-term solutions to major food safety problems. A single, independent food safety and inspection agency could more easily work toward long-term solutions to the frustrating and potentially life-threatening issue of food safety. 
   Mr. President, together, we can bring the various agencies together to eliminate the overlap and confusion that have, unfortunately, at times characterized our food safety efforts. We need action, not simply reaction. I encourage my colleagues to join me in this effort to consolidate the food safety and inspection functions of numerous agencies and offices into a single, independent food safety agency.

   Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Nevada for yielding to me. 
   This debate really gets down to some very fundamental and basic questions about whether, when you go into your doctor's office and present yourself with an illness, you can trust that your doctor is going to be honest with you, tell you what is best for you or your family, or whether you have to worry about the fact that there may be some insurance company bureaucrat involved in this decision. 
   When it comes down to these basic life or death situations for a member of a family, there is enough emotional strain on an individual in trying to keep their wits about them, trying to keep their family together; but to think that you not only have to battle those things in your own mind but then, on a daily basis, battle the insurance company bureaucrats, that, to me, is the worst part of what we are debating. 
   I want to show you a photograph of a great little boy. He is 11 months old. His name is Roberto Cortes. He is from Elk Grove Village, IL--a cute kid, but a kid who has a serious problem, spinal muscular atrophy. He is currently on a home ventilator, as you can see in this photograph. 
   That is enough of a strain on any family--to try to make sure this little fellow has a chance to live a good life. But the sad part of this debate is that the parents of this little boy are self-employed. They have a little business. 
   The Republican Patients' Bill of Rights provides no protection whatsoever to self-employed people. Roberto Cortes and his family would not be protected at all by the Republican version of the Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   The Democratic version, supported by over 200 groups, representing doctors and hospitals and consumers and labor and businesses across America, would provide protection to the Cortes family. That is how basic this is. 
   When the Republicans tell us: We don't have time to debate this issue; we don't have time to debate whether or not you have a fighting chance when it comes to your health insurance, they are just wrong. 
   You are going to hear a lot about this issue from Members on the Democratic side. We are not going to quit until we get a chance to have this debate.  
   Since I see my colleague from California is here, and I know she has an important contribution to make to this discussion, I yield the floor back to the Senator from Nevada. 
   Mr. REID addressed the Chair.

   Mr. DURBIN. I thank the minority leader for coming to the floor. 
   For those who have been following this debate for the 10 days or more now that we have tried to focus the attention of the Senate on this Patients' Bill of Rights, this is the health insurance issue which American families are focused on already. We have talked about a lot of things on Capitol Hill, but it is time to talk about the things that are important to them. 
   In the example the Senator from South Dakota and the Senator from California addressed, about a doctor being overruled, is it not also the case that in some of these same insurance policies the doctor cannot even tell the patient that he has been overruled by an insurance company, that, in fact, it is not his best medical 
   judgment, but, in fact, the judgment of some bureaucrat in an insurance company that is going to dictate the treatment the patient receives?

   Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Wisconsin, the Senator from New York, and so many others who have come to the floor this morning and early this afternoon to talk about the Patients' Bill of Rights. For those who may not be familiar with the term, it is an effort to pass into law protections for individual Americans and their families when they have to deal with an insurance company. 
   The Rand Corporation tells us that 115 million Americans have had a bad experience with a health insurance company, or they know someone who has--perhaps someone in their family. 
   Those bad experiences run the gamut of being denied access to the doctor you want to go to, being denied access to a specialist in a case where you think one is necessary, or medically necessary in the view of another doctor, being unable to go to the emergency room closest to your home because your policy said no, you have to go across town or perhaps to another location for the emergency room in another hospital, dealing with a doctor who may not be able, under the terms of his contract, to even tell you what is best for you medically, having doctors who are losing out in the debate with bureaucrats at health insurance companies. 
   One doctor in Joliet, IL, frustrated with the voice on the other end of the telephone at the insurance company who kept saying no, no, no, every time this doctor told the insurance company what the insured patient needed, finally said to this voice: Wait a minute, are you a doctor? 
   And the voice said: No. 
   Well, are you a nurse? 
   No. 
   Are you a college graduate? 
   Well, no. 
   Are you a high school graduate? 
   Yes. 
   What gives you the authority in this insurance company to overrule my medical decision? 
   She said: I go by the rules--the rules of the insurance company. 
   Rules, frankly, that are driven not so much by the need for quality care but by the bottom line. 
   The health care system in this country is in a state of crisis. The question is whether this body, the Senate, which is supposed to be the most deliberative body in American politics, will even consider the issue. We are now tied up in knots over whether we can debate this issue. Isn't it ironic. The argument made by the Republican side is, we do not have time to debate this issue. Time? It is 1:30 in the afternoon. We spent the entire morning talking about this issue. Why don't we spend this time actually debating the issue? Let the Republicans put their best plan forward, let us put our plan forward, and let's vote. That is what this body is supposed to be about--not ducking and weaving and avoiding the issue but facing it. That is what it is about. 
   I stand by the Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights. I think our approach is a better approach. It includes a lot of provisions that, frankly, just make sense to most people. 
   First, doctors should make medical decisions, not insurance company bureaucrats. 
   Second, if you need a specialist and your doctor says that is the best thing for you or your baby, you have access to that specialist. 
   Third, if you are a woman and believe your primary care physician should be your OB/GYN, whom you are confident in dealing with, you have that right. 
   Fourth, if the insurance company makes a bad decision--if the insurance company denies you care, overrules your doctor, sends you home--you have a right to hold that insurance company accountable. 
   Let me be honest about what that means. It means the possibility the insurance company might have to go to court. The Republican side of the aisle just says, oh, you are not for health care; you are for more litigation; you want more people 
   in court. 
   No. But I can tell you, every American, every American company, is subject to that same rule except health insurance companies. They have an exception in the law. You cannot sue them for anything more than the cost of the procedure. 
   This Senator and everyone in the gallery and all listening will be held accountable for their actions. If I did something so foolish as to drink and drive and hurt someone, I would be hauled into court. I should be. That is something you expect in America. If you ask businessmen, they say: Yes, if we sell a product that is defective and we hurt someone, we are going to be held accountable. But health insurance companies are not held accountable. They make life-and-death decisions, and the Republicans in their so-called Patients' Bill of Rights do not want them to be held accountable. They think insurance companies should be above the law, the only businesses in America above the law. I don't think that is right. 
   The provisions in the Republican version, as opposed to the Democratic version, leave 115 million Americans behind. Who is involved in that? If you happen to be a farmer--and I come from an agricultural State, Illinois--you are not going to get a protection from the Republican version of the bill, only the Democratic version. If you happen to be a small businessperson, self-employed, you have no protection in the Republican bill. There is protection in the Democratic bill. State and local employee? Same story. 
   Why would we do that? Why would we write a law saying we respect the  rights of individual Americans in dealing with their health insurance company--unless they happen to be small businesses, unless they happen to be farmers, unless they happen to be the local policemen we rely on for safety in our community? This is worthy of a debate. 
   I think the Republicans would want to stand up and defend their point of view and let us defend our point of view. Then vote. But that is not what has happened. For 2 weeks we have talked about debating. For 2 weeks we have been here day after day asking for recognition on the floor to talk about this issue, because the Republican leadership does not want to face a debate and does not want to face tough votes, votes that may be hard to explain back home. 
   I have quoted him before and he is worthy of another quote, a former Congressman from Oklahoma named Mike Synar, who used to say to squeamish Congressmen when a tough vote was coming: If you don't want to fight fires, don't be a fireman. If you don't want to cast tough votes, don't run for Congress. 
   That is what we are here for, to do the best we can, debate this, and come up with a law that is good for America. Maybe we should bring in some of the better provisions from the Republican side, some of the better provisions from the Democrat side, and put forth a bill that will help the families in this country. But we have been stopped in our tracks. The leadership on the Republican side refused to give us that opportunity. 
   We tried yesterday, incidentally. We had an effort to amend the agriculture appropriations bill. You say, What does that have to do with health care? Well, people who live in rural areas are concerned about health care, but it was an available bill on which to try to bring up this issue. When we tried, we were stopped again. A vote to table that effort, to stop the 
   debate, to stop the amendments prevailed. 
   I have here a story, which I am sorry I will not have time to tell you, about Michael Cahill who lives in my home State, in Chicago, IL. It is a long, sad story. Michael had dizzy spells and went to a doctor who thought it might have been an inner ear problem. He was sent back and forth. Finally, he was referred to a neurologist who performed a CAT scan, and 3 years after the symptoms began, they determined he had multiple sclerosis, and then the insurance company said: You have to go back to the original doctor who did not diagnose it properly. 
   He went through a period--this goes on for pages--of fighting his insurance company. This is a man who comes to realize in his adult life that he has a serious medical illness, one he worries about. He worries about its effect on him and his family and his future. Instead of just fighting the illness, he is fighting the insurance company at the same time. 
   I wish this were an isolated story. It, unfortunately, is a story that has been repeated time and again. It is a story which reflects the reality most Americans now face when it comes to health insurance. 
   We only have a limited time left this week and next before we break for the Fourth of July. I am sure there will be many important issues we will consider. But I will bet if I went back to Chicago or any part of Illinois, my hometown of Springfield, and started asking people: What really concerns you? What could we do on Capitol Hill that might have an impact on your life?--if I brought up the issue of health insurance, my guess is a lot of those people would say, Can you do something about this? Are your hands tied? Can the Senate really act on it? 
   The answer is, we can do a lot. There was a press conference this morning by the women Senators who came forward and talked about some of the terrible things that have occurred in the treatment of women receiving these so-called drive-by mastectomies, where women literally have mastectomies and, under the insurance policies, cannot stay in the hospital overnight. A lot of State legislatures are changing the law in their States, but federally this should be a standard we all agree to, that people can stay in the hospital long enough for a good recovery. 
   Clinical trials are another real concern. Clinical trials are opportunities for medical researchers to come up with new cures. But, of course, they are not the most cost-efficient things. It takes extra time to try to find the patients who are appropriate for the test, get their permission, go through the testing and procedure, and a lot of health insurance companies say: We cannot be bothered by that. It is the bottom line. The longer they stay in the hospital, the worse for us. 
   But think about it. How can we expect to develop the cures we need in this country, the important things that challenge us and our families, if we do not have that? So we want to make certain clinical trials can still go on as a result of health care in this country. 
   Let me return for a moment to one of the basic frustrations that seems to attack the medical profession. I spoke to the Illinois State Medical Society a few weeks ago. It was an amazing experience, because as they started to ask questions afterwards, a lot of the questions circled around the question whether or not, as doctors, they could form a union. You know, there was a time if you said the word ``union'' in the presence of doctors, they would say: Wait a minute, we have nothing to do with that; that's some other group of people. 
   Why are doctors talking about forming unions or associations now? Because they have to have the power to bargain with the health insurance companies. Otherwise, they are being treated as employees and denied their professional rights, rights which they have earned with their education and their licensure. 
   It is an indication, too, of a concern I have that unless we change the way health care is managed in this country, fewer and fewer women and men will go to medical school. They will opt out of the opportunity of being health insurance company employees or servants and try something else. That is something that is not good for America if it occurs. 
   I can tell you if I am on a gurney in a hospital needing medical care and I look up into the eyes of that doctor, I want to see the best and the brightest. I will be praying that doctor was top of the class, the No. 1 graduate. I do not want someone who thought about this as a second option in their life, if they ever could. 
   I am afraid if this debate does not take place, if health insurance does not change, we could jeopardize the possibility of having the kind of men and women we want going to medical school and certainly jeopardize our ability, as individuals and members of families, to have health insurance and health care that we really can count on. 
   When Americans are asked across the board about their concerns, what they would like to see us work on, they tell us over and over: Take the decisions out of the hands of the health insurance companies and give them back to the doctors and medical professionals. 
   That is what this debate should be about. This empty Chamber should be filled with 100 Senators, Democrats and Republicans, debating this most important issue. Instead it is empty. We give these speeches calling for the issue to come before the Senate, and we are told by the other side we cannot; it would take too much time. And the clock continues to tick. 
   We have the time. The question is whether or not we can summon the courage to address an issue which, frankly, is controversial. On one side, the Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights has some 200 different organizations endorsing it. Doctors and hospitals, consumer groups, children advocacy groups, labor, business--all endorsing the Democratic plan. On the Republican side, their plan is endorsed by only one group, but it is a big one--the insurance companies. They do not want to see this changed. They are making a lot of money. 
   It goes beyond money. It goes to a question of quality of life for America's families. We had a similar debate just a few weeks ago, a debate that really followed the tragedy in Littleton, CO, when families across America and individuals stopped to ponder whether or not it was safe to send their kids to school anymore. It wasn't just Littleton, CO. It was Conyers, GA; West Paducah, KY; Pearl, MS; Springfield, OR; Jonesboro, AR; and maybe your hometown is next. 
   Finally, after a week of pointless debate, we came down to a sensible gun  control bill that was enacted only when Vice President GORE cast the deciding vote. Six Republicans and 44 Democrats voted for this bipartisan plan. It was sent to the House of Representatives and, unfortunately, there the National Rifle Association prevailed. The bill was basically defeated, and the opportunity for sensible gun control was lost. 
   I hope we have another chance in this session. I hope we have a chance to address not only gun control but the Patients' Bill of Rights, an improvement in the minimum wage in this country, and doing something about the future of Medicare--these things I believe are the reason we are here. It is the agenda with which most American families can identify--doing something about our schools to improve education. Instead we seem to be caught up in a lot of other issues that are at best only secondary. It is time to move to the primary agenda and the primary agenda is the Patients' Bill of Rights and that is what this Senate should be considering. 
   I thank the Chair for the opportunity to speak in morning business. I hope that as I end my remarks and we go into a quorum call, which is really a time out in the Senate, that all those who watch this quorum call will ask the same question: Why then, during that moment in time, isn't the Senate even talking about or debating the Patients' Bill of Rights? Why isn't that bill on the floor? Why aren't the Senators of both parties offering their best suggestions on how to improve health insurance in America? 
   Sadly, that has not happened. I hope it happens soon, and the sooner the better. I yield the floor. 
   Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.

    Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my longtime friend, Douglas R. Aurand of Rockford, IL. Doug has served as Winnebago County Treasurer for 28 years and Rockford Township Trustee for 2 years. He retired earlier this month as treasurer. 
   Doug has been an Illinois resident his entire life, born in Dixon and raised in Pecatonica. He married the former Julie Moore and they have two children, David and Christine. Retirement will give Doug more time to spend with his grandchildren, Billy and Tommy Schwengels. 
   After graduating from Pecatonica High School, Doug served in the U.S. Air Force for four years. He was first elected to public office as Winnebago County Treasurer in 1970, at the age of 29. He held his office for six consecutive terms, becoming the longest serving elected official in the same office in northern Illinois. 
   Doug has worked tirelessly for more than 28 years as a public servant and for the taxpayers of Winnebago County. During this time, he has reduced his staff by 60 percent.  
   Responsible for funds exceeding $387 million year, he has earned over $44 million in interest for taxpayers in Winnebago County through his wise investments. He is responsible for the administration and collection of 110,000 tax bills which bring in approximately $285 million for the 72 taxing districts in his county. 
   In short, Doug Aurand has given remarkable service as Winnebago County Treasurer, and I commend him for his achievements. His leadership and fiscal management skills have made a difference in Winnebago County and he will most certainly be missed. 
   I congratulate Doug Aurand and, once again, commend him for the last impact he will leave on Rockford, Winnebago County, and the State of Illinois. My best wishes to Doug and Julie Aurand as Doug begins his well deserved retirement.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the State Department has been working to promote regional cooperation in Northeastern Europe. The idea behind this policy is more fully to integrate the Baltic countries into Europe and overcome cold war divisions to promote stability in the region. I support this approach, and I want to see it institutionalized at the State Department by designating a senior-level official with responsibility for coordinating policy toward Northeastern Europe. 
   This policy of integration also reduces tensions, since regional cooperation that includes Russia's northwestern regions gives Russia a stake in regional stability. The policy will also  show Russia that it need not feel threatened by the integration of the Baltic States into European institutions. The Baltic countries have increased their ties with the northwestern Russian regions, much the way Canada has ties with the border states of the United States. The Baltic States benefit as well from regional cooperation with the Nordic countries, further cementing the Baltic nations as part of Europe. 
   It is mutually beneficial for the all the Northeastern European countries to address regional problems, such as environmental problems caused by the former Soviet Union, or burgeoning crime and drug smuggling from the Russian mafia. 
   The Northern European Initiative announced in 1997 is just one example of this policy. It fosters regional cooperation and cross-border ties, relying on the private sector and nongovernmental organizations, as well as governments, in the areas of trade and investment, institution building, law enforcement, nuclear waste control, and the development of civil society, among others. Another positive step was the signing of the Baltic Charter in 1998 that strengthens Baltic bilateral ties and ties with the United States and addresses Baltic security concerns. Regional organizations have been set up, including BALTSEA, to coordinate military assistance, as well as several joint Baltic efforts at defense cooperation. 
   The State Department has set out on an ambitious agenda that I think is going in a very positive direction. However, I am afraid other crises and problems, for instance the many issues that will come up in Southeastern Europe following the crisis in Kosovo, will divert the Department's attention from this policy and cause it to lose steam. Therefore, I am offering this amendment to direct the Secretary to designate an existing senior-level State Department official with responsibility for coordinating policy toward Northeastern Europe. The way this assignment of responsibility would fit in the State Department's structure is up to the Secretary. 
   I also want to make clear that I mean no criticism of the Assistant Secretary for European Affairs by proposing this amendment. On the contrary, I think he has done an extraordinarily good job in pursuing the integration of Northeastern Europe. But with all of Europe on his mind, I think it would only further the aims of the bureau to be sure that a senior-level official is designated to coordinate and promote this policy. 
   I appreciate the support of Senator HELMS and Senator BIDEN, and understand that this amendment has been added to the manager's package.

   Mr. DURBIN. I am going to ask a very brief question. Is it not true that at 5:45--in 45 minutes--there will be a motion by the Republicans to table the Democratic version of the Patients' Bill of Rights without further debate, without further amendment, and to bring to an end this debate about whether families across America will have the stronger voice in terms of their health insurance protection? 
   I ask the Senator from Massachusetts, who has been here for a few months, to respond, if he will. Why is it that the Republican majority is so concerned about or afraid of the idea of actually debating or deliberating something which is so important to American families, their health care?

   Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senate for yielding. 
   You know what this reminds me of? This reminds me of the Senate. Imagine, both sides of the aisle--Republican and Democrat--on the floor discussing and debating an issue which counts with American families--health insurance. 
   Is it going to be there when we need it? Will it be affordable? Can we trust our doctors not to be overruled by insurance company bureaucrats? 
   I like this debate. That is why I ran for the Senate. But in 10 minutes there will be a vote on a Republican motion to table to end this debate, to stop it, to say that there is going to be no further debate, no future amendments--it is over. 
   I do not think that makes sense. Weren't we sent here to enter into this debate? To face these issues on an up-or-down vote? I am prepared to do that. 
   I know that some of the votes on these amendments will not be easy, but I think we have an excellent bill in the Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights, a bill that has been endorsed by every major health organization, children's advocacy groups, and labor-business across the board. 
   I am prepared to stand and defend this bill, offer amendments that give to families the assurance they are going to get quality health care. But the Republican side does not want this debate. They do not want to vote on these amendments. They called it ``health care-plus.'' It is ``health care-minus.'' Every day they are taking away from American families their power to choose a doctor, their power to have the right specialist, their willingness, I guess, to sit down with their doctor and realize they are getting an honest answer. 
   It is a shame that in 10 minutes this motion to table is going to come before us. This really resembles the Senate--deliberation on an issue that counts. I hope the motion to table is defeated. Let's have the real debate on this issue. 
   I yield back my time.

    Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to share with my colleagues a story about a most remarkable woman who is celebrating her ninetieth birthday. Her heroic existence embodies every element of a true American.  
   Katherine Dunham is a studied anthropologist, a brilliant social worker, an inspiring dancer and a historic activist. She started her first dance school in Chicago in 1931, and later became dance director for the Works Progress Administration's Chicago theater project. In 1967 she founded a performing arts center for inner-city youths in East St. Louis, Ill. 
   One of her many accomplishments came on the night of January 15, 1979, when she was presented with the Albert Schweitzer Music Award at New York's Carnegie Hall. The significance of this award was underscored as three generations of Katherine Dunham dancers and musicians offered spectacular renditions of her marvelous work. The dance and music roared, peppered with the rich flavor of American dance mixed with the anthropological roots of African American heritage. 
   This kind and brave woman forged a path for less fortunate children, offering the arts as an outlet to their misfortunes. She gave of herself everything and asked little in return. Katherine Dunham was and remains a stellar addition to our rich American heritage. 
   I hope you will join me in wishing Ms. Dunham a very happy birthday.

Mr. President, there is a crisis facing the steel industry in the United States, a crisis that has left over 10,000 steelworkers out of jobs and could jeopardize the jobs of thousands of additional workers. This disruption is a result of subsidized and dumped goods coming into the United States from a variety of countries--from Russia, from Japan, from Brazil, from Indonesia--at far under the cost of production and far under the price the steel is being sold in those countries. 
   While our existing laws and administrative procedures are in place and we've received favorable preliminary indications from administration officials, the time it takes to process these cases is too long and does not respond to a situation as dire as ours quickly enough. For example, hot-rolled carbon steel dumping petitions filed in September 1998, a full 10 months after the import surge began, were only recently decided. Under current law, industries and workers must wait until the injury has occurred or is so imminent as to be unavoidable to file a section 201 case. 
   Meanwhile, steelworkers continue to lose their jobs and the steel industry is suffering tremendous losses from which it may not easily recover. I shouldn't have to remind anyone that five American steel companies have declared bankruptcy and two of them are in the State of Illinois (LaClede Steel in Alton, IL, and Acme Steel in Riverside, IL) and at least 10,000 of the Nation's 170,000 steelworkers have been laid off. Illinois is one of the top steel producing States and we're proud of our steelworkers, the industry, and the products that they make for the American people and the world. 
   It is my belief that we should approach this situation with both short-term and long-term strategies that will complement each other and produce the maximum benefit for the U.S. economy, the steelworkers, and the industry. First, steel mills need access to capital to stay open and to keep their workers on the job, producing the finest and best steel in the world. That's a short-term approach that will help the industry and the workers when they need it most: now. And that's an approach that we take with this bill: H.R. 1664, Byrd-Domenici Steel Oil and Gas Loan Guarantee Program. 
   H.R. 1664 would provide a short-term, GATT legal, guaranteed loan program to address the cash flow emergency created by the historic steel import 
   surge. The maximum aggregate amount of a loan guarantee that could be available to a single company would be $250 million. The guarantees provided to U.S. steel mills would be 6 years in duration, would require the commitment of collateral, and would require a fee to be paid by the borrower to cover the cost of administering the program. The level of guarantees to be provided to a steel mill would be 85 percent. 
   Finally, a board would be created in order to implement a steel loan guarantee program that provides maximum benefits to the U.S. steel industry and protection to the taxpayers. 
   Second, we need to put more teeth into current trade laws. Specifically, we should strengthen section 201 language by removing a very high causation standard and replacing that standard with a lower threshold by which U.S. industries and workers can prove their cases more easily. Let me state for the Record that if we reform our trade laws and we ensure our trading partners know we are serious about enforcing those laws, the incentive to dump steel or other imported products will be reduced. I liken this to the Senate filibuster. The threat of a filibuster may be far more effective than the actual filibuster itself. Similarly, the threat of more readily-proven dumping cases may, in fact, make a country think twice about dumping a product illegally into this country. Legislation was recently marked up in the Finance Committee that addressed the issue of section 201 and we should have a healthy debate about that as well. 
   In the meantime, Mr. President, we have a responsibility as Senators to address this issue as well as the serious situation the oil and gas industries is currently experiencing; and, I hope we can find a consensus solution that will help both these backbones of the U.S. industrial sector.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, thank you for the recognition, and I see the Senator from Rhode Island has joined me. I would like to address for a few moments an issue which, frankly, more than half of the people in America identify as something that worries them--a worry over your health insurance. How good is it? 
   The rules being written by insurance companies now have you worried as to whether you can go to a doctor and get the kinds of treatment you really need for yourself, or your wife, your husband, or another member of your family. Can you go to the hospital of your choice if you have an emergency and need to go to the emergency room? Can you go to the hospital that is closest to where the accident occurred or to your home, or wherever? Does your insurance company say you have to go to another place? If you need a specialist--absolutely need one for your own medical care--can you expect, under your plan, to get that specialist, or do you expect to enter into a negotiation with your insurance company as to whether they will let you go to a certain specialist? 
   When you doctor sits down with you in his office, when your heart is beating hard and you want to know what kind of treatment you need for that someone you love, are you sure that doctor is always telling you his best judgment based on years of medical training, or is he telling you what the insurance manual says he can tell you under the terms of his contract with the insurance company? If, God forbid, something goes wrong with a procedure, or something is done that ends up wrong, can you hold whoever is responsible accountable even if it was the insurance companies fault? 
   These are basic questions that families across America are asking every day. In fact, a Rand study said that 115 million Americans either had a personal experience, or a member of their family or someone they knew had such an experience, with an insurance company that troubled them about whether or not they were being treated fairly. 
   So the question before the Congress is: Can we try to bring some balance back to this situation so consumers and families across America, when they sign up for health insurance, have some assurance that they are going to get fair treatment, professional treatment, and quality care? It is pretty basic, isn't it? 
   Can you think of another time in your life when you are more vulnerable than when you are sick, or when you have a baby you love in your arms and you say: Doctor, what does my baby need? Have you ever felt more helpless? I have been there! A lot of Americans have been there. You want to know, when that doctor looks in your eyes and says the best treatment for your little girl is the following surgery at the following hospital, that that is his best medical decision, not an insurance company decision. 
   How can you hold people accountable in medical care when you have a situation under the law where you cannot take the insurance company into court to hold them responsible for their decisions? That, sadly, is the law today. 
   So the law that we are hoping to debate on the floor of the Senate and the House called the Patients' Bill of Rights would try to rewrite this basic relationship, so that when you are dealing with your health insurance company, it is with more confidence that you are getting the best care, that you are getting honest answers from your doctor, that the recommendation coming to you for a member of your family or yourself is the best medical recommendation, not an insurance company recommendation. 
   Now, this is an issue that is not new. We have had it around for a while. But for some reason, the leadership on the other side of the aisle does not want to debate this issue. They don't want us to talk about it. In fact, today there was an unrelated bill, the agriculture appropriations bill before the Senate. BYRON DORGAN of North Dakota looked at the agriculture appropriations bill and offered the Patients' Bill of Rights as an amendment to it. What 
   does that have to do with agriculture? Well, not much. People listening will say: Why did you do that? Well because he was, in desperation, trying to get this matter to the floor because, try as we might, leadership on the other side of the aisle does not want to debate this issue. They don't want Members of the Senate--Republicans or Democrats--to enter into a debate and have to face tough questions. 
   How are you going to vote? If I am not mistaken, I accepted voting as part of my responsibilities as a Senator from Illinois. Isn't that why I am here--to debate issues and vote, to use my best judgment to try to improve the law so the people in my State and across the Nation are better off? 
   One of the key questions here is: What do you do when an insurance company decides that they are not going to provide certain care to you? You have heard these cases. You have seen them in local hometown newspapers, on television, and on the radio where somebody says they need a certain treatment and the insurance company says no. 
   What is next? Well, under the bill we have proposed on the Democratic side, we have a speedy independent appeals process. Well, it keeps you out of court and gets a decision made by somebody who may be objective. I think that is fair. That is what the Democratic bill proposes. 
   The Republican bill, however, suggests that the insurance company should decide whether a denial is actually appealable and the insurer which has turned you down gets to pick somebody who will then decide whether the insurance company is right or wrong. And if you are injured, by their denial, you cannot sue. Sound fishy? It does to me. Basically, as far as I am concerned, the insurance company is insulating itself from ever making the right judgment. 
   That is exactly the situation that we have today. It was recognized by one of the major newspapers in this country, USA Today. This article is from June  19 of last year. They called insurers the ``new untouchables''--people you can't sue--your HMO, managed care insurance policy.  
   Bill Weaver, age 52, says his HMO misdiagnosed a brain tumor for 2 years and told him his condition was inoperable and hopeless. 
   Jerry Cannon's wife Phyllis died from leukemia after her HMO denied a bone marrow transplant her physician recommended. 
   Melody Louise Johnson died at the age of age 16 of cystic fibrosis. Her mother says the HMO overruled the specialists.  
   These are families from across America. Under the law as it is currently written, what recourse do these people have for the terrible outcomes dealing with insurance companies? Listen to this. They can go to Federal court and hire a lawyer and sue the insurance company. Do you know what they can recover? The cost of the procedure--the cost of the medical procedure. So if somebody dies, God forbid, you cannot recover for their death. If someone lingers and suffers literally for years because of a bad decision by the insurance company, they are not liable for that. If someone can't go back to work for 12, 24, or 36 months, you cannot recover a penny for that. They are the untouchables, the HMOs, the managed care insurance companies. They cannot be sued for anything other than the cost of the procedure. 
   Well, I am sure, if you are listening to this, you think there must be a whole lot of companies in America which have similar treatment. No. This is the only group of companies in America that cannot be held accountable for their wrongdoing. How did it happen? Well, it happened right here. It happened right here many years ago when we passed something called ERISA, the Employee Retirement Insurance Security Act. This was a bill passed in 1974 that was supposed to protect workers. Instead, in recent years it has provided insurance companies with a legal shield. And 123 million Americans with their health insurance plans through their 
   employer have nowhere to go when a bad result comes out of a bad insurance company decision. I think that is wrong. 
   I don't think these insurance companies should be treated any differently from any other company, large or small, in America, or any other person, for that matter. If you are so reckless as to drink too much and get in your car and have an accident, can you be held accountable in America? You bet you can, and you should be. But if an insurer is reckless in making a decision about health insurance for somebody's daughter--if they make the wrong decision and they are maimed, crippled, or they die, can they be held accountable as an insurance company? Well, no, not really. That doesn't make sense, and it is not fair. 
   Let me tell you about another case that really illustrates this very clearly. Carly Christy. These are the words of her father:  
   Carly was nine years old when she was diagnosed with malignant kidney cancer. When the HMO insisted that we trust our daughter's delicate surgery to remove the cancerous tumor from her kidney to a doctor with no experience in this area, we were forced to find an expert and pay out of our pockets. You only get one chance at removing a Wilm's tumor correctly and successfully, to ensure the highest probability of survival in children, and we weren't willing to take that chance with our daughter's life because the HMO wanted to save money.  
   Her father Harry Christy says:  
   Congress must close this loophole and hold health plans accountable for cost-cutting decisions that result in patient injury.  
   Take a look at the two bills on the floor--the Patient's Bill of Rights, as they call them. How would they help Mr. Christy with his little daughter? 
   Frankly, the Republican bill offers no recourse, no place to turn, because the HMO didn't deny treatment. In the Republican bill only outright denials are appealable, all quality issues are not appealable. In Carly's case the HMO just said you have to go to Dr. X who has never done this before. They were going to get treatment but not from the best doctor. 
   If it is your daughter, don't you want the best and the brightest in America operating on her to try to save her life? If they said go to this other doctor who has never done this before on a surgery that is life and death, wouldn't that cause you some trouble? 
   Harry Christy decided he and his wife were going to pay for this out of their pockets. I don't have to tell you what kind of money we are talking about. Average families literally put everything on the line--their homes, savings, everything they can gather--for this care. That is how much they love this little girl and how much they think the insurance company made a big mistake. 
   Under the Republican approach, that insurance company cannot be held accountable, because they said go ahead, go to a doctor who is inexperienced and if Carly had been injured by that insurance company's direction, the insurer would still have been immune from suit. 
   The Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights says first you have a speedy external appeal, by someone not chosen by the insurance company, to decide whether the insurance company is right. If it turns out they are wrong, you can literally recover what it costs and the pain and suffering your family has gone through. If your daughter, for example, because of this mistake, has long-term problems, she can recover for that, too. I think that is sensible. I think it is reasonable. 
   We have a chance with the Patients' Bill of Rights to do something for families across America--to finally bring this issue to the floor of the Senate. It is regretful that today when Senator DORGAN tried to bring this issue before the Senate, he was stopped. The Republican leadership was so determined not to debate this issue, they pulled this bill from the floor. They said we will not debate it. 
   Of course, we are in evening business and Senator REED of Rhode Island will follow me and discuss this as an issue whose time has come. This is an issue that affects literally all Americans. If we are going to make certain that we cover the millions of Americans who are concerned about their health care coverage, concerned about the quality of care, and concerned about their rights under the law, then we have to deal with reform that is meaningful. 
   The Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights has the endorsement of 200 professional organizations, including medical organizations, labor organizations, and consumer organizations. They have come forward and said this is the real deal here, the Democratic version is the real deal. The Republican bill has no support. Well actually they probably have the support of insurance companies, but it doesn't have the support of any health groups. I think this is about health and access to health care. 
   We wrapped up last week a 5-day debate on protecting computer companies from being sued if they don't change their computers for this Y2K problem. The debate went on a long time. I think it was an important debate. 
   If we can spend 5 days debating protecting computer companies, can't we spend 5 hours talking about protecting families across America, worried about health care coverage? Can't we bring for a vote on the Senate floor the very fundamental question as to whether or not the courthouse doors are closed when it comes to health insurance companies? Can't we suggest that in America--rich or poor, individual or business--we are all held accountable in court, all of us as American citizens, and that we shouldn't have the untouchables, the health insurance companies, who can't be brought into court? 
   I hope this week we will take this issue up. I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will understand the gravity of this issue and move forward. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, during the course of this week we have come to the Senate floor many times to discuss pending legislation of great importance to families across America. 
   Last night--I guess this morning, in the early morning hours--the House of Representatives failed to pass the gun control legislation which the Senate enacted 3 weeks ago. 
   You may remember that Vice President GORE came to the floor, cast the deciding vote, broke the tie, and we passed a bill which would try to close the loopholes for the sales of firearms at so-called gun shows, trying to find a way--any way we can--to reduce the likelihood that guns will get into the hands of children and criminals. 
   America's heart was broken by Littleton, CO. Families across America, who may have heard these numbing statistics about 13 children a day dying, finally realized it could happen there--it could happen in Littleton, CO, in Conyers, GA, in Jonesboro, AR, in Pearl, MS, West Paducah, KY, Springfield, OR, or in Springfield, IL, my hometown. It could happen anywhere. 
   Guns are just too easy to come by in America. Troubled kids, who are always a problem, become tragedies when they take these guns into the classrooms, killing their classmates and teachers. 
   So we passed legislation, good legislation, bipartisan legislation, and sent it to the House of Representatives. Frankly, they decided, because of the political heat that might be generated, to call for a vote in the middle of the night, at 1:15 in the morning, to ask the House of Representatives to go on the Record, because the leadership in the House thought Americans would not notice it if it happened in the middle of the night. The National Rifle Association did not think Americans would care. They are both wrong. 
   America understands what happened in the dark of night. There was a shot in the dark, and it hit American families right where they live--families who worry about whether sending their kids to school anymore is a safe thing to do, families who wonder, when they say good-bye to their child in the morning, if those are the last words they will ever share with their child. 
   That is where we are in America. That is where gun violence has brought us. But this is not a fatal shot on the American families. They have, I guess, the hope and the confidence that this Congress will come to its senses and once and for all say no to these gun lobbies and yes to safety in our schools. 
   The big debate in the House was whether or not we ought to post the Ten Commandments in schools. Let me go on the Record and say I support values for families. I support strengthening families. I believe that those families who believe, as my family did, that the practice of religion is an important part of values, those families should be encouraged in every way whatsoever. We should make sure our kids grow up with values. But it is so naive to believe that simply posting the Ten Commandments in schools is going to change the climate in 
   America. 
   Perhaps, though, we could post the Ten Commandments at the gun shows and underline the Commandment that says: Thou shalt not kill, saying to people who want to buy and sell these guns without any background checks, accept your moral responsibility for what is about to occur. 
   The Illinois State Police did a survey of the crime guns they had confiscated recently and found over 25 percent of them came out of these gun shows, sold to people who, frankly, face no background check whatsoever. 
   We tried to close that loophole in the Senate; the House has failed. We cannot leave this issue alone.

   Mr. DURBIN. But there is another issue that haunts American families beyond the violence in our schools and beyond the question of gun safety. It is the issue of health insurance. 
   Mr. President, 115 million Americans, when asked, said that either they personally or a member of their family had run into serious problems when it came to health insurance and health insurance companies. 
   I started speaking on the floor about this issue just this week, and I have started getting letters from my State of Illinois and across the country. People said: Yes, you are right. Let me read you two of these letters to give you an idea. 
   Here is one that comes from Raymond and Marianne Eberhardt. These are folks who, frankly, could be any of us. They write:  
   Enclosed is a picture of Theresa, needless to say she is a very beautiful child. She was hospitalized from September 2, 1998 to February 15, 1999 due to fighting the insurance company for certain provisions we could not do without in our home. Her daddy is a police officer and [her] mommy stays at home. 
   She most likely would not have had to be vented--  
   She is on a ventilator.  
   if she were able to leave when the doctors had said she could go. However, we had to fight and fight with the insurance company for things that the doctors had said were needed. So we fought for 2 1/2 months.  
   Can you imagine, as parents, fighting to keep this lovely little girl alive, getting up every morning and saying a prayer that she will survive, and then getting on the telephone to fight with the insurance company for the basics that the doctors say she needs to continue living? Their battle went on for 2 1/2 months. She writes:  
   We eventually did get everything that we needed, except it was a very long battle. Can you imagine having your family separated that long because the insurance company did not want to help? Seven months is a long time for a family to have to go through something like this. Theresa caught RSV in the hospital--  
   This is a malady which clearly is very serious.  
   while we were waiting for the appeals to go through.  
   That is, with the insurance company.  
   That is why she is now vented and has a trach. Theresa copes extremely well with what all has been done to her. It does not  fade her in the least. She has Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type 1. She is very strong willed and is a joy to be around. I hope something can be done in regards to insurance companies helping families more and be a little more compassionate. I know in my heart we would have lost her if we did not get the proper equipment. I am thankful to them that they eventually changed their minds. I just wish it did not have to take so long.  
   As a parent, I have sat in a waiting room at the hospital with my daughter in surgery. My wife and I have been through that several times. You will never in your life feel as helpless as that moment. You will never feel as vulnerable. You pray to God that everything turns out right. You hope those doctors and nurses and technicians who are in that operating room are the best and the brightest that could possibly be there. But you don't want to sit there and have to worry about whether you are going to have to fight with an insurance company over whether or not that surgery will go forward or whether, when that surgery is finished, your child receives the kind of treatment that is essential. 
   Here is another letter we received:  
   This letter is to introduce you to our precious angel child Roberto Antonio Cortes. He is 11 months old now and is so special to us. He was diagnosed with Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type I, the Werdnig Hoffman disease. He is currently on a home ventilator. 
   My husband, Rigo, is self-employed at this time and doing contract work out of our house.  
   They indicated they would be more than happy to talk to our office about the battles they have faced with insurance companies. 
   Here is another letter from Addison, IL, Dolores Pavletich:  
   Dear Senator DURBIN, 
   Just a note to thank you for taking a stand on Health Care Issues. 
   Last night when I returned home from work and turned on TV, I caught part of C-Span where you, Senator KENNEDY, Senator SCHUMER, Senator DASCHLE [and Senator BOXER] were asking to negotiate the Health Care Issues. When you spoke, you addressed all the issues so many of us are concerned with. I have recently had such bad experiences with Insurance Companies. I started by choosing a doctor from a book, being treated by him, and half way through treatment was told the doctor was dropped [by the insurance company] and I would have to change doctors or they would not pay [for it.] I did not think it was fair to stop treatment and start over with another doctor. I then chose a doctor only to find out that the hospital he was on staff was not [covered by my insurance company] therefore, any tests or blood workup could not be done at his hospital. Blood tests would have to be sent to a lab, and if I had to be admitted to a hospital, I would have to choose yet another doctor. 
   I am a 57 year old woman, on my own, and now find that the company I work for is down sizing and my job may be eliminated soon. I cannot retire yet, am not eligible for medicare and with only unemployment cannot afford Cobra [Insurance] because of it being so expensive [and I do not know if I can afford it.] 
   I am so interested in the Health Care Issue I would do anything to help make life easier for so many people. If there is anything I can contribute towards this issue I would gladly devote as much time as possible to assure everyone the right to choose [their doctor, their insurance company.] I wish I could speak to you in person to tell you what people are being faced with today. 
   Please continue to speak for the majority of people in this country. We've chosen you to do what you do best and we look forward to you to speak for us.  
   That is why I am here on this floor. We have a choice. We have a thing that we can do that can make a difference. There is a Patients' Bill of Rights the Democrats have introduced, which has been endorsed by over 200 major health organizations, which will finally step forward and stand up for consumers and stand up for families and say we are going to address the basics. We are going to make sure you can choose the specialist you need. We are going to make sure when you sit down in the office with the doctor that you get straight talk and honest answers. You aren't going to hear a doctor parrot some insurance company line instead of telling you the truth about your medical care and what you need. 
   We want to make certain that when you go to an emergency room, you go to the one you need for your family because of medical necessity. You don't fumble through the dashboard looking for the health insurance policy to figure out which hospital you can go to without paying for it out of your pocket. 
   These are the basics, to make sure that the women across America who trust their medical care to an OB/GYN can continue to pick that doctor they trust, the doctor they have confidence in, and not be told by the insurance company to pick up and move; to make certain that doctors, when they say surgery is necessary, won't be overruled by some clerk sitting in an insurance company office in Omaha, NE. The decision should be made by our doctors, not by insurance company clerks. 
   This debate is central to really giving peace of mind to families across America. Why haven't we debated it for over 2 years? Because the insurance companies do not want this issue 
   to come to the floor of the Senate. They do not want to face the votes which we would call for on the floor of the Senate. 
   The Patients' Bill of Rights that the Democrats support is a bill which gives to those who are providing health care fair treatment. Right now if something happens that is wrong in medical treatment, who gets sued? The doctors and the hospitals. But what if the insurance company made the wrong decision? Under the law, they are protected. The current law protects them. They can't be held accountable. Is that fair? Is that American? I don't believe it is. We are each held accountable for our actions, as every business is held accountable. There is no reason why health insurance companies should be exempt from that responsibility. 
   Here is what faces us: Will we, in the closing weeks before we break for the Fourth of July or our August recess, have the political courage to bring this issue to the floor? We spent 5 days debating giving protection to computer companies against being sued for Y2K problems, 5 days. We were worried about computer companies. Well, maybe we should be. But can't we spend 5 hours on this debate to stand up for families across America who want protection when it comes to the health care that means so much? 
   Look at these photographs. Imagine what life is like battling every single day with the insurance company and then praying to God, as you go to sleep at night, that this beautiful little baby will be alive in the morning. That is the reality of health care in America. 
   I challenge the Republican leadership, challenge them to bring to the floor of the Senate within the next week the Patients' Bill of Rights. Let us have this debate. Let us face the tough votes. That is what we are here for, for goodness' sake. This is supposed to be a deliberative body where we debate and argue and come to the best conclusion for the people we represent. 
   I will stand behind the Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights, because I believe it is the best one. I believe it is the only one that is honest and complete and will help American families. The Republican plan, as this chart indicates, would leave over 100 million Americans behind, would not give them the protections which we believe are essential to health insurance. 
   It is true they protect 48 million Americans, just as we do, but they leave behind 113 million who are protected by the Democratic bill. 
   I think it is time to have this debate, for the good of families across America, for the Pavletichs in Addison, IL, for the Cortez family from Elk Grove Village, for the Eberhardts, who have written to me and told me their story, from Yorkville, IL. 
   I promise you this: As long as my voice holds out, I will be on my feet on the Senate floor saying to my colleagues, we have a responsibility. The 105th Congress left town a little over 6 months ago and did nothing. It was a do-nothing Congress. This Congress is not going to leave town without addressing this critical issue, this issue that means so much to Americans across this country and people who continue to write on a daily basis. 
   I will close by saying this: Keep the letters and photographs coming in. As long as you will send me your stories of your family struggling to provide quality health care, I will continue to stand on this floor and tell these stories, in the hopes that my colleagues in the Senate will address this important issue. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is interesting. Prior to my speech, the Senator from New Jersey and the Senator from Rhode Island talked about lead poisoning and public health. The Senator from Maine has discussed Medicare, and now I want to discuss the Patients' Bill of Rights. There have been three speeches in a row on health care. It sounds like a pretty important issue to me. 
   Frankly, for many Americans, it is the most important issue. But the sad reality is that the Senate spends a lot of time on speeches when it comes to health care and almost no time when it comes to debating legislation to make things better. 
   If you are watching this proceeding or are within the sound of my voice and you can say in the last year I had a problem in my family with health insurance coverage or I know someone in my family who did, do not believe you are in the minority. In fact, almost 50 percent of Americans say they have had problems with their managed care health insurance. 
   What kind of problems? Coverage. If there is a problem, a medical problem, will the managed care policy cover it with the care that is necessary, or do you have to go out and hire a lawyer? 
   On the question of emergency room access, if you belong to a managed care plan, they might tell you, incidentally, you are supposed to go to St. John's Hospital and not Memorial Medical Center and you find yourself in a predicament where Memorial Medical Center is closer to your home in an emergency situation, you better check your policy. You might have just done something, by going to the wrong hospital, in the view of that insurance company, that is going to cost you and your family some money. That should be changed. 
   Basically, an individual in a family situation who has a medical necessity, a kid who has fallen down with a broken arm or something very serious should not have to fumble through the glove compartment to figure out which hospital to go to for emergency care. That is something we need to address. 
   The Patients' Bill of Rights proposed by the Democratic side is an attempt to try to address obvious inadequacies when it comes to health insurance and health care in America. I have given a couple of examples--coverage under a health insurance policy and the question of which emergency room you can use. There are many others. 
   For instance, most people believe when they sit down in the doctor's office, the doctor is being honest with them, the doctor is telling the truth, the doctor is giving his or her best medical judgment. In fact, that relationship and that conversation is really so honored in law, that in a courtroom it is considered a confidential relationship--the doctor-patient relationship. Yet, what has happened is there is another party in the room, although invisible. That other party is a bureaucrat from an insurance company. Many doctors, when they lean over the table and say, you know, I think this is what your son needs, or this is what your wife will need, are not giving you their best medical advice. They are telling you what the health insurance company will pay for and what it will not pay for. 
   One of the things we address in the Patients' Bill of Rights is ending this physician gag rule. Please, in America, allow doctors to practice medicine. Do not let clerks and insurance companies make crucial medical decisions. 
   The Illinois State Medical Society invited me several years ago to accompany a local doctor in Springfield, IL, to a hospital and spend a day making rounds. I was a little nervous about it because, frankly, I do not have any business in a hospital room unless I am being treated. But they invited me, and it turned out that most of the patients were happy to see a politician wandering around with their doctors. 
   But the thing that was an eye-opener at St. John's Hospital in Springfield was when the doctor I was accompanying decided he wanted to keep a patient in the hospital over the weekend. The lady was in her sixties. She had been diagnosed with a brain tumor that was causing her dizziness. She lived alone. 
   The doctor said: I'm afraid that if she went home over the weekend before the Monday surgery to remove the tumor, she might fall down and hurt herself. We would have to postpone the surgery. I want to keep her in the hospital so we can take care of her and watch her, and then on Monday perform the surgery. 
   I am a layman, but that sounded perfectly reasonable. 
   Before he could make that decision, though, he had to get on the phone and call a clerk at an insurance company in Omaha, NE. You know what the clerk said? ``No. Send her home. Tell her to come back Monday morning for the brain surgery.'' 
   This doctor could not believe it. He stood at this nurse's station, on that same floor, arguing with that clerk for half an hour. Finally, he slammed the phone down and said: I'm keeping this woman in the hospital. We'll appeal this later on. 
   What that doctor faced is repeated every day all across America where people who are sitting with these books of insurance regulations are making the decisions--the life-and-death decisions--that we count on when we take ourselves or our family in for medical care. 
   This has to come to an end. It has to change. We have to say, basically, that health insurance in this country is not going to be driven just by the bottom line in reducing costs, but by the top line of quality medical care; we are not going to take health care away from the professionals and give it to the insurance bureaucrats. 
   There is legislation pending before the Senate which engages this debate, which says this, the greatest deliberative body in America, is going to come down and debate, once and for all, how to make it right for American families. That bill is mired down in the process and cannot be brought to this floor. As a result, we stand before you today--and I know Senator DORGAN is going to address this as well--in frustration. 
   What is it we are doing here that is more important than making sure health insurance and health care in America is of the highest quality? We spent 5 days, 5 legislative days, debating the protection of computer companies. Well, it is an interesting challenge in terms of liability and their protection. Can't we spend 5 hours debating whether or not 150 million American families have health insurance protection? Isn't that worth our time and our debate? 
   Oh, there are differences of opinion here. I see things one way and some on the other side may see it another, but that is what the legislative process is about. Yet, we cannot seem to bring it to the floor so that we can have an honest debate to help America's families.  
   The other day I called on the Senate majority leader, the Republican leader, TRENT LOTT, to call up this bill before the Fourth of July. We have the bill out there. We know what the issues are. Let's have the debate. Yet, he was not sure he could. I hope he changes his mind. I hope those who were listening to this speech, and others, will decide that it is worth calling their Senators and their Congressmen and telling them: Yes, do something about health insurance. 
   Incidentally, in the case I mentioned earlier, where that 
   insurance company clerk told the doctor to send the lady home, that if that clerk guessed wrong, and that lady went home, fell down the stairs and had a serious injury, do you know who is liable for that? Do you know who would have to answer in court for that insurance clerk's decision? The doctor--not the insurance company, the doctor. 
   That is what is upside down, because in America we are all held accountable for our actions. But by a quirk in the Federal law, health insurance companies--many of them are not held accountable for their conduct, not held accountable for their decisions. 
   Are the doctors upset about this? Are hospitals upset? Wouldn't you be if you wanted to do the right thing for the patient, and the insurance company makes the decision, a wrong one, the patient is injured, and the person sued ends up being the doctor or the hospital? 
   Frankly, in this country we are all held accountable for our actions. Why should health insurance companies be any different? If they knew they had to answer for their decisions, I think they would make better decisions. I think they would be more sensitive and more responsive. That is one of the key areas of disagreement between Democrats and Republicans on this bill. 
   Should it be debated? I think so. I would like a vote on it. Let's decide whether health insurance companies shall be held accountable like every other company in America. For some reason, the leadership here in the Senate does not want us to debate this issue. That is a sad reality. 
   They have come up with a bill, incidentally, which really only covers a third of Americans who are covered by health insurance. So many other Americans just do not have a chance. 
   Let me give you an example of what I am talking about. If you worked for AT&T, you would be covered by the Republican bill; General Electric, covered by their bill; Wal-Mart, covered by their bill. But other small business employees would be left behind to fend for themselves. Family farmers--I have a lot of them in Illinois--they pay for their own insurance, they pay a lot for it; they would not be protected by the Republican bill. Public school teachers, policemen, women firefighters, in fact all State and local employees would not be covered by the bill that is being proposed by the Republicans. 
   This is worthy of a debate. Are we going to have a Patients' Bill of Rights that helps all Americans, or are we going to slice off a third of them and say: Well, we're worried about you; we're not worried about your neighbor? 
   That is worth a debate. That is worth a vote. What is holding this up? It is a decision by some that, before we take this issue under consideration, there has to be an agreement to limit the number of amendments. The Democratic leadership is prepared to limit those amendments. Let's bring it down to a 5-day debate or a 6-day debate. Let's go at it, and go at it seriously. 
   Yet, I think the underlying reason for the delay is something more serious. There is an old friend of mine and former boss, State Senator Cecil Partee of Chicago, IL, who used to say: In politics, for every decision there is a good reason and a real reason. Well, the good reason is the time of the Senate. The real reason is that many Senators on the other side of the aisle don't want to be forced to vote on some of these tough questions. The insurance companies tell them to vote one way, and they know that when they go back home they cannot explain that vote. That, to me, is the bottom line. 
   I mentioned the other day in debate a former Congressman, now passed away, a great friend of mine, Mike Synar, who was a Congressman from Oklahoma. He said: If you don't want to fight fires, don't be a fireman. If you don't want to vote on tough issues, don't be a Member of Congress. 
   These are tough issues, but they are important issues. The 
   American people deserve our best judgment in bringing this debate forward in a Patients' Bill of Rights, to bring it to the floor of the Senate. 
   Do you remember the debate on gun control? A lot of phony amendments were considered for a week. Finally, they were rejected and a real bill was passed. It is important to do the same thing with the Patients' Bill of Rights.

   Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield, I really have two questions. 
   First, related to the fact that we both have large rural populations in our State, as the Senator from North Dakota understands, the tax laws do not help family farmers pay for their health insurance as they should. We have worked together to try to have full deductibility of health insurance. The family farmer, self-employed person trying to get health insurance coverage has to pay more out of pocket than anyone who works for a corporation, for example, because of our tax laws. 
   We have the Republican version of this issue, the Patients' Bill of Rights, which doesn't cover these same family farmers and give them protection. So they pay more for their insurance, higher premiums. They pay more out of pocket for it and don't get protection from the Republican Patients' Bill of Rights, whereas the Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights provides this protection.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am happy to join my colleagues from California and Massachusetts. We were on the floor about a month ago and decided that we would like to have the Senate debate the gun issue. I remember the day very well. The majority leader, Senator LOTT, came to the floor and said: You will have your wish. In 2 weeks you will get a vote. 
   Most people view that as a very historic debate, as America was literally emotionally wrenched over the Littleton, CO, tragedy. 
   We, finally after a few weeks, addressed it on the floor of the Senate in a debate which culminated in the passage of sensible gun control legislation, when the Vice President of the United States, AL GORE, cast the deciding vote. 
   We come to the floor this evening, as we have before and will in the future, to urge the leadership of the Senate to again address the issue which is on the minds of American families nationwide. 
   Senator KENNEDY made an excellent point. We are blessed as Members of  the Senate. We are blessed by being considered Federal employees. As Federal employees, we have access to health care, which very few people in America have. 
   Imagine this for a moment. Once a year, we have open enrollment. We get to make a choice of medical plans. What do we want for our families? 
   There is a Congressman now who serves from the State of South Carolina in the House of Representatives who decided at age 60 that he wanted a lung transplant. He waited until open enrollment and enrolled in a plan which would cover a lung transplant for him at the age of 60. He signed up for it and went through the operation successfully, and still serves in the U.S. House of Representatives. This was 6 or 8 years ago. But he was able to shop for his health insurance. What a luxury. 
   How many Americans can do that? Those of us in the Senate and most Federal employees have that option. What we are talking about is giving this kind of protection and this kind of option to many different Americans when it comes to the quality of their own health care. 
   When we asked the Rand Corporation how important this issue is, they told us that 115 million Americans either have had a problem with their managed care insurance, or a member of their family has had a problem. This is a real concern. 
   Do you remember the movie ``As Good As It Gets'' with Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt? She was so good in that movie and had a little boy suffering from asthma. There was this great scene in the movie where Jack Nicholson decides to pay for a specialist to come see her little boy at their apartment. They are sitting at the table, and Helen Hunt decides to give, in her own earthy way, an expletive definition of managed care. In every movie theater that I have been to where that movie is shown the people started applauding. She knows what she is talking about. 
   Arbitrary decisions that are being made by bureaucrats and clerks in insurance companies are not good for you or your family. 
   Senator KENNEDY is talking about the Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights. Senator BOXER of California spelled out the difference between these two. 
   It gets down to some fundamental things. When you look at it, think about this. 
   An internist from my hometown of Springfield, IL, a town of about 110,000 people with two excellent hospitals comes in to talk to me. We are in a conversation. He says: You know, I am treating more and more patients for depression. It is something that seems to bother a lot of people, and thank goodness we have many ways to treat it with drugs and therapies that work. He says: You know, a lot of my patients are concerned if it gets into part of their medical record that they have been treated for chronic depression. He says: Of course, they know that if they are in a position where they have to apply for health insurance in the future they may be turned down because they have ``a mental illness,'' a chronic depression, a very common malady among American people. 
   Shouldn't we during the course of this debate on a Patients' Bill of Rights talk about this kind of prejudice and discrimination against people who have chronic depression? This is something that affects every family. It could. 
   When we talk about access to health care--Senator KENNEDY made this point, and Senator BOXER as well--the difference between the Republican plan and the Democratic plan is graphic. The Republican plan excludes more than 100 million Americans from protections we are talking about. They cover people that are in a self-funded employer health insurance plan, about 48 million Americans. But look who is left behind--15 million Americans buying individual policies, 23 million State and local government workers, 75 million people whose employers provide coverage through an insurance policy, or an HMO, 75 million people written out of the Republican plan. They leave behind 113 million Americans. 
   If we are talking about a real bill that addresses the concern of real American families, it should include all.

   Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts. His point is well taken. 
   Before we end this debate, let's stop talking about health for a minute and let's talk about politics. 
   If this is such an important issue, and the debate on this issue is really one where we could have some debates, why are we not considering it on the floor of the Senate? 
   We spent 5 days debating protection for computer companies against lawsuits--5 days to protect these computer companies. It is an important debate. Can't we spend 5 hours talking about protecting American families when it comes to their health insurance? We are afraid of amendments, the Republicans say. We want to make sure that we have a limited number of amendments--no more than 20 on the side. In fact, that may be too many. 
   As Senator KENNEDY said, on the next bill we will consider there are over 50 amendments. We haven't disqualified that bill from consideration. We understand that it is important that we do our business and debate these things and vote on them. 
   The bottom line here is that there are Members on the other side of the aisle who do not want to face votes on these issues. They don't want to have to go home and explain why they stood with the insurance companies and voted against the people they are supposed to represent--the families, the consumers, those who are literally worried on a day-to-day basis as to whether they have health insurance protection. 
   I think, frankly, they have to face their responsibility on this side of the aisle as we do on our side of the aisle, a responsibility to face a tougher vote, make a choice, go home, and defend your vote. That is the nature of this government. 
   For them to try to construct some sort of a strategy on the floor to protect themselves from criticism is at the expense of the families across America who do not have adequate health insurance and expect Congress to do something to protect them.

   Mr. DURBIN. Every one of us as individuals and businesses can be held accountable for our actions. That is understandable. You go out and drink too much, drive a car, get in an accident, and you might be sued. There are two groups, though, that are spared this: foreign diplomats and health insurance companies. 
   Why in the world would we carve out this kind of protection from liability for this group of health insurance companies? If they make the wrong decision on coverage, and it is your child who ends up not getting adequate care, or getting a bad medical result, who should be held responsible--the doctor, the hospital, or the insurance company that made the basic decision? I think the insurance company should. 
   Frankly, if they are held accountable, they will think twice about making the wrong decision. They will make certain that children have access to specialists they need, that people can go to emergency rooms close to home, and when there is a medical necessity there is a continuity of care. 
   If your employer changes health insurance, you have an opportunity to keep that doctor who is so important to you. 
   One of the most humbling experiences in my life--in the life of virtually anyone--is to sit in a waiting room in a hospital waiting to hear about the surgery on your child. Senator KENNEDY has been through that. I have been through that. It is something I will never forget. You realize that everything you hold dear and close is in the hands of people you have to trust to be the very best specialists, well-trained medical technicians trying to save or improve the life of someone you love so very much. 
   I think at those moments in our life when we are so vulnerable and pray that we have the very best and brightest helping our children and helping members of the family we love so much, to do the job and do the right thing and bring them home, we need to have the confidence that we have a system that works. 
   Over 100 million Americans today question whether this system works. They question whether that doctor they want to trust can tell them everything they need to know. They question whether that hospital making a decision can make that decision without worrying about some insurance clerk in some faraway city. 
   If we do nothing else in the 106th Congress, shouldn't we address this basic gut issue that American families worry about on a day-to-day basis? The 105th Congress came and went with a record no one remembers. This Congress has a chance to act. We may debate a lot of things on the floor of the Senate, but if we don't take up this very fundamental issue, we are missing our responsibility. 
   This Congress should not be toiling in an atmosphere of partisanship. It shouldn't be afraid to face tough issues. It should come forward and vote for the Patients' Bill of Rights, as Senator KENNEDY and Senator BOXER have said, to make sure families across America receive the protection they deserve.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in summary, I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bipartisan legislation. I am also proud to be a member of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Governmental Affairs Committee, which Senator COLLINS chairs. This has been one of the best assignments I have had in the Senate because Senator COLLINS is not afraid to tackle tough issues. We have gone after the issue of food safety with fascinating hearings which I believe will lead to improving America's food supply and really protecting America's families. 
   She has shown extraordinary courage in addressing this issue of Medicare fraud. Frankly, it took a very good investigative team and her determination to bring us to this moment where this legislation is being introduced. 
   Mr. President, 39 million Americans rely on Medicare. If you have a parent or grandparent who is elderly or disabled, they may view Medicare as their health insurance plan. Without it, think where America would be if elderly people and disabled folks had to rely on their own resources to pay for their medical care. 
   We pay a great deal of money each year in America to keep Medicare, this health insurance plan, solvent and working; about $218 billion a year. What Senator COLLINS is addressing is the fact that we know for a fact that each year we waste anywhere from $13 billion to $21 billion a year. You say: How does that happen? Is it a matter of the bureaucrats moving the paper around, and they get it wrong? No, for the most part, it comes down to people who are setting out to intentionally defraud the Government, and they are so good at it, we lose at least $35 million a day--a day--to these smoothies, these swindlers, these con artists who prey upon the Medicare system as an open pot of money they can reach into and grab. 
   When Senator COLLINS' investigators went out, they found that some of the people who claimed to be providing medical services and medical equipment do not even exist. The addresses they gave, when we traced them, turned out, if they were true addresses, would be smack dab in the middle of a runway at the Miami International Airport, and no one checked up on it. Year after year, we send out money automatically to these folks without verification. 
   The legislation I am introducing with Senator COLLINS will really put some teeth in the law and say we are not going to tolerate this anymore. The  money that is being taken out of this program is at the expense of the elderly and disabled and certainly at the expense of America's taxpayers. 
   Can I give one illustration of this? Nursing homes provide care for elderly people who suffer from incontinency. It is something which happens to many older folks. Nursing homes are supposed to provide adult diapers for seniors who find themselves in this predicament. However, one of the groups that we discovered decided they would try to invent a way to bill the Federal Government for these 30-cent diapers that are needed for elderly people, so they changed the name of the diaper to ``female urinary collection device'' and billed the Federal Government $8 an item: a 30-cent diaper, billed them $8--clearly fraudulent, taking money right out of the Treasury, money that, frankly, should be there for the real needs of senior citizens. 
   The stories go on and on. With this bill, we try to step forward and say we are going to put an end to it or at least reduce it dramatically. We are going to create incentives for people who take the time, as many seniors should with the help of their families, to go through their medical bills. Really, that is the first line of defense. When a senior under Medicare receives a medical bill, I know it has to be a challenge--it is for me and I am an attorney--they should go through it page by page and look for things that do not make sense. When they discover these things and call into the hotline under Medicare, we can many times track down abuses and fraud and help not only that senior, but every senior and Americans in general. 
   I salute the Senator from Maine. Her leadership on this issue is absolutely essential.

    Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to recognize Ms. Shirley Cochran, a person who has made a significant contribution to the education of our children. 
   Ms. Cochran's outstanding efforts during her 28 years as a special educator have helped countless individuals live productive, successful lives. In her  current position at the Camelot Care Center in Palatine, IL, she continues to assist students who have enrolled to get the special attention they need. Ms. Cochran's kindness and commitment are commendable. 
   As an educator with an undergraduate degree in psychology and a master's degree in special education, Ms. Cochran is well-equipped to serve as a teacher and administrator. But it is her genuine kindness, sincerity, and devotion to her students that make her the remarkable educator she has proven to be throughout the past 28 years. 
   Ms. Cochran is an example of professional dedication for all teachers in the state of Illinois and the nation. I congratulate her on her years of educational achievement, and wish her the best of luck in the years to come.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I think most of those who are following the activities on Capitol Hill understand that we are awaiting action in the other body, the House of Representatives, on a measure that was passed here several weeks ago concerning gun safety. This is a measure which received a bipartisan vote, a tie vote on the floor of the Senate, a tie that was broken by Vice President GORE. That issue, which reached, I guess, the highest level of national consciousness, came in the wake of the Littleton, CO, tragedy. 
   I think most Members of Congress thought we on Capitol Hill had to listen to the families across America who were asking us to do something to make life safer for our school children. The Senate responded. After a week-long debate, we passed legislation and sent it to the House of Representatives--modest steps but important steps in sensible gun control. 
   It is our hope that the House meets its obligation, passes legislation, and we can achieve something this year on the important issue of safety in our schools. This respite that we currently enjoy, because of summer vacation, should not lull us into a false sense of security about school safety. 
   Sadly, the names of towns across America remind us that we have a national problem: Conyers, GA; Littleton, CO; Jonesboro, AR; West Paducah, KY; Pearl, MS; Springfield, OR. The list goes on, sadly, to include too many towns, many of which I am sure we would never have guessed would be the site or scene of violence in a school. It has become a national problem. 
   I hope this Congress, which has done precious little in the last few months, can respond to this issue of school safety and do it quickly. We would be remiss to believe the response to that issue satisfies the needs of the American people as they look to Congress for leadership. 
   There is an area which most Americans understand and appreciate that, frankly, we have failed to address over the last several years. I refer, of course, to the whole question of the Patients' Bill of Rights and whether or not we, as a Congress, will respond to the need to do something about the state of health insurance in America. 
   We all know what has happened. There was a debate several years ago, when the Clinton administration first came in, over whether we would do health care reform. That debate broke down on Capitol Hill when the insurance industry spent literally millions of dollars in advertising against any kind of reform. We stopped in place. We did nothing on Capitol Hill. 
   Families across America, as they look at the changing landscape of health insurance, might assume we passed some sweeping Federal legislation. We did not. What happened was, there were dramatic changes in the private sector without any impetus from legislation on Capitol Hill. Those changes started moving more and more Americans into what is now euphemistically called managed care. Managed care, of course, is a health insurance approach that is designed to bring down costs. I do not argue with the fact that it has brought down costs in some areas. What I argue with is whether or not we have paid too high a price for those costs to be brought down and whether there is a more sensible way to address it. 
   It is estimated that by 1996, 75 percent of employees with employer-provided health insurance were covered by managed care. 
   I have traveled around Illinois. I will bet Senators visiting their home States would find the same thing that I did. I visited hospitals in cities and rural areas. I invited doctors and medical professionals to come to the cafeteria and sit around a table and talk about health insurance. I didn't know if any doctors would take time out of their busy day for that purpose, but they did. 
   In fact, in one hospital, as we were sitting in a cafeteria discussing the issue, all of the doctors' beepers went off. There was a crisis in the emergency room, and they all left. They returned about 45 minutes later, still anxious to carry on the conversation. What these doctors talked to me about was the changing environment in medical care in this country and their concern as to whether or not they could do the right job professionally. 
   And it wasn't just the doctor's concern. I have heard the same thing from families all across Illinois, and we have heard it across the Nation. 
   Too many people worry that when they go into a doctor's office with a medical problem, or with a member of their family who is ill, they aren't getting straight talk. They expect doctors to tell them honestly what the options are, the best course of treatment, the best hospital, the best specialist. Unfortunately, because of managed care, there is another party involved in this conversation. It is no longer just the doctor and the patient, or the doctor and the parent of an ailing child; there is also some clerk at an insurance company who is party to that conversation. They might not be sitting at the examining table, but most doctors, before they can recommend anything for a patient, have to get on a phone and call some invisible clerk hundreds, if not thousands, of miles away for approval. 
   Let me tell you a real life story by a doctor. The doctor said that a mother came in with a young boy and said, ``My son has complained of headaches  for months.'' The doctor said, ``Are they in one particular part of his head?'' She said, ``Yes; on the left side. He always complains about headaches on the left side of his head.'' 
   The doctor thought to himself that there was a possibility that this could be a tumor if the child continued to complain about headaches on one side of his head. So he thought that perhaps he needed some diagnostic treatment--an MRI, CAT scan, or something to tell him whether or not there was the presence of a tumor. 
   Before he said those words to the mother, he excused himself. He took a copy of her chart and looked up the insurance company and had his secretary call so he could ask the clerk at the insurance company whether or not he could tell this mother they could go ahead with this diagnostic treatment to determine the nature of the child's problem. 
   The clerk on the other side of the telephone said, ``No, it is not covered; you can't do that.'' The doctor said to the clerk, ``What am I supposed to do?'' The clerk said, ``Tell the mother to go home and wait and come back at a later time if the problem is still there.'' 
   That doctor walked back into the room with the mother present and said, ``I think you should go home and wait and call me in a few weeks if things have not changed.'' He could not, under his contract with the insurance company, even tell the mother why he had been overruled on his course of treatment. That is what is known as a ``physician's gag rule.'' 
   What that means for too many Americans is that when you sit across the table from a doctor, you are never certain whether that doctor is telling you everything you ought to know. When we erode the basic confidence in the relationship between a doctor and a patient, we have gone a long way in this country in undermining quality health care, which has been one of the hallmarks of America. The physician-patient relationship is so sacred under the law that it is recognized in court as a special, confidential relationship. Yet that very relationship is being undermined because of this fact. 
   Managed care restricts a doctor's right to decide and his or her right to even tell you why he has made a certain decision. 
   That is not the end of it by a long shot. In addition, many managed care policies restrict the hospitals to which patients can go. I belong to a managed care plan in Springfield, IL. We have two excellent hospitals, but my plan really focuses on one hospital and says, you will go to this hospital to the exclusion of the other hospital, or it will cost you. It is not a big problem where I live, because the hospitals are a few blocks from one another. But in some areas of urban America, and in rural America, it can be a problem. 
   In what way? Well, consider this. You are in your backyard at a family picnic for the Fourth of July, and the kids are playing around, as I just went through with Memorial Day at a family get-together. They are climbing trees, and a child falls out of a tree and starts crying, and there is fear that he might have broken his arm, or worse. They take off for the emergency room. 
   But wait. Before you take off for the nearest emergency room, you had better ask yourself: Does my health insurance policy cover emergency care at that hospital? Do I have to drive across town or to some other hospital under the terms of my policy? It makes no sense. If there is a situation of medical necessity to protect your child or a member of your family, you should not have to fumble around and try to remember which hospital is covered by your plan. Instead, you should do what is right for your family. That is one of the elements I think many people are concerned about when it comes to this whole question of managed care. 
   There is also a question about the cost of this managed care and the accessibility of this care for many employees. It is a fact of life in America that each year fewer and fewer working families in America have the benefit of health insurance 
   protection. Fewer and fewer employers are offering it. We are drifting away from our goal of universal health coverage and leaving more and more Americans vulnerable. That is a classic example of what is wrong with our system today, an instance of what we need to do in order to make certain that every American has the peace of mind to know they have health insurance coverage.

   Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator for that question. 
   Sadly, the Senator's experience can be repeated in almost every State under managed care plans. What we are trying to provide in the Patients' Bill of Rights, supported by the Democratic side, is a continuity of care and access to specialists when needed. I think that just makes common sense. I can't imagine anyone, such as this lady the Senator mentioned, or others, who would want to compromise the best care possible to make sure they are taken care of. 
   Here is another example you are probably aware of. Many times, companies will change managed care plans. Someone who, for example, is going through cancer therapy and believes they have good, quality care that is very promising in terms of full recovery may find a change in managed care plans which makes that doctor, that clinic, or that hospital ineligible. So that is another area where, frankly, we want to restore peace of mind among the people across America--that they would have this kind of access, access with continuity--even if a change in plan has taken place through the employer. 
   This access to needed specialists becomes equally important, because most managed care plans have what they call gatekeepers. These gatekeepers are general practitioners, family internists, and the like who try to decide whether or not you need a specialist. Many specialists have come to me and said they have limited training, but they have specialized training. And they are encouraged to pass them along the chain to a specialist who might be initially more expensive but, frankly, might save that patient a lot of worry, perhaps suffering, and perhaps provide a cure that might not otherwise be available.  
   That is the kind of thing that I think families across America are concerned about. 
   They look at Capitol Hill and say: Do you get it up there? Do you understand? These are things our families worry about when we think we have the protection of health insurance, and, yet, we are so vulnerable. What are you doing about it in Washington? 
   The honest answer is, we have done nothing. 
   The question is, before we leave town this year, perhaps even this month, whether or not we can bring up this bill, the Patients' Bill of Rights, and address some of the real family concerns we have run into.

   Mr. DURBIN. It is. I was in Joliet, IL, at a hospital cafeteria, sitting at a table full of doctors. One of the doctors was so angry because he kept getting this clerk on the phone: No, that patient can't be admitted. He finally said to the voice on the other end of the phone: Are you a doctor? The employee of the insurance company said no. Well, are you a nurse? No. Well, are you a college graduate? No. How can you possibly overrule my decision on treating a patient? She said: I am going by the book. 
   She had a book in front of her that had the complaints that a person might register and whether or not a treatment was warranted. 
   That medical care has now been reduced to the level that we have people who are reading books and overruling doctors who have been trained gives everyone concern. 
   One of the reasons we need to bring up this Patients' Bill of Rights is to make sure that doctors and medical care personnel across the country can make the best professional decision for the people they treat--a decision based on a person's health and their well-being as opposed to the bottom line profit margin of the insurance company that is involved in it.

   Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from New York. The history of the legislation has been frustrating, because we came close to debating it last year, then it fell apart. 
   There are two different points of view: The Republican side of the aisle, not exclusively but by and large, has their own approach. The Democratic side of the aisle has its own 
   approach on the Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   We would like to bring this out for a debate. Let's have a debate. Let's act as a legislative body, as we did during the gun debate. Let's let the American people in on it. Let's let them hear arguments over the amendments on one side and then the other, and let them join us in this decision-making process. Unfortunately, that broke down last year and there has been no evidence of an effort to revive it this year. 
   We need to remember that in a few weeks, literally, we will all be heading home for the 4th of July recess, then for the August recess, and many people will say to us: Incidentally, what have you done? What is happening in Washington? If we can't point to real-life issues that families care about, they have a right to be upset and wonder if we are doing our job. 
   So I say to the Senator from New York, precious little has been done on this subject. But we are prepared to go forward with debate. I think that is what this body is supposed to be all about--the world's most deliberative body, the Senate. 
   Let's not be afraid of amendments. Let's not be afraid of votes. I invite the Members on the other side of the aisle to join us. Let's put the issue on the floor. Let's come to some conclusion, send the bill on to the House and challenge them to do the same thing, bring the President into the conversation, and say to the American people that we are doing what you sent us to Washington to do--to respond to things that people really care about.

   Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from New York. 
   We just spent 5 days debating whether or not certain computer companies should be protected from liability on Y2K problems. That is a serious issue. It is a bill that we passed today. We spent 5 days debating it. I think we owe the American people to spend at least 5 days, if not more, debating the Patients' Bill of Rights. We have the time to do it. We don't have an overload of activity in the Senate, but we have an overload of responsibility when it comes to the health care issue. 
   The last point I will make before giving up the floor is on the question of liability. Remember the example I used earlier about the doctor who couldn't tell the mother that it wasn't his decision that her son couldn't have an MRI or CAT scan. He couldn't tell her. It was the insurance company's decision. 
   Let's assume for a minute that something terrible occurred, and that child  didn't have a brain tumor, and in fact suffered some long illness, or recuperation, or maybe worse. Do you know that under current law, as written, in many of these managed care plans, even though the insurance company made the bad decision, the insurance company overruled the doctor, the insurance company could not be held accountable for its wrongdoing in America? 
   There are very few groups that are immune from liability. I think foreign diplomats are one. When it comes to this issue of managed care and insurance companies, many doctors are saying: That is not fair; we want to make the right medical decision, and we are overruled by the insurance company. The doctors get sued. The insurance companies are off the hook. 
   That is not what this system or what this Government is all about. It is about accountability. I am held accountable for my actions as the driver of a car, as the owner of a home--all sorts of different things. Why should we exempt health insurance companies and say they are not going to be held liable for bad decisions--decisions not to refer you to the right specialist, decisions not to allow you to stay in a hospital, decisions not to allow you the kind of care you need? 
   That, to me, is the bottom line in this debate. 
   I see Senator KENNEDY on the floor. He has been a leader on this issue. I thank him for joining in this discussion. I hope he can give Members some instruction. 
   I yield to the Senator for a question.

   I think the Senator's question is rhetorical. But if we can spend 5 days debating protection for computer companies, can't we spend 5 days debating protection for America's families concerned about the quality of the health care available to them and their children? 
   I think that is obvious. I think the Senator has clearly made the point about the number of groups that endorse the Democratic approach to that, that they could and should have that kind of debate. 
   I see the minority leader on the floor, and I am happy to yield.

   Mr. DURBIN. I have had a similar experience. Not only is this an important issue, the human side is compelling. We hear the stories from the Senators from New York and Massachusetts, and we have run into these real-life stories. These are not the kinds of stories you dream up or see on television. 
   People worry on a day-to-day basis whether they can protect themselves and their own families under this managed care Patients' Bill of Rights, on which Senator DASCHLE is the lead sponsor. It gives a framework to give assurance to these people so they can have confidence that not only good health care will be there but quality health care that will help respond to a lot of the family tragedies which we hear over and over as we travel about our States. 
   The other side of the aisle makes a serious mistake if they do not understand this is a very bipartisan issue. I am just not hearing from Democrats or Independents; I am hearing from Republicans and Democrats and Independents alike. All families are in the same predicament. All families look to the Senate to focus on this issue, which means so much to the future of this country.

   Mr. DURBIN. I agree with the Senator from Massachusetts. Isn't it an interesting analogy to the debate we had on guns, where we had amendments coming before us, and when the public had a chance to take a look at it they were satisfied that amendment does not achieve the result we want, keeping schools safer and guns out of the hands of children and criminals? The debate ensued for the week we were on it, and when it was all over the public prevailed. They passed a real sensible gun control bill as opposed to one that did not do the job. 
   I think what the Senator from Massachusetts says is let's let the American public in on this debate, too. Do they think covering one out of three families is enough, or do we want to make sure we have a bill similar to the Democrats' Patients' Bill of Rights which really provides protection and assurance of quality health care for the vast majority of families under managed care plans? I think the Senator is right. That deserves to be debated on the floor of the Senate.

   Mr. DURBIN. I say, reclaiming my time, one of my colleagues and friends from the home State of the Senator from Oklahoma, the late Congressman Mike Synar, used to say: If you don't want to fight fires, don't be a fireman. If you don't want to cast tough votes, don't be a Member of Congress. 
   I think we ought to welcome the possibility of having some tough votes on amendments. Let the Democrats squirm, let the Republicans squirm, and let the body work its will. Don't be afraid of some amendments. Let's bring out the best ideas on both sides and see if we can craft it together in a bipartisan bill. 
   If we limit this debate to a few days or a certain number of amendments, there is no reason why we should not be able to accomplish this in the next week or two. Insulating Members from casting a tough vote on what might be a difficult amendment really should not be our goal. The goal should be the very best legislation and the body working its will. If we have an up-or-down vote, take it or leave it, that is an odd way for the Senate to view this issue.

   Mr. DURBIN. Because many people think this is a debate between the computer and software companies versus the trial lawyers; choose whose side you are going to be on. People forget we are talking about the consumers of the products, the people who buy computers and software. These are businesses, too. These are doctors and manufacturers and retail merchants who rely on computers to work. 
   This bill basically says, if you bought a computer that, it turns out, stops working come January 1 in the year 2000, we are going to limit your ability to recover for wrongdoing by the person who sold it to you. We will limit it. Unlike any other category of defendants in American courts, save one that I can think of, we are going to say this is a special class of people; those who make computers and software are not going to be held accountable like the people who make automobiles, and the folks who make equipment, the folks who make virtually everything in the world, including all of us. 
   Everybody gathered here in this Chamber can be held liable in court for our wrongdoing. If we make a mistake, we can be brought before a jury, and they can decide whether our mistake caused someone damage. This bill says: Wait a minute, special class of Americans here. American corporations that make computers and software shall not be held liable, or at least if they are going to be held liable, under limited circumstances. 
   So the losers in this process are not trial lawyers. The losers are other businesses that say, January 2, wait a minute, this computer is not working. I can't make a profit. I have hundreds of employees who counted on this, and now what am I supposed to do? 
   I say to the Senator from California, thank you for this amendment. 
   A couple questions. You make a point here that if we are going to generalize and say, well, there may be some bad actors in this industry that sold defective products, that we are going to, in fact, absolve all manufacturers, it is a disservice to the companies which in good faith have been doing everything in their power to bring everything up to speed. Just to make this point, is it the Senator's point that we do not want to favor those bad actors at the expense of so many good actors from Silicon Valley and across the world?

   Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield, I am curious. I ask the Senator for her reaction on this. What if we said, instead of computers, we are going to deal with airplanes this way. If we said we do not want people who make airplanes to be held liable if they fall out of the sky, America would say that is crazy, that is ridiculous. We, of course, want to hold the manufacturers of products where we have a lot at stake to a standard of care. 
   If you were going to absolve them, insulate them, then, frankly, as a consumer I am going to have second thoughts about getting on the airplane. 
   I think what the Senator is saying with her amendment is those companies that have done the right thing,  have established their reputation for integrity by stepping forward and saying we are solving the Y2K problem, certified, as the gentleman from Dell Computer did with the SEC, these companies that have gone that extra mile and want to stand behind that reputation will actually be penalized by this bill, because, frankly, all their hard work is not only being ignored, it is being defied. 
   They are saying: We have to carve out a special treatment here for those who didn't do a good job as businesspeople. 
   Coming back to the point I made earlier, the victims here are not trial lawyers. The victims are businesses, small businesses as well as medium-size businesses, trying to keep their employees at work, worrying that January 2 of the year 2000, they are going to have to close down and send people home 
   without a paycheck. Those are the folks disadvantaged by the broad sweep of this bill. 
   I think the Senator from California is on the right track. The good actors, the ones that have worked hard to make this work, should be rewarded. Those that have not should not be protected by the National Association of Manufacturers, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and all of the interests that have come in here and said, let us provide special treatment for those that have not met their responsibility.

   Mr. DURBIN. We are talking about small and medium-sized businesses, dependent on computers, that discover, January 2, the year 2000, they have a serious problem. 
   What the Senator from California is suggesting is, if it is an old computer, one that goes back over 5 years, they would have to pay the cost of whatever the repair; if it has been purchased in the last 5 years--a period of time when everyone generally sensed this problem was coming--the computer company would fix it without charge. 
   A lot of businesses would retain the ability to keep going, making their products and keeping their people working. 
   This is not just proconsumer, this is probusiness. It troubles me to see so many business groups lined up against this amendment. It seems to me counterintuitive. 
   I think what the Senator from California is doing is showing sensitivity that virtually all friends of business should show in this legislation.

   Mr. DURBIN. As I look at this legislation which we are considering, the underlying bill, it is hard to argue with it. It starts out saying: 
   The majority of responsible business enterprises in the 
   United States are committed to working in cooperation with their contracting partners towards the timely and cost-effective resolution of the many technological, business and legal issues associated with the Y2K date change. 
   That is the first paragraph of this bill. It is a perfect description of the Senator's amendment, because it says responsible businesses will be working to solve problems. In my colleague's situation, she is providing a means of resolving the problem short of going to court. That is what this is all about.

   Mr. DURBIN. So those who are truly interested in the damage done to businesses must really step back and say the BOXER amendment is one that really addresses the damage that businesses will face--repeating, again: These are businesses depending on computers that may shut down because the computer they purchased is not proper, is not ready to deal with the new century. 
   That is what this legislation, the amendment, is all about: Find a way to help these people stay in business. Responsible businesses dealing with responsible businesses, not racing off to court, not playing with lawyers. I am stunned that at this point the amendment by the Senator from California just has not been adopted. It troubles me when I think about it in the context of the underlying bill. 
   If the people who are bringing this bill to the floor do not care that much about small and medium-sized businesses that will face the delays, face the layoffs, because of Y2K problems, this is not a probusiness bill. This is for an elite group of bad actors in an industry who have not done their homework and do not want to be held responsible for their bad conduct. That, to me, is not what we should be doing on the floor of the Senate. 
   I think the Senator from California, when you take a look at the first paragraph of this bill, really has an amendment that addresses the bottom line.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I wish to engage the distinguished Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee and the Defense Subcommittee, Senator STEVENS, in a brief colloquy regarding the Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps program (JROTC). 
   As Chairman STEVENS may know, the Chicago Public Schools have developed and implemented a very successful JROTC program. Since the program began, it has served over 7,500 cadets from all four branches of the armed services and helped these students achieve better grades, attendance, conduct, and higher graduation rates. The Chicago Public Schools are now in need of expanding the successful JROTC program to an additional 10 high schools, including the Chicago Military Academy at Bronzeville. And, they are attempting to enter partnerships with all of the branches of the armed services in order to better serve interested students. 
   The Senate bill includes an increase for JROTC of $3.5 million. Is it the understanding of Chairman STEVENS that successful programs like the one in Chicago should be able to work with the Department of Defense and the various branches to receive funding?

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I wish to engage the distinguished Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee and the Defense Subcommittee, Senator STEVENS, in a brief colloquy regarding distance learning. 
   As Chairman STEVENS may know, the City Colleges of Chicago Europe has been providing college degree and certificate programs to the U.S. military service members and their families in Europe since 1969. In fact, the City Colleges of Chicago was one of the early pioneers in distance learning. Today, the program offers over 70 courses on the Internet and provides interactive television courses via satellite to U.S. peacekeeping forces stationed in the Sinai Desert, Bosnia, and Hungary. 
   The Senate bill includes an increase for distance learning of $45 million. Is it the understanding of Chairman STEVENS that successful programs like the City Colleges of Chicago Europe should be able to work with the Department of Defense to receive funding?

    Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to make my colleagues aware of the accomplishments of an outstanding Illinois citizen. This Thursday, June 10, Ira P. Weinstein will turn 80. As we celebrated Memorial Day just a week ago, I think it is appropriate to mention Mr. Weinstein's service to our country as it is a constant reminder that without the dedication and bravery of so many like him, the freedom we are privileged to enjoy could not be possible. 
   Born in Chicago, Illinois on June 10, 1919, Mr. Weinstein entered the U.S. Army Air Corps in 1942, just as America was being drawn into World War II. Trained as a Navigator-Bombardier, Mr. Weinstein rose to the rank of First Lieutenant and proceeded to fly 25 missions during World War II as a member of the 8th Air Force 445 Bomb Group, 702nd Squadron. Although the 24 previous missions he flew had been safe ones, Mr. Weinstein's 25th would be his most harrowing. 
   On September 27, 1944, Mr Weinstein's plane was shot down over Germany during the Kassell Mission. As he parachuted to the ground, Mr. Weinstein found safety and eluded capture for six days. Unfortunately, he was found by the enemy and held as a Prisoner of War in Stalag Luft I, in Barth, Germany. On May 11, 1945, the camp where Mr. Weinstein was held was liberated, ending an eight-month ordeal as a POW. For his heroism, Mr. Weinstein was awarded several distinguished service medals. These include the Purple Heart, the Air Medal, the POW Medal, a Presidential Citation, the American Campaign and European Campaign Medals, the WW II Victory Medal, and the distinguished French Croix de Guerre. 
   After returning from the war, Mr. Weinstein, like so many others of his generation, went on to become accomplished in the world of business, building a successful advertising agency respected throughout the Chicago area. Despite the loss of his wife several years ago, Mr. Weinstein, now retired, enjoys being a grandfather and takes special pride in his expertise as a horticulturist. 
   I am pleased to take this opportunity today to honor an American hero and one of my constituents. As we did one week ago today, we should not hesitate to honor our defenders of freedom every day as we enjoy the liberty they fought so hard to protect.

    Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to share a letter I received from my constituent, Ms. Shirley Roney of Bonnie, Illinois. Ms. Roney shared with me a letter she wrote to President Clinton on behalf of her grandmother, Vaneeta Allen. This ``Letter from a Nursing Home'' reminds us of some of the important issues many American families face every day. 
   Long-term care is a serious concern for many elderly and disabled Americans. Too many of our citizens face losing everything they have worked their whole lives for, just so they can pay for nursing home care. Medicare was not designed to provide coverage for long-term care, and long-term care insurance is often unavailable due to preexisting medical conditions, or it is out of financial reach for seniors. We must continue to explore other options to assist those like Vaneeta Allen who must rely on nursing home care. 
   This letter does not have all of the answers, but we will never have the answers if we lose sight of the struggles and simple dignity of people like Mrs. Allen.

   Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Washington, as well as the Senator from Maine, for offering this amendment, which I will support. I join in saying what the Senator from New Hampshire said earlier. Senator SMITH suggested this is not a debate in which we are anxious to get involved. It is a very controversial issue, deeply felt on both sides. I respect the Senator from New Hampshire and his personal views on this, as I respect those who support my position in offering a vote in favor of this amendment. 
   Let me say a few things that need to be cleared up. The Senator from New Hampshire said repeatedly that this process uses taxpayer dollars to pay for abortion. Of course, that is a flash point. When people hear that, they say: Wait, I don't think we ought to spend taxpayer dollars on that. Maybe people want to do that personally. 
   Senator MURRAY addressed that point. Her amendment makes it clear that these procedures are to be paid for by the servicewoman out of her pocket at a cost that is assessed for the procedure itself. There are no taxpayer dollars involved in this. This amendment is clear. 
   Secondly, the Senator from New Hampshire says this does not abide by the Hyde amendment. The Hyde amendment, as important as it is, does not override Roe v. Wade. The Hyde amendment limits abortions to those cases involving the life of the mother. But the procedure now on military bases goes beyond the Hyde amendment. The procedure on military bases today says if there is an endangerment of the woman's life, she can have the abortion performed at a military hospital at Government expense. If she is a victim of rape or incest, she can have an abortion performed at a military hospital at her own expense. 
   We are talking about the other universe of possibilities out there. Senator BOXER of California really poses an interesting challenge to us: Two women, under the supervision of the Government of the United States of America, both of them pregnant, both of them wanting to end the pregnancy with a procedure. In one case, we say if you have the money, we will escort you to a safe and legal clinic in America for the performance of this procedure. In the other case, we say if you have the money, you have to fend for yourself; you cannot use a safe and legal clinic or military hospital. 
   What is the difference? The first woman is a prisoner in the Federal Prison System. For her, we have an escort committee. But for the woman who has volunteered to serve the United States to defend our country and she is in the same circumstance, we say: You're on your own; go out in this country, wherever it might be, and try to find someone who will perform this procedure safely and legally. 
   Whether you are for abortion or against it, simple justice requires us to apply it equally and not to discriminate against those women who are serving in the American military. That is what it comes down to. 
   The Senator from Oklahoma said abortion is not a fringe benefit. He is right. But health care is a fringe benefit that most Americans enjoy, and many hospitalization insurance policies cover abortion procedures. We do not cover them when it comes to the women who serve in the U.S. military. Abortion is not a fringe benefit; abortion is a constitutional right. If that constitutional right means anything, we should support the Murray-Snowe amendment.

It is interesting to note that last year when a similar amendment was called on the defense appropriation bill, offered by a gentleman in the House, David Skaggs, only 15 Members of the Senate voted in favor of it, including the Senator from Pennsylvania, the Senator from Delaware, myself, and a handful of others. It will be interesting to see 
   this debate now in the context of a real conflict. 
   I have seen a copy of this amendment, and I want to understand the full clarity and intention of the Senator. As I understand it, there are two paragraphs offered as part of this amendment. They use different language in each paragraph. I wish the Senator would clarify.

   Mr. DURBIN. I think it might be. I ask the Senator a second question. Would he not want to make an exception, as well, for the rescue of the NATO forces in Yugoslavia if we would perhaps have a downed flier and ground troops could be sent in for rescue, and that would not require congressional authorization. I think that would be consistent with the Senator's earlier statements about the emergency authority of the President as Commander in Chief.

Last, I will ask the Senator from Pennsylvania, if this requires a joint resolution, under the rules of the Senate,  Members in a filibuster, a minority, say, 41 Senators, could stop us from ever taking action on this measure. How would the Senator from Pennsylvania respond to that? Does that, in effect, give to a minority the authority to stop the debate and a vote by the Senate and thereby tie the President's hands when it comes to committing ground troops, should we ever reach the point where that is necessary?

I certainly believe, as he does, that the Congress should make that decision and not the President unilaterally. He has promised to come to us for that decision to be made. I hope Mr. Milosevic and those who follow this debate don't take any comfort in this. We are speaking only to the question of the authority of Congress, not as to any actual decision of whether we will ever commit to ground troops. I think that is the sense of the Senator from Pennsylvania. I thank him for offering the amendment, and I support this important amendment.

   Mr. DURBIN. I would like to first commend the Senator from New Hampshire. I was visited in my office by a gentleman named Michael Kuryla, Jr., of Poplar Grove, IL, one of the survivors of the U.S.S. Indianapolis. He recounted to me in detail what happened when that ship went down. As he talked about being in the ocean for days, not knowing whether they would be rescued, watching his shipmates who were literally dying around him  and being devoured by sharks, wondering if they would ever be rescued, tears came to his eyes. More than 50 years after, tears came to his eyes. He said it wasn't fair, what they did to Captain McVay; to court-martial him was wrong. He asked me for my help, if I would join the Senator from New Hampshire on this resolution, and I am happy to do so. 
   I think justice cries out that we agree to this resolution; that Captain McVay, who was singled out, out of all the captains of the fleet, to be court-martialed under these circumstances is just unfair. The men who served under him, those whose lives were under his care and those who survived this worst sea disaster in U.S. naval history--they have come forward. They have asked us to make sure that history properly records the contribution Captain McVay made to his country. 
   I am happy to join in this resolution. I hope other Members of the Senate, hearing this debate and reading this resolution, will cosponsor it as well and that we can close the right way this chapter in American naval history.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, first, I thank the Senator from West Virginia and my leader on the Appropriations Committee, and my friend, Senator STEVENS from Alaska, who is not present on the floor; he is also the chairman of this important committee. 
   You can measure the values of a nation by the way it spends its money. If you take a look at this bill, you will see that the values of America are strong in many areas. We are prepared to spend $6 billion to make sure that the men and women in uniform in Kosovo have the very best. Were it my son or daughter, I would demand nothing less. I am sure we all feel the same. 
   We are spending hundreds of millions of dollars for humanitarian relief. Isn't it typically American that no matter what our sacrifice, we are willing to help others, whether it is the refugees  in Kosovo or those suffering from the hurricane in Central America. 
   Many other good things are in this bill. I was happy to be part of an effort to provide financial assistance to those who have been in the pork production industry and have been hard hit during the last year. Senator BOND and I have worked for $145 million to try to help some of these farmers to face the toughest times in their lives. Net farm income in Illinois is down 78 percent. Farmland in Illinois is some of the best in the country, yet farmers have seen this dramatic decline in income. With all these good things in the bill, it would seem fairly obvious to vote for it without reservation. I wish I could. I plan on voting for it, but with serious reservations. Let me tell you what they relate to. 
   When this bill came from the White House, the President asked for $6 billion for military and humanitarian assistance, and then the House added $5 billion in military spending which the President didn't ask for. Among other things in this bill is $500 million for military construction around the world that is not authorized, not requested. It is put in here. 
   When I went to the conference with Senator BYRD and Senator STEVENS, the Senate side of the aisle said we are going to propose an amendment that I offered--$265 million for American schools. You have heard of all the things I have mentioned. There is not a penny in this bill for American schools--nothing. Are schools on our minds? You bet they are. Cities like Conyers, GA; Littleton, CO; Jonesboro, AR; West Paducah, KY; Pearl, MS; Springfield, OR. The sad roster of schools in America that have been hit by school violence continues to grow. 
   I produced an amendment for $265 million for two things--not radical new suggestions but tried and true things such as school counselors so that kids who are troubled and have a problem have somebody to turn to, and afterschool programs so that kids are supervised in a positive, safe learning environment. The House conferees rejected that. Not a penny for schools, not $265 million. Not a penny for schools, but $5 billion more in military spending than this President requested. 
   Where are our values? Where are our priorities? If our priorities are not in the schoolrooms and classrooms of America, if they are not with our children, where are our values? 
   I salute what is in this bill. Much is good. But it pains me greatly to stand on the floor of the Senate and say that in a conference committee only a few days ago the idea of sending money to America's schools for America's schoolchildren was soundly rejected by the House conferees. That makes no sense whatsoever. 
   We will talk in the juvenile justice bill about how to reduce crime in America, how to reduce violence, and we should. We will talk about gun control, and I support it. But there is more to it. We have to be able to reach out to those kids who show up at school every day with a world of hurt, a world of problems, kids who probably see school as the only shelter, the only nurturing environment, in their lives. These kids need a helping hand, and with this helping hand they can be better students and better Americans. 
   We missed an opportunity in this bill by denying one penny for those schools. We missed that opportunity. I am sorry to say that this bill does not include it. But I promise you this. As long as I serve in the Senate, I will join with those in the Senate and, I hope, others in the House, who come to the realization that there is no greater priority than our children. 
   I yield back the remainder of my time.

   Let me say at the outset that I am honored to support this amendment. I am glad that Senator WELLSTONE, Senator KENNEDY, and many others have joined in this effort. 
   For those who question whether Senator WELLSTONE's testimony before the Senate is accurate, I share with them some statistical information which came as a shock to me. General McCaffrey, who is our Nation's drug czar, appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee last year. I asked General McCaffrey if the statistics I had read were accurate.

   Mr. DURBIN. Let me say to the Senator from Minnesota, again, in support of this amendment--and I am happy to be a cosponsor of it--the important aspect in the administration of justice that is often overlooked is respect for the law. We teach our children to respect the law. We try to make certain that they teach their children. It is that legacy which allows the administration of justice to succeed. 
   When people lose respect for the law, it doesn't take too many of them to turn on a system and break it down. This amendment being offered by Senator WELLSTONE is an effort to make certain that we have respect for the law here, respect for the equal administration of justice. 
   We cannot be impervious or blind to the obvious. The obvious is demonstrated by the statistics I have mentioned on the floor and those read by Senator WELLSTONE. I cannot believe in 1999, at this stage in the history of this great Nation, we are prepared in this piece of legislation to take a step back in time when it comes to progress toward racial harmony in America. If we are so foolish to do that, we risk respect for the administration of justice and respect for the law. 
   People who observe this system can't ignore the fact that disproportionate numbers of minorities are being incarcerated and treated unfairly. I stand, as I am sure the Senator from Minnesota does, in saying that I want those who break the law to answer for it. I want to live in a safe neighborhood. I want to live in a safe town. If the perpetrator of a crime is black, white, or brown, male or female, it is irrelevant. They should be treated under our system of justice fairly and the same. 
   But when we look at the end result of this system of justice and see this disproportionate confinement of minorities, are we to turn our backs on that? Are we to walk away from that? What do we do to this Nation and our system of laws if we do? We risk, I am afraid, a disintegration of a sense of community in America, a disintegration of respect for law. Then we all suffer, not just African Americans, but also Hispanic Americans, those of every color and hue and ethnic background. 
   So I support this amendment, an amendment that passed overwhelmingly in the House of Representatives. I hope it will be enacted as part of this legislation. I say, as the Senator from Minnesota has said, every Senator should take this amendment very, very seriously. 
   I yield back to the Senator.

   Mr. DURBIN. Does the Senator recall when General McCaffrey testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last year and I asked the general, who was in charge of trying to reduce drug crime in America, if it were true that of those committing drug crimes in America, 13 percent are African American, and of those incarcerated for committing drug crimes in America, 67 percent are African American? He said: Yes, it is true. I don't have an answer. 
   Now, I say to the chairman of that committee, I don't know if you were there during that questioning, but if you are looking for an indication of why Senator WELLSTONE's amendment is important, that statistic alone should give the Senator from Utah some pause. I hope he will consider that we are not going to release anyone who has been charged with a crime but merely step back and try to make sure the administration of justice is color-blind in this country and that it is fair and try to eradicate the statistic which was quoted and verified by General McCaffrey.

   Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment to be offered by the Senator from California, Mrs. FEINSTEIN. 
   Let me tell you two things that happened yesterday on Capitol Hill which most people across America would find nothing short of incredible. We had a chance on the floor of the Senate to say that if you went to a gun show and bought a gun, you would be subject to the same law as anyone who walked into a gun dealer. In other words, we would check your background. Are you a felon; do you have a criminal record; do you have a history of violent mental illness? 
   Before we sell a gun at a gun show, we wanted to make sure there was less likelihood that people would walk in with those problems and walk out with a gun. We were defeated. The National Rifle Association defeated that amendment. Despite the best efforts of Senator FRANK LAUTENBERG of New Jersey and many of us, we were defeated. 
   Instead, this Senate passed an amendment by the Senator from Idaho which went in the opposite direction and made it easier for people to buy guns without background checks. In fact, the amendment offered by the Senator from Idaho, adopted by this Senate, said you could walk into a pawn shop and buy your gun back without any background check. 
   What is wrong with that? Five times as many criminal felons put their guns in pawn shops as regular citizens. So what the National Rifle Association did with this amendment by the Senator from Idaho was make it easier for those who use guns in crime to get those guns without a background check. 
   America has to be standing back and saying: Did the Senate learn anything from what happened in Littleton, CO? Can we do anything to deal with gun violence? 
   Then, last night, I went to a conference committee on the emergency supplemental bill, and I said to the gathered members of the House and Senate, please, we are considering a bill worth billions of dollars. Can we put some money in to help our schools--$265 million so we can hire more counselors in schools to help troubled children; $100 million for more afterschool programs so that kids can be in a constructive, positive, safe environment. They said no, not a penny. In this emergency supplemental bill, not one penny for America's schools, but $6 billion more for military spending than President Clinton asked for, billions of dollars to be spent around the world for problems which the United States is involved in, but not a penny to be spent on safety in schools. 
   What a message. What a message coming out of Capitol Hill yesterday. If these are truly representative bodies in the Senate and the House of Representatives, to whom have they been listening? They haven't been listening to the families across America who want us to stand up and do something about gun violence. They have been listening to the National Rifle Association. They haven't been listening to the kids that we met with this morning from all across the United States, who came in and talked about their worries and their concerns about safety in schools. And they sure haven't been listening to the parents, worried to death about another school year and more violence. 
   If this Senate is going to be truly representative of the people who sent us here, if we are going to do something to show leadership instead of powerlessness to groups like the National Rifle Association, we should pass the amendment of Senator DIANNE FEINSTEIN. 
   Stop these ammunition clips. Who on God's green Earth needs an ammunition clip with 250 bullets in it? If you need that kind of ammunition to go out and shoot a deer, you ought to stick to fishing. 
   The bottom line is, this amendment is sensible. She is trying to stop those who are buying ammunition clips that are designed to do one thing--kill human beings. Yet, the National Rifle Association says it is our constitutional right to buy these. Ridiculous. 
   Ask the families across America whether the Dianne Feinstein amendment makes sense and they will say yes. Ask them whether Senator FRANK LAUTENBERG's amendment, to make sure that we check the backgrounds of people before they buy these guns at gun shows, is the sort of thing we want to make certain it is safe for all Americans. They will say yes; that makes sense. 
   Time and again, we are going to give our colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, on the Senate floor a chance to stand up and decide whether they are going to be for the families across America who want safety in schools or whether they are going to shrink away in cowardice because of the National Rifle Association. Let us do the right thing. Let us adopt Senator FEINSTEIN's amendment.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Jersey. 
   To recount where we are in this arduous debate over gun control in light of the Littleton tragedy, yesterday my colleague from the State of New Jersey, Mr. LAUTENBERG, offered a very clear amendment that said: If you want to purchase a gun at a gun show, you are going to be held to the same standards as a person who buys it from a licensed firearms dealer. 
   In other words, we will do a background check and make sure that you are not a prohibited person under the law, make certain you do not have a criminal record, a history of violent mental illness or something of that nature. 
   It was a very good amendment, and I commend my colleague from New Jersey for his leadership. He envisioned this problem long before many of us did and, frankly, put before us a very straightforward option. I was happy to support him. 
   Unfortunately, it did not receive a majority of support in the Senate. The sad reality is that 6 of the 55 Republican Senators voted for it and 41 of the 45 Democratic Senators voted for it--2 were absent--and it was not enough, so the Lautenberg amendment went down in defeat. 
   That was a bitter disappointment. But even worse was the fact there was an amendment offered by the Senator from Idaho, Mr. CRAIG, which he purported to offer as an alternative to Senator LAUTENBERG's amendment. 
   Let me tell you what has happened in the 24 hours since the Senate adopted that amendment. People have seen through it. It is transparent. It not only did not deal with the problem of gun shows and stopping the sale of guns to people who should not own them, it took a step backwards and made it easier for those sales to be made. 
   So there has been a mad scramble in the last 48 hours from the other side of the aisle. Once the public had an opportunity to look at this Craig amendment, there has been a mad scramble to undo what the Craig amendment sought to accomplish. 
   The NRA, the National Rifle Association, shot the Republican Senate leadership in the foot yesterday, and they have been hopping around all day today trying to figure out how they are going to salvage this mess. So they have come up with another amendment. It is unclear to me what they are thinking about, because they took a bad amendment, the Craig amendment, and added another bad amendment to it. 
   In this case, two wrongs will not make a right. What we have now in this so-called Hatch-Craig amendment is an abomination. It doesn't address the gun show problem. Senator LAUTENBERG did that clearly. 
   Let me tell you how bad this bill is, this Hatch-Craig second bill. This is Senator CRAIG's Thursday bill. 
   This bill, sadly, sets up at least two, maybe three different categories under the law for sales at gun shows. In his original bill, he had some special licensee category, voluntary category, that you could sell a gun at a gun show under that category. No background check was necessary; it was not necessary, of course, to send the name and address and gun serial number into any group that might check to see if it had any criminal history, if that weapon might have been used in a crime to kill someone or in a drug deal that went bad. No. 
   Then he came back today, and in this amendment they have created some more categories of how to sell guns at gun shows and they are just as difficult to follow. 
   One says, licensed gun dealers at gun shows can sell a gun. I do not have a problem with that. That is what we are seeking here. That is what Senator LAUTENBERG is seeking here, so that the background check is accomplished. 
   Then they had a provision in there that violates the Brady law we have lived under for so many years. Instead of giving law enforcement 3 days to check on the background of a would-be purchaser at a gun show, they give them 24 hours. And if they don't get the completed inquiry back in 24 hours, they sell the gun. The presumption is on the side of the purchaser. We are saying to those in law enforcement: Take a back seat. We want to keep these guns moving. This is big business. 
   Is that really what America wants? I do not think so. 
   So we have these categories of who can sell guns at gun shows. It is a labored attempt by the National Rifle Association to accomplish nothing--nothing--other than to take away from law enforcement their authority to do what American people ask for under the Brady law. 
   In this country what they said under the Brady law is, do not sell a gun to someone who has a history of having committed a felony or has a violent mental illness. The NRA has never liked that. They have tried to keep this gun show loophole alive. And they do it with this latest Republican amendment. 
   What a sad, sad situation, where those with serious mental illness, fugitives, stalkers, straw purchasers can still run to these gun shows, and under this Hatch-Craig amendment they can find a way to get their hands on the guns. Is it a problem? There are 4,000 gun shows a year across America. They are in my home State of Illinois, and over 200 in the year 1998. 
   When they had an investigation into these gun shows to find out who they were selling guns to without background checks, 
   they found out it included a lot of felons prohibited from acquiring firearms who have been able to buy them at gun shows. 
   In fact, the Department of Treasury and the Department of Justice found that felons buying or selling firearms were involved in more than 46 percent of the investigations involving gun shows. This is a loophole that is producing guns right and left. 
   We are still trying to trace the guns used by those two kids in Littleton, CO. At least three, if not all four of them, came out of gun shows. Is it important that we know how they were bought or sold? Of course it is. You go to any police department in America--start with Chicago; pick your hometown--and ask them whether tracing a firearm is an important part of a criminal investigation. They will tell you it is critical. Where did that gun come from? Who sold it to them? 
   Let's try to establish a chain of purchase here and get down to the root cause of crime in America. The National Rifle Association talks about the second amendment and what they want to protect. And yet they come in with this amendment which literally takes away the power of law enforcement to try to enforce the laws and reduce crime. 
   That isn't the end of it. One of the most insidious aspects of this amendment was put in that would exempt pawnshops from doing a background check on a gun that is resold to someone who pawns it.  
   Picture this: A person needs money, picks up a handgun, walks into a pawnshop, hands it to the pawnshop owner, and says: How much are you going to give me? $20. He takes the ticket and the $20 and leaves. 
   That pawnshop owner may, but is not required to, report to law enforcement where that gun came from, the source of it, as well as the serial number. If they do not, under the current law, when the person walks back in and says: Here is the $20 and the ticket; I want my gun back, they are required to say: First, we have to check and make sure you are qualified under Brady. If you have a criminal history of mental illness, we will not sell it back to you. 
   The National Rifle Association, in this amendment, takes out that requirement. So the pawnbroker turns around and hands that gun back to the street. 
   Is it important in a pawnshop? Consider this: It is five times more likely that criminals are going into pawnshops with guns than those who have not committed crimes--five times more likely. And the National Rifle Association, which insists they want to keep guns out of the hands of criminals, puts this provision in the law, which many on that side of the aisle are now lauding as a great improvement. It is not. It is a step backwards. 
   Then there is the question about all the records of these gun purchases. If these records are not kept, we are basically tying the hands of law enforcement. It is no wonder to me that law enforcement across this country cannot understand the amendment that is being offered on the Republican side of the aisle. 
   This is a sad situation. We have a national tragedy on our hands--270 million Americans, 200 million guns, more gun crime than any country on Earth. We stiffen the penalties right and left. We are determined to reduce gun violence. Yet, when it comes to the most basic thing, to keep guns out of the hands of 
   people who do not need them and should not have them, to keep them out of the hands of kids, we face amendments such as this. 
   It is really, in my estimation, unsettling. I cannot understand where a notion like background checks at gun shows--which enjoys the support of 87 percent of the American people--has such a tough time passing. Senator LAUTENBERG deserved 87 votes at a minimum on his amendment, an honest straightforward amendment to deal with gun shows. We could not get half of the Members of the Senate to vote for it. 
   The best thing for us to do is to defeat the Hatch-Craig amendment. It is a step in the wrong direction. We are going backwards instead of forwards. 
   The NRA, incidentally, put in one provision which they now put in everything. If you get involved in one of these purchases, and you sell a gun to somebody who kills another person, the National Rifle Association said, well, you should not be sued for that, should you? Of course you should be liable and accountable for that, as we all are for our actions. 
   They build immunity into this law from civil prosecution, immunity in the law. Who is immune from prosecution in America? Foreign diplomats and some health insurance companies. That is it. And now the National Rifle Association says, and, of course, the people who sell guns at gun shows, make them immune from liability, too. That is so far over the line it is hard to explain, let alone defend. 
   I salute my friend from New Jersey for his leadership on this issue. I hope my colleagues in the Senate will not be misled by this new Hatch-Craig amendment. If this is an effort to undo the damage done to those who voted for Mr. CRAIG's original amendment, they did not accomplish it. This second amendment compounds the problem. It makes it that much worse. 
   Let's get back to the basics. Let's support Senator LAUTENBERG's amendment--a straightforward amendment, supported by law enforcement and families across America who are sick of school violence, sick of gun violence, and expect this Senate to meet its constitutional responsibility to pass laws to accomplish these goals and make America a safer place to live. 
   I yield back the remainder of my time.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Jersey. 
   I want to tell those following this debate that you are never going to have a clearer choice than between the Lautenberg amendment and the Craig amendment. The Lautenberg amendment closes down the loophole that allows people to sell lethal weapons at a gun show--what they call ``private sales''-- without a background check. The Craig alternative makes it permissible. 
   What does that mean? It means if you want to get involved in a background check for sale at a gun show, you may. You may. How many laws do we write across America where you say ``you may'' observe the speed limit, ``you may'' observe the law when it comes to the sale of drugs, ``you may'' observe the law when it comes to treason against the United States? No. If a law is going to work, a law has to be sensible and enforceable. 
   The Craig amendment is neither. It is neither sensible nor enforceable, because not only does it ignore the reality of the horror that is coming out of schools in America but it ignores the reality that at gun shows across America people are buying weapons without a background check and using them in the commission of crime. 
   This is not my observation, it is the observation of the Department of Treasury, the Department of Justice, and ATF, and other researchers who reviewed 314 recent investigations involving gun shows across America. Their findings are chilling. Felons, although prohibited under the Brady law from buying firearms, have been able to purchase guns at gun shows. In fact, felons buying or selling firearms were involved in more than 46 percent of the investigations involving gun shows. 
   There are plenty of gun shows in my home State of Illinois. Most of the people who attend are law abiding. Most of them follow the law and are glad to do it. Clearly, the criminal element is using this gun show as a way to launder weapons and purchase them when they can't buy them from a licensed dealer. 
   Mr. CRAIG would suggest the people attending gun shows are much like those who come around to buy and sell baseball cards. There is a big difference. Of course, what you are buying and selling at a gun show is a lethal weapon. 
   Senator LAUTENBERG is trying to close down a loophole which is a loophole for criminals. Why the National Rifle Association--which continues to say it is just defending the rights of hunters and sportsmen across America who want to use guns safely and legally--would come in with the Craig amendment in an attempt to undermine Senator LAUTENBERG's amendment is beyond me. 
   That is not all that is in the Craig amendment. Read on, my friends, because he proceeds in this amendment to provide immunity from civil liability for those who would ask for a special license at a gun show. There are only two groups in America who can't be sued now--diplomats and some health insurance companies--and we are debating that particular element. And now the Senator from Idaho says we should also include in the group of Americans who cannot be held accountable in court those who want to sell guns at a gun show. 
   The last point I want to make is this: As they poured through the records to try to figure out how these two children in Littleton, CO, came up with two sawed-off shotguns and other weapons, they were stymied because there were no records; they couldn't trace them. They were trying to figure out where they came from. Senator CRAIG's amendment would mandate that we destroy records about the sale of firearms, records that law enforcement needs to try to figure out when guns are stolen and used in the course of crime. 
   I can't believe any gun owner, who as I do opposes the gun crimes across America, is going to stand up and defend what Mr. CRAIG is arguing for. Senator LAUTENBERG's amendment is clear and concise and hits the points in this loophole that many criminals are using to come into possession of guns which they are using to menace Americans and American families.

    Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to commend St. John's Hospital in Springfield. This is National Hospital Week, when communities across the country celebrate the people that make hospitals the special places they are. This year's theme sums it up nicely: ``People Care. Miracles Happen.'' It recognizes the health care workers, volunteers, and other health professionals who are there 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, curing and caring for their neighbors who need them. 
   An example of this dedication is the Parent Help Line of St. John's Hospital in Springfield, Illinois. The program won the American Hospital Association's prestigious Hospital Award for Volunteer Excellence, which highlights special contributions of hospital volunteers. 
   The Parent Help Line provides parents and agencies with easily accessible, low-cost parenting information and support to help strengthen families and prevent child abuse. Trained volunteers give parenting tips, support and referrals to about 100 callers a month. Volunteers also visit parents of newborns and offer information about infant growth and development and about the Parent Help Line services, and a volunteer nurse makes a follow-up call to each family one month after discharge. Volunteers taking part in an intervention program regularly call parents identified as high risk. Parenting classes, program and support groups are made available to parents, and a television show on parenting issues airs weekly on a local public access channel. A monthly newsletter is mailed to more than 1,500 individuals and agencies in central Illinois. 
   Mr. President, I want to congratulate St. John's Hospital for this award-winning program.

   Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, the bill which is before the Senate, S. 900, is known in the shorthand form as the Financial Modernization Act. It is a 150-page bill which has been the subject of debate and deliberation on Capitol Hill for almost 10 years--a 10-year effort by the House and the Senate to try to modernize the laws and regulations in Washington relative to banks and financial services. Of course, anyone who has paid any attention understands that while we have been debating, there has been a revolution taking place. 
   I am reminded that just a few years ago we passed major reform in the area of telecommunications--years of hearings, extraordinary testimony from expert witnesses, the best staff work, the best lawyers, the best efforts by the  Members of the House and Senate--and we delivered the Telecommunications Act modernizing regulation when it came to this industry. 
   Now, a few years later, we take a look at that work product. I was amused to find someone who came to my office and reported to me that they had found in that 1,000-page bill only two references to the Internet. Think of that. We modernized our telecommunications law and almost overlooked the most amazing phenomena that is taking place in telecommunications. 
   I hope we don't make the same mistake here. I hope in our effort to modernize financial institutions that we are thoughtful, that we modernize them in a way that is good for everyone--consumers and families in America as well as the owners of those institutions. 
   Twenty-two years ago we took a look at banking in America. We decided that we had some interest as a nation in making certain that the banks served the communities where they were located. That is not a radical notion, is it--to say if you have a bank in a town that is holding the savings and checking accounts of individuals and families and businesses, that when that bank does business it should do business in that same community where the people live, where the businesses are located, where the farmers have their farms, and where the ranchers have their ranches. 
   We found that some banks were, in effect, in a parasitic capacity. They were drawing out the resources of communities and regions and not putting the money back in. In its worse situation, you would find in some of the urban areas redlining, where banks would take the money out of a community and refuse to write mortgages for the people who wanted to build homes, or to modernize their homes. They wouldn't put money into the small businesses in the same communities where they were drawing the money. 
   In 1977, we decided there was a need for legislation called the Community Reinvestment Act. It speaks for itself--that the banks reinvest in the communities where they are located. It is not a radical concept. In fact, I think it is a rational concept. It is one that, frankly, has served us very well for 22 years. Now, as part of Senate bill 900, there is an effort to radically change community reinvestment. 
   I don't know what the experience of other Senators might be. But I can tell you what my experience has been in my hometown of Springfield, IL. I have lived in that town for 
   about 30 years, practiced law there, and raised a family. There was a time when I not only knew the name of every bank downtown, but I knew the bank presidents. I might not have socialized with them, but I sure knew where they were. I knew where they lived, and I knew who their families were. I had a feeling that those banks were going to be around for a long time. You could just tick them off: The First National Bank, the Illinois National Bank, The Springfield Marine Bank. 
   But over a span of 10 or 15 years a dramatic change has taken place. I think a lot of Americans find themselves in the same situation that I am in. I struggle to remember the latest names of these latest banks. Which one is the First National Bank? Which one is the Planters and Growers Bank? I can't keep up with it. It seems every 6 or 12 months there is a change, and not just a change in name, there is a change in ownership. The bank that used to be run downtown in Springfield may be run out of someplace in Ohio, New York, or Europe. 
   If Members ask whether or not we need this law of 1977, this Community Reinvestment Act, to make certain that as these changes are taking place in the banking industry--whoever owns them, wherever their home might be--that they still serve the communities where they draw their money from, I think is still a very sound concept. 
   Yet this bill, S. 900, suggests it is a concept that should be largely abandoned, because in three specific areas there are changes in the law. 
   First, it eliminates the requirement that all banks within a holding company have and maintain satisfactory Community Reinvestment Act ratings as a condition for exercising new financial powers. To put it in common English, if you want to take your bank and holding company and expand it in some direction, we are going to take a look to see if you have been good citizens in the communities where you are located. 
   I think that is a reasonable suggestion. That is the law. But this bill changes it. This bill removes that requirement and says you can't take a look at their records and see if they have been helping local farmers and businesspeople, families, with mortgages. 
   Does that make sense, at a time when bank ownership is becoming further and further removed from the people who bank, that we are going to somehow absolve them of responsibility to the neighborhoods, the communities, the towns, the counties around them? I don't think that makes any sense at all. 
   The second thing, the so-called safe harbor provision. If an institution had a good conduct ribbon for 36 months under the Community Reinvestment Act, this bill basically says leave those banks alone, don't ask any more questions. 
   I don't think that makes sense either. 
   The Community Reinvestment Act examinations take place about once every 18 to 24 months. In fact, for the smaller institutions, they have been streamlined more dramatically. I don't think we ought to say that after some 3 years of good conduct we are no longer going to ask basic questions as to whether or not you are making an investment in your community. 
   The final provision, which the previous speaker, the Senator from Minnesota, addressed from his point of view, was whether or not a bank--rural bank in this instance--with less than $100 million in assets should be required to meet the requirements of the Community Reinvestment Act. An argument can be made, and has been made by some, that these are smaller institutions and, as such, should not be burdened by regulators and paperwork, let them do their business, they are good neighbors, and things will work out. 
   Yet in the report filed with this bill, we find the statistics do not bear out that point of view. Let me read:  
   Over 76 percent of rural U.S. banks and thrifts have assets less than $100 million.  
   We are talking about more than three-fourths of the bank and thrift institutions in the smalltown areas.  
   It is asserted these small rural banks by their nature serve the credit needs of their local neighbors. However, small banks have historically received the lowest Community Reinvestment Act ratings. Institutions with less than $100 million in assets accounted for 92 percent of institutions receiving noncompliance ratings under the CRA.  
   What many do is take the money from the community and then do not lend it back into the communities. They turn around and buy government securities instead of lending it to the businesses and families that need those assets to make investments in the communities. 
   I don't think the small bank exemption is the way to go. I think the provision in the CRA change relating to that overlooks the fact that just a few years ago we put in new regulations to streamline CRA investigations in smaller banks, banks of less than $250 million in assets. We exempted many small banks from reporting requirements and eliminated a lot of documentation and paperwork. We need to continue to focus on banks of all sizes to make sure they are doing the right thing. 
   After 22 years of the Community Reinvestment Act, what do we have to show for it? Has it worked? I think, quite honestly, it has worked very well. My State of Illinois is very diverse, with a large city like Chicago and many small towns. In the Chicago area, thanks to a strong economy and CRA, the number of home loans to low-income borrowers almost doubled between 1990 and 1996, enabling 30,000 families to become homeowners. Is it of value to those families that those banks put the money back into the community? I think it obviously is. 
   I want to take a look at some of the other areas of my State. Voice of the People, in the Chicago Uptown area, has provided quality, affordable housing for low-income families. The racially and economically diverse community of Uptown Chicago, on the far north side of town, partnered with the  Uptown National Bank of Chicago and completed the International 
   Homes project, a development of 28 town homes constructed on five vacant lots within a four-square-block area in Uptown. This made homeownership possible for 28 lower-income minority and immigrant families. Half of these first-time homeowners are families earning under 50 percent of median income. 
   At the same time, down in my old hometown of East St. Louis is Winstanley/Industry Park Neighborhood Organization, a new nonprofit corporation representing 8,000 people. For those not familiar with it, my old hometown has had a tough time for the last 20 or 25 years. They struggled to keep the community together and to survive. The Winstanley/Industry Park Neighborhood Organization has been a plus. It is a mixed-use area comprised of residential, commercial, and abandoned industrial sites. What they have tried to do is to work with Magna Bank of Illinois to change the area. They have created a farmers market, community owned and operated, which was developed by this organization. What makes the market particularly unique is 14 of the 16 vendors are local residents. 
   If your bank were located somewhere in Europe and you came into the branch in your hometown and said, ``We have some people here who are struggling to make a living; they are low income and they want a chance to start a farmers market,'' is it more likely that you are going to get a sympathetic response from someone who knows the community, has a responsibility to the community, rather than someone who is just hammering away at the bottom line? I think the answer is obvious. 
   A residential loan counseling program of the same organization has launched a response to the victimization of over 1,400 lower-income families who were being misled by unscrupulous realtors into home purchase agreements known as bond-for-deed. The realtors who engaged in this often held the title to the properties throughout the length of the contract without recording the transaction and without hazard insurance for the purchaser. Most of these agreements contain no terms and have open-end type mortgage balances. This organization counseling program helped these same residents, lower-income families, refinance with conventional mortgages on their own homes. 
   Finally, West Humboldt Park is a low-income, predominantly minority neighborhood on Chicago's west side. It is plagued by poverty, illiteracy, welfare dependence, street and domestic violence, alcohol and substance abuse, and a lack of job opportunity. In 1989, Orr High School and the 12 neighborhood elementary schools formed a partnership with Bank of America--then Continental Bank--establishing a community network of schools in West Humboldt. The partnership has grown to include over 25 programs providing education and social services. They include Boys and Girls Clubs, the creation of the BUILD project, which is a group of parents who are really trying to keep the streets safe for their kids. 
   It amazes me that in our efforts to modernize the laws involving banks and thrift institutions, one of the first casualties proposed in the Republican majority bill before the Senate is to eliminate the Community Reinvestment Act. A party which dedicates itself to the premise that local control is best is virtually ready to give it away. To say that when it comes to local control of banking assets so critical for building and rebuilding a community, it will no longer hold them responsible, I think that is shortsighted. 
   For 22 years, the Community Reinvestment Act has worked. I 
   hope we defeat this provision if we can muster a direct vote on it. If not, defeat the bill if it continues to push the things which are not in the best interests of consumers and families across America. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution honoring the academic achievements and excellence of Lincoln Park High School in Chicago, Illinois, which is celebrating its 100th anniversary this year. 
   Educating America's youth is a difficult and often overlooked task. For the students of today to become the leaders of tommorrow, education is critical. It is the foundation on which a student builds his or her future. With our ever changing world, education is the key that unlocks the door of opportunity. Therefore, it is an honor to acknowledge this institution for its great service over the last century. 
   Since 1899, Lincoln Park High School has been an educational leader in Chicago, maintaining a standard of excellence that should be looked upon as a model. Furthermore, Lincoln Park High School has been consistently among the top public high schools in test scores and other measures of achievement, and has been racially integrated throughout its history. 
   I am pleased to be joined today by my colleague from Illinois, Senator PETER FITZGERALD, in presenting this resolution recognizing Lincoln Park High School as a model for educational institutions throughout the United States.

   Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator. 
   Mr. President, I am joining today in this discussion and debate on what is a critically important issue not just for the current challenge facing America in the Balkans but also, frankly, in terms of the history of Congress and this Nation. 
   I feel very strongly about that provision of the Constitution which gives to Congress, and Congress alone, the authority to declare war. It is, unfortunately, a power allotted to Congress which for the past 50 years has been largely ignored. 
   One day after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, President Franklin Roosevelt hobbled to the podium of the House of Representatives and gave his memorable speech referring to a day which would ``live in infamy.'' He then asked from a joint session of Congress for a declaration of war, first against Japan and then later against Germany and Italy. 
   That was literally the last time a President came before Congress and recognized the authority of Congress to declare war. Every subsequent President--Democrat and Republican alike--found an excuse not to come before Congress and to wage wars of varying magnitude. 
   It is curious, when you look back after World War II, at the debate on the formation of NATO and of the United Nations, how careful the Members of Congress from both political parties were to preserve the authority of Congress to declare war, to make certain that we would not delegate that authority to any international institution or any treaty organization. Time and time again during the course of that debate we were reminded that even as members of the United Nations, even as members of NATO, we were not ceding the power of Congress under the Constitution to declare war. 
   The steady decline of congressional involvement in the war-making process resulted, of course, in our participation in Korea, in Vietnam, in a dozen other military undertakings without the express approval of Congress. 
   Last year, I stood on the floor of this institution and asked my colleagues--Democrats and Republicans alike--to join me in reasserting the principle that Congress, and Congress alone, has the authority to declare war and to engage in any offensive military action. Yes, the President is Commander in Chief and defends American personnel, American territory, and does it without coming to Congress waiting for a quorum and a debate and a final vote before he acts. No one would ever demand that a President restrain that authority to defend this country or its people. But in the case of an offensive military action, one where we were not defending Americans, or our territory, or engaged in some peacekeeping permissive activity, I felt the Constitution was clear. I offered that amendment to the defense appropriations bill last year. 
   For those who are keeping score at home, they might be interested to know that 15 of the 100 Senators voted in favor of my resolution, and 84 in opposition. 
   It will be interesting to take the debate on this resolution and the statements made by so many of my colleagues and put them next to that vote and ask them if there has been a change of heart. I think to some extent there has been. I think it is unfortunate that we are considering this particular resolution and that we will have little chance to amend it. 
   I strongly agree with my colleagues who drafted the resolution that Congress must vote to authorize any escalation of this conflict to include ground troops. I filed an amendment that would prohibit the use of ground troops to invade Yugoslavia unless specifically authorized by Congress. The President said he doesn't intend to use ground troops. He has promised in a letter to congressional leaders that he will ask for a vote of Congress before introducing United States ground forces into Kosovo in a nonpermissive environment. 
   I think the President must come to Congress before committing us to any ground war. I think it would better for us to vote on that specifically. But I understand that a motion to table Senate Joint Resolution 20 will be made and that it is not likely that I will be able to offer this amendment. 
   I did vote for Senate Concurrent Resolution 21 on March 23 that supported airstrikes against Yugoslavia. It passed by a vote of 58 to 41. I commend the President and this administration for giving the Senate at least an opportunity to vote before any action was taken. That is a concession that has rarely been made by any President. Most Presidents moved forward as if the Constitution did not exist in terms of congressional authority. 
   I support the President and NATO's policy. I think we need 
   to have patience and resolve to see the air campaign through. Many have questioned the strategy of conducting an air campaign without committing ground troops. 
   This is an important debate. But I believe we had no choice but to start the bombing campaign in an attempt to respond to ethnic cleansing, the genocide in Kosovo. We could not stand idly by and watch it happen. 
   I have listened to the speeches on the floor from some of my colleagues who take exception to the premise that the United States should even be involved in this conflict. I do not agree with that. Frankly, having been there, having seen literally thousands of people in a refugee camp in Brazda in Macedonia, it is clear to me what is going on. The policies of Milosevic in Yugoslavia are directed toward innocent people. 
   Time and time again I asked these innocent Kosovars why they left Kosovo--an open-ended question. Time and time again the response was exactly the same. In the middle of the night a knock on the door, people in black ski masks, or otherwise concealed identity, gave them literally minutes to leave: Pick up your babies, pick up your grandparents and whatever you can hold, and leave, because we are going to burn down or blow up your home. If they were lucky, they got out. They got out with a family intact. But many were not so fortunate. They were victims of ethnic cleansing--not just displacement but murder. So many times over and over we hear these stories of murder, of genocide against people, not because they have  done anything wrong but because they are of the wrong ethnic persuasion, the wrong culture, the wrong religious belief. 
   I am not sure what the word ``genocide'' means technically. But what I have seen is the closest I may come to it in my lifetime in that refugee camp in Macedonia--victims of murder, rape, displacement, genocide, suffering. These are the people forced out of Kosovo. 
   Some of my colleagues will come to the floor and say that is none of our business, we can't be the policeman to the world; the United States has limited capability, limited responsibility. That is a point of view that I would disagree with but I understand. We certainly cannot police the world. But the fact is, we are part of a NATO alliance which is being tested in terms of its existence and its future. If NATO does not come forward at this moment in time unified and determined to rid Milosevic of his killing fields in Kosovo, the NATO alliance is all but moribund and dead and pointless. 
   For the 20th century, we have invested so much in American treasures, in American lives to preserve Europe: World War I, World War II, and the cold war--thousands and thousands of Americans fighting and dying for the stability and safety and security of Europe. 
   Now in the closing moments of this century are we to walk away from this corner of the world which has been so important in our alliance in the past? Are we to ignore the barbarism being practiced by Slobodan Milosevic? Are we to say that a man who has initiated four wars in 10 years can now start another war if he cares to, find more innocent victims for his policy of ethnic cleansing? Should we, as the United States, step back as the lead nation in this important alliance and declare it is over? I hope not. 
   I think President Clinton is right. Fighting this war at this moment in time is critically important because it will validate the future of NATO. I hope for a generation, perhaps even a century of peace in a Europe that has been torn with warfare too many times. 
   The critical question in Senate Joint Resolution 20 is how far do we go. I voted for airstrikes, I mentioned earlier. But this resolution goes further. I read it in its entirety in the resolution clause:  
   That the President is authorized to use all necessary force and other means in concert with United States allies to accomplish United States and North Atlantic Treaty Organization objectives in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Serbia and Montenegro.  
   I cannot support that. As much as I support the current air war, as much as I support our efforts to stop ethnic cleansing by Slobodan Milosevic, I cannot support committing ground troops. I think that is a mistake. 
   I made a point during my recent visit to ask military experts how it would be accomplished. How can we send troops in the field and accomplish this goal? Time and time again the answer came back: With great difficulty. We don't have the port facility that we can rely on. Frankly, we can't look at the nations surrounding Yugoslavia and find a ready entry strategy. What we would have to do would be elaborate, costly, expensive, time consuming, and dangerous. 
   That is why, though I support the air war, I don't support the concept of sending ground troops. I don't believe it is necessary nor practical, and I don't think we should do it. This resolution is open ended and gives the President authority for ground troops and beyond. 
   Just last week, the House of Representatives considered this issue. I am sorry to say, about an institution where I served for 14 years and one which I hold in the highest regard, that it was not one of their finer moments. It was an aimless, pointless, confusing debate. At a time when the American people needed clarity and leadership from the Congress, they received neither. They voted not to expand the war; they voted not to pull out; and then by a tie vote they failed to pass a resolution even supporting the current air war in place in Kosovo and in Yugoslavia. 
   I am not sure what message was sent. We spend a lot of time here on Capitol Hill talking about sending messages as if we are some sort of e-mail source or Western Union. But that was a very confused day for America, and I am sure the confusion was felt around the world. 
   I hope our vote here does not lead to the same misunderstanding. I think it is likely that this resolution, because it is so broad and open ended, will be tabled. The decision made by that, I believe, that we will continue the Senate approval of the air war, we will not give to this President something he has not asked for--the authority to commit ground troops or whatever other power is in his hands. 
   How did we reach this point where we have to debate whether Congress will exercise its constitutional authority? I think there are several reasons. By attrition we have given back to the executive branch the conduct not only of foreign policy but of the military as well, without any real reference for the language of the Constitution. We have said fundamentally, Mr. President, it is your decision to make. 
   I think it reflects many things. I think it reflects historical attrition. I think it also reflects a timidity on the part of Congress in terms of getting its hands dirty, involved in a military struggle that might result in American casualties. That is a sad commentary because the American people count on us to come forward during the course of debate and with as much clarity as possible to explain the choices and to make the call in terms of our military and foreign policy. 
   I think, unfortunately, this resolution by Senators MCCAIN, BIDEN, and others, does not express the feelings of Congress today. I think if there were a resolution in the Senate as to whether or not we should continue this air war, as the President has proposed, it again will pass as it did on March 23. This idea of expanding beyond goes too far. 
   I listened to the Senator from Virginia argue earlier that Congress has a very limited, if any, role, when it comes to the declaration of war. I disagree with him on that score. I believe there is an important element here that must be remembered. The words of James Madison aptly summarize the founders of this country and their thinking on this point when he said: 
   In no part of the constitution is more wisdom to be found, than in the clause which confides the question of war or peace to the legislature, and not to the executive department.....[T]he trust and the temptation would be too great for any one man......Hence it has grown into an axiom that the executive is the department of power most distinguished by its propensity to war; hence it is the practice of all states, in proportion as they are free, to disarm this propensity of its influence.  
   It is hard to imagine a clearer situation for acting on the Congress' war power than the situation we face with Yugoslavia and Kosovo today. 
   I have offered a resolution which states that if the President seeks to expand this war beyond the current air war approved earlier by Senate resolution, it would require Senate approval. I think with that type of resolution we would continue to assert our constitutional authority to authorize military activity and to draw clear, bright lines as to the extent that the President can go. 
   I understand the Senator from Arizona, and I have heard him speak many times on the floor and in the press about his belief that we should give to this President all power necessary to complete the war. I appreciate his point of view, though I respectfully disagree with him. I think that involvement in a ground war could be costly and, frankly, not the result for which the American people are looking. 
   I hope during the course of this debate several things come through loudly and clearly. First, regardless of your point of view on this resolution, we support the men and women in uniform. Regardless of party preference, we are here in support of their actions. I am proud of what I have seen and what I am sure will continue in their service to this country. 
   Second, we condemn the ethnic cleansing policy of Slobodan Milosevic. He has picked on innocent victims time and time again, and this type of genocide must come to an end. 
   Third, any expansion of this war beyond the current military undertaking must be with the consent of the American people through their elected Representatives in Congress. I hope, regardless of what the vote may be on  this resolution tomorrow, that that will be a principle which the President will continuing to abide by. 
   I believe NATO has a future. I certainly believe that America has a future in its leadership in the world. We are being tested in the Balkans. I want to pass that test so the 21st century is a century of peace. 
   I yield back the remainder of my time.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues Senator CHAFEE, Senator KENNEDY, Senator SCHUMER, Senator LAUTENBERG, Senator BOXER, and Senator REED to introduce the Child Firearm Access Prevention Act of 1999. 
   Following the tragedy in Littleton, Colorado, it is natural to ask ``why'', but we also need to ask ``how?'' 
   How do two teenagers enter their high school armed with a Tec 9, semi-automatic assault rifle, two sawed off 12 gauge shotguns, a 9 millimeter semi-automatic pistol, 30 explosive devices and kill 13 innocent people? 
   There are those who say you can't pass laws to stop this behavior because those inclined to do it will simply ignore the law. I guess the message of this logic is if you can't solve the entire problem, you shouldn't even try. 
   I think that logic is wrong. We have to act and we have to act now. Everyday in America, 13 children die as a result of gun violence. 
   In the last two years our schools have been shattered by gun violence. 
   October 1, 1997, Pearl, Mississippi: A sixteen year old boy killed his mother then went to his high school and shot nine students, two fatally. 
   December 1, 1997, West Paducah, Kentucky: Three students were killed and five were wounded in a hallway at Heath High School by a 14 year old classmate. 
   March 24, 1998, Jonesboro, Arkansas: Four girls and a teacher were shot to death and 10 people were wounded during a false fire alarm at a middle school when two boys 11 and 13 opened fire from the woods. 
   April 24, 1998, Edinboro, Pennsylvania: A science teacher was shot to death in front of students at an eighth grade dance by a 14 year old student. 
   May 19, 1998, Fayetteville, Tennessee: Three days before his graduation, an 18 year old honor student allegedly opened fire in a parking lot at a high school killing a classmate who was dating his ex-girlfriend. 
   May 21, 1998, Springfield, Oregon: Two teen-agers were killed and more than 20 people were hurt when a 15 year old boy allegedly opened fire at a high school. The boy's parents were killed at their home. 
   There is something we can do to protect our children. Seventeen states have already recognized the problem and passed a child firearm access prevention law, which is known as a CAP law. These laws say to those who purchase and own guns, it is not enough for you to follow the law in purchasing them and to use the guns safely; you have another responsibility. If you are going to own a firearm in your home, you have to keep it safely and securely so that children do not have access to it.  
   These laws are effective. Florida was the first State to pass a CAP law in 1989. The following year, unintentional shooting deaths of children dropped 50%. Moreover, a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) in October of 1997 found a 23% decrease in unintentional firearm related deaths among children younger than 15 in those States that had implemented CAP laws. According to the JAMA article, if all 50 states had CAP laws during the period of 1990-94, 216 children might have lived. 
   Should we consider these state laws as a national model? I think the obvious answer is yes. Unfortunately, the Littleton tragedy is no longer unique. 
   Mr. President, what I propose today is Federal legislation that will apply to every State, not just 17, but every State. And this is what it says. If you want to own a handgun, a rifle or shotgun, and it is legal to do so, you can; but if you own it, you have a responsibility to make certain that it is kept securely and safely. 
   What does the bill do? The bill imposes criminal penalties for gun owners who know or should know that a juvenile could gain access to the gun, and a juvenile does gain access & thereby causes death or injury or exhibits the gun in a public place. The gun owner is subject to a prison sentence of up to 1 year and/or fined $10,000 (a misdemeanor penalty). The bill also provides a felony provision for a reckless violation. 
   The bill has 5 common sense exceptions. (1) The adult uses a trigger lock, secure storage box, or other secure storage technique; (2) The juvenile used the gun in a lawful act of self-defense; (3) The juvenile takes the gun off the person of a law enforcement official; (4) The owner has no reasonable expectation that juveniles will be on the premises; and (5) The juvenile got the gun as a result of a burglary. 
   States which have passed CAP laws include: Florida, Connecticut, Iowa, California, Nevada, New Jersey, Virginia, Wisconsin, Hawaii, Maryland, Minnesota, North Carolina, Delaware, Rhode Island, Texas, Massachusetts and Illinois. An examination of this list does not reveal the most liberal states in America. The first State to pass this legislation in 1989 was Florida and in 1995, Texas, certainly no bleeding heart state by any political definition, passed a CAP law. 
   I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in this bipartisan effort to protect children from the dangers of gun violence. Children and easy access to guns are a recipe for tragedy.

   Mr. DURBIN. 
   Mr. President, today, joined by colleagues, Senator LEAHY, Senator KENNEDY, Senator FEINGOLD and Senator SARBANES, I am introducing the bankruptcy reform bill that passed the Senate last year by a vote of 97-1. 
   A constant theme that has guided me throughout the consideration of bankruptcy legislation is balanced reform. You cannot have meaningful bankruptcy reform without addressing both sides of the problem--irresponsible debtors and irresponsible creditors. 
   Unfortunately, the bill we worked so hard to develop, was decimated in conference and the result was a one-sided bill designed to reward the credit industry and penalize American consumers. I could not support it. I hope this year will be different. 
   The bankruptcy code is delicate balance. When you push one thing, almost invariably something else will give. For that reason, it is crucial for bankruptcy reform to be thoughtful and for the changes to be targeted and not create more problems than they attempt to solve. 
   This year, Senator GRASSLEY has introduced S.625, the bankruptcy reform bill of 1999. This bill has more similarities to last year's conference report than the bipartisan measure that passed the Senate last year by an overwhelming margin. 
   The Durbin-Leahy bill is fairer. S.625 uses a means test adopted from IRS collection allowances. The test would require every debtor, regardless of income, who files for Chapter 7 bankruptcy to be scrutinized by the U.S. trustee to determine whether the filling is abusive. The bill creates a presumption that a case is abusive if a debtor can pay the lesser of 25% of unsecured nonpriority claims or $15,000 over 5 years. The IRS means test was designed for use on a case by case basis, not as an automatic template. 
   In my home state, the average annual income for bankruptcy filers in the Central District of Illinois for 1998 was $20,448, yet the average amount of unsecured debt was $22,900. This figure shows that many filers were hopelessly insolvent. They owed more money on debt that had no collateral than their total income for the entire year. These debtors don't even come close to meeting the standards that would require them to convert their case to a 
   chapter 13 case, but they will be forced to go through additional scrutiny at extra costs to everyone involved. 
   In contrast, the Durbin-Leahy bill gives courts discretion to dismiss or convert a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case if the debtor can fund a Chapter 13 repayment plan. One of the factors for the court to consider in making the decision is whether the debtor is capable of paying 30% of unsecured claims under a 3 year plan. This reform can address abuses without the complexity of certifying ability to pay in every case as required by S.625. 
   The Durbin-Leahy bill is cheaper because every case does not go through means testing. By requiring the trustee to submit reports on all filers the cost to trustees is dramatically increased with little reward. 
   The means test in S. 625 looks a lot like the means test in the House bill. We now know that the means test in the House bill would only apply to far less than 10% of Chapter 7 filings. A study released by the American Bankruptcy Institute found that by using the test from the House bill, 97% of sample Chapter 7 debtors had too little income to repay even 20% of their unsecured debts over five years. As a result, only 3% of the sample Chapter 7 filers had sufficient repayment capacity to be barred from Chapter 7 under the rigid means test. This means 100% of the filers would have to go through a process that would only apply to 3% of the cases. 
   Beyond the administrative costs, there is the unneeded stress on poor families. According to the National Conference on Bankruptcy Judges, a review of surveys of Chapter 7 cases from 46 judicial districts in 33 states reveals that the median gross annual income for the 3151 cases in 1998 was $21,540, some $15,000 lower than the 1997 national median income for all families in the United States. Yet, the median amount of unsecured nonpriority debt for these same debtors was $23,411. These people are insolvent, and forcing them to go through unnecessary hoops for little reward is unfair and ineffective. 
   The Durbin-Leahy bill is more balanced. The Durbin-Leahy bill includes credit disclosures designed to help families understand their debt and prevent them from incurring debt which makes them financially vulnerable. Many families file for bankruptcy after a health crisis or some other catastrophic event that prevents them from paying their debts. For example, the survey conducted by the bankruptcy judges shows that on average over 25% of bankruptcy cases involve debtors with medical debts over $1000. By requiring more complete information for debtors, they can make better credit decisions and avoid bankruptcy altogether. 
   The Durbin-Leahy bill addresses abusive creditor practices. The Durbin-Leahy bill protects the elderly from predatory lending practices. Much of our discussion concerning reform of the nation's bankruptcy laws has focused upon perceived abuses of the bankruptcy system by consumer debtors. Far less discussion has occurred with regard to abuses by creditors that help usher the nation's consumers into bankruptcy. I believe that abuses exist on both sides of the debtor-creditor relationship and that bankruptcy reform is incomplete if it fails to address documented abuses among creditors. 
   Last year, I worked to protect elderly Americans by prohibiting a high-cost mortgage lender who extended credit in violation of the provisions of the Truth-In-Lending Act from collecting its claim in bankruptcy. If the lender has failed to comply with the requirements of the Truth-in-Lending Act for high-cost second mortgages, the lender will have absolutely no claim against the bankruptcy estate. This provision is not aimed at all lenders or at all second mortgages. Indeed, it is aimed only at the worst, most predatory, of these by and large worthy lenders. It is aimed only at practices that are already illegal and it does not deal with technical or immaterial violations of the Truth in Lending Act. 
   Disallowing the claims of predatory lenders in bankruptcy cases will not end these predatory practices altogether. Yet it is one step we can take to curb creditor abuse in a situation where the lender bears primary responsibility for the deterioration of a consumer's financial situation.  
   I encourage my Senate colleagues to join Senator LEAHY and me in this effort. Bankruptcy reform must be balanced and must not create a nation of financial outlaws.

   Mr. DURBIN. Well, I want to ask the Senator: We are considering on the floor S. 96, the so-called Y2K bill, which is designed to protect businesses. And good, compelling arguments can be made about protecting businesses. But doesn't this vote suggest that the majority party feels that we should not be discussing help for working families, those in the lower income categories who are falling behind even as they go to work every single day trying to 
   raise their families? That is how I read that vote. It is loud and clear.

   Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield, yesterday we were prepared on the floor to offer an amendment relative to school violence, to try to prevent a repeat of the tragedy that we saw in Littleton, CO, and in Jonesboro, AR, Pearl, MS, West Paducah, KY, and so many other places. I believe the Senator and I came away with the understanding from the majority leader, Senator LOTT, that, yes, within 2 weeks we would have our opportunity to consider those issues and some legislation to deal with them. 
   I ask the Senator from Massachusetts, there is a concern as well about teachers and the President's proposal to try to have more classroom teachers and a smaller student/teacher ratio in grades kindergarten, 1, 2, and 3; is that scheduled to be considered under any schedule that the Senator from Massachusetts has seen?

   Mr. DURBIN. One last question to the Senator--and I thank him for his patience in responding--all of us are concerned about Littleton, CO, and what happened there and school violence in general. There isn't a parent in America who isn't sensitive to that today. 
   The suggestion of a smaller classroom and more personal attention to children in the early stages of their development suggests to me the possibility of spotting a child's problem at an early stage and perhaps dealing with it successfully rather than having this child pushed through the mill, ignored, perhaps not given the personal attention they need.  
   It strikes me that there are so many different pieces to this, whether it is the guns that make these troubled kids so dangerous to so many other people, or the fact that there are troubled children who are not getting the personal attention they need. 
   I join with the Senator from Massachusetts. I hope we can return to an agenda that really identifies the priorities of America's families. It is important to talk about Ed-Flex. It is important to talk about Y2K. But for goodness sake, before we leave at the end of the year, shouldn't we talk about the issues that families talk about when they are sitting around the table or around the family room watching television? 
   I salute the Senator. I hope he will continue with his efforts.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I listened to the debate on this bill, S. 96. It is an important bill. It is an important bill because it protects American business. 
   There are elements of this bill which I think are wise policy. I am certain that at the end of the debate, if the amendment process is a reasonable one, we will pass legislation along these lines protecting business.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, there are many of us who believe that today's debate should have been focused on protection of another group, not the businesses of America but the children of America, because, try as we might to capture public attention about the necessity for Y2K legislation, American's attention is still riveted on Littleton, CO, and Columbine High School. 
   We have had meetings across my home State of Illinois, as my colleagues have had across their States, talking to leaders, schoolchildren, police, psychologists, virtually every group imaginable, about what happened in Littleton, CO. 
   Sadly, it is a repetition of events which have occurred too often in our recent history. 
   October 1, 1997, Pearl, MS, a 16-year-old boy killed his mother, went to high school, and shot nine students, two fatally. 
   December 1, 1997, West Paducah, KY, three students were killed, five were found wounded in the hallway of Heath High School by a 14-year-old. 
   March 24, 1998, Jonesboro, AR, 4 girls and a teacher shot to death, 10 people wounded, during a false fire alarm in middle school when two boys age 11 and 13 opened fire from the woods. 
   April 24, 1998, Edinboro, PA, a science teacher shot to death in front of students at an eighth-grade dance by a 14-year-old. 
   May 19, 1998, Fayetteville, TN, 3 days before graduation, an 18-year-old honor student, allegedly opened fire in a  parking lot of a high school, killing a classmate who was dating his ex-girlfriend. 
   May 21, 1998, Springfield, OR, 2 teenagers were killed and more than 20 people were hurt when a 15-year old boy allegedly opened fire on a high school; the boy's parents were killed at their home. 
   Then there is Littleton, CO, 13 victims and the 2 alleged perpetrators, dead, as a result of gunfire that killed so many. 
   Time and again we have been told these are unusual circumstances and not likely to happen again. 
   Sadly, history has proven they have become all too common place. Can anyone believe that our hometown, the high school in our home city, is immune from this sort of violence? I don't believe so. Frankly, it is because there are many troubled children. That is a problem which needs to be addressed directly and seriously. 
   It is a responsibility that falls on the shoulders of parents first, classmates, teachers, principals, psychologists, counselors, those who see the warning signs, to bring these children to the attention of others. Troubled children are not new to society. They have been there for many, many years. Troubled children in my generation waited on the parking lot to punch you or they threw something at you; troubled children today find a gun. That troubled child moves from being a sad reality to a tragedy, a tragedy in multiple numbers, time and time again. 
   Today I come to the floor with several of my colleagues--Senator KENNEDY, Senator SCHUMER, Senator BOXER, and others--prepared to offer an amendment to this bill to say to my colleagues that protecting business is important; protecting children is more important. As important as the Y2K debate is to many business interests, families across America are not going to stay up tonight watching television and talk about Y2K; they may and they should talk about violence in schools and how it is becoming epidemic in America. 
   The legislation we were prepared to offer today, the Juvenile Gun Violence Prevention Act, has about eight or nine provisions. We had the amendment prepared and we had our cloture motion signed, by 16 Members of the Senate. We were going to make this a day for at least a debate, if not a political confrontation, as to why the Senate fails to consider that legislation at a time when America wonders if we have become impotent when it comes to dealing with violence in our schools. 
   I am happy to report a development occurred on the floor a short time ago which really has changed the face of this debate. Senator TRENT LOTT, the majority leader, the Republican majority leader, came to the floor. I understand he was apprised of our intentions and he made an announcement that within 2 weeks we will be able to debate these issues about school violence, guns, and related issues here on the floor of the Senate. 
   Some may say, Well, what else would you do in the U.S. Senate? My friends, for 2 years we have faced committees on Capitol Hill which basically will not report out any bills related to guns. We don't talk about that subject around here. It is as if it is somehow sacred and you can't bring it up and you can't debate it. That is why Senator LOTT's concession today that we will have this chance to vote on important legislation relative to our schools is so important across America. 
   I say to all those who follow the issue, my heart goes out to the victims and their families in Littleton, CO. It goes out, as well, to the other students whose lives will never ever be the same, having witnessed this horror and this violence. It goes out to students across America concerned about their schools. 
   How many more of our schools have to be desecrated by bullets and blood? How many more of our teachers and students 
   have to be prepared to give up their lives at school to defend their classmates? How many more parents will have to search their memories to try to remember the last words they said to their child as he went off to his last day in school, his last day on Earth? How many more deaths? How many more funerals? 
   It is time now that America will come together and say to this Congress, as representative of the American people, Do something. We can't solve all these problems, we can't make every troubled kid normal again, but please, reduce the firepower of these children who have such twisted minds, these children who are bent on violence. 
   This legislation which we are proposing I hope will become bipartisan legislation. I am sorry to report that it will be almost historic if it is, but some Senators have stepped forward in the past from the Republican side to support this legislation. I hope some will show the courage to do that again. 
   This legislation addresses a number of points, some that are so obvious it is a shame we have to legislate. Should a gunowner be responsible for the safe storage of his or her gun? Should a gunowner who knows that children are in the house have to put the gun under lock and key or put a trigger lock on it? Sixteen States say yes, this is the law. If you don't, you, as a gunowner, will be held criminally responsible. We say this should be a national law. Mr. President, 13 or 14 children every day in America die by gun violence. Columbine High School focuses our attention on 1 day and 15 lives, but every single day there is a massacre spread across this country that doesn't capture our attention like Littleton, CO. 
   We also have a provision which some will find incredible. Did you know that currently under Federal law a child is prohibited, with few exceptions, from possessing and purchasing a handgun, but there is no prohibition against possessing and purchasing a semiautomatic weapon? That is currently the law. We hope to change it. 
   Did you know that if a firearm dealer willfully and knowingly sells a gun to a child in violation of the law, there is no automatic revocation of their license? I think there should be. 
   Did you know, as well, that at gun shows across America all of the provisions of the Brady law for background checks and waiting periods do not apply? We suspect--we are still waiting to hear--that one of the weapons used by these children in Littleton, CO, to kill the others was purchased through a straw purchaser at a gun show and given to the child. Is America unable to deal with this? I think we can, and we should. 
   Did you know you can buy firearms over the Internet? How in the world could you responsibly sell a firearm over the Internet, not knowing on the other side if the purchaser is 15, 16, 17 years old, or a former criminal, or someone with a history of violent mental illness? To me, these things seem so obvious. 
   I yield for a question from my colleague from California, who has been a supporter on this issue.

   Mr. DURBIN. I thank my friend and colleague from California. 
   My reaction is this: I am concerned about two things. I am concerned that the American people have given up on us. I believe they have come to the conclusion that for political reasons we cannot do the obvious; we cannot pass the laws to keep guns out of the hands of kids. I think they are wrong. I hope we can prove them wrong. 
   Certainly the record of the last few decades suggests that we have been blind to this carnage in our streets, people living in fear of walking down the street in Los Angeles or Chicago, kids living in fear of walking on the playground. There is a school on the west side of Chicago called the Austin Career Academy. When that high school is about to adjourn for the day, let the children go home, the police come and close the streets around the schools so that the gang bangers cannot drive by and shoot the children as they come out of the schools. 
   That is daily life in too many places in America. We can argue about what we can do and why the people should give up on this Congress. I hope they do not. But we cannot give up on our children, because if we do, we have failed our most fundamental responsibility. 
   I know this is tough, because some of our colleagues, even on the Democratic side and on the Republican side, have great concerns about the gun lobby and what they might do if they vote for any legislation. It is a tough vote, a hard vote, but I hope they will step back for a second and say we cannot allow this violence and killing to continue in American schools.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I will close by saying I am happy that the majority leader, Senator LOTT, has made this commitment publicly on the floor of the Senate that within 2 weeks we will have debate on legislation such as I have described here. The important thing about that debate is not what is said on the floor of the Senate between Senators. What is important between now and that 2-week deadline is what is said by the American people to those who serve in the Senate. 
   For those who are watching the proceedings of the Senate or who read the RECORD, I hope you will understand that if you are not part of this debate, if you do not pick up your telephone, if you do not take a pen and write a letter, if you do not send an e-mail saying, ``For goodness sake, do something about violence in our schools and the proliferation of guns in the hands of children,'' I can guarantee you that the outcome of this debate is going to be a disappointment to families across America. 
   Do not give up on Congress. This is an institution which is serving this country and all of the American families in it. The families have to come forward now. They have to be heard from. It is not enough to say the school year is coming to an end, so that will be the end of school violence. There will always be another school year, history tells us, sadly, always an opportunity for another tragedy. Let us learn something valuable from the suffering of the families in Littleton, CO. Let us vow, Democrat and Republican alike, that we will do everything in our power to reduce school violence and make this a safer place for our children. 
   I yield back my time.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and my colleague, Senator PETER FITZGERALD, to submit a resolution in support of the establishment of the National Railroad Hall of Fame in Galesburg, Illinois. 
   The state of Illinois has played a pioneering role in the growth of the railroad industry. In 1849, the Peoria and Oquawka Railroad was organized. The city of Galesburg joined Chicago by rail six years later in 1854. In addition, the Carl Sandburg College of Galesburg was one of the first colleges to establish an educational curriculum in railroading. 
   This privately-funded museum will help promote and encourage a better understanding of the origins and growth of the railroad industry. It will also highlight the efforts of men and women whose hard work and resourcefulness helped build one of the nation's best modes of transportation. 
   Already, the Illinois General Assembly, with the unqualified support of our state's new governor, George Ryan, has passed a resolution similar to the one I am introducing today. This resolution is also supported by major railways, railroad organizations, and rail employee organizations. Nineteen members of the House of Representatives have cosponsored an identical measure in the House. Approval by the Senate will be one more step toward establishing this museum. 
   Mr. President, I urge the Senate to pass this resolution in a timely fashion so that we can properly honor the railroad industry and its many pioneers.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today, Senator BOND and I are joining together in submitting a resolution commemorating the 60th anniversary of the International Visitors Program next year. The International Visitors Program is the State Department's public diplomacy initiative that brings distinguished foreign leaders to the United States for short-term professional programs under the authority of the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961. 
   The International Visitor Program has been wonderfully successful in meeting its public diplomacy mission. Thousands of rising leaders from other countries in government, business, labor, academia, and the arts have come to this country and met with their counterparts and with everyday Americans from all walks of life. They have learned about our democratic values and institutions, our entrepreneurial skills, and our culture. 
   Future foreign leaders have learned much about this country that has helped them shape their own, or that simply helped them understand this country's point of view. I wonder how many people in this country know the story of F.W. de Klerk's visit to the United States under the International Visitor Program, and how influential that visit was in his realization that apartheid in South Africa had to end. Perhaps more well known, at least in my part of the country, were the visits of Polish Solidarity Labor leaders who played a pivotal role in transforming Poland to the democratic country it is today. I am sure there are many more stories--most not so dramatic--but with tangible results all over the world. We will never know how many problems have been prevented because rising leaders had a better understanding of democracy, of our policies, and our culture. 
   Many up-and-coming political leaders come to visit Members of Congress and Senators while they're here. These meetings take a few minutes of my time, and I learn as much from my visitor as I hope he or she does from me. Volunteers always tell me that they, too, have learned much from their visitors, and we should not underestimate the value of this program as a two-way street that helps educate the volunteers, their children, and other people in their communities. 
   But I want to commend and thank those thousands of Americans who have opened their homes, their businesses, and their hearts to international visitors with such a tremendous impact on furthering international understanding. I deeply appreciate it that international visitors do not just come to Washington, but that the program takes them into our country's heartland so they can get a real education about our country, outside the Beltway, as they say. That means that volunteers from all over the country are critical for the success of the program. 
   I know in my own State of Illinois, there are six such volunteer groups in Chicago, Freeport, Geneseo, Paris, Sterling, and Springfield. I have heard first-hand the deep commitment many Illinoisans have to this program, because I know many enthusiastic volunteers. Because of the commitment of Illinois volunteers, our State is among the most active in the Nation in hosting international visitors, along with the much larger States of California and Texas. 
   But when we commemorate this anniversary I want to be sure that we're celebrating the contribution and commitment of the thousands of volunteers that make the program meaningful and successful.

    Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, as reports come in detailing the events in Kosovo, the ``ethnic cleansing'' and terror that has forced over a million people from their homes, sadness fills our hearts. Less than two weeks ago I traveled to the Balkans and visited a refugee camp, filled with thousands of people, that had been an empty field just weeks before. We are often so immersed in the accounts of those survivors who have lived through the suffering that we forget about the men and women who have dedicated their lives to ease this pain, and to bringing those who abuse human rights to justice. 
   Today, I rise to recognize M. Cherif Bassiouni of Chicago, Illinois for his selflessness and dedication to bringing those who commit crimes against humanity to justice. Professor Bassiouni, facing great personal risk and many obstacles, has visited many war-torn sections of Bosnia and Croatia, documenting the atrocities and crimes that have been committed there. His 3,500 pages of analysis, backed by 300 hours of videotape and 65,000 documents served as the foundation for the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. Professor Bassiouni has also played a key role in the UN Convention against Torture. 
   Professor Bassiouni has often been a powerful voice insisting that violators of human rights be brought to justice. Professor Bassiouni is a Professor of Law and President of the International Human Rights Law Institute at DePaul University in Chicago. The global impact of his work, dating back to 1964, has led to the creation of the International Criminal Court. A citizen of both the United States and Egypt, Professor Bassiouni is known and respected around the world for his accomplishments. He is the President of the Association Internationale de Troit Penal and President of the International Institute of Higher Studies in Criminal Science. 
   Professor Bassiouni has accomplished a great deal in his effort to see that human rights are respected. In 1977, Bassiouni co-chaired the committee that drafted the U.N. Convention Against Torture. He was appointed the independent expert by the U.N. Commission on Human Rights to draft the statute establishing international jurisdiction over the implementation of the Apartheid Convention of 1981. Bassiouni was the Chairman of the U.N. Commission investigating international humanitarian law violations in the former Yugoslavia, work that led to the Ad-Hoc Tribunal on the Former Yugoslavia in the Hague. His many accomplishments led to his election in 1995 as Vice-Chairman of the U.N. General Assembly Committee for the establishment of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. 
   For his work leading to the establishment of the International Criminal Court, and for his dedication to protecting human rights, Professor Bassiouni has been nominated for the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize. The nominating organization, the International and Scientific Professional Advisory Council of the UN has said that Professor Bassiouni was the ``single most driving force behind the global decision to establish the International Criminal Court.'' This court prosecutes and brings to justice internationally, those who have committed crimes against humanity. His accomplishments in this field have caused Professor Bassiouni to be known as the ``father of the International Criminal Court.'' 
   Professor Bassiouni has been a great asset to the people of all nations. It was his dedication and perseverance, in the face of great odds, that helped create an institution that holds accountable those who choose to commit human rights abuses. The vision of Professor Bassiouni has culminated in a system that ensures that those who commit crimes against humanity do not go unpunished. 
   Mr. President, M. Cherif Bassiouni has made an important difference in the battle against human rights abuses. It is my pleasure to rise today to pay tribute to his extraordinary work and to congratulate him on his Nobel Peace Prize nomination.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing America's Red Rock Wilderness Act to protect an important part of our nation's natural heritage. America's Red Rock Wilderness Act  designates 9.1 million acres of public land in Utah as wilderness. 
   Passage of America's Red Rock Wilderness Act is essential to protect a national treasure for future generations of Americans. It provides wilderness protection for magnificent canyons, red rock cliffs and rock formations unlike any on earth. The lands included in this legislation contain steep slick rock canyons, high cliffs offering spectacular vistas of rare rock formations, desert lands, important archeological sites, and habitat for rare plant and animal species. 
   The areas designated for wilderness protection in America's Red Rock Wilderness Act are based on a detailed inventory of lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management conducted by volunteers from the Utah Wilderness Coalition. Between 1996 and 1998, UWC volunteers and staff surveyed thousands of square miles of BLM land, taking over 50,000 photos and compiling documentation to ensure that these areas meet federal wilderness criteria. 
   As a result of this inventory, an additional 3.4 million acres not included in earlier Utah wilderness bills have been added to the wilderness designations in America's Red Rock Wilderness Act. Most of the areas added to the bill are in the remote Great Basin deserts in the western portion of the state and the red rock canyons in Southern Utah, which had not been included in earlier inventories. 
   Recently, BLM completed a re-inventory of approximately 6 million acres of federal land which had been proposed for wilderness designation in previous wilderness bills. The results provide a convincing confirmation of the inventory conducted by UWC volunteers. Of the 6 million acres it re-inventoried, BLM found that 5.8 million acres qualified for wilderness consideration. Almost all of these lands are included in America's Red Rock Wilderness Act. 
   Theodore Roosevelt once stated, ``The Nation behaves well if it treats the natural resources as assets which it must turn over to the next generation increased and not impaired in value.'' Unfortunately, these fragile, scenic lands in Utah are threatened by oil, gas and mining interests, destructive use by off-road vehicles, increased commercial development, and proposals to construct roads, communication towers, transmission lines, and dams. We must act now to protect these lands for future generations. 
   America's Red Rock Wilderness Act is supported by a broad coalition of over 150 environmental, conservation, and recreational organizations and citizen groups. In independent television and newspaper surveys and public hearings on this issue, the citizens of Utah also have expressed overwhelming support for a strong wilderness bill. 
   Yesterday was John Muir's birthday. He observed that ``Thousands of tired, nerve-shaken, over-civilized people are beginning to find out that going to the mountains is going home; that wilderness is a necessity; that mountain parks and reservations are useful not only as fountains of timber and irrigating rivers, but as fountains of life.'' America's Red Rock Wilderness Act honors his vision. 
   The preservation of our nation's vital natural resources will be one of our most important legacies. I urge my colleagues to join me as a cosponsor of this important bill to protect the America's Red Rock Wilderness area in Utah for future generations.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to close the U.S. Army School of the Americas. The school is the Army's Spanish language training facility for Latin American personnel. It is located in Fort Benning, GA. The school is a relic of the cold war with a terrible legacy of teaching torture and assassination. It deserves to be closed for what it has taught in the past, what it stands for in Latin American democracies today, and what its counterinsurgency training at such a tainted institution may create in the future. 
   This school was formed after World War II. Its mission, starting in the 1960s, was to fight Communist insurgencies in Latin America. To do this, instruction manuals used at the school from 1982 to 1991 recommended execution, torture, and blackmail of insurgents. These manuals at the U.S. Army School of the Americas advocated that Latin American militaries spy on and infiltrate civic organizations such as opposition political parties, community organizations, and unions. They fundamentally confused what constitutes armed insurgency with genuine civic opposition. To the Latin American dictators of the time, insurgents were anybody who did not agree with them, leading to a virtual war against civilians, religious leaders, and Native Americans. 
   The Chicago Tribune recently wrote an editorial noting the fact that there would likely be very few reunions of the graduates of the Army School of the Americas. It is not surprising when you take a look at the list of the graduates of this U.S. Army School of the Americas and consider that it contains a list of some of the worst human rights abusers in recent Latin American history. 
   Let me be specific: 19 Salvadoran soldiers linked to the murder of 6 Jesuit priests, their housekeeper, and her daughter in El Salvador in 1989. Among the other graduates of the School of the Americas: 48 of 69 Salvadoran military members cited at the United Nations Truth Commission report on El Salvador for involvement in human rights violations. The list goes on: Former Panamanian dictator and convicted drug dealer Manuel Noriega and nine other Latin American military dictators; El Salvador death squad leader Roberto D'Aubuisson; two of the three killers of Catholic Archbishop Oscar Romero of El Salvador. 
   I continue reading the list of graduates from the U.S. Army School of the Americas at Fort Benning, GA: Mexican General Juan Lopez Ortiz, whose troops committed the Ocosingo massacre in Chiapas in 1994; Guatamalan Colonel Julio Alpirez, linked to the murder of U.S. citizen Michael Devine in 1990, and Efrain Bamaca, husband of Jennifer Harbury in 1992; 124 of the 247--more than half--Colombian military officials accused of human rights violations in the 1992 work ``State Terrorism in Colombia,'' compiled by a large coalition of European and Colombian nongovernmental organizations; 2 of the 3 officers prosecuted by Guatemala for masterminding the killing of anthropologist Myrna MACK in 1992, as well as several leaders of the notorious Guatamalan military unit D-2. 
   I continue to read the list of graduates of the U.S. Army School of the Americas at Fort Benning, GA: Argentinian dictator Leopoldo Galtieri, a leader of the so-called ``dirty war,'' during which some 30,000 civilians were killed or ``disappeared;'' Haitian Colonel Gambetta Hyppolite, who ordered his soldiers to fire on a provincial electoral bureau in 1987; several Peruvian military officers linked to the July 1992 killings of 9 students and a professor from La Cantuta University. 
   I read on from the list of graduates of the U.S. Army School of the Americas, Fort Benning, GA: Several Honduran officers linked to a clandestine military force known as Battalion 316 responsible for disappearances in the 1980s; 10 of the 12 officers responsible for the murder of 900 civilians in the El Salvadoran village of El Mozote; and, finally, 3 of the 5 officers involved in the 1980 rape and murder of 4 U.S. churchwomen in El Salvador. These are all graduates of the U.S. Army School of the Americas, Fort Benning, GA. 
   This school is not a victim of a few isolated incidents of wrongdoing by its graduates. This list shows that human rights violations are endemic among its graduates, with far in excess of 200 murders and other human rights violators by its past roll of honor graduates. 
   Can the School of the Americas claim innocence in the actions of its graduates? Many do not think it is possible. For example, just a few months ago the Guatemalan Truth Commission Report faulted the school's counterinsurgency training as having ``had a significant impact on the human rights violations during the armed conflict,'' a conflict that killed 200,000 people. 
   How, in the name of humanity or democracy, can the people of America allow this school to remain open? How can we sanction the legacy perpetuated by its name today? The Latin American dictatorships of the 1970s and 1980s have given way to democracy, some fragile, some strong. But to the people of these countries, the continued existence of the Army School of the Americas perpetuates the unfortunate link between the United 
   States and the perpetrators of the heinous crimes I have just listed. The school should be closed to send a powerful signal to democratic countries of Latin America that America repudiates the terror, the torture, and the murder carried out against civilian populations by Central and South American military forces run amok. 
   I am not proposing that we hold this U.S. foreign military program accountable for the actions attributed to the graduates. We know from experience that people can be brutal with or without training. But neither can we deny the links of those human rights abusers to the School of the Americas. Just a few of those examples should have been enough for us to quickly close that school in shame. 
   In the post-cold-war era, it is more important than ever for the United States to promote democratic values and human rights in developing countries and to reject militaries that view their own countries' citizens as the enemy. 
   The Pentagon will tell you that the Army has tried to make changes at the school by updating the curriculum to include discussions of human rights and by approving the selection process for students and the quality of the teaching staff. I do not doubt that some changes have been made, but I am not confident that these changes are enough or could ever be enough at a facility with such a sorry history. 
   To be sure the continuing counterinsurgency training will not lead to future abuses against legitimate civic opposition, we must close this school. The U.S. Army School of the Americas is trying to sell itself with a new mission--certainly a topical mission--counternarcotics training. But the Chicago Tribune in an April 16 editorial addressed this assertion of a new mission directly:  
   Attempts to recast the school as an anti-narcotics center are so much hokum. Little in the curriculum is related to drug interdiction, and it is not at all clear that the U.S. Army is qualified to impart such instruction or that training the notoriously meddlesome Latin militaries to get involved in civilian law enforcement is advisable.  
   Most importantly, cosmetic changes in the curriculum cannot salvage the savage reputation of this school's graduates or erase the U.S. Army School of the Americas' bloody and embarrassing legacy. We offer plenty of other training opportunities for Latin American military personnel. We do not need this school, Latin America's fragile democracies do not need it, and it should be closed. 
   Last weekend it was my privilege to be part of a delegation sent by the leadership in Congress to go to Germany, Italy, Albania, Macedonia, and Belgium. During that visit, we met many of America's finest men and women in uniform who are literally doing their duty for this country, fighting to protect democracy and to accomplish the mission that has been assigned to them. I was so proud to be there and greet those from Illinois and from around the country and to thank them for the job they are doing for this country. 
   What I am about today is no reflection on them. In fact, I suggest to the leaders in the Pentagon, in the name of the men and women currently in uniform, to make certain that they don't  have to answer the troubling questions about the existence of this School of the Americas, it should be closed forthwith. 
   If there are those who want to come forward and suggest there are some missions at the school that can be transferred to another place, entirely peaceful, entirely constructive, entirely defensible, I will listen to that and I am open to it. But, please, once and for all let us close this sorry, sad chapter at the U.S. Army School of the Americas at Fort Benning, GA.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to address for a moment as well some reflections on the visit I made this past weekend as part of this delegation. It was a delegation that flew from Washington Andrews Air Force base to Ramstein Air Force Base in Germany where we met with General Wesley Clark, the Supreme Allied Commander of the NATO forces for our mission in Kosovo and Serbia. We then went to a war room at that base and met, as I mentioned earlier, with some of the most amazing young men and women that America could ever hope to bring to this cause. They are so filled with energy and commitment and enthusiasm that it really makes you proud to be an American, to be in their midst. You see the amazing technology at their disposal and realize without their dedication and their talent it would mean little or nothing. 
   We flew the next morning from that Air Force base directly, on a cargo plane, to Albania, one of the poorest countries in Europe, where, on a lengthy landing strip, we saw one of the most massive humanitarian efforts undertaken since World War II in Europe. Countries literally from all over the world are rallying for the Kosovo refugees. Among them you could see evidence of humanitarian assistance from the French, the Swedes, of course the Americans; helicopters from the United Arab Emirates--so many different countries coming together in this humanitarian undertaking. The men and women who have to endure the most primitive conditions living there to protect this humanitarian airlift, again, deserve our praise, because there they sit literally on a muddy delta in their tents doing their duty. I was proud to represent this Nation and represent the State of Illinois in thanking them so much for their sacrifice. 
   We flew from Albania, after meeting with the Prime Minister, to Macedonia, part of the trip which I may never forget as long as I live, because we visited a refugee camp at a place outside of Skopje, Macedonia, the camp known as Brazda, or Stakovac. Two weeks ago, this camp did not exist. Today, it has 32,000 people in it. In the 48 hours before we arrived, over 7,000 refugees came across the border out of Kosovo, looking for safety. 
   I walked into that camp which had been built by NATO and was being managed by the Catholic Relief Services and was literally mobbed when I offered a piece of candy to a young child. They saw an American with a bag full of candy and they wanted to come up and meet me right away. I passed out a lot of these Hershey Kisses to the kids, and their parents stood around. With a translator, I asked them: Why are you here? Open-ended question, no propaganda: Why did you leave Kosovo? 
   The story was the same over and over again. Simple people leading ordinary lives in the villages of Kosovo would hear a knock on the door in the middle of the night, only to be greeted by people in black ski masks, some of whom they knew right away to be their neighbors, who announced they had 5 minutes to pick up anything they wanted to pick up with them and leave the country because their house was about to be burned down or blown up. In many cases, the head of the family, if he were a young adult male, was taken away from them. The rest were pushed out in the road and they started their walk, their walk to safety, their walk out of Kosovo. 
   You know, when you see pictures of refugee camps around the world, you see some very sad scenes. Many times the people are 
   very poor, starving, very sick, some dying on the spot. That was not the case at these refugee camps. These people, as I said, were ordinary people leading their lives, who were disrupted because of Slobodan Milosevic's ethnic cleansing. What was their crime? They committed no crime other than to have, as far as Mr. Milosevic was concerned, the wrong ethnic background, the wrong culture, the wrong religion. You see, he is cleansing his country, as he says, of these undesirables. 
   I am not sure what the word genocide means to most people, but when I saw these people, the tens of thousands, shunned, rejected, persecuted and pushed out of their homes, now trying to make a simple life in a refugee camp, I understood genocide and ``geno-suffering.'' 
   Some people ask a question: Why is the United States involved in this? Why do we care? What does this have to do with America? Come on, these are people in Serbia and they always fight, don't they? 
   I think there is more to the story because what is at stake here is Europe, and Europe has always had a special meaning to the United States. In this century, we fought two World Wars, we have given the best of our country in defense of causes that we felt were right against Nazism, against communism, to make certain that Europe was peaceful, had stability, was there, and they were friends of the United States. It means something to the people of Europe. 
   This morning, as part of the NATO summit, the Polish Prime Minister came here on Capitol Hill. It was a wonderful celebratory gathering, for breakfast: Poland, so proud and happy to be part of NATO. Think of that, that this country that went through such deprivation during World War II under the heel of communism for so many decades had finally pushed it aside through their own courage and determination and said once and for all: We are not neutral in our future. We are part of the West. We want to be part of NATO. That is where we belong. 
   I am proud of that, proud of that as an American that Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland became part of NATO and are dedicated to the principle of democracy, something we are all about in the United States. What a great celebration will happen in Washington, even under the shadow of the war that goes on, as these NATO allies come together, determined to make a better future in Europe. That is one of the reasons we are there. 
   Second, NATO itself is being tested. The NATO alliance has come forward and said we will not allow a dictator in Europe who pursues these policies of genocide, who has initiated four wars in 10 years, who tomorrow will start another war and pick some more innocent victims--we cannot have a stable Europe with this in place. Slobodan Milosevic must be stopped. Mr. President, 18 allied nations turned to the United States and said: Are you with us? Will you be with us in this mission?  I am glad President Clinton said yes. I voted for the airstrikes. I think it was the appropriate response for NATO against Milosevic. 
   The third issue is one of values, values as to whether or not we stand for anything as Americans. God knows we have throughout our history. We do not get engaged in wars to pick up territory or to come back with loot and booty. We get engaged in wars for values. That is what it was all about in World War II; to make sure that Hitler and his genocide would come to an end once and for all, to make certain in the cold war 
   that we stopped the spread of communism in Europe. Now, today, in this mission in Kosovo, we say we are standing again for values that are important, not only in the United States, but in Europe and around the world. 
   There are some who question this, and I understand it. I am not one who runs quickly to get involved in any military undertaking. I only wish those who have doubts about this would have been with me last Saturday afternoon, walking through this camp in Brazda, in Macedonia, or, frankly, in many other camps, where the 350,000 Kosovo refugees now in Albania are living in tents and under sheets of plastic--over 120,000 in Macedonia, over 30,000 in Montenegro. Honestly, these are the lucky refugees. They got out alive. They are under the protection of NATO. 
   The unluckiest are still left behind, those who are still hiding out as refugees in Kosovo, in the woods, hoping they can survive another day until this war comes to an end and it is safe to go home. Those who were brought in, conscripted as slave labor in the Serbian Army, those are the ones who were unlucky. Those are the ones we have to always remember are part of our mission. 
   Earlier this morning, we were visited by the Prime Minister of Great Britain, Tony Blair. I had never met him before. He is an impressive individual. I can understand why the people of that nation have decided to choose him as a leader. He said some things that were flattering, but I think well worth sharing as I speak to you today. He said the United States has a special place in this world. It is an example to the rest of the world so many times. He said, ``I can't tell you how many times we say thank God for America and its leadership.'' I am proud of that. And I am proud of the men and women who have made it possible, 
   Those pilots who put their lives on the line every night in the bombers, soon in the helicopters, to try to bring this war to a conclusion and peace to Yugoslavia. 
   I am proud, too, of the families back home who wait, hoping that they will return safely. I am proud of the families of the three POWs who have been captured there. I want to let them know we will never forget those prisoners. They are in our thoughts and our prayers every moment until they come home safely, as they will. 
   I think we have to stay this course. We have three difficult choices at this moment. We can leave, and if we leave, what have we left behind? This penny-ante dictator with his genocide and ethnic cleansing who will pick another helpless target? 
   Some say we should have a ground war. I am not for that. I do not think that will work. Or we can pursue this air campaign, a campaign which has gone on about 26 days, about which 13 or 14 days we have had good weather. If we pick up the intensity of this bombing, Mr. Milosevic will understand there is a price to pay for his horrible policy of ethnic cleansing. 
   If this ends as we want it to, we will close the 20th century with peace in Europe. We will be able to say to Europeans wherever they live that the United States, your partner, stood by your side during one of the bloodiest centuries in the history of Europe. When it was all over, the values we cherish, the values we fought for, prevailed. That is what is at stake here, and that is what I hope most Americans will recall. 
   Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I say at the outset, I salute the Senator on his remarks. I think he struck the right tone. There is a sense of mourning and sadness across America for what happened in Colorado. 
   We have to address the needs of troubled children. I think the Senator from New York was correct in highlighting that. I think he also calls us to task, too, to do something sensible about gun control. A troubled child is a sad thing; a troubled child with a gun can be a tragedy not just for himself but for a lot of innocent youngsters. 
   I ask the Senator if he can indicate to Members those legislative initiatives we should be considering that might slow down the violence we are seeing too often in America and too frequently in our schools?

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I commend my colleagues for the time they have taken on the floor to talk about the situation in Kosovo. I was privileged this last weekend to be selected to be part of the first leadership delegation to go to the Balkans. It was a joint House and Senate delegation involving Democrats and Republicans, and it was a whirlwind trip. We all came back exhausted, but I think each of us came back better informed about the situation. 
   I would like to speak to that a few moments, following up on the speech just given by my colleague. 
   Let me say at the outset that I am a product of the Vietnam era. I did not serve in the military nor in Vietnam, obviously, but I came to the conclusion, as a result of that experience, that war is the last resort; that there is no such thing as a military adventure. When military is involved, people die. It should be taken ever so seriously. 
   That has guided me through 17 years of service on Capitol Hill. I have not been quick to turn to the military or quick to pull the trigger. I have always looked for an alternative, a peaceful alternative. Yet, I believe we find ourselves in the Balkans in a situation where, frankly, there was no alternative but the use of force. 
   The Senator raised the question about what in the world is our national interest in Kosovo? Most Americans could not find it on a map. Why are we sending all this money and all of our troops, all of the resources of this country focused on Serbia? Why? 
   It is part of Europe. It is part of a continent where the United States has a special interest. And if there is any doubt about that special interest, merely tour the veterans cemeteries in Europe, because in World War I and World War II, our best and brightest in America put on their uniforms, picked up their guns and went to Europe to defend the stability and future of that continent. 
   We have an Atlantic alliance, not just because of a common ethnic heritage, but because we believe the synergy between the United States and Europe brings strength to the Atlantic, brings strength to both countries, both regions, and we have committed ourselves to that. 
   Today, as you look at the map of Europe, the investments we made in two World Wars and the cold war has paid off so well. We now have former Warsaw Pact nations, like Poland, like the Czech Republic and like Hungary, waiting in line and finally being accepted as part of the NATO alliance. They are part of our alliance. We won. We are bringing Europe together. Our leadership makes a difference. 
   But, yes, in one corner of Europe, a terrible thing has occurred over the last 12 years. A man by the name of Slobodan Milosevic has on four separate occasions started a war in this region of Europe. If you look at the nature of the war, you will find some harrowing language from this man. 
   Twelve years ago in Kosovo, he stood up to the Serbs and said, ``They will not beat you again,'' and heard this roar of approval. This man, who was a minor league Communist apparatchik, said, ``I have a rallying cry here. I can rally the Serbs in their hatred of other ethnic groups.'' If you think I am overstating the case, in 1989, he went to Kosovo, stood on a battlefield where a war had been fought in 1389 and the Serbs had lost to the Ottoman Turks, and announced his policy of ethnic cleansing. As a result of his policy, that region has been at war and in turmoil ever since. 
   For those who act surprised at Slobodan Milosevic, merely look at the history. For those who question why we are there, look at the history of the 20th century. We have said that Europe is important to the United States, and we have said something else: America does not go to war for territory or for treasure. We go to war for values. And the values at stake in this conflict are values that Americans can take at heart. 
   Some have said that President Clinton came up with Kosovo at the last minute. Yet, history tells us that as President George Bush left office, knowing what Milosevic was all about, he left a letter behind to President Clinton saying: Watch Kosovo. We have warned Milosevic--do not show your aggression toward the province of Kosovo. President George Bush knew that. President Clinton was forewarned. And he has tried, with limited success, to contain this man's barbarism. 
   Of course, they raise the question over whether or not we should have started the bombing in the Serbian area and in Kosovo. I voted for it. I voted for it because there was no alternative, none whatsoever. 
   Many people have questioned the strategy ever since--important questions, questions that should be answered. But at least we have the answer to one question. When the United States saw this ethnic cleansing, this genocide in Serbia, did we stand idly by and do nothing? The answer is no, and that is an important answer. 
   We decided to use the resources at our disposal to try to stop Milosevic from what he was doing. Of course, he is equally adept and should be recognized as a man of military means. He decided since he could not invade the neighboring nations of Albania and Macedonia with troops, he would overwhelm them with refugees. 
   Saturday, I spent the afternoon in a refugee camp in Macedonia, near Skopje, named Brazda. You read about it a lot. It is a camp that did not exist 2 weeks ago, and 32,000 people live there today in that camp. The day I came and the previous 2 days, 7,500 people had flooded into this camp from Kosovo. These are not the poorest of the poor dragging themselves in. These are teachers and businessmen. These are doctors and lawyers whose neighbors put on black ski masks and came to the door and said, ``Take everything  that you want in your arms and leave in 5 minutes; we're blowing up your house.'' You have heard it on television, but I heard it firsthand. 
   Standing in that camp and talking to those people, I asked a simple open-ended question: Why did you leave Kosovo? The stories came back the same time and time again. They did not leave for a crime or wrongdoing; they left because of who they were, and that is the nature of genocide and ``geno-suffering.'' 
   Now, of course, they are trying to survive, and we are helping them. Thank God we are. NATO is building camps. The humanitarian relief from around the world is inspiring, and yet these people wait, wondering what their fate will be. 
   I came away from that experience understanding better the Holocaust, understanding what must have been in the minds of so many Jewish people at the end of World War II who said: We need Israel because we have nowhere to go. Everywhere we go, we have been persecuted, we have been killed. Now the Kosovar refugees ask the same question: Where shall we go? 
   Our policy is to allow them to return to Kosovo. That is where they want to be. That is where they should be. We have said to Mr. Milosevic: Here is what we are asking of you, demanding of you: Remove your troops from Kosovo, allow the refugees to return in safety with an international force to protect them, and then we will negotiate the political status. 
   I think that is sensible and humane. 
   May I say a word, too, about Russia. Yes, I am concerned about the reaction of Russia. It is important that Russia 
   prosper and get stronger. We have helped in many ways and can do more, and I am sure we will. But Russia is a master of its own destiny, too. If it decides it is better to be an ally of Slobodan Milosevic than an ally of the United States, then, of course, it is a decision they can freely make and one with which they will have to live. 
   I hope they do not make that decision. I hope instead of arming Milosevic so he can shoot down American and NATO planes that they will decide they can play a more positive and constructive role; that Russia could be part of the brokerage of peace, lasting peace in the region; that Russia could provide some troops in an international peacekeeping force in Kosovo so that it will be more acceptable to the Serbian side. They can do that, and I hope that they will. But I think it is faulty logic to argue that we should restrain our foreign policy for fear that the Russians might react against it. Did we stop to ask the Russians whether we should bomb Saddam Hussein? I certainly hope not. We knew what our national interest was, and we proceeded with it. 
   We hope the Russians will be with us, but they certainly should not have a veto over our foreign policy. 
   Allow me, if you will, to speak for a moment about the state of our military. General Wes Clark, who is our commander in chief now of the NATO operations in Kosovo, is an extraordinary man. He was first in his class at West Point, a Rhodes scholar. He is articulate, dedicated, and patriotic. Thank God for him and people just like him who have dedicated their lives and service to our country. 
   He met with us at great length and answered literally every question we had to ask about this operation. Is he frustrated? Of course, he is. This is NATO's first war. America has fought wars before, but this is a war by committee with 19 nations gathering together to talk of strategy, and that is a frustration to any commander in chief. He understands our mission, and he is executing it professionally. 
   It troubles me to hear some of my friends on the other side of the aisle suggest that after 25 days of bombing in Serbia and Kosovo somehow or another the American military might has been decimated. 
   I sure did not see that, not at Aviano Air Base or Ramstein in Germany. I saw a strong military that needs our support. I do not believe it is in the weak condition that many of my colleagues are suggesting. 
   The President said we need $6 billion to make sure it continues to be strong. I hope we move on that quickly and we do not use this request by the administration as an excuse to get into a prolonged political debate about whether or not the military has been treated well over the last few years. Let us focus on the immediate needs: Supplying our troops and making certain they can defend themselves and successfully prosecute this mission. 
   Let me also say that the Senator concluded with three recommendations about refugees. I disagree with his conclusion that we move them to another place. They want to return to Kosovo. They should return to Kosovo. I agree with him in bringing Russia in for peace negotiations. And I certainly agree with his conclusion that we should not involve ground troops in this effort. 
   I say to those who are witnessing this event, the American people are now focusing more on it, as they should. My visit over the last 3 days, this last weekend, focused my attention on it as well. I am proud of what the United States is doing. I am proud of what NATO is doing and what it stands for. I believe we are standing for values that we have stood for for at least the 20th century, if not longer. 
   I believe we can succeed. But we cannot succeed when a television program like ``Nightline,'' 7 days into the war, has a program entitled ``The Kosovo Crisis: Still no end in sight.'' Seven days--7 days into the war they want it over with, and all the political pundits are coming on television on Sunday and saying, well, we must have lost that war. It is a good thing they were not around during the Battle of the Bulge. Who knows how that war might have ended? It is going to take patience and determination to bring this to a good conclusion. I hope Members of both political parties will join together to make that happen. 
   I will tell you, when there was a vote on the Persian Gulf war, President Bush came to Congress and asked for our approval. I voted against it. I did not think it was necessary. I thought we could achieve our goals without the use of the military. But I lost and the vote went against me; the military action was approved. Immediately after that vote, a resolution was introduced, and passed overwhelmingly on a bipartisan basis, that said the debate is behind us now, we are behind our men and women in uniform, and we will stay behind them to the end. 
   There will be plenty of time to debate this. History will be the judge of whether we did the right thing and did it in the right way. For the time being, let us, as a nation, let those of us, as elected officials in the Senate and the House, have the determination to stand behind this policy. 
   What are our options? Well, there are three. We can stand behind this policy of bombing, or we can leave, or we can send in ground troops. It is an easy choice for me. I am going to stand behind this policy, because the future of NATO is at stake, the future of Europe is at stake, and the values of the United States, that we have defended so long, are at stake as well. 
   Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. DURBIN. 
   Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a private bill for the relief of Corina Dechalup of France. My bill would grant permanent resident status to Corina, affording her the legal security she needs to rebuild her life in this country. 
   Corina Dechalup first arrived in the United States from France in February 1990. She was admitted under the visa waiver pilot program after her then-fiancee Marin Turcinovic of Croatia was injured. Admitted on an H-1 visa in January 1990, Marin was hit by a car in Fairview, New Jersey in February 1990. Both of his legs were shattered. His spinal cord was severed, leaving him paralyzed below the neck. He will probably never walk again. Both Marin and Corina have been in the United States since their initial entries.  
   Corina and Marin married in February 1996, six years after his accident. Corina is an essential part of Marin's life. She has been with Marin throughout his ordeal and has been instrumental in coordinating his medical care. She has directly provided care for Marin, and he could never have reached the degree of recovery he now enjoys without her support. 
   Marin requires 24-hour medical care for his survival. An insurance settlement from litigation filed after the accident provides Marin with lifetime medical and rehabilitative care. Marin and Corina currently live in a specially modified house located in the Beverly community of Chicago. According to Marin's lawyers, the insurance settlement that provides for Marin's lifetime shelter and medical care would not cover him at another location. 
   Marin was granted permanent resident status on September 30, 1998, pursuant to former section 244 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Though he can now file a petition requesting permanent resident status for Corina, she will still face a four to five year wait. Because she entered the U.S. under the visa waiver pilot program, she was subject to an order of deportation, without the right to an administrative hearing, once she overstayed her 90-day authorized admission in February 1990. Since 1994, she has received a stay of deportation in one year increments. She cannot currently travel to see her family in France, and she has no assurance that her stay will be renewed from one year to the next. 
   Before arriving in the U.S., Corina, a university graduate, worked as a tour guide for a Yugoslavian tourist agency. Although her days are primarily devoted to Marin, she has the skills and desire to find part-time employment and would like to obtain authorization to work. 
   Mr. President, nine years ago, fate tragically changed forever the lives of Corina Dechalup of France and her husband Marin Turcinovic of Croatia. A terrible accident in the United States left Marin permanently injured, making his return home impossible. Fortunately for Marin, he had the love and support of Corina, who left her home and her family to devote her life to him. Given the tremendous adversity that she faces on a day-to-day basis, I believe it appropriate for Congress to grant her permanent resident status. Such status would clear up much of the uncertainty that currently clouds her future, and would allow Corina and her husband to rebuild their lives in our country with confidence.

    Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize April 28, 1999, as ``Illinois Student Technology Day.'' On that day, approximately 140 schools will participate in school technology demonstrations at the eighth annual Students for the Information Age program at the Illinois State Capitol Building in Springfield. 
   During this all-day event in the middle of National Science & Technology Week, over 300 Illinois students will demonstrate the important impact technology, and access to it, has had in their classrooms. 
   The advancements that have been made in technology, and the role it has played in increasing access to valuable information and resources, has improved the learning experience for many of our nation's students. Technology has clearly become a powerful instrument for enhancing the learning process. With the advent of the information age, it is more important than ever to expose students to technological innovations that will play a crucial role in their intellectual development. We need to redouble our efforts to ensure that more students, especially those in rural and impoverished areas, have access to these technological advancements. 
   I hope that we can look at what will take place in Springfield, IL, on April 28, 1999, as a sign of the continuing commitment to give our students the best possible opportunity to learn and succeed both in the classroom and in their later careers.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the ranking Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee, Senator FRANK LAUTENBERG, who has announced his retirement. He is headed for the last budget roundup. This is the second to the last stop. I have one more year with FRANK LAUTENBERG as spokesman on that committee who has made an enormous contribution to the committee, his State, to this Nation, and certainly this budget deliberation. We are going to miss him. He has done a great job for America. 
   I have known for many years the chairman of this committee, Senator DOMENICI of New Mexico. When I was a member of the House Budget Committee, his reputation was well known. He has been a deficit hawk for as long as I have known him. I am sure he has some sense of relief today dealing with a budget that is in much better circumstances than it was a few years ago. That is due in no small measure to his contribution. Though I may disagree with him on this particular budget resolution, it does not diminish my respect for what he has done in this budget process in demanding honesty. I hope he will continue on that pursuit, and I hope we will share goals in the near future. I am looking forward to doing just that.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, having said all these wonderful things about Senator DOMENICI, I am going to tell you what is wrong with his budget resolution, and he is not going to be a bit surprised by all that.  
   There are a few things where we do disagree. As Senator GRAMS of Minnesota just mentioned, there is overriding concern by all of us about the future of Social Security. I think Senator CONRAD on the Democratic side offered a very novel, imaginative, and positive contribution to this debate when he suggested we lock up the Social Security surplus for Social Security. 
   This would be done by requiring that an extraordinary vote of 60 votes would be required to spend the Social Security trust fund surplus for anything other than Social Security. We understand Social Security is a solid covenant between generations. Without it, 16 million more Americans would live in poverty, and Social Security is the principal source of income for two-thirds of older Americans and the only source of income for nearly one-fifth of our seniors. 
   This trust fund will go bankrupt in the year 2034 when people like myself, if we are lucky to be alive, will be part of the huge baby-boom generation looking to a smaller pool of American workers to sustain us. That is why the actions we take today for the future of Social Security are so critically important. 
   I am afraid the Republican alternative in this budget resolution is not nearly as good as Senator CONRAD's suggestion of a 60-vote lockbox. I am afraid we have fallen short of the mark when coming to guaranteeing the future of Social Security in this budget resolution. 
   There is another element, though, that is even more mystifying. There is an old poem that goes something like this:  
   As I was walking up the stair, I met a man who wasn't there. He wasn't there again today. I wish that man would go away.  
   The man I am talking about is Medicare. The problem with Medicare will not go away. The Medicare trust fund is expected to go bankrupt in the year 2015. If that is not bad enough, as baby boomers like myself retire, the strain will become even greater. By 2034, the number of Medicare beneficiaries is expected to double to almost 80 million American seniors. 
   The Democrats had a proposal to deal with that. The Democrats came forward and said we should dedicate a substantial portion of any future surplus to go to Medicare so that in addition to reforming Medicare, we would be putting our surplus funds into it so that it would be strong for many years to come. Our lockbox proposal for Medicare would save $376 billion of the budget surplus for the next 10 years, and it would extend Medicare solvency by 12 years to the year 2027. 
   By locking these funds away, we make sure the country will have time for a serious debate on the future of Medicare reform while we are certain that it is going to be solvent. Unfortunately and sadly, and almost without explanation, the Republican budget proposal before us today does not put away a single penny--not one cent--for Medicare. It does not extend the life of the trust fund by a single day. That, I think, is an abdication of responsibility, not just to the 40 million seniors who depend on Medicare but to their children who want their parents and grandparents to live in dignity and without worry about medical bills. 
   If we ignore Medicare, we are ignoring a looming crisis. This budget resolution does not address it. We will be hearing from the other side about how this budget resolution ``fully funds Medicare.'' But a fully funded Medicare is still going to go bankrupt in just 16 years. The truth is, this budget does not do anything substantial for the Medicare system. It could leave it withering on the vine from neglect. 
   This chart indicates the difference in approach between the Republican side in blue and the Democratic side in red about the dedication of surpluses for Social Security and Medicare. 
   You can see a substantial difference between the two; in the years 2000 to 2004 composite--the first graph--and then later the 2000 to 2009 composite. It indicates the different dedication of funds to make certain Medicare is included in any plan that is a part of this budget resolution. 
   Let me speak for a moment about tax cuts, too. As I have said many times, there is just no more appealing phrase for a politician than, ``I favor a tax cut.'' People cheer, ``Oh, we love you. This is great.'' But we have to be honest with the American people. Some politicians in the past have talked about, ``Read my lips: No new taxes.'' The American people learned a lesson there. They want honest talk about taxes. They do not want promises that cannot be kept or promises that we should not keep. The Democratic plan has targeted tax cuts, after we dedicated funds for Social Security, after we dedicated funds for Medicare. We kept a substantial portion aside for tax cuts targeted for the American families truly in need. 
   That would include USA accounts, the President suggested, so that more working families can save for retirement. 
   Long-term care tax credits, think of how many people are worried about their parents and grandparents now in nursing homes or in need of special care. This $1,000 tax credit would be a helping hand to literally millions of Americans in that predicament. 
   The child and dependent care tax credit, we proposed $6.3 billion to help pay for child care. We want Americans to work. But while they work, we want their children to be in safe and loving hands. And that means quality day care and stepping in to help low-income families so they can pay for that day care. And a tax credit for work-related expenses for people with disabilities. This will defray special employment-related costs incurred by those people with disabilities, such as transportation and technology costs. 
   Our tax cuts are geared to make certain that we meet our obligations first to Social Security and Medicare, and then to the American working families who most deserve them. It is still a mystery as to what the Republican tax cut will be. I am not sure. Perhaps we will have an explanation of it sometime later today before we vote on this budget resolution. 
   But, in fact, we have heard one proposal from JOHN KASICH, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, about a 10-percent, across-the-board tax cut. What would that tax cut mean? It is a good day to ask the question--on April 15. 
   For those with incomes under $38,000 a year, the Republican tax cut of Mr. KASICH is $99 a year. That is almost $8.25 a month that people will have to spend under the Republican tax cut, if they happen to be among the 60 percent of working Americans who make less than $38,000 a year. Think of it--a Republican tax cut that might pay half of your cable TV bill each month. Isn't that something to look forward to? 
   But if you happen to be in an income category in the stratosphere--over $300,000 a year--a 10-percent tax cut is $20,697. 
   So the people with the money are given the tax cuts. The folks who are working to raise their families and pay their bills, under this Republican tax-cut plan, get $99 a year. I do not think that is fair. April 15 is a good time to talk about taxes. I want to remind my wife to get the forms in the mail before midnight back home. We want to make sure we do file our taxes on time, as all Americans should. But I hope that we will 
   take a minute to reflect on the tax burden in America and what has happened to it. 
   The median family income in America--that is the average--is $54,000. If you look at the tax burden on working families in America over the last 22 years, you will see an interesting thing has occurred. The taxes had gone up in the early 1980s, and then started coming down; and then look where they have dropped by 1999--the lowest tax burden in 23 years. 
   Anyone writing a check today will say, ``I wish it was even lower,'' but the fact is it has been coming down. The U.S. Treasury reports a family of four, with the median income of $54,900, will pay the lowest percentage of its income in taxes since 1976. It shows that many families with half the median income--these are folks making about $27,000 a year--let me show this chart here--some of our hardest working families, I might add--will actually pay no income tax at all or get a check back from the government. They have an average income tax burden of a negative 1 percent. Their overall tax burden is the lowest in more than 30 years. This chart indicates it is the lowest in 35 years. A family of four can make up to as much as $28,000 and not owe a dime in taxes. 
   Incidentally, one of the reasons many of these family tax burdens are lower is  because of our expansion of the earned income tax credit in 1993. This tax credit focuses on helping working families. 
   What a contrast: A Republican proposal by a Congressman from Ohio for a tax cut to benefit the wealthiest; the earned income tax credit designed to help working families. It really tells a world of difference in philosophy when it comes to tax cuts. 
   The interesting thing is if you look at those who are doing pretty well in America, those making twice the median income; that would be over $109,000 a year. Their tax burden is also declining. The average Federal tax burden of a family of four with twice the median income is the lowest it has been since 1988, and the second lowest since 1977. 
   We back these figures up by an analysis, not from some Democratic Party organ but, rather, the accounting firm Deloitte and Touche, a group recognized as reputable in the field. Their analysis shows that the average Federal tax rate is lower today than it was 20 years ago for virtually every type of taxpayer. 
   We want to continue that, target the tax cuts to the families that need it the most, but it is not in this budget resolution--an approach which is so general as to suggest we would be giving tax cuts to the wealthiest among us instead of those who work the hardest, the working families struggling to put their kids through school. 
   We are going to face a crisis here on this budget debate, and it will come soon. I am afraid when we take a look at the Republican budget resolution, with tax cuts for wealthy people, we are going to find ourselves cutting back on a lot of spending. Some on the Republican side have stood up and very honestly said that is OK, ``We believe that cutting back on Federal spending is good at any cost.'' I have second thoughts about that, because some of the programs which we will cut with this budget resolution are critically important to many American families. 
   As a result of this resolution, as many as 100,000 fewer American kids would have access to Head Start--Head Start-- 
   that early childhood development program where kids get a chance to prepare themselves for kindergarten and first grade. One-hundred thousand more kids in America would be off the program as a result of this budget resolution. 
   Another program, that is near and dear to my heart, the WIC Program--Women, Infants, and Children Program--brings in pregnant mothers, mothers with young children, and helps them with nutritional assistance during the pregnancy and after the children are born. One out of four American babies is in this program. Lower-income families need this helping hand to make sure their kids get nutritious food and so that the mother is healthy when she delivers the baby. 
   Is there any better investment of money in this country than doing what we can to make sure that our pregnant mothers and their children, at their earliest age, are off to a healthy, nutritious start? This Republican budget resolution will cut over 1.2 million low-income women, children, and infants from the WIC Program. How can that make this a better country? 
   And when it comes to some basic things, we all abhor drugs in America and drug crimes, and yet with this budget we will be forced to cut the number of Border Patrol agents who are trying to ferret out those smuggling narcotics into America. So 1,350 fewer Border Patrol agents, 780 fewer drug enforcement agency personnel out there fighting the war on drugs--think about that for a second. Does that make any sense? More drugs in America, so we would have more people ultimately committing crimes and going to prison because we give a tax cut to the wealthiest people in this country. This is upside down thinking and a reason why many of us question its wisdom. 
   Funding eliminated for 21 Superfund sites; 73,000 summer jobs and training opportunities cut. 
   The list goes on. 
   Cuts in food safety. You ask the American people, what do you expect of your Federal Government? In the State of Iowa a poll said: The first thing is to make sure the food we eat is safe to eat. People are concerned about that. They hear about scandals where children eat tainted food, or the elderly do, and get seriously ill, if not die, and yet we cut back in the Department of Agriculture in areas of food safety. How can we possibly rationalize and explain that in the name of giving greater tax cuts to wealthy Americans? 
   Let me close by saying that I respect the hard work that has gone into this budget. I respect the serious difference of opinion between the Republican side and the Democratic side. 
   I think ours is a more balanced and rational approach. It takes care of the future of Social Security. It provides help for Medicare where the Republican budget resolution provides none. It provides tax cuts for families that really need it and doesn't give tax cuts to the wealthiest among us. It also provides that we will have the money available to meet the basic needs of America when it comes to educating kids, feeding pregnant mothers and children, providing for the kind of law enforcement that is essential for the security of this country. 
   I hope that before this is all said and done, President Clinton can bring the leaders on Capitol Hill, the Republican leaders in the Senate and the House, together and that we can work out some reasonable bipartisan compromise. I am afraid this budget resolution does not reflect that, and that is why I am going to respectfully oppose it and vote against it. 
   I yield back the remainder of my time.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to make a few remarks concerning a bill that Senator DEWINE and I are introducing today that we hope will improve the lives of many of the nation's asthmatic children. 
   Asthma is one of the most common chronic conditions in the U.S., affecting an estimated 14.9 million people, causing over 1.5 million emergency department visits and over 5,500 deaths in 1995, and estimated to cost over $14.5 billion by the year 2000. Asthma deaths have tripled over the past two decades despite improvements in clinical treatment. 
   Asthma is considered the worst chronic health problem affecting children. Childhood asthma has dramatically increased by over 160 percent since 1980. Currently, 7 percent of the nation's children suffer from asthma. It is particularly prevalent among the urban poor because of the lack of accessible health care and the high number of allergens in the environment. Research supported by the National Institutes of Health demonstrated that the combination of cockroach allergen, house dust mites, molds, tobacco smoke, and feathers are important causes of asthma-related illness and hospitalization among the children in inner-city areas of the United States. 
   To combat asthma, innovative community-based programs have been developed in some areas to fight this growing public health problem. For example, in Los Angeles the Asthma and Allergy Foundation has set up two ``breathmobiles.'' The converted motor homes, staffed by doctors and nurses, visit schools to test, treat, and educate at-risk children. Since the program began two years ago, there has been a 17 percent decline in the number of children visiting emergency rooms for asthma. 
   Today, I am introducing with Senator DEWINE ``The Childhood Asthma Initiative'' to help more communities create childhood asthma programs tailored to meet their local needs. This bill funds grants for state and community-based organizations to support a variety of treatment, educational, or preventive programs. The funds are targeted to areas where childhood asthma and asthma-associated mortality rates are high. This will enable those areas with the most need to provide services that reduce emergency room visits, create healthier environments, reduce mortality rates from asthma, and provide overall improved quality of life. The bill also helps enroll eligible asthmatic children in Medicaid or State Children's Health Insurance Programs (S-CHIP). Furthermore, the bill provides additional funding for S-CHIP to incorporate asthma screening, treatment, and education in to their programs. 
   The bill coordinates Federal asthma activities through the National Asthma Education Prevention Program Coordinating Committee, and increases data collection by the CDC on prevalence and mortality associated with asthma. These efforts will help link patients to effective treatments and disseminate new breakthroughs in asthma treatment. 
   This bill has been endorsed by the National Association of Children's Hospitals and Research Institutions, the American Lung Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the Association of Maternal and Child Health Programs. 
   I hope that many of my colleagues will join me in supporting this bill. Nobody should die from asthma. Treatments are available. Let us make sure that every child in America that suffers from asthma has access to those treatments.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today on tax day to introduce a new legislative proposal to help small businesses afford quality health insurance for their low-income workers. The number of uninsured is at an all-time high. More than 43 million people, including 11 million children, lack health insurance coverage. Workers in small firms are significantly more likely to be uninsured than workers in larger firms. Nationally, 34 percent of workers in small businesses with less than 10 employees are uninsured. This compares to the national average for all workers which is 18.2 percent. In Illinois, 183,781 workers in a small business in 1997 went without health insurance. For low-income workers the situation was even worse. Nationally, 41.3 percent of workers earning less than $16,000 were uninsured. Again in Illinois, 112,770 working for less than $16,000 in small businesses were uninsured. 
   This situation is deteriorating. Recent studies show that the number of small businesses offering health insurance has been declining. In 1996, 52 percent of small businesses offered their employees health insurance benefits. This level had fallen to 47 percent by 1998. For the smallest firms, those with 3-9 workers, the percentage of employees covered by employer-sponsored health insurance fell from 36 percent in 1996 to 31 percent in 1998. 
   Only 39 percent of small businesses with a significant percentage of low-income employees offer employer-sponsored health insurance--such companies are half as likely to offer health benefits as are companies that have only a small proportion of low-income employees. 
   One of the main reasons for this decline in employer-sponsored health insurance is cost. Small businesses pay on average 30 percent more for health insurance than larger firms and costs are increasing more rapidly for small businesses causing them to drop health insurance benefits. 
   Health insurance coverage is also related to income. High income workers have the highest rates of insurance. The very poor are generally covered by public sources of health care. It is most often the working poor who have the lowest incidence of insurance. Thirty-seven percent of those with family incomes between 100 percent and 125 percent of poverty are uninsured. In contrast, 92.2 percent of individuals in families with incomes over $50,000 have insurance. 
   Bearing all this in mind, I am introducing a bill that recognizes that the most concentrated pool of Americans without health insurance are low-income workers in small businesses (0-9 employees). The bill provides tax credits to small businesses when they provide health insurance to those low-income workers. The bill provides a tax credit of up to $600 for an individual policy for a worker making up to $16,000/yr. and a tax credit of up to $1,200 for a family policy for a worker making up to $16,000/yr. The tax credit is valued at 60 percent of what the employer contributes for the individual's health insurance, or 70 percent of what the employer contributes for a family policy, to the maximum of $600 and $1,200 for self-only and family policies respectively. 
   The proposal does not undermine the employer-based health insurance market, and does not undermine the protections and advantages that are available to group purchasers. Instead it is designed to help small businesses to provide quality health insurance benefits for their employees.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this is a procedural change relating to the times when the Senate considers emergency spending. Examples are disaster aid, when an area has been hit by a flood, or the need for more money in the Department of Defense, for example. We may have emergency spending that is necessary because of the Kosovo military operation. I don't believe a single Member would stand in the way of providing all the resources necessary to bring our men and women home safely. Other emergency spending might be something as esoteric as the Y2K crisis--whether we are going to be able to respond quickly enough so the Government computers will be in line and not cause any problem to provide services. Those are examples of emergency spending, and the Senate can decide by a majority vote whether to change the basic caps or limits on spending because of an emergency. 
   Now there is a provision in this budget resolution which changes that dramatically and says that any emergency provision is going to require a supermajority vote from now on--60 votes. I oppose that. I don't believe that is good policy. I think that a majority of the Senators should be allowed to decide whether or not this Nation and this Senate face an emergency situation that requires a majority vote only to go forward and spend the necessary funds. Setting up a supermajority allows the minority in this body to become more or less the political brokers in an emergency situation. 
   I don't want to see that occur. We debated this in the Governmental Affairs Committee and reached a bipartisan agreement--involving Senators THOMPSON and DOMENICI on the Republican side, and involving Senator LIEBERMAN, myself, and others on the Democratic side--that we would stick with the majority vote. Then I was surprised to see that in the budget resolution our bipartisan agreement has been vitiated, and now we are dealing with another requirement for supermajority. 
   My amendment goes back to the simple majority requirement for emergency spending. It is supported by Senator LIEBERMAN from the Governmental Affairs Committee, the ranking Democrat, as well as Senator ROBERT BYRD, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee. 
   At this point, I will retain the remainder of my time. I don't know if the rules require me to use it in all one fell swoop.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the First Safe Cigarette Act of 1999. This legislation would solve a serious fire safety problem, namely, fires that are caused by a carelessly discarded cigarette. 
   The statistics regarding cigarette-related fires are truly startling. In 1996 there were 169,500 cigarette-related first that resulted in 1,181 deaths, 2,931 injuries and $452 million in property damage. According to the National Fire Protection Association, one out of every four fire deaths in the United States in 1996 was attributed to tobacco products. 
   In my state of Illinois, cigarette-related fires have also caused too many senseless tragedies. In 1997, alone, there were more than 1,700 cigarette-related fires, of which more than 900  were in people's homes. These fires led to 109 injuries and 8 deaths. Also in 1997, smoking-related fires in Illinois led to property loss of more than $10.4 million. According to statistics from the U.S. Fire Administration, half of the known residential fire deaths in Illinois from 1993 to 1995 were from arson and careless smoking. During that three-year period, 69 deaths in Illinois were attributed to careless smoking.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the ranking Democrat on the committee, Senator LAUTENBERG from New Jersey, for his leadership. I also thank Senator DOMENICI for his leadership. We have disagreed, and in the course of my speech you will hear our areas of disagreement. My respect for him has not been diminished by those disagreements, and I continue to believe he is making a good-faith effort, as we all are, to come up with a responsible way to deal with our Federal budget in this challenging year. Oh, what a different challenge it is. 
   It was only 2 years ago on the floor of the Senate, we must recall, that we initiated the session by Senator ORRIN HATCH, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, coming to the floor and stacking up over the top of his head all of the deficit-ridden budgets of the last 30 years. He pointed scornfully at these budgets and said, ``This Congress cannot contain itself and control its spending, and only with a constitutional amendment, the balanced budget amendment, giving to Federal judges and the courts the authority to stop Congress from spending, can we ever hope to reach the day where we will put deficits behind us and live in that wonderful land of milk and honey called surplus.'' 
   Well, here we are 24 months later with no constitutional amendment, no balanced budget amendment, no new authority in the Federal courts to restrain congressional spending, and we are debating a surplus. Now, I will concede, as my colleague from Illinois mentioned earlier, that the surplus in the initial years we are discussing is a surplus in trust funds, particularly the Social Security trust fund. 
   What that means, of course, is that employers and employees across America are paying more into the Social Security program than is needed to pay out to the beneficiaries. The excess is being saved for the eventuality that people like myself--the baby boomer generation--will live long enough to go to the Social Security window and pick up a check. We want to make sure there is some money there not only for ourselves but for others. The question is, What to do with the remainder of the surplus? If we are going to dedicate 62 percent of any surplus in the future to the Social Security trust fund, what will we do with the rest? 
   That is what this budget resolution debate is all about, because it comes down to some very basic choices. As a family's budget is a series of choices, so the Nation's budget is a series of choices. The choices that have been made by the Republican majority in presenting their budget resolution are different than those of us on the Democratic side. We believe, as they do, that at least 62 percent of all of the surpluses in the near future should be dedicated to making sure that Social Security is solvent. Not good enough that the program will be solvent until the year 2032. We want to have an extended life beyond that. 
   Then we get into our areas of controversy--a significant controversy for American families--because we believe on the Democratic side that 15 percent of any surpluses should then be dedicated to reducing the debt in Medicare, the health insurance program for the aged and disabled, a program that is literally a lifeline--for 40 million Americans will go broke in the year 2008 if Congress does not act. The Democrats believe that we need to commit ourselves to Medicare solvency and, therefore, we seek in our budget resolution to dedicate 15 percent of future surpluses to Medicare. 
   On the other side of the ledger is a stark contrast, because the Republican budget resolution does not dedicate one penny--not one penny--to Medicare. Instead, they want the money to go toward tax cuts. There can't be two more appealing words in the English language for a politician to utter than ``tax cuts.'' To think that you could stand before an audience and say to them, ``We are going to let you keep more of your money, the Government won't take it,'' is appealing. 
   I suppose we on the Democratic side could join in that chorus, but we don't believe that is a responsible course of action. We believe that we have an obligation to Medicare to make certain that its future is strong and is right. Before we suggest a tax cut of any magnitude to any person in America, first we must meet our responsibilities. The good part of meeting our responsibility is that we not only guarantee the future solvency of Medicare but at the same time we pay down the national debt. 
   Arranged before me here on the Senate floor are Senate pages, young people from high school who come here and work in the Senate, and do a great job. I am glad they are here. I am sure they are hoping that some of the laws that we will pass will make America a better place for them to live. This is a law which I think addresses the concern that they may not have today but they might in the future. 
   If we have our way, in the Democrat budget resolution, we will start reducing the national debt that we have to pay interest on every year. How much is the interest payment this year on the national debt? It is about $1 billion a day, $355 
   billion that we are paying with Federal tax dollars each year to service the national debt that has been accumulated over the history of the United States. 
   We believe on the Democratic side that we should set on a course of action dedicating money to Social Security and Medicare at the same time bringing down that national debt, so that we can see in the lifetime of the young people who serve as pages here a  dramatic decline in the annual interest cost to the Federal Government. What it means for their generation is more money available, either for tax cuts or for programs they think are important for the future of this country. But we hope to give them that choice. 
   On the other side of the aisle, the Republican budget resolution says: ``No. Let's not save the money. Let's not put the money in Medicare. Let's give it away as tax cuts.'' 
   In fairness to the chairman of the Budget Committee, he has not specified what kind of tax cut package he has in mind. Some Members of his party have already expressed themselves. For example, the House Budget Committee chairman, Mr. KASICH of Ohio, has suggested a 10-percent across-the-board tax cut. I want the American people to understand what that tax cut means to them as opposed to the Democratic budget which seeks to bring down the national debt and to make sure that Medicare is well funded. 
   The Kasich tax cut, the 10-percent tax cut, would mean for 60 percent of American working families an average of $8.25 a month in tax cuts. That is a lot of money to put away and to save up for a vacation. In all honesty, it is not enough money to pay for the cable TV bill. But there are those who believe--as I mentioned, Mr. KASICH, proposals on the Republican side--that is preferable, to give that sort of tax cut as opposed to putting the money into Medicare, as opposed to paying down the national debt. I think they are wrong. 
   I think, if you look at the alternatives, it is very graphically demonstrated that in this budget that we are presently considering--the Republican budget--there will be some $831 billion in tax breaks, and nothing for Medicare; not a penny for Medicare. That, I think, is a serious mistake. It is a serious mistake, because, frankly, for 40 million Americans it results in some very, very grave decisions. Some people say, ``Well, Medicare is just a program for the elderly.'' I know better. I think most families do. It is not just for the elderly. It is for the children and grandchildren of the elderly to have the peace of mind that their parents and grandparents are going to have good, quality, affordable medical care. It meant a lot to my family, and I think it means a lot to families across America. 
   If we don't take the money that the Democrats propose in their budget resolution and put it into Medicare, I would suggest to you that the alternatives for that program are grim--cutting benefits for seniors, asking seniors and disabled Americans who are often on fixed incomes to shoulder substantially higher costs, significantly reducing payments to providers, well below the cost of providing quality medical care, or increasing payroll taxes. I don't want to be a party to that. I think that is one of the most onerous taxes in America. If we don't face our obligation to make sure Medicare is sound, it could lead to increases in payroll taxes. 
   There was a question raised by some as to whether or not the Democratic budget resolution will, in fact, do any good for 
   Medicare. I have in my hand here a letter that was sent to Members of Congress that is offered by the Department of Health and Human Services, Health Care Financing Administration, which says quite clearly, yes, the Democratic budget resolution is good for Medicare. It will make sure that Medicare remains solvent up to 10 years beyond the date that we currently see solvency ending. 
   And, of course, if we face Medicare without these additional funds, take a look at what it does. In the area of provider cuts, to extend Medicare to 2020 without new investment, as the Democrats propose, and without benefit cuts of payroll tax increases, we would have to cut payments to providers by 18 percent or more. That is a cut in the Nation of $349 billion, and over 10 years in Illinois alone $14.3 billion. 
   I contacted the Illinois hospital administrators a few years ago when we were in the midst of the same debate, and said to the Illinois hospital administrators, if we have this kind of cut in Medicare payments, what will happen? For many of the hospitals dependent on Medicare--these are hospitals in rural areas, hospitals in the inner city--they would face closure. It is just that serious. The Illinois Hospital Health System Association tells me that even before the last round of cuts, 25 percent of Illinois hospitals were taking a loss on their in-patient Medicare costs. 
   If we don't act responsibly and adopt President Clinton's approach and the Democratic budget approach, if we don't put money in Medicare, hospitals all across America--in New Jersey, in New Mexico, in Maine, in States across America--are going to face the same kind of pressure. 
   Second, there are those who suggest let's put the burden of the cost of Medicare reform on the backs of the seniors and disabled. That might extend the solvency of Medicare, but at a very high cost. To date, on average, seniors pay 19 percent of their income to purchase the health care that they need. And Medicare is currently only paying half of their bills. Many seniors live on fixed incomes. The median total annual income of Americans over the age of 65 is a mere $16,000. And that is hardly a huge sum of money for people to survive. 
   For seniors over 85 it plummets to $11,251. For the oldest and frailest in America, such as those using home health services, the average income is less than $9,000. 
   Can someone with this level of income really afford to pay more for Medicare so we can give tax cuts to some of the wealthiest people in this country? I think that is really not fair. I think most Americans would react the same: $8.25 in tax cuts for 60 percent of America's working families, is that really a valid tradeoff if we are going to impose greater burdens on seniors under the Medicare program? 
   Medicare reform may involve tough choices but it should not involve mean choices. Reform and investment are needed to strengthen Medicare. There are those who say if you just put the money in Medicare as the Democrats propose, they are just never going to reform the system. But the reality is, the Medicare program has grown. The number of beneficiaries has doubled since the program was created, and Americans are living longer. I think there is a fair argument to be made that one of the reasons Americans are living longer is because they now have access to quality health care after retirement. 
   There was a day, and I can remember as a child, when grandparents moved into the homes of your parents. It was expected. Then we tried to scrape up enough money to make sure medical bills were paid, and often they were not. Those days are behind us because of Social Security and Medicare. Before Medicare, less than 50 percent of retirees had health insurance. Now virtually every elderly American has health insurance. 
   So here is the priority question for us. How much do we value increased life expectancy? How much do we value the independence of seniors who can live confident that they will receive quality health care under Medicare? Are the people of my generation, who are working and contributing to the surplus, hopefully soon, willing to defer gratification of a tax cut of small magnitude to invest in a retirement insurance program for 40 million Americans? I think they are. The choice, of course, is whether or not we forgo the Republican tax cut and put the money into Medicare and reducing the national debt. 
   I would like to take that question to the American people by way of referendum. I think I know what the answer is. It is not just a Democratic idea. It was Alan Greenspan who came to Congress and said: Suppress the urge to cut taxes or to increase spending. You should, instead, reduce the national debt, the debt that is taking so much money in interest service payments each year. It is sound economics and it is sound for this country. 
   We need the strength to address the needs of the Medicare program. Changes will have to be made. But none of the programs being considered presently by the bipartisan Medicare Commission really save much money in the short term. Some of the proposals, such as raising the age of retirement, ask beneficiaries to pay a lot more. They even eliminate graduate medical education, so important to medical schools across America. We need to make sure there is an infusion of money into Medicare now to keep it strong. It is very unwise to enact large  tax cuts, to commit to those tax cuts before we secure both Medicare and Social Security. 
   Let me say a word about one Medicare reform, too, that I have addressed in the past. I, for one, am opposed to the concept of raising the eligibility age for Medicare. Some have suggested we raise it to the age of 67 as a way of reforming 
   Medicare. The reason for my opposition is personal and it is strong. I had a brother who retired from a well-paid job, working for a major company. He retired early. They promised him a pension and health care benefits. He ran into some problems with his health. He was required to have some major surgery and after his retirement with his company his plan canceled his health care benefits. It was before he reached the age of 65. He literally, then, had everything at risk in terms of his family's life savings and his plans for retirement because he had no health insurance protection and had to wait until he reached the age of 65 to qualify for Medicare. 
   There are too many Americans falling into this trap. I do not want to see us extend it. Instead, I think we need to have reforms in Medicare that are sensible and we need to have a budget that is dedicated to making certain that the surplus that we have now and in the near future is really focused on reducing the national debt and focused, first and foremost, on strengthening Social Security and Medicare. 
   Ask the American people: Would you give up the tax cut proposed on the Republican side of the aisle to guarantee that Medicare is going to be solvent for 10 more years? That we will not have to close hospitals? That we will not have to increase payroll taxes for Medicare? That we will not have to slash benefits? I think the answer will come back resoundingly: Stick with the programs that are so critical to millions of Americans. Make certain the Democratic approach in the budget resolution is the one that finally succeeds. 
   We can put off this tax cut debate to a later time, and let's hope our economy continues to grow so we can consider it. But before we do it, the tax cuts, if any, should be targeted to those who really need them, and we should make sure that Social Security and Medicare are still our highest priority. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to share with my colleagues an article written by Max Rowe. On November 8, 1998, Mr. Rowe, a guest columnist for the Springfield Journal-Register, wrote an article paying tribute to John Glenn entitled, ``Glenn is a hero for the ages.'' 
   Mr. President, I would like to speak for a brief moment about Mr. Rowe and some of his accomplishments. Max attended the University of Illinois where he received his B.A. and law degree (J.D.). Following his academic career at the University of Illinois, he furthered his education by pursuing a Master of Business Administration from the University of Chicago. After completing his education, Max went on to work for the Kirkland & Ellis law firm where he dedicated over 30 years of his life to his true passion, the practice of law. In 1995 Max was elected to the Illinois Senior Hall of Fame, and he volunteers part-time at the Memorial Medical Center in Springfield. On the side, he is a management consultant and writes for the Journal-Register. 
   I believe Max's life experiences inspired him to pay tribute to John Glenn, a man whom he respects so much, and a man who will keep withstanding the test of time, much like himself. John Glenn, one of his all-time heroes and someone I have had the honor to serve with in the Senate, is an inspiration to so many people in so many ways. To some he is a husband, a father, a grandfather, an astronaut, a United States Senator, or a Presidential candidate, but to all of us he is a true American hero.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I can recall this concept when it was first suggested by President Reagan. It was a concept that was alluring. The notion that we could somehow put a protective umbrella of defense over the United States against nuclear missiles would certainly be an effort that would allay the fears of many that a missile might be launched from some nation like Russia. This idea of a strategic defense initiative, Star Wars, or whatever you might characterize it as, has always had a certain appeal to me and I am sure to anyone who hears it. I have been skeptical from the start as to whether or not this was feasible. Now I think there are more fundamental policies that should be addressed. 
   First, let us take a look at the history of the early part of the century. 
   After World War I, the French--determined never to let the Germans invade their country again--set up a series of ``impregnable'' fortifications along their border from Switzerland to Belgium called the Maginot Line. When Hitler decided to invade France he passed north of the Maginot Line via Belgium, swept behind the line, and captured it from behind. France was totally defeated in 6 weeks. 
   The national missile defense plan is our Maginot Line. It would give us a false sense of security and be completely ineffective in countering threats that simply go around it--like the terrorist with chemical, biological or nuclear weapons in his suitcase. It could be totally overwhelmed by intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) held by Russia, and its existence would encourage nuclear countries to defeat it with devastating force. The star wars Strategic Defense Initiative in the 1980's faced these same problems. The current plan is ``star wars lite,'' a shrunken relic of the cold war.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of an amendment that is to be offered by Senators SPECTER and HARKIN relative to the tobacco settlement funds and the question of Federal recoupment. 
   First, let me say that I have been involved in the tobacco issue on Capitol Hill for almost as long as I have been here. As a Member of the House of Representatives, I introduced legislation  to ban smoking on airplanes, and I have addressed this issue from so many different angles that I believe I have some knowledge on the subject. 
   Having said that, I have to tell you that I stand here in admiration of the 42 State attorneys general who had the political courage and foresight to file these lawsuits against the tobacco giants in an effort to recoup some of the money that had been spent on tobacco-related disease and death in their States. In my own home State, our attorney general, Jim Ryan, was one of those. I have saluted him privately and I do it publicly. I am happy they did this. The money they have recouped is going to be an important resource for the State of Illinois and all of the other States. 
   In addition, they have forced the tobacco companies to make some major changes in the way they sell the product. Perhaps, we will see--I hope in the not-too-distant future--a decline in the number of young people who have become addicted to tobacco products. It is truly a frightening statistic to consider the impact on America's public health when you consider the percentage of high school students, and even younger, who are taking up smoking. But now that we have recovered money from the tobacco companies, the debate now is how it should be spent. I have tried to come up with a reasonable approach to it. I salute my colleagues, Senators SPECTER and HARKIN, for what I consider to be a reasonable approach as well. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be shown as a cosponsor of the Specter-Harkin amendment.

   Mr. DURBIN. Having said that, Mr. President, let me try to explain, if I can, the predicament we face. Many of the States that filed lawsuits against tobacco companies tried to recover in those lawsuits moneys that had been spent for Medicaid. Medicaid is, of course, health insurance for the poor and disabled. Across the United States, on average, out of every dollar spent on the Medicaid health insurance program, 57 cents of it comes from Washington, and 43 cents comes from the local State. 
   In my State of Illinois, it is a 50/50 split. But including all States, it is an average of 57 percent coming from the Federal Government. Now, we send the money to the States and ask them to administer the Medicaid funds. We also say to the States that if there are lawsuits to be filed relative to Medicaid, it is your responsibility as a State to do it. They are obligated to recoup any cost that they recover in these lawsuits against third parties back to the Federal Government, 
   proportionately based on the Federal Government's contribution. 
   So the suggestion that a State would file a lawsuit against the tobacco company claiming expenditures for Medicaid funds and recover, and then be asked to send some of that money back to Washington is not a novice suggestion. It is not radical. It is what happens by normal course. That is what has happened in the past. 
   But there have been some who have argued that when it comes to the tobacco settlement we should suspend that and say that the moneys recovered by the States against the tobacco companies for Medicaid expenditures should belong entirely to the States and not come back to the Federal Government at all. I have a problem with that inasmuch as I am concerned about how the money will be spent by the States. 
   Some Senators have come to the floor and said it is really none of our business. The States filed the lawsuit; let them spend the money the way they want. I think that is the wrong way to approach this. The lawsuits were filed because of a public health problem with tobacco. The money that was recovered--at least a portion of it--is Federal in nature. I think it is reasonable for us to say that the money recouped from these tobacco companies should at least be spent for the public health purposes of the lawsuit. That is what the Specter-Harkin, and now Durbin, amendment seeks to achieve. 
   I am also concerned, because, as part of their settlement, many of the States relinquished their right to file claims in the future against tobacco companies for Medicaid expenditures. In other words, they said they would give up the right of the Federal Government to recover funds under Medicaid against tobacco companies in the future. They have, in fact, surrendered a right of the Federal Government. I think that is noteworthy, because it means that, basically having settled these future claims, we have no opportunity to pursue them if we wanted to. The Federal Government has paid, and will continue to pay, one-half or more of Medicaid costs associated with treating tobacco-caused diseases, even though the States have now waived the Federal Government's right to any further tobacco-related Medicaid recovery. This further underscores the Federal right to have, if not a share of the settlement proceeds, at least a voice in how they are spent. 
   Let me say that the States routinely follow the requirements of the Medicaid statutes when it comes to money that they collect. 
   For those who argue that the tobacco suits should be treated somewhat differently, let me give them some evidence to consider. 
   In March 1996, five States--Florida, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, and West Virginia--settled a lawsuit with the Liggett tobacco company. In fiscal year 1996 and fiscal year 1997, the total reported to HCFA, the Federal agency, as the Federal share, was $465,359. This is the precedent for a Federal claim for the tobacco proceeds. 
   It is important to keep in mind that if we don't recoup this money from the State in some form, we also create a budget problem on our own. 
   The Congressional Budget Office estimates, for scoring purposes, that we would recover from State tobacco suits $2.9 billion over 5 years and $6.8 billion over 10 years. Any legislation that allows the States to keep all the funds is going to require some more on our part to offset this budget 
   priority, this budget assumption. 
   Having said that, let me try to address my point of view on what I believe the Specter-Harkin amendment will achieve. 
   It is less important to me who spends the money from the Tobacco companies than how it is spent. It is not as important to me that a Federal agency achieve the results so much as the results are achieved. And the results I am seeking are several. 
   First, it reduces the number of young people who are taking up tobacco and becoming addicted to it. Ultimately, one out of three die. If we can bring that percentage down by innovative, creative, and forceful State programs, that is all the better as far as I am concerned. 
   But I worry about suggestions in the underlying Hutchison amendment that we not be specific in terms of what we ask of the States. I am happy to see that the amendment that has been proposed by Senators SPECTER and HARKIN will try to address this by putting 20 percent of the proceeds into tobacco control to reduce the number of young people who are addicted to the product. I think that is sensible. 
   Second, I think it is reasonable to ask that a portion of the money recovered go toward public health purposes, particularly children's health programs. And it is my understanding that the Specter-Harkin amendment does that. It says that another 30 percent will go for those purposes. 
   This is consistent with the National Governors' Association, which I already identified, as their priorities at their 1999 winter meeting for the tobacco settlement money. Let me quote from the statement that they released:  
   The Nation's Governors are committed to spending a significant portion of the settlement funds on smoking cessation programs, health care education and programs benefiting children.  
   The Specter-Harkin-Durbin amendment seeks to follow the recommendations of the National Governors' Association--to say the Federal Government will not claim a share of these proceeds so long as they are spent for this purpose, and then to make certain that we are doing something with the money that is consistent with the goals of the initial litigation. 
   It would be troubling to me, and to many others who have been involved in this battle for a long time, if the net result of the tobacco lawsuits by the States should result in a windfall to the State treasuries and are spent on other things that really forget these important elements, important priorities of smoking cessation, as well as children's health care.  
   So I will be supporting the amendment being offered by Senators SPECTER and HARKIN. 
   I can tell you that when the American people were asked through a poll conducted by the American Heart Association last November, that 74 percent of the voters supported at least half of the Medicaid dollars to go to tobacco addiction treatment and to efforts to educate teens about the dangers of tobacco. 
   I am hoping that Members on both sides of the aisle will join us in this bipartisan amendment to the supplemental appropriations bill. 
   At this point, I yield my time on this issue.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, as the Senator from Kansas has noted--and, Mr. President, your tie notes--today is St. Patrick's Day, and it is a fitting time to remember not only the Irish heritage, which so many Americans--over 40 million--claim, but also as equally important is the significant progress that has been made in this island nation over the last several months to finally bring peace. Tributes, of course, could be given to so many different people. 
   Today, we were meeting with Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, as well as President Clinton, and the leaders from Northern Ireland, as well as the Republic of Ireland, celebrating their courage and the fact that they have received the Nobel Peace Prize for their endeavors, and really making certain that we double our resolve so that peace can come to that land. 
   The Good Friday Peace Agreement that was entered into and initiated about a year ago outlined the political settlement to three decades of political and sectarian violence in Northern 
   Ireland. It also reminds us, too, that there is a lot of hard work to be done to complete this agreement. 
   Over the last 30 years, more than 3,200 people have died in Northern Ireland and thousands more were injured. In 1997, the British and Irish Governments sponsored peace talks, chaired by our former colleague, Senator George Mitchell, and attended by eight political parties. 
   Senator Mitchell will be receiving an award this evening at the White House from the President and representatives of Ireland for his amazing role in bringing about this peace process. It is a much-deserved accolade. 
   An agreement was reached on April 10, 1998, that includes the formation of a Northern Ireland Assembly, a North/South Ministerial Council, and a British-Irish Council. The agreement also contains provisions on human rights, decommissioning of weapons, policing, and prisoners. Voters in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland approved the agreement on May 22. Elections to the new assembly were held on June 25. Enabling legislation has been passed by the Irish and British Parliaments, the necessary international agreements have been signed, and many prisoners have been released. 
   However, some contentious issues still remain before the agreement is implemented. In addition to former Senator George Mitchell, the Clinton administration and many Members of Congress and Senators have played a positive role in the peace process. Again, the parties have turned to the United States for leadership and mediation. Many party leaders from Northern Ireland will be at the White House this evening. Let me also say I attended last night a special tribute to one of our colleagues, Senator TED KENNEDY. The American-Ireland Fund presented him with their Man of the Year Award for his extraordinary contribution toward this peace process throughout his career in the U.S. Senate. 
   This resolution which we are considering today is cosponsored by 34 of my colleagues. It recognizes the historic first anniversary of the Good Friday peace agreement, encourages the parties to move forward to implement it, and congratulates the people of the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland for their courageous commitment to work together for peace. I appreciate my colleagues' support of this resolution, and I hope it will add another constructive measure of support for the meetings going on at the White House today. 
   I am glad the Senate, when it enacts this resolution, will be on record this year to not only celebrate the legacy of Ireland and the legacy of St. Patrick, but to look to the future of that great country, a future in peace, a future as one people.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Carolina for this resolution honoring our fellow colleague, Senator BOB KERREY of Nebraska. I want to add my voice to those who have spoken in salute to this individual and the contribution he has made. 
   The Vietnam war was like nothing else in my life politically--I am sure virtually everyone my age in this Chamber would say the same thing--the way it preoccupied the attention of this country, the way it dominated our political and personal lives, and the debate that went on for so many years. There were some who stayed and some who went and some who protested; there were some who served. Everyone was touched by that war in some way or another. 
   I was particularly struck by the story of our colleague, Senator BOB KERREY, and the contribution that he made as a member of the U.S. Navy and of course the injury which he sustained in his heroic effort on behalf of our country. Senator JACK REED of Rhode Island, a graduate of West Point, talked about his humbling experience of joining BOB KERREY for a race. He is a jogger--a runner, if you will. I have joined him for a race from time to time. You can tell by my physique I am not a runner. However, it is always a humbling experience as BOB KERREY comes motoring past you with a big smile and you realize that this man just can't be stopped. And I am glad he can't be stopped because he has made not only a great contribution to his State and his country but he continues to do so. 
   A few years back, Senator BOB KERREY got the notion that he wanted to run for President of the United States. There were some Members of the House of Representatives who stood by him and endorsed his candidacy--the few, the proud, the Members of Congress--who believed that BOB KERREY would have been an excellent President of the United States. I believe that today. 
   I have come to know this man even better as a Member of the U.S. Senate while serving with him. I know that he has courage. He showed it not only in battle, but he shows it every day on the floor of the Senate. I cannot imagine  what he has endured in his life. I only stand in awe and respect for what he brings to this institution because of that contribution. Very few people in the history of the United States have been awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. It is my great honor personally to count one of those recipients as a personal friend and colleague. 
   I thank Senator EDWARDS and I salute my friend, BOB KERREY. I am happy to stand as a cosponsor of this resolution.

   Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   Mr. President, I rise to speak in morning business and to support the efforts by Senators KENNEDY, MURRAY, and so many others to finally bring to this Senate floor a vote on education. 
   We have been in session for almost 2 months now. A great deal of that time was spent on the impeachment trial with the promise that when it ended, we would come together and consider issues important to this country. And I think all of us took heart in that promise by the leadership. Yet, when this debate comes to the floor on the first education bill of the 106th Congress in the U.S. Senate, we are finding efforts by the Republican leadership to limit the debate. When Senator KENNEDY comes to the floor with Senator PATTY MURRAY of the State of Washington and asks only for the opportunity for the Senate to vote on several key educational issues, I am sorry to say the Republican leadership has used every procedural device to stop the Senate from voting on education. 
   What does that say about the 106th Congress and what we hope to achieve? I hope Republican Senators feel, as those do on this side of the aisle, that reducing classroom size gives kids a better chance. My wife and I have taken three kids to school--taken them as they started in kindergarten through the grades. Can you believe for a moment we would have felt encouraged if we walked in and they said, ``You have a choice here. There is one classroom with 30 kids and one teacher, another with 18 kids and one teacher. We are going to put your child in the larger classroom with 30 kids. That is OK, isn't it?'' You would say, ``Wait a minute. My son or my daughter has a better chance with more personal attention.'' 
   That is what is behind the proposal for 100,000 new teachers--to reduce classroom size so that more personal attention can be given to each student. There may be some Republicans and maybe even some Democrats who would disagree with that premise and argue that larger classrooms are better for kids. Let them vote that way. Let them cast that vote that way. But to stop us procedurally from even coming to this vote on President Clinton's initiative for 100,000 more teachers does a disservice to the kids and families across America and doesn't speak well of the agenda for the 106th Congress. 
   Another item being considered, and one I hope we vote on, is the question of making sure we have enough classrooms and that we are going to, in fact, have smaller class sizes. As I travel around my home State of Illinois, superintendents, teachers, and parents said, ``Great. Smaller classrooms make a lot of sense. We think our kids have a better chance.'' But we are going to need more classrooms, obviously. 
   So one of the proposals that is before us which Senator KENNEDY is pushing for is to have help for the school districts across America to build more buildings. Unfortunately, that, too, has been stopped. 
   Imagine, if you will, that the Republican leadership does not want us to vote on whether or not to help school districts build more classrooms, modernize classrooms, make certain they have the technology necessary for the 21st century, even to make certain there are safer classrooms for our kids. What possible item on the agenda is more important than education? Yet, as the 106th Congress begins, we got off to a slow start because of the impeachment, and now we have come to a grinding halt on education. If we cannot achieve a bipartisan consensus on the basics of education, it doesn't speak well for the prospects of this Congress. I hope Senator KENNEDY, Senator MURRAY, and many others prevail. They are going to try to ask the Senate to come together on a bipartisan basis and really put their votes where their campaign rhetoric has been--commitment to education. 
   That is what it is all about. Let me speak for a moment to another issue which has been brought up, and it is a very valid issue. 
   Many Republicans argue today and in the last week's debate that we should put more Federal money into school districts to help them pay for disabled children. I have been to these schools. I have many times seen one teacher per student. I know it is very expensive education. I know some kids are sent off by school districts to better opportunities in other States. And that, too, can be very expensive. So the Republican majority has suggested we should put more money into special education from the Federal level. I hope it is clear that most Democrats agree with the Republicans on that; and that, if we are going to focus the surplus on education, this is a valid investment. But make no mistake; we have faced this vote before. 
   Take a look here. On April 23rd of last year when we offered an amendment to the Coverdell bill on the so-called parent and student savings accounts, an amendment which said take the money and put it into special education, only four Republicans joined us in that vote. They said, no; it is more important that we have vouchers for private schools than we take care of disabled children in public schools. So, by a vote of 50 to 4, the Republicans said no; don't put the money in special education. Now they argue today that it is the most important priority, the highest priority above all. 
   I sincerely hope we can return to this debate on the floor in an honest and bipartisan fashion. 
   I don't know why Senator KENNEDY stands here alone on the issue of classroom size. I don't know why Senator MURRAY stands here alone on the issue of increasing the number of classrooms and the safety of our school buildings. 
   This truly is bipartisan. So many of us who go to the campaign stump and speak about education now have a chance to put our votes where our promises have been. 
   I sincerely hope that the Republican leadership will think twice about this--that we have an opportunity here to get the 106th Congress off to a positive start. The 105th Congress was a do-nothing Congress. It achieved little or nothing, and the American people in the last election in 1998 made it clear that they rejected that approach. Now we have a chance to do something on education on a bipartisan basis if the Republican majority will stop throwing these procedural roadblocks in our path. 
   At this point, Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of time in morning business.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a private bill for the relief of Janina Altagracia Castillo-Rojas and her husband, Diogenes Patricio Rojas. My bill would grant permanent resident status to Janina and Diogenes, who face deportation later this month to the Dominican Republic as a result of a technicality in current federal immigration law. 
   Janina has been denied citizenship because her mother was the child of a U.S. citizen female and foreign male. Previous law allowed only children of U.S. citizen males and foreign females to claim U.S. citizenship. 
   In 1994, Senator Paul Simon passed the Immigration and Nationality and Technical Corrections Act, which allowed individuals born overseas before 1934 to U.S. citizen mothers, and their descendants, to claim U.S. citizenship. As a result of that 1994 law, Janina's mother received U.S. citizenship in January 1996. 
   However, when Janina attempted to attain citizenship as a descendant of a direct beneficiary of this legislation, her application was denied. Despite the 1994 law, the Immigration and Naturalization Service required that Janina's mother meet transmission requirements: she must have been physically present in the U.S. for 10 years prior to Janina's birth, 5 of which over the age of 16 years, in order for Janina to derive citizenship. Since her mother was prohibited from becoming a U.S. citizen until 1996, however, this requirement is unreasonable. 
   While 60 years of discriminatory law was corrected in 1994, the citizenship qualifications of the line of descendants of those U.S. citizen females remain adversely impacted. The private relief bill I introduce today will grant Janina and her husband Diogenes permanent resident status to continue  their lives in this country until this provision can be amended.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the topic which I would like to speak about during this brief time on the floor is one which is important to millions of Americans and involves two of our most important and successful programs: Social Security and Medicare. 
   They are so important to so many families that President Clinton has proposed that 77 percent of the surplus which we anticipate over the next few years be invested in both of these programs so that they will be available for future generations of Americans. 
   There are some who believe that the surplus, as it is generated, should be spent instead and invested in tax cuts for Americans. Of course, any politician, any person in public life, proposing a tax cut is going to get a round of applause. People would like to pay less in taxes, whether they are payroll taxes, income taxes, or whatever. But we have to realize that a tax cut is instant gratification and what the President has proposed instead is that we invest the surplus in programs with long-term benefits to not only current Americans but those of us who hope in the years ahead to take advantage of them as well. 
   We have to keep the security in Social Security and the promise of good medical care in our Medicare Program. And I think we have to understand that just solving the problems of Social Security is not enough; income security goes hand in hand with health care security. 
   One of the proposals coming from some Republican leaders suggests that there would be a tax cut. And as you can see from this chart, the Republican investment in Medicare under this plan is zero, and the Republican investment in tax cuts, $1.7 trillion. 
   Now, of course, that is quite a stark contrast. Instead of prudent investments, I am afraid that many of those who suggest tax cuts of this magnitude are not really giving us the bread and butter that we really need for these important programs like Social Security and Medicare. Instead, they are handing out these candy bar tax cuts. I do not think that that is what America needs nor what we deserve. Let me take a look at the tax cut as it would affect individual American families. 
   There is a question that many of us have when we get into the topic of tax cuts, and that is the question of fairness, progressivity: Is this tax cut really good for the average working family? One of the proposals which has been suggested by a Republican leader and Republican candidate for President, who serves in the House of Representatives, is an across-the-board tax cut. Well, take a look at what this means for the families of average Americans. 
   For the lower 60 percent of wage earners in America, people making $38,000 or less, this Republican tax cut is worth $99 a year, about $8.25 a month--not even enough to pay the cable TV bill. But if you happen to be in the top 1 percent of the earners, with an average income of $833,000, your break is $20,697. 
   I listened over the weekend while one of our noted commentators, George Will, who was born and educated in my home State of Illinois, suggested: Well, of course, because people who make this much money pay so much more in taxes, they should get a larger tax cut. 
   We have been debating this for a while, but we really decided it decades ago. In a progressive tax system, if you are wealthy, if you have higher income, then in fact you will pay more in taxes. So I do not think it is a revelation to suggest that people making almost a million dollars a year in income are going to end up paying more in taxes. Well, the Republican tax cut plan, as it has been proposed, an across-the-board tax cut, does very little for the average person, but of course is extremely generous to those in the highest income categories. 
   Today in America, 38 million citizens rely on Medicare, including 1.6 million in my home State of Illinois. By the time my generation retires, this number will have increased substantially. With these increasing numbers of Americans 
   relying on Medicare, and advances in health care technology currently increasing costs, any way you look at it, you need more money for the Medicare Program, unless you intend to do one of several things: 
   You can slash the benefits; you can change the program in terms of the way it helps senior citizens; you can ask seniors and disabled Americans who use Medicare, who are often on fixed incomes, to shoulder substantially higher costs; you can significantly reduce the payments to providers, the doctors and the hospitals; or you can increase payroll taxes by up to 18 percent for both workers and their employers. 
   A report that was released today by the Senate Budget Democrats lays out some of these harsh alternatives that would be necessary if the Republicans refuse to make investments in the Medicare Program. 
   President Clinton says, take 15 percent of the surplus, put it in Medicare; it will not solve all the problems of Medicare, but it will buy us 10 years to implement reforms in a gradual way. The Republicans, instead, suggest no money out of the surplus for Medicare, and instead put it into tax cuts. I think that is a rather stark choice.

   Mr. DURBIN. Of course I remember that period of time. It 
   was an amazing period. I recall particularly the commentator, Rush Limbaugh, who enjoys some notoriety across America. He said: You know, if they closed down the Federal Government, no one would even notice. They were kind of goading us to go ahead and call the bluff of those who wanted to shut it down. 
   Well, in fact the Government was shut down when Congress failed to pass the necessary bills to continue the funding of Government agencies. And across America people started noticing. I am sure the Senator from California--I was then a Congressman from Illinois--received phone calls from people saying, ``Wait a minute. You mean to tell me that these workers cannot go to work and they're going to be paid ultimately? You mean to say the services that we depend on, that Government needs to do, aren't going to be performed?'' And that is exactly what happened. 
   I think the American people were outraged over this, outraged that the Government would shut down. If there were those on the other side who believed that the American people would rally to their cause over this Government shutdown and say, ``Oh, you've got it right, give tax cuts to wealthy people, and go ahead and cut Medicare and cut the environmental protection and cut education programs,'' that did not happen.

   Mr. DURBIN. Yes. I am happy to. 
   Really, it is a good illustration of what happened. Back in 1995 with the Government shutdown, this was a time when the Republican Party was calling for tax cuts of $250 billion and was going to cut Medicare for that to occur. And that is exactly what led to the President's veto of their bill and ultimately led to the shutdown of the Government.

   Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from California. 
   Of course, she raises a point near and dear to all of us. Some people think Medicare is a program that seniors worry about. I think it is a program that their children worry about. They want to make sure that their mothers and fathers--grandparents in some instances--have the protection of Medicare. It is hard to believe this program only dates back about 35 years. It is a program that has now become so essential, and it is a program that has worked. 
   As a result of the Medicare Program, people are living longer, the quality of health care for elderly people has improved. At the same time, the Medicare Program has really democratized health care across America. Hospitals, which once might have served the very elite clientele, now serve virtually everyone because they are part of the Medicare Program. I think that is a plus. I think that says a lot about our country. 
   I worry when I look at the alternative budget plans here because the Democratic plan is very specific. It says if there is to be a surplus--and we think there will be--that this surplus should be used for specific purposes: to save Social Security and to preserve Medicare. Unfortunately, on the other side, there is no mention of Medicare. The Republican proposal doesn't talk about putting any of the surplus into Medicare. 
   That, I think, is shortsighted, because if you don't put the surplus, a portion of it, into Medicare, it causes some terrible things to occur. For instance, to extend Medicare to 2020 without new investment, without the influx of capital which we are talking about in the surplus, and without benefit cuts and payroll tax increases, we would need to cut payments to providers by over 18 percent. That is a cut of $349 billion. For the average person, these figures, I am sure, swim through their head. They think, What can that mean? 
   What it means is your local hospital, your local doctor, the people who are providing home health care for elderly people to stay in their homes, would receive less in compensation. As they reduce their compensation, many of them will not be able to make ends meet. I have seen it happen in Illinois already. 
   I have been somewhat critical of the Clinton administration. Some of the changes they have made in home health care services, I think, are very shortsighted. Many seniors, for example, would love to stay in their homes. That is where they feel safe and comfortable. They have the furniture and the things they have collected through their lives and their neighbors who they know. They don't want to head off to some other place, a nursing home or convalescent home. They would much rather stay in their home. What do they need to stay there? Many times just a visit by a nurse, a stop by a doctor once in a while. Although that seems extraordinary in this day and age, the alternative is a much more expensive situation where someone finds himself in a nursing home with extended and expensive care. 
   I hope that we realize that we made a mistake in 1995 when we had this Republican tax cut of $250 billion at the expense of Medicare and the Government was shut down. I hope we don't repeat it. We called the hospitals in our State of Illinois back in 1995 and asked what would this mean to you, if, in fact, you lost some $270 billion in Medicare reimbursement; what would it mean? Most of the hospitals were reluctant to speak openly and publicly and on the record. They told us privately many of them would have to close because many hospitals in my home State of Illinois and rural States like Kansas depend to a great extent on Medicare and Medicaid to reimburse their services and to keep their doors open. So, cutbacks can cost us the kinds of hospitals we need in areas that, frankly, are underserved medically. 
   Large cuts that might be envisioned without dedicating part of the surplus could threaten many of these hospitals. When a hospital closes, it isn't just the seniors who are affected. The whole community suffers. It is a situation in  many of my 
   rural towns and downstate Illinois where that emergency room is literally a matter of life or death. Farmers, miners and people who work around their homes count on the availability of their services. When a hospital's financial security is put under significant strain, they are forced to look for other sources of revenue. Cost shifting becomes inevitable. So virtually every American would pay for Congress' failure to invest in Medicare. 
   The second option, if we don't invest a portion of the surplus into Medicare, is one that would ask seniors and disabled to pay more for their own medical care. They would need to double their contributions to extend the solvency of Medicare to the year 2020 if the President's proposal of investing 15 percent of the surplus into Medicare is not made. 
   Take a look at this chart to get an idea of what it means to a senior citizen. This is a chart which shows the current amount that is being paid in part B premium of $1,262; then take a look, if we do not dedicate a part of the surplus, what the senior will have to pay instead. Instead of $100 a month, it is over $200 a month. 
   Some might say it is not too much to go from $100 to $200. I think they don't understand that many senior citizens live on fixed incomes, very low incomes, and that this kind of premium increase in order to continue Medicare as they know it would cause a great hardship to many of their families. 
   Today, on average, seniors pay 19 percent of their income to purchase the health care that they need. Medicare is currently only paying about half of their bills. These seniors living on fixed incomes are really going to face some sacrifice if this increase takes place. The medium total annual income of Americans over the age of 65 is a mere $16,000; for seniors over 85, it is even less, $11,251; for the oldest and frailest among us, such as those using home health services, the average income is less than $9,000. Now, can someone making about $800 a month, for example, see an increase in their Medicare premium from $100 to $200 without some personal sacrifice? I don't think so. Medicare as it is currently drawn up helps seniors to live with dignity. Medicare reform may involve tough choices but it shouldn't involve mean choices. This Medicare reform on the backs of seniors and disabled, unfortunately, leads us to that. 
   Reform and investment are clearly needed to strengthen Medicare. There are some who will say all you want to do is spend more money; you have to do more fundamental things like reform. I don't disagree with the concept of reform. I think it is part of the package. But the reality is, the Medicare Program has grown, the number of beneficiaries has doubled since the program was enacted, and Americans are living longer. 
   I think there is a fair argument to be made that one of the reasons that Americans are living longer is because of Medicare and the access to health care that it provides. Before Medicare, less than 50 percent of retirees had health insurance. Now, virtually every one of them does. This is a question of priority. How much do we value increased life expectancy? Are people in my generation who are working and actually contributing to the surplus--a surplus that we hope to soon have--willing to put off a tax cut to make sure that Social Security and Medicare are there for decades? Are we willing to invest in what is basically our own retirement health insurance program in the years to come? 
   By not enacting a massive tax cut that benefits the most wealthy Americas, but instead passing more limited tax cuts targeted to help working families, we can, in fact, get a tax cut that is reasonable and consistent with saving Social Security and Medicare. It seems very unwise to enact large tax cuts before we secure both of these important programs. 
   Let me close by saying that this budget season is one that causes many people's eyes to glaze over. I have served a combination now of about 8 1/2 years on Budget Committees in the House and the Senate. 
   I do my best to keep up with it. It is an arcane science to follow this budget politics. But I have to say that it does reflect our values. We have to decide what is important. 
   Last week, we had a bill on the floor here that was, on its face, a very good proposal--a bill that would have increased military pay and retirement benefits. I believe that those things should happen. The President proposed it, the Republican Party and Democratic Party agree on it. But the bill that came to the floor was significantly different than the President's proposal. In fact, it spent about $17 billion more over 6 years than the President had proposed. 
   This bill came to the floor of the Senate without one committee hearing. Some came to the floor and said we need to do this so that men and women will stay in the military, and that we give them adequate pay and the reward of retirement. So they suggested we vote for the bill. I didn't think it was a responsible thing to do. I can remember that, two years ago, on the floor of the Senate we tied ourselves in knots over amending the Constitution to provide for authority to the Federal courts to force Congress to stop deficit spending. We had reached our limits and we had said that the only thing that could control congressional spending is a constitutional amendment and court authority. Well, that constitutional amendment failed by one vote. But that was only two years ago. We were so despondent over dealing with deficits two years ago that we were at the precipice where we were about to amend the Constitution and virtually say we have given up on congressional responsibility in this area. 
   Well, here we are two years later, and the first bill we consider is not a constitutional amendment about deficits, but rather one over spending this surplus on military pay raises that we cannot justify in terms of their sources. I have asked a variety of members and people in the administration where would the extra money come from--the extra $17 billion--for military pay raises. They say, ``Frankly, we don't know.'' I don't think that is a good way to start the 106th Congress, in terms of its substantive issues; but it is a reminder that we need a budget resolution that honestly looks at our budget to maintain not only a balanced budget, but surpluses for years to come, and investment of those surpluses in a way that we can say to future generations that, yes, we understood; we had a responsibility not only to the seniors, but to the families and their grandchildren, to make sure that those programs would survive. 
   So, Mr. President, I hope that as this debate continues we can find some common ground to work together to make sure that the surplus as it exists in the future is invested in programs of real meaning to American families for many years to come. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

    Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I support giving our troops a pay raise, and I support improving the retirement package of career military personnel. However, the bill the Senate has considered, S. 4, the Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's and Marines' Bill of Rights, is not only too expensive, it was also brought to the floor too hastily, without holding hearings on its provisions, and before we considered how the bill might affect the rest of the budget. Even though I want to see a pay raise and retirement reform, I had to vote against this excessively costly bill. 
   When S. 4 was reported out of committee, it already cost $12 billion more than the President requested over the next five years. The bill as passed by the Senate is estimated to cost $17 billion more than the President asked for. That is just for the next five years. Using Congressional Budget Office (CBO) figures, S. 4 would consume one-quarter of the projected non-Social Security surplus in the next fiscal year. Once personnel start to retire under its provisions, costs will skyrocket. CBO estimates that the retirement changes in S. 4 will eventually raise the costs of military pensions by a whopping 18 percent. These increased costs will come due at the same time the baby boom generation retires, with the attendant strain on Social Security and Medicare. 
   It is impossible to justify these steep increases in costs, particularly since not one hearing was held on S. 4. We all agree there are problems with recruitment and retention in the military, but we did not get the benefit of expert testimony--or any testimony at all--as to why, nor did we get input on how best to address these problems before passing this very expensive solution. Last year Congress asked the General Accounting Office (GAO) to do a detailed study of recruitment and retention problems. GAO has been conducting surveys and interviewing troops in the field to find out why they may plan to leave the service. GAO's preliminary findings show that ``money has been overstated as a retention factor.'' GAO's report is due in just a few months. Similar studies by CBO and the Pentagon are due out shortly. Some experts have said that dissatisfaction over military health care and the operations tempo were more important issues for those leaving the military. 
   I find it most troubling that this bill was brought to the floor before we passed a budget resolution, and outside of the normal Defense Authorization bill. With no budget caps, and no other defense priorities to consider, the bill brought us into a never, never land of wishful thinking. The bill sets out the most generous package of benefits, but does not consider what might happen to the rest of the defense budget if these cost increases go into effect. Will we have to cut readiness, operations and maintenance, or procurement accounts? Will we be able to fund steps that could reduce the operations tempo or make it more predictable? Will we be able to fund improvements in military health care? 
   The so-called firewalls between defense and domestic discretionary spending are down. That means that, rather than cutting other parts of the defense budget to pay for these increases, we may have to cut domestic programs instead, like education, the environment, or transportation. According to the Concord Coalition, 57 percent of the budget was devoted to entitlements in 1998, but we are now on track to devote 73 percent of the budget to entitlements by 2009. This bill will worsen the entitlement picture, and mean that more and more discretionary spending will have to be cut to cover growing entitlements. 
   This was a very sad first bill for the Senate to consider after we finally turned the corner on deficits. We cannot go back to pre-1974 Budget Act spending patterns. We must not abandon fiscal discipline and spend the surplus before we even see a penny of it. I hope and expect that fiscal sanity will be restored and that, when the bill returns from conference or as part of a larger measure, I will be able to vote for a well-deserved pay raise for our military personnel and a reasonable retirement package, but a package that fits within the budget framework and discipline we have all embraced.

    Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to share with my colleagues an essay written by a great Chicagoan, and the father of our modern-day futures industry, Leo Melamed. I believe his essay, Reflections on the Twentieth Century, eloquently captures the essence of this great nation. 
   Mr. President, Leo Melamed had to travel a long hard road to reach the pinnacle of success. As a boy, he survived the Holocaust, coming to the United States to find a better life for his family. Growing up on the streets of Chicago, Leo was able to climb the ladder of opportunity and make that better life for himself and his family. His early experiences gave him a deep appreciation of the importance of a free society and an open economy. 
   Leo Melamed's heroic story embodies the American Dream. The young man who came to Chicago with little has, through hard work, tenacity, intellect and energy, given much to the world. In 1972, he launched the International Monetary Market (IMM), the first financial futures market. He has also achieved the position of Chairman Emeritus and Senior Policy Advisor for the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), and is the author of several books. His leadership over the past quarter century has been critical in helping transform the Chicago Mercantile Exchange from a domestic agricultural exchange to the world's foremost financial futures exchange. 
   Currently, Melamed serves as chairman and CEO of Sakura Dellaher, Inc., a global futures organization which he formed in 1993 by combining the Sakura Bank, Ltd., one of the world's largest banks, and Dellaher Investment Company, Inc., a Futures Commission Merchant (FCM) he established in 1965. As a member of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade, and with an ability to operate in all world futures markets, Sakura Dellaher, Inc., assists financial institutions in their management of risk. Because of Leo's exemplary accomplishments and contributions to the field of financial futures, he has been recognized as ``the father of the futures market concept.'' 
   I should also add, Mr. President, that the March 1999 issue of Chicago magazine has chosen Leo Melamed as one of the Most Important Chicagoans of the 20th Century. The article states: ``As de facto leader of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange for a quarter of a century, Melamed transformed the moribund exchange, introducing foreign currency and gold as commodities to be auctioned off in the trading pits. Thanks to those decisions, Chicago is today the world capital of currency futures trading.'' Leo Melamed deserves great recognition for his outstanding contributions to the city he loves so much.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, during the course of this 1 hour I will be yielding to other Members on this side of the aisle. We will be discussing a range of topics, primarily focusing on questions of education. 
   Let me say at the outset, Mr. President, last week I journeyed back to my home State of Illinois--a welcome interlude from our impeachment proceedings--to address issues which I consider to be very critical to the future not only of my State but this Nation. In the span of 4 days I visited a variety of communities and had nine different meetings with educators, teachers, administrators, students, parents, and interested people in the community to talk about the state of education. It was an eye-opener. 
   As we started to discuss education from a brand-new perspective, to throw out some of the assumptions and some of the rules, to take a look at education today, I found that there were three basic fallacies in educational thinking today which these educators understood and many in Congress do not. The first fallacy is the belief that children start to learn at age 6, and therefore, we have a social responsibility to put children in school at age 6. 
   Any parent will tell you, and certainly those who study the issue can confirm it, children start learning at a much earlier age. Teacher after teacher told me of students who showed up in kindergarten already far behind where they should be--students who had fallen behind because of family problems or the lack of family initiative or the lack of exposure to an educating environment. Of course, it took the teachers a long time to bring these kids up to speed. They challenged the premise, the assumption, that education starts at the age of 6. 
   When I asked my staff, incidentally, to research why we put kids in school at age 6, they couldn't find a reason. We looked at history. We asked the experts. They couldn't come up with a reason. The best we came up with is most kids can sit still at age 6, and in the old days that is what a classroom was all about--kids sitting still at their desks. It is not the modern threshold and should not be the threshold education of decision. 
   The second notion we challenged is the premise of the schoolday. Why on God's green Earth are students dismissed from school at 3 in the afternoon? Why? There was a day, of course, when they would go home to a parent or their parents, but the days of Ozzie and Harriet with cookies and milk waiting for the kids, I am afraid, are long gone. Most kids have no adult supervision. I am not surprised to find reports from those who know that kids, between the hours of 3 o'clock and the arrival of an adult for supervision at, say, 6 o'clock, are the kids most prone to get in trouble--kids who are involved in scrapes with the law, exposure to drugs, gang activity, teen pregnancy. These things are happening during unsupervised hours. 
   That is why when we discussed in our proposals on Capitol Hill afterschool programs, it is in the best interest of all of these children--those who are coming out of school who need remedial help, as well as those who are doing well in school and need enrichment. 
   The final point that came through loud and clear is that summer months with 3 months of vacation is something that we all look forward to as kids, but it doesn't make as much sense anymore. There was a time when kids needed the summer months off to go work on the farm. Not many kids do that anymore. Frankly, kids need an opportunity to do something constructive, positive, and supervised during the summer months, as well. 
   I am happy the democratic proposal on education addresses these three issues and addresses many others. At this point, I will yield to several of my colleagues who have joined me on the floor. 
   I see my colleague from California, Senator BOXER. I am happy you have joined in this discussion. I yield to the Senator as much time as she needs to express her thoughts on this issue.

   Mr. DURBIN. I agree with the Senator from California. There is no doubt that the funding for education is primarily State and local. The responsibility follows the funding. But we are remiss at the Federal level if we don't realize we have an important role here. As I have traveled around and have spoken to school administrators, the  source of the funding was secondary. They were talking about solving problems and what to do with those problems. 
   I see that we have been joined by the Senator from Washington, Senator MURRAY, who was a teacher in the classroom before she came to the Senate. I welcome her to join us in this colloquy. She knows, as well, that there are practical problems. When the administration starts talking about technology in schools, they are sometimes heartened by the fact that they have the new computers, but they quickly add, ``Senator, don't forget, we have to bring the teachers up to speed now.'' Many teachers my age, as decrepit as I am, and even older, are trying to become well versed in technology in order to keep up with the students. If the kids don't get the technology and the teachers don't get the training to give it to them, then we are all going to be losers. I agree, that is a central part of this.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if the Senator from Nevada will yield, I think it is interesting to step back for a second and look at what Congress does. We believe that because there is a problem of crime in America, we should Federalize a lot of crimes. Even the Chief Justice of the United States recently noted that if we continue this trend of Federalizing crime, we are going to dramatically change law enforcement in the United States. The enforcement of laws involving crime used to be a State and local responsibility. But because of our interest on Capitol Hill in crime, we continue to Federalize more and more crime. Yet, when it comes to prevention programs such as the one suggested by the Senator from Nevada, many people argue, ``Keep your hands off.'' If you want to prevent crime, it has to be done at the State and local basis. 
   I hope we can find a balance here. 
   As I traveled around Illinois, I found some extraordinary ideas coming out of local school districts about afterschool programs, bringing kids up to the reading levels in school, remedial activities, and the like. I want to express that. 
   I notice the Senator from Nevada was careful to say that he wanted to see this local creativity, that we were not going to send down a Federal rule book, a manual of instruction. We are looking for results. We want accountability. I think if we take that approach, we can build Federal programs that are welcomed at the local level, and not rejected.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, as the Senator from Nevada said earlier, many of us have theories on education as parents who watched our kids go through school and met with teachers and administrators. The Senator from Washington has spent enough time in classrooms to teach all of us, and I think her suggestions are very valuable suggestions. 
   What I have found as I have traveled around my state, and I think other Senators have as well, is that the basics of what they need in education and a helping hand can make such a difference. 
   When we talked about after school programs in school district after school district, they said, Senator, can you help us with transporting the kids safely from a school to an after school program and back home again? 
   A practical concern that stops them from doing things that are so important. And I think there are ways we can help here. Yesterday, we passed an important bill about military salaries. We decided to put $11 billion more in the bill than the President's budget requested, and many of us raised questions about where that figure came from, why there had been no hearings on it. And they said, of course, we want to help the military. We all do. But it really raises the question, if we were to come up with $11- or $12-billion today for education for after-school programs, I am afraid there would be a firestorm of opposition. People would say, wait a minute, you didn't have a hearing; it's too much of an undertaking by the Federal Government. I really hope that we can get this priority right. 
   People across America identify education as the No. 1 concern. I think it's because of their personal experience and also the realization that opportunity in this country comes with achievement, achievement in school is really I guess the best way to get started on a good life in America and many other places. 
   I am happy today to join with the Senator from Washington to discuss this. Isn't it interesting, President Clinton's suggested 100,000 more teachers to reduce classroom size. My Republican Governor in Illinois, in the State of the State message, George Ryan, suggested 10,000 new teachers for our State. The reaction from local school districts? ``Where are we going to put them? We need classrooms. You can't just give us more teachers and expect smaller classroom sizes without new classrooms.'' 
   That is why the President's proposal to help school districts modernize their schools, expand their schools, build new schools is really a timely suggestion. The GAO report a few years ago said that we need 6,000 new schools in America by the year 2006. One-third of all schools in America, serving 14 million kids, need extensive repair and replacement. So I think we understand that the President's proposal for teachers and classrooms is the only sensible way to have class room size reduction in a way that will be handled effectively.

   Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Washington. I have noted this on the Senate floor before, but it struck me that at the turn of the last century one of the most amazing things that happened in America was that between the years 1890 and 1920 we built in America on average one new high school every day. We started our new century with a dedication to public education. We Democratized education unlike any country in the world. And we said, whether you are rich or poor, you are going to have a chance to go to high school. 
   That wasn't a Federal mandate. That sprung up from local communities that said, if we are going to build a community in Washington or Illinois, and it is going to be a real community, we are  going to have a real high school, we are going to hire teachers, and we will have all the kids go to school. 
   Look at the benefits we have reaped as a nation because of that kind of forward thinking, that kind of vision that said in 20th century America will be different, our commitment to education will be different. And look what we have seen as a result of it. We have gone from the Wright Brothers at Kitty Hawk to a space program; we have gone from Henry Ford's tin lizys* moving across that assembly line to the point where we have the most modern computer chip factories in the world here in the United States. 
   I don't think it is a coincidence. I think what happened here is the fact that we dedicated ourselves to improving our work force and elevating the intelligence and training and skills of Americans. And look at the benefits we reaped. We had an American century in the 20th century. Will we have an American century in the 21st? If we take a view that it is a hands-off subject and we can't talk about that in Washington and the people at the local level can't raise the money we are missing another opportunity. 
   But to bring in talented teachers to have smaller classroom sizes, to have more modern classrooms, has to be an investment of the 21st century to continue what has become the American way of doing things. I want to salute not only Senator MURRAY and Senator REID by those who have joined us in supporting the President's program. I think it is a program that is balanced, a program that takes a portion of this surplus, a surplus we worked hard to put together, and says we are going to put that portion into education. It's an investment that will pay off in generations to come. At this point I don't know that any other Senators are seeking time on the issue of education, and, Mr. President, I would reserve the remainder of my time or yield perhaps to the Senator from Florida if he would like to speak on another subject.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today with by colleague, Senator KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON to introduce the Nursing Relief for Disadvantaged Areas Act of 1999. Today, some of our nation's poorest rural and inner-city communities face a crisis--they may soon have inadequate or no hospital healthcare because nurses are unwilling to work in these neighborhoods. The Nursing Relief for Disadvantaged Areas Act of 1999 will ensure that hospitals located in these desperately underserved areas can continue to provide adequate healthcare to our most needy communities. 
   Hospitals located in underprivileged areas often experience severe difficulty in attracting nurses. These hospitals operate in the middle of some of the harshest poverty and crime in our country. The employees of these hospitals often treat the worst and most troubling cases.  
   The condition of the surrounding area imperils the ability of these hospitals to recruit and maintain an adequate nursing staff. These circumstances have pushed some hospitals into a financial crisis, threatening the quality of healthcare to those most in need. 
   For the past eight years, this problem has been addressed by the H(1)(a) visa program which has allowed these hospitals to hire nonimmigrant nurses. Unfortunately, the H(1)(a) visa program sunset in 1997, and so once again such hospitals are in crisis. By replacing the H(1)(a) visa, the Nursing Relief Act will alleviate this crisis. 
   The true beneficiary of this program will not be the hospitals, but the underprivileged communities which rely on the hospitals' services. Let me tell you a story about the role that this program can play in the health of a community. The story is about the St. Bernard Hospital on the South Side of Chicago. 
   St. Bernard Hospital is the only remaining hospital in the Englewood community, which serves over 100,000 people. It is located in one of the poorest and most crime ridden neighborhoods in the country. Over the years, St. Bernard has become indispensable to its community. Even though it has not been designated as a trauma center, St. Bernard receives the second highest number of ambulance runs from the Chicago Fire Department. St. Bernard also provides free vision exams and free screening for blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes, and sickle cell anemia. In addition, schoolchildren receive free physicals and inoculations. 
   St. Bernard Hospital also offers a great number of outreach and community services. A food pantry is stocked, and clothes are made available for patients in need. St. Bernard is sponsoring a project for affordable housing in the community. The hospital has opened four family clinics in Englewood to provide safe and easy access to healthcare for community residents. Physicians from St. Bernard visit senior housing facilities on a regular basis, and the hospital has been recognized by Catholic Charities for its work with senior housing and healthcare. 
   In addition, St. Bernard is by far the largest employer in the Englewood area. When the hospital faces a crisis, many jobs in the community are placed at risk. 
   Even though the health of Englewood relies on this hospital, St. Bernard almost had to close its doors in 1992. After aggressive recruitment efforts, the hospital was unable to attract enough healthcare professionals to maintain its services. The hospital was especially in need of registered nurses. 
   The problem had been solved in part by hiring foreign nurses through the H(1)(a) visa program. The hospital had gone through great lengths to hire domestic nurses, and was using the H(1)(a) program only as a last alternative to closing its doors. 
   In the first half of 1997, for example, the hospital placed want ads in the Chicago Tribune and received approximately 200 responses. However, almost 75 percent of the responses declined to interview when they learned where the hospital was located. St. Bernard has also tried to hire nurses through nurse registries. However, the rates of the registries would cost the hospital more than $2 million a year, an unsustainable expense for an already financially burdened hospital. 
   Clearly, the H(1)(a) visa program had been offering St. Bernard a way to maintain its service to the community when no other option was available. In 1997, even that option was eliminated. 
   The Nursing Relief for Disadvantaged Areas Act will ensure that hospitals like St. Bernard can keep their doors open to the public and continue to support their community. In addition, however, the bill has been designed to protect the jobs of domestic nurses and to ensure that hospitals use the visa program faithfully and only as a last resort solution. 
   This bill is more narrowly targeted than the old H(1)(a) visa program. The measure ensures that nurses can only be brought into the United States by hospitals that have no alternative. In short, we have made every effort to ensure that no American nurse will lose his or her job as a result of this bill. While we want to assure that these hospitals have an adequate nursing staff, we must also guarantee that foreign nurses are not taking away jobs from domestic nurses. 
   Let me tell you what this bill does: 
   It establishes a nonimmigrant classification for nurses in health professional shortage areas. The program provides non-immigrant visas for 500 nurses each year to work in hospitals where there are severe nursing shortages. 
   The Nursing Relief Act protects the jobs of domestic nurses in three separate ways: 
   First, the measure requires that a hospital must certify that it has gone through great lengths to hire and retain domestic nurses before it can use this visa program to hire nonimmigrant nurses. 
   Second, the measure requires that nonimmigrant nurses must be paid the same wages and work under the same conditions as domestic nurses. In addition, nonimmigrant nurses cannot be hired in order to disrupt the activities of labor unions. These provisions ensure that hospitals cannot undercut the working conditions of domestic nurses. 
   And third, the measure limits the number of nonimmigrant nurses who may enter the United States in any given year. The Act provides spaces for only 500 nonimmigrants each year, and it caps the number of nurses who may enter each state. 
   In addition, the Nursing Relief Act provides for serious penalties for abuse, thus ensuring that hospitals will not misuse this new visa category. Moreover, the bill guarantees that hospitals use this program faithfully by narrowly defining the hospitals which are eligible. In order to hire nonimmigrant nurses through this visa program, hospitals must fulfill four strict requirements. 
   First, the hospital must be located in an area which has been defined by the Department of Health and Human Services as having a shortage of health care professionals. 
   Second, the hospital must have at least 190 acute care beds. 
   Third, the hospital must have at least 35 percent of its in-patient days reimbursed by Medicare. 
   Fourth, the hospital must have at least 28 percent of its in-patient days reimbursed by Medicaid. 
   All of these measures ensure that the Nursing Relief Act will serve as a relief to our communities rather than a loophole in the immigration laws. 
   Thank you, Mr. President, for the opportunity to introduce this important and very timely initiative. I hope that my colleagues will join me and support the Nursing Relief for Disadvantaged Areas Act of 1999 so that every hospital can maintain an adequate nursing staff regardless of its location.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues Senators CHAFEE, SCHUMER, LAUTENBERG, TORRICELLI, REED, BOXER and DODD to introduce the ``Permanent Brady Waiting Period Act of 1999.'' It is vital that we enact this measure if we are to ensure Americans that the popular Brady Bill will continue to be one hundred percent effective. 
   Five years ago, Congress passed the Brady Bill. That law contained a provision that required a 5-day waiting period before a person can buy a gun. Unfortunately last November, the waiting period was eliminated when we begin using the national instant check system for gun purchasers. 
   I fully support the use of an instant check system to determine if a putative firearm purchaser is legally barred from owning a gun because of a criminal record. But I believe that it must be coupled with a cooling off period. 
   Let me briefly explain what this legislation would do. It would require that anyone who wishes a buy a handgun must wait three days. There are two exceptions to this requirement. First, if a prospective purchaser presents a written statement from his of her local chief law enforcement officer stating that the handgun is needed immediately because of a threat to that person's life or that of his family, then the cooling off period will not apply. Second, if a prospective purchaser lives in a state that has a licensing requirement--and there are 27 such states--then the federal cooling off period will not apply. 
   I think both of these are common sense exceptions. Obviously people who have a legitimate and immediate need of a handgun for self-defense should be able to buy one. And in the states that have licensing or permit systems, the process of getting a permit acts as a state cooling off period. 
   This measure also requires that when a person applies to buy a gun that the gun shop owner send a copy of the application to the local chief law enforcement officer. In addition, it alters the amount of time that the state or federal government has to investigate a potential purchaser who has an arrest record. Under the law that will go into effect on the first of December this year, if a person with an arrest record applies for a gun, law enforcement will have three days to determine if that arrest resulted in a conviction. The measure we introduce today would give law enforcement five days. 
   Mr. President, let me walk you through the process of buying a gun if this law were in place. 
   If you are in a state that does not have a permit system in place, then you go into a store and fill out a purchase form. A copy of that form will be sent to the Insta-Check point of contact for your state and a copy will also be sent to the chief law enforcement 
   officer for where you live. You will then need to wait three days whereupon, assuming that you do not have a criminal record or any of the other disqualifying characteristics, you will be able to pick up your gun. 
   If on the other hand, when the Insta-Check is run, the FBI learns that you were arrested, then you will have to wait at least 5 days. That five days will be used to determine if the arrest resulted in a conviction. If it did not, then after 5 days you can get your gun. If you were arrested and convicted then you cannot get your gun and may be prosecuted. 
   Enacting this law is only sensible. A cooling off period may be the only barrier between a woman and her abusive husband whose local restraining order doesn't show up on a computer check or the only obstacle in the way of a troubled person planning to commit suicide and take others with them. A cooling off period will prevent crimes of passion and spontaneous suicides. The list of people who have bought guns and used them within a few hours or a day to kill themselves or others is far too long. 
   A recent study by the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence demonstrates a disturbing trend that reinforces the need for a cooling off period. Normally, 4 to 5 percent of all crime guns traced by the police were used in murders. But the study found that 20 percent of all guns traced within 7 days of purchase were used in murders. That is a startlingly high incidence of guns being bought and used very soon thereafter to commit a murder. 
   But this measure has a second, equally important justification. 
   That the Insta-Check system is in very good shape, but it will never be perfect. For example, it will not have a lot of mental health records. And it is unlikely to have information like restraining orders entered in domestic violence cases. Letting local law enforcement know about a potential gun purchase is a good idea--the local sheriff may know that a person trying to buy a gun has a restraining order while the FBI's Insta-check computer might not. In short, then, this bill will help serve as a fail safe mechanism for the Insta-Check system. I for one do not want to learn a year from now that someone got a gun and used it to harm someone else when a simple check of local records in addition to the Insta-Check would have revealed that the purchaser had a history of mental instability. 
   Making the Brady waiting period permanent is not about more government. It's about fewer gun crime victims. I hope that we can all agree on this goal. Thank you.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I just left a hearing of the Senate Budget Committee, and I thought it was ironic that we are now in a debate over the disposition of America's surplus. I am sure the President will recall that 2 years ago, almost to the day, we were here on the floor of the U.S. Senate where the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator ORRIN HATCH of Utah, brought out virtually every budget report from the last 30 years that he believed to be in deficit, in red ink, and stacked them up. They were higher than the height of the Senator from Utah, and he is a tall man, 
   making the point that we had been embroiled in deficit spending for so long we had no recourse, nothing we could do, other than to amend the Constitution of the United States and to give the Federal courts the authority to force Congress to stop spending, to stop deficits, with the so-called balanced budget amendment. That amendment lost by 1 vote 2 years ago. It was the hottest item on the Senate calendar 2 years ago. 
   Today, we are deeply embroiled in a debate in the Senate Budget Committee on how to spend the surplus. We have turned the corner as a nation, and the President has come forward and said, ``I think we should take this surplus and use it in a sensible way for the future of America.'' I hope we engage in debate here in the 106th Congress, House and Senate, Democrats and Republicans, in a way to do that responsibly. 
   I think we should take the President's advice that at least 62 percent or so of this surplus be dedicated to Social Security, to retire the debt in Social Security, to give it a longer life. But then we seem to break down after we kind of reach that agreement on 60 percent or so of that surplus, and it is that breakdown I would like to address for just a few moments on the floor of the Senate this morning. 
   One of the things that concerns me is that there are other programs in need of help, not just Social Security, not the least of which is Medicare. And after we have taken some 60 percent of the surplus and spent it to solidify Social Security, the President is suggesting we take some 15 percent of that surplus and invest that in Medicare, adding about 10 years to the Medicare Program. 
   We have to do more. Just putting that money in may buy some time. We know the fundamentals of the program need to be addressed. And if I am not mistaken, this week, or soon, we will have a report from a bipartisan commission on what to do with the future of Medicare. It won't be easy, whatever it might be. 
   But I am concerned that the Republican Party, in addressing this same surplus, does not speak to the need for more money into Medicare. Instead, what they are proposing is $776 billion in tax cuts. I cannot think of two more popular words for a politician to utter than ``tax cuts.'' People just sit up and listen. ``Are you going to cut my taxes? I want to hear about it.'' It is a very popular thing to say. 
   But I hope we will step back for a moment and realize that a program like Medicare needs an infusion of capital to make sure it can survive. Gene Sperling, the economic advisor to the President, said the other day, in a bipartisan meeting, he is hoping the Republican leadership will join us in not only dedicating surplus to Social Security but also to Medicare because so many millions of Americans are dependent on that. 
   I might also say that I think there is need and room for some tax cuts after we have taken the surplus and put it into Social Security and Medicare, things we need to do. But I do not believe the tax cut which has been proposed, at least initially, by the Republican Party is one that is fair, because, frankly, it is not progressive. Inasmuch as it is not progressive, this chart demonstrates what happens. 
   For the bottom 60 percent of wage earners in America, those making $38,000 a year or less, a 10-percent across-the-board tax cut means a savings of $99 a year, about $8.25 a month--hardly enough to pay the cable TV bill, let alone change a lifestyle--$99 in tax cuts for the bottom 60 percent of wage earners in America. 
   The same Republican tax cut, though, for the top 1 percent of wage earners, those making over $833,000 a year--over $833,000 a year--for them the Republican tax cut is worth $20,697. Ninety-nine dollars for 60 percent of America; for 1 percent of America, $20,000 in tax breaks. 
   That offends me. And I think it is worthy of a debate. I think it is more sensible for us to focus tax breaks on working middle-income families--families who are trying to pay for day care, families who are trying to save a few dollars for their kids' college education, families who are trying to get by. Keeping this kind of a tax break for the wealthiest of Americans may make them happy but I do not think it is good for this country. 
   I think the single best thing for us to do with this surplus is to retire our public debt. The President's proposal of focusing 62 percent of it in retiring the debt in Social Security and another 15 percent into Medicare is eminently sensible. Before we take the money that could be used to save Medicare and give it away in tax cuts that really benefit the wealthiest of Americans, I hope we will stop and think twice and remember that only 2 years ago we heard passionate speeches on this floor that, without an amendment to the Constitution of the United States giving the Federal courts the authority to clamp down on Congress' runaway spending, deficits would loom for generations to come. 
   We have turned that corner. With the leadership of the administration, with the cooperation and leadership of a bipartisan Congress, we are here today discussing surpluses. Let us do it in a sensible way--retire the national debt, take that burden off future generations, put the money into Social Security and Medicare, so that those programs will be sound for generations to come.  
   I yield back the remainder of my time.

   Mr. DURBIN. From the opening statement to the closing argument, Chairman HENRY HYDE and the House managers stated repeatedly that what is at stake in this trial is the rule of law. 
   In a compelling reference to the life of Sir Thomas More, Mr. HYDE quoted from ``A Man for All Seasons'' by Robert Bolt to remind us that More was prepared to die rather than swear a false oath of loyalty to the King and his church. 
   But Mr. HYDE did not read my favorite passage from that work. Let me share it with you and tell you why I think it is important to us in this deliberation.  
   MORE. The law, Roper, the law. I know what's legal not what's right. And I'll stick to what's legal. 
   ROPER. Then you set Man's law above God's! 
   MORE. No far below; but let me draw your attention to a fact--I'm not God. The currents and eddies of right and wrong, which you find such plain-sailing, I can't navigate, I'm no voyager. But in the thickets of the law, oh there I'm a forester. I doubt if there's a man alive who could follow me there, thank God. 
   ALICE. While you talk, he's gone! 
   MORE. And go he should if he was the devil himself until he broke the law! 
   ROPER. So now you'd give the Devil benefit of law! 
   MORE. Yes. What would you do? Cut a great road through the law to get after the Devil? 
   ROPER. I'd cut down every law in England to do that! 
   MORE. Oh? And when the last law was down, and the Devil turned round on you--where would you hide, Roper, the laws all being flat? This country's planted thick with laws from coast to coast--Man's laws, not God's--and if you cut them down--and you're just the man to do it--d'you really think you could stand upright in the winds that would blow then? Yes, I'd give the Devil benefit of law, for my own safety's sake.  
   Sir Thomas More's words remind us the law must be followed not only by the accused but also by the accusers.  
   And every day in America many who are accused of crimes are released because this government has violated their constitutional rights--denied them due process--forsaken the rule of law. 
   How American of us--we are prepared to release an accused because the accuser has not played by the rules *.*.* the rules of law. 
   The House managers built their case on one key question: Did the President respect the rule of law? 
   But the same managers who exalted the rule of law from their opening words would have us ignore the process which brought us to this moment: 
   An independent counsel in name only whose conduct before the House Judiciary Committee led Sam Dash, former Watergate counsel and Mr. Starr's ethics advisor, to resign in protest. 
   Listen to Dash's words to Kenneth Starr in his letter of resignation concerning Starr's appearance and testimony:  
   In doing this you have violated your obligation under the Independent Counsel Statute and have unlawfully intruded on the power of impeachment, which the Constitution gives solely to the House...... By your willingness to serve in this improper role (advocating for impeachment) you have seriously harmed the public confidence in the independence and objectivity of your office.  
   Much has been made about the so-called pep rally which some House Democrats held for President Clinton at the White House after the impeachment vote. If you wonder how those members could act in such an apparently partisan manner after the historic vote on December 19, 1998, I hope you will recall that the Republican members of the House Judiciary Committee gave Mr. Starr nothing less than a standing ovation when he completed testimony which Mr. Dash characterized as ``unlawful'' and ``improper''. 
   Is it any wonder why the American people think this whole impeachment process reeks of partisanship and the excesses of the Independent Counsel have created a bipartisan sentiment to amend if not abolish that statute? 
   Did Mr. Starr respect the rule of law? 
   And the House Judiciary Committee--so anxious to complete its work in a lame-duck session that it would vote for impeachment without calling a single material witness. Then those same managers came to the Senate and argued justice cannot be served without live witnesses on the Senate floor. 
   When I listen to PAUL SARBANES recount the painstaking efforts to avoid partisanship during the impeachment hearing on President Nixon, it is a stark contrast to the committee process which voted these articles of impeachment against President Clinton. 
   Did the House Judiciary Committee respect the rule of law? 
   And the House of Representatives, an institution which I was proud to serve in for 14 years, was so hellbent on impeachment that it bent the rules, denied the regular order of business and refused the House a vote to censure this President so the Majority would have a better chance to visit the disgrace of impeachment on his record. 
   Did the House of Representatives respect the rule of law? 
   But it would be too facile to dismiss this case simply because the process which brought us 
   to this point is so suspect--too easy to discard the fruit of this poisoned tree. 
   Justice and history will not give us this easy exit. We must ignore the birthing of this impeachment and judge it on its merits. 
   First, let me stipulate the obvious. The personal conduct of this President has been disgraceful and dishonorable. He has brought shame on himself and his Presidency. No one--not any Senator in this Chamber nor any person in this country--will look at this President in the same way again. 
   I have known Bill Clinton for 35 years. I remember him as a popular student when we both attended Georgetown. And I know despite all of the talk about ``compartmentalization'' that this man has suffered the greatest humiliation of any President in our history. I hope his marriage and his family can survive it. 
   But our job is not to judge Bill Clinton as a person, a husband, a father. Our responsibility under the Constitution is to judge Bill Clinton as a President, not whether he should be an object of scorn but whether he should be removed from office. 
   Did William Jefferson Clinton commit perjury or obstruct justice, and for these acts should he be removed from office? 
   When this trial began I believed that President Clinton's only refuge was in a strict reading of ``high crimes and misdemeanors''--that James Madison, George Mason and Alexander Hamilton would have to serve as his defense team and save this President from removal. 
   The managers' case was compelling, but as the defense team rebutted their evidence I saw the charges of perjury crack, obstruction of justice crumble and impeachment collapse. 
   The managers failed in Article I on perjury to meet the most basic requirement of the law: specificity. In the Andrew Johnson impeachment trial, Senator William Fessenden of Maine pointed out the unfairness of failing to name specific charges:  
   It would be contrary to every principle of justice to the clearest dictates of right, to try and condemn any man, however guilty he may be thought, for an offense not charged, of which no notice has been given to him, and against which he has had no opportunity to defend himself.  
   Senator Fessenden understood the rule of law. 
   And by what standard should the President be judged? 
   When the House managers discussed the gravity of the case for impeachment, they said repeatedly: ``These are crimes.'' But when asked why they failed to meet the most basic criminal procedural requirements of pleading and proof, Mr. Canady said: ``This proceeding is not a criminal trial.'' 
   And what is the difference between charging a crime and proving something less than a crime? The difference is known as the rule of law--a rule which requires fair notice and due process whether the accused is President or penniless. 
   How many times have we seen the House managers run into the brick wall of sworn testimony contradicting their charges. On gifts--Monica Lewinsky said hiding them was Betty Currie's idea--Betty Currie claimed it was Lewinsky's idea--neither of them claimed it was the President's idea. On the affidavit issue--the House Managers could not produce one witness--not Lewinsky, not Jordan and not the President to support their charge of obstruction. 
   Time and again the House managers failed to prove their case--failed to produce testimony or evidence and at best played to a draw. I don't need to remind my colleagues in the Senate that playing to a draw on this field comes down in favor of the President. 
   The House managers failed to meet their burden of proof. 
   And let me say a word about witnesses. 
   We have spent a lot of time on this issue. I do not know who came up with the limitation of three witnesses for the managers. But is there anyone in this chamber who believes that Sidney Blumenthal was a more valuable witness to this case than Betty Currie? 
   Surely my colleagues in the Senate remember that the House managers spent three solid days building their obstruction of justice case on concealing gifts and tampering with witnesses. And Betty Currie was critical to the most credible charges against the President. 
   Then when the House managers were given a chance to call this key witness, they refused. 
   And what can we conclude from this tactical decision? Let me read Rule 14.15 from Instructions for Federal Criminal Cases.  
   If it is peculiarly within the power of either the government or the defense to produce a witness who could give relevant testimony on an issue in the case, failure to call that witness may give rise to an inference that this testimony would have been unfavorable to that party. No such conclusion should be drawn by you, however, with regard to a witness who is equally available to both parties or where the testimony of that witness would be merely cumulative. 
   The jury must always bear in mind that the law never imposes on a defendant in a criminal case the burden or duty of calling any witnesses or producing any evidence.  
   Betty Currie was no help to the House managers in her deposition and they clearly concluded she was more likely to hurt than help their case if called as a witness. The key witness in the obstruction of justice charge never materialized and neither did the proof the House managers needed.  
   How will history judge this chapter in our history? 
   The House managers and many of my colleagues believe an acquittal will violate the basic American principle of equal justice under the law--they argue that acquitting the President will cheapen the Presidency--and imperil our nation and its values. 
   I have heard my colleagues stand in disbelief that the American people could still want a man they find so lacking in character to continue as their President. William Bennett and his pharisaical followers have profited from books and lectures decrying the lack of moral outrage in our nation 
   against Bill Clinton. 
   I hope my colleagues will pause and reflect on this conclusion that the American people have somehow lost their moral compass--that the polls demonstrate our people have lost their soul--and that we, their elected leaders, have to impeach this President to remind the American people of the values--the integrity--the honor which is so important to our nation. 
   May I respectfully suggest that those who appoint themselves as the guardians of moral order in America risk the vices of pride and arrogance themselves. Before we don the armor and choose our side in what Manager HYDE calls a ``cultural war,'' let us not give up on the wisdom and judgement of the people we represent. 
   Like Abraham Lincoln, I am a firm believer in the American people. If given the truth they can be depended upon to meet any national crisis. 
   And the American people have this right. The President's personal conduct was clearly wrong. He has endured embarrassment and will spend the rest of his natural life and forever in the annals of history branded by this experience. The American people clearly believe that the process which brings him before us in this trial was too partisan, too unfair, too suspect. 
   What has occurred here is a personal and family tragedy--it is not a national tragedy which should result in the removal of this President from office. 
   In 1798, THOMAS Jefferson wrote to James Madison: ``History shows that in England, impeachment has been an engine more of passion than justice.'' 
   Jefferson feared that even our process for impeachment could be a formidable partisan weapon. He feared that a determined faction in Congress would use it ``.....for getting rid of any man whom they consider as dangerous to their views, and I do not know that we could count on one-third in an emergency.'' 
   In 1868, with the suffering and death of our Civil War still fresh in everyone's mind, this Senate came within one vote of impeaching a President who was viewed as too sympathetic to the vanquished South. 
   In 1999, after six years and millions of tax dollars spent in investigation of this President, I believe the Senate will once again cool the political passions, preserve the Presidency, protect the Constitution, and prove to Thomas Jefferson that his trust in this body and that great document was not misplaced. 
   I will vote to acquit William Jefferson Clinton on both Articles of Impeachment and support a strong resolution of censure to bring this sad chapter in American politics to a close.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity, along with my distinguished colleagues, Senators KENNEDY, CLELAND, GRAMS, DASCHLE, DEWINE, LAUTENBERG, and LEVIN, to reintroduce legislation recognizing the importance of the institution of the Presidency. My legislation would redesignate ``Washington's Birthday'' as ``Presidents' Day,'' honoring George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and Franklin Roosevelt. In taking this step, we would honor three of our nation's most important leaders, Presidents who led our nation through our greatest challenges and crises. In so doing, we would be celebrating the contributions that these and other great Presidents have made to the development of freedom and democracy in our great nation. 
   Our democracy depends upon the participation of a well-informed electorate--citizens who take their civic responsibilities seriously. However, many Americans appear to have lost confidence in our political system. In the last presidential election, less than half of eligible voters--49 percent--voted. In the 1998 midterm elections, only 36 percent of the voting populace cast their vote to determine the future of our nation. This was the lowest voter turnout since 1942, over 50 years ago. The turnout rate among younger voters is even lower. 
   Tests administered by the National Assessment of Educational Progress found that almost 60 percent of high school seniors lacked even a basic understanding of American history. These findings indicate that too many Americans feel a sense of alienation from the political process and do not believe that government and political involvement are relevant to their lives. 
   In this time of cynicism about American politics, we must restore the faith and pride of our citizens in our government. Passage of this legislation will recognize three of our nation's greatest leaders and the enduring strength of the Office of the Presidency. It will remind all of us--but particularly young people who are our nation's future leaders--of the important contributions made by Presidents of the United States and the principles on which our nation was founded.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank you for yielding me this time in morning business to address the issue of the Federal budget. This time of year, as America starts to look forward to spring training in Florida and Arizona for the baseball season, Members of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives get involved in their own grapefruit league, their own spring training, which starts with our speeches on the Federal budget process. And I am sure that many people who would witness this debate would scratch their heads and say, What can that possibly mean to my family in Chicago, IL, or Springfield, IL? In fact, it has a great deal of importance and not only defines who we are as a nation and what our priorities will be in the coming year, but it also affects a lot of programs and a lot of taxes that directly impact families across America. So this kind of runup to the serious debates on the budget resolution is an important part of the annual ritual in Congress. And I am happy to be part of it today. 
   I have listened to my Republican colleagues, as they have spoken about their view of the budget, the budget process, and where we are in America, and it is a slightly--well, no, it is a significantly different point of view than I have. Because I take a look at this Nation and I do not see it in somber and serious terms. I don't find it depressing. I am not saddened by it. I really look at the state of government today in Washington, DC, and see so many hopeful signs that I wonder sometimes if my Republican colleagues are looking at the same picture that I am looking at. 
   There are certain things which I think we ought to accept as a reality. The fact that two out of three Americans today say the Clinton administration is doing a good job suggests to me that most Americans--Democrats, independents and even almost a majority of the moderate Republicans--have come to the conclusion that this country is on the right track, this administration is doing a good job. And there is ample reason for them to reach this conclusion. 
   Think about where we were 6 years ago when this administration began. The budget deficit stood at nearly $300 billion a year with no relief in sight. At the time, the Congressional Budget Office was projecting that the deficit would reach $350 billion in 1998. At that time, no one--absolutely no one--would have expected, instead of a $350 billion deficit, we would be running a $70 billion surplus. 
   The first step on our road to recovery and sanity in the budget process was the passage of President Clinton's 1993 Deficit Reduction Act. I remember that vote as if it were yesterday. That vote taken over 5 years ago is imprinted in my memory, because we were told by our Republican critics that if we voted for this Clinton deficit-reduction plan we would drive this economy into a tailspin, we would have even deeper deficits, we would have a wholesale reaction from the American people against this new policy. And as a result of it, we didn't garner a single Republican vote in support of the Clinton deficit-reduction plan. Here in the Senate, before I arrived, when the vote was cast, it was up to Vice President GORE to cast the deciding vote for this deficit-reduction plan. 
   It turns out the President and the Vice President were correct and the critics of the plan were wrong. Because, as you see, we have now reached the point where that deficit reduction put us on a road toward a balanced budget, which we enjoy today. Giving credit where it is due, there was a second installment on deficit reduction done on a bipartisan basis by Republicans and Democrats which completed this effort. I am glad that we were able to do that on a bipartisan basis. But history records that the first important and most painful step in this process began in 1993 with President Clinton's proposal. 
   A lot of my friends on the Republican side have argued that we have been able to eliminate the deficit but at the expense of raising taxes on ordinary Americans. I have heard this so often you almost start to believe it. And then you look at the facts. The facts are these: The Treasury Department shows that a median income family of four currently pays less in taxes as a percentage of their income than at any time in the last 20 years. It is also true for families of four at one-half the median income level and a family of four at twice the median income level. 
   So the Republican claims that the President has balanced the budget on the backs of working people just simply are not true. Nor is it true that the administration has increased the size of government. All of these claims about big government and big taxing just do not wash when you take a look at the facts. According to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, spending has declined to its smallest share of our gross domestic product in 25 years. Furthermore, under the President's proposal, spending will continue to decline as a percentage of our gross domestic product to its lowest level in 33 years. 
   Sound fiscal policy has translated into economic resurgence in America which still baffles even the experts. Here we are enjoying the 95th consecutive month of economic expansion, the longest peacetime expansion in our history; interest rates stable and falling; unemployment rates coming down; welfare rolls coming down; inflation at its lowest combined rate with interest rates and unemployment in a generation. 
   As the President announced to Congress 2 weeks ago, the state of our Nation is strong. As Vice President GORE often says, everything that we want to go down has gone down. We are talking about the unemployment rate and welfare rolls. And things we want to go up, like family income and housing starts and new businesses, continue to go up. So when I hear these funereal tones from my Republican colleagues about how sad it is that this administration just can't get it, can't get it right, I look around at our economy and I am baffled, I cannot find the evidence for their claim. 
   Despite these promises of surpluses in our budget as far as the eye can see, we all know that budget projections in the future are a guess, an educated guess but a guess. Four years ago, the Congressional Budget Office forecast the deficit would exceed $300 billion this year and approach $500 billion by the year 2005. 
   With $5 trillion of Federal debt hanging over our heads, now is not the time to abandon fiscal prudence in favor of tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, as many of my colleagues have suggested. We should take advantage of the opportunity to redirect and invest our surpluses at this moment in history where they can pay off for America in the long run. We need a responsible fiscal course to begin with. The President's budget wisely preserves 62 percent of the projected surplus for Social Security and I hope both parties can agree to this. Let me say this: If at this moment in time--this year--as we debate the budget, as we envision surpluses for years to come, if we cannot muster the will, on a bipartisan basis,  to save Social Security, we never will. It will be less painful now than any time in our future. And we have to accept the responsibility of dedicating the surplus to Social Security. 
   The President said it last year, and repeated it again this year: ``Save Social Security first.'' And those who want to embark on a different course, so be it. I believe the American people agree with me and the President that this money should go to Social Security, and also to Medicare. The Medicare Program, important to millions of elderly, is a program that is in trouble. There is no doubt about it. As health care costs go up, as the elderly population increases, Medicare faces strains and pressures never envisioned. 
   The President has suggested taking 15 percent of the surplus and putting it into Medicare to make sure that we have an additional 10 years of a solid Medicare system for senior citizens. That, to me, is eminently sensible. That, again, is an investment of the surplus in something good for the long-term benefits of our Nation, not just for elderly--of course it benefits them directly--but for their children as well. 
   When senior citizens cannot pay their health care bills, many times they turn to the government but they often turn to their children. Let us relieve that generation from a burden they shouldn't carry, by investing a portion of the surplus in Medicare. Medicare and Social Security are entitlements but they are earned entitlements. Let's put the ``security'' back in Social Security and put quality health care into Medicare. 
   When we think about what to do with the surplus, it makes sense to consider the perspective of Alan Greenspan. If there is one man who is credited with leading us through this out-of-the-deficit desert and into the sunshine of surpluses, it is the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan. In testimony to the Senate Budget Committee last week, the Chairman said that the single-best use of the surplus is to pay down the national debt. 
   This is exactly what the President is doing by dedicating the surplus to Social Security and Medicare. 
   There is also a proposal for tax relief. It is perfectly reasonable that once we have taken care of our obligations to save and preserve Social Security and Medicare and thereby reduce the national debt, we also help families in America who need tax relief. The President's proposal is a sensible approach which gives working families more income security, more spending power, and a greater ability to save for the future. 
   The President's proposal finds $34 billion in tax relief to working families. His budget reserves 12 percent of the projected surplus to provide low- and moderate-income Americans with a tax cut to help fund personal retirement accounts. Millions of Americans and millions of Federal employees, including most of the people who work in this building, have availed themselves of savings opportunities for their retirement, whether it is the Federal Thrift Savings Plan, individual retirement accounts, or Roth IRAs--named after Senator ROTH from Delaware. In order to make certain that low- and middle-income families have that same option, the President suggests that we create these personal retirement accounts that will help them. I think that makes sense. 
   The President also suggests that we provide tax relief for child care costs for 3 million working families. A couple years ago, I went across Illinois and talked to working families and in particular, working mothers, about their major concerns. Do you know what the number one concern was? It was, what will I do with my kids when I go to work? I can't afford to send them to the very best day care, and I worry myself to death when I am on the job and I am not certain that they are safe. That is a natural human reaction. It is the right reaction from a parent. What the President is saying is that we need to be sensitive to these working families by giving them some tax relief to help pay for day care and child care. 
   The same thing is true for many of the working families who have elderly parents or parents who are sick or disabled who need help with long-term care. Here again, the President's proposal offers tax relief to millions of Americans who want to provide for loved ones that are in their golden years. 
   You will also hear a cry for tax cuts from our colleagues on the other side of the aisle. But it is almost as predictable as night following day that when you go beyond the surface appeal of tax cuts proposed by the Republicans, you find the same story year in and year out. Let me give you some graphic examples of what I am talking about. 
   This chart which we had prepared looks at the proposed 10-percent tax rate cut that the Republicans have brought forward. Of course, we had to analyze it to see what it would mean to most families. This is no surprise if you have followed Republican tax breaks in years gone by. The bottom sixty percent of America's families, based on income, would see an average of a tax break of just $99 a year, roughly $8 and a few cents each month. Then you get to the top 1 percent of incomes, people making over $300,000 a year, and look what their average tax break is under the Republican plan--$20,697. I just can't understand this. I can't understand why low- and middle-income families making below $38,000 a year should get an average annual tax break of a little over $8 a month while we turn around and give $1,600 or $1,700 a month to the wealthiest among us. 
   If there is to be a tax break, if we are to use the surplus to help American families, should we not dedicate that surplus first and foremost to the low- and middle-income families who absolutely need it the most? 
   When I take a look at where money can be spent in this Federal budget, I am sometimes troubled that my friends on the Republican side of the aisle suggest that spending on domestic priorities is creating wasteful, new programs. In one particular area I take exception; that is in the area of education and training. 
   It was only last year that we had the major corporations in Silicon Valley and across the country lobbying Congress to change the immigration laws in America so that these companies could bring in skilled and trained personnel, immigrants from overseas, to fill gaps in their employment. That is a sad commentary on America's educational system. And it really troubles me that we have reached the point these companies cannot find within America the skills that they need to make a profit. 
   Then we hear from the U.S. Navy that it is suggesting it needs a change in policy. The Navy, an All-Volunteer Navy, relies on those who come forward and those they can recruit, and they have fallen short of their goals. Some 22,000 seaman are needed and not available, particularly 18,000 for service on ships at sea. So the Navy has come to Congress and said we think the answer to this is for Congress to allow us to increase the number of recruits who don't have high school diplomas from 5 percent of the total to 10 percent. Now, that is a troubling admission to say that we have so many young people without a high school education that we need to turn to the Armed Forces to give these young people a basic education. 
   When the President comes before Congress and says we can do a better job in our schools, I think most American families agree. And money invested there, I think, is money well invested. We have a skills gap in our country which needs to be addressed. We need a commitment to education that includes afterschool and summer school programs. We need 100,000 new teachers. We need to improve teacher skills and hold them accountable to make certain that when they come into the classroom, they are prepared to teach. The vast majority of teachers will meet this threshold requirement without breaking a sweat. But you know as well as I that there are people standing in classrooms across America reading from textbooks on subjects they know little or nothing about. 
   In my old home town of East St. Louis, last year or so I talked to some of the people on the school board and they say they will literally give a job to anyone who tells us they are prepared to try and teach science and math--``prepared to try and teach.'' They don't require any degrees, they can't, because they can't attract the people to do the job. We need to increase teacher skills and training to do so. 
   In addition, I think we need to put more money into school construction,  not just because the school-age enrollment is going to mushroom dramatically over the next several decades, but because our current school buildings in America for the most part are not prepared to accept the new technology necessary to educate our children. When President Clinton suggests $25 billion in tax credits for that school construction and renovation, I think he is talking about an issue that most Americans and most families can certainly understand. 
   This is a time to invest in America, not a time to provide a windfall tax break for the wealthiest people in our country. The President maintains strong fiscal discipline, targets his tax relief to Americans who need it, and makes certain that our highest priority of preserving Social Security and Medicare and reducing national debt is met. 
   There is also a suggestion that we increase defense spending. As a member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, I am going to watch this carefully. I understand, as most people do, that national defense is one of our highest priorities. I want to make certain that we dedicate our resources, first and foremost, to the men and women in uniform to make certain that they are compensated well and have a fair retirement plan. 
   It is a personal embarrassment to me, and it should be to every Member of Congress, to learn that so many members of the U.S. military today qualify for food stamps. That shouldn't be the case. We ought to make certain that the amount of money paid to our military personnel is adequate not only to maintain their families, but to attract and retain the very best in uniform across America. We owe our freedom to these men and women. We should compensate them accordingly. Of course, technology is part of that, but let's make sure the technology demands are consistent with the post-cold war world, that it is a technology demand that really envisions America's future role in the world in realistic terms. 
   I conclude by saying that I think that the President's budget has areas where I might disagree and probably will. It has areas that Congress will certainly address in a different way, 
   but it is a budget based on the right principles, a budget to keep America on a track for prosperity and economic improvement. When we look at the growth in our domestic product each and every quarter, the encouragement it gives us, I think it suggests that we ought to think long and hard before we abandon this course we have been on--a successful course, with 95 consecutive months of economic expansion. Those who want to experiment with another approach, perhaps they can make that case to the American people; but, today, two-thirds of the American people say: Stay on this course, keep us moving forward in the right way, helping working families and preserving the programs that mean so much to America. 
   I yield the remainder of my time.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my distinguished colleagues, Senators LEVIN and COLLINS, today in introducing the Deceptive Games of Chance Mailing Elimination Act of 1999. 
   It's rare that any American household has escaped receipt of a flurry of envelopes boldly proclaiming ``You're our next million-dollar winner!'' or similar claim of impending good fortune. Most of us recognize these prominent lines as the special language of direct mail sweepstakes. While many companies have used sweepstakes responsibly, others have bilked consumers out of millions of dollars by falsely suggesting a purchase is necessary to qualify for the sweepstakes or to increase the odds of winning a prize. Some of these operators promise fame and fortune, but they deliver fraud and false promises. 
   As Senator LEVIN has outlined, this bill sharpens the teeth of the current postal statutes by directing the Postal Service to develop and issue rules that restrict the use of misleading language and symbols on direct mail games of chance such as sweepstakes that mislead the recipient into believing they've already won or will win a prize. This rulemaking authority will allow the Postal Service to respond more rapidly to emerging deceptive practices. The bill also requires that additional disclosures be given to recipients of mailed solicitations involving sweepstakes giveaways about their chances of winning and that no purchase is necessary to enter the contest. Furthermore, the bill gives the Postal Service administrative subpoena power so it can react and respond more rapidly to deceptive and fraudulent mail schemes. Under our bill, civil fines can be imposed upon the issuance of an enforcement order, or alternatively, in lieu of an enforcement order, rather than awaiting a violation of that order. 
   By giving the Postal Service these additional tools and authority, this legislation will help combat the growing problem of consumer fraud in the form of deceptive or misleading mailings that use games of chance or sweepstakes contests to solicit the purchase of a product. Other deceptions have included packaging sweepstakes solicitations to closely resemble government documents and promising recipients that they have already won, even though the fine print reveals minuscule odds of winning. 
   The elderly are particularly vulnerable to sweepstakes fraud. Some senior citizen sweepstakes recipients have traveled thousands of miles to claim prizes they thought they had been assured of winning. Others spend thousands of dollars on magazines and other merchandise because they are convinced it will boost their chances of winning. 
   Like Senators LEVIN and COLLINS, I have heard from numerous constituents about how some crafty purveyors prey on the public, often persons on fixed or limited incomes, through these deceptive envelopes and packaging techniques. Recently, one constituent related how her elderly mother has become ``hooked'' on sweepstakes. She shared with me a bulky stack of envelopes, representing just a sample of the mailings. She remarked how her mother is convinced that the company will think better of her if she orders lots of merchandise, and that buying more products will accord her special consideration and improve her chances to win a lucrative prize. She noted that some companies, by using clever typefaces, sophisticated and official-looking symbols, gimmicky labels, and personalization, lead people to believe the company is writing to them personally, and that the odds of winning are high. Her story is but one example of what we have heard, and why it is so important to ensure that strong laws are enacted to address deceptive practices. 
   I am pleased that the United States Postal Inspector, the National Fraud  Information Center, the Direct Marketing Association, the American Association of Retired Persons, and a special committee of the Association of Attorneys General are among those who are actively seeking ways to ensure that consumers are informed and protected from dishonest marketing ploys. 
   I look forward to the hearings planned by Senator COLLINS in the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations to examine the problem of deceptive mailings and legislative solutions. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting enactment of legislation to promote more honesty by product marketers, clearer disclosure for consumers, tighter penalties for violators, and quicker and more effective enforcement tools for more rapid response to unscrupulous practices.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is, indeed, fitting that Senate Resolution 23 in this 106th Congress be dedicated to a man who immortalized the No. 23 as a player for the Chicago Bulls. 
   I rise today to pay tribute to a man who is a true legend both on and off the hardwood. Michael Jordan may have retired last week from the Chicago Bulls and professional basketball, but he is anything but retired. He may well be remembered as the greatest basketball player of all time, but as long as boys and girls and men and women play this uniquely American game, they can also remember a great legacy beyond sports. We all owe Michael Jordan a special tribute, not only for his excellence at the game and his practiced skills on the basketball court but as a decent human being. Michael Jordan is an outstanding citizen of his community, the city of Chicago, the State of Illinois, his native North Carolina, but also of America and the world. 
   It is often asked in many polls across the Earth: Who is the most popular man, the most well-known man? And it seems, now that the results are in--and not surprising--it is a basketball player from Chicago, No. 23, Michael Jordan. 
   Those who have not traveled around the world may find that hard to believe, but my own limited personal experience can tell you it is the case. I can recall in the streets of Shanghai, in China, when my wife and I were walking along and saw a little boy with a Chicago Bulls baseball cap on, and we went up to this little boy, who did not speak English, and I leaned over to him --he was about 9 years old--and I said, ``Michael Jordan,'' he looked back at me and he said, ``Scottie `Peepin'.'' 
   A friend of mine was traveling on the Trans-Siberian Railroad across Mongolia. He was seated there for a while, and two native Mongolians came in and sat down, and after they had been on the train several hours, one of them looked at him and said, ``Michael Jordan.'' 
   When I visited Portugal a few years ago, in the streets of Lisbon the kids were wearing Chicago Bulls gear and talking about Michael Jordan. In Budapest, in Hungary, at the little flea markets on the square you will find these nestling dolls--the wooden dolls that we traditionally associate with Russian culture--are now being made with Michael Jordan on the outside and the entire Chicago Bulls teams on the inside. Isn't it amazing that this one man has now become so well known and so popular around the world. 
   Well, he is a gifted man, gifted as few individuals have ever been, and more significantly, he has not squandered those gifts. He continues to contribute to our communities through his support for the James R. Jordan Boys and Girls Club, named after his father, the Jordan Institute for Families at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and the Ronald McDonald Houses of Greenville, Chapel Hill, Durham and Winston-Salem. For the families of seriously ill children who are being treated at nearby hospitals, Michael Jordan's charity makes a real difference. 
   To have seen him perform on a basketball court is to have witnessed a talent that has been fashioned out of years of dedication, planning, practice, conditioning, mental discipline, will and spirit. As the greatest individual basketball player, he leaves his sport as the supreme team player. Michael Jordan defined the 1990s. He gained eternal fame as the greatest leader and ultimate team player in a team sport: six NBA championships in 8 years. He was so magnificent he continued to top the statistical lists, yet made everyone around him better, as individuals and components of a team. 
   I can recall that when my son was in college and we went to our first Bulls game, you had the feeling, years ago, that at any moment in that game Michael Jordan would take control; no matter what the score was, he would be in control. The Bulls won their first NBA title in 1991, added two more in a row before Michael Jordan's premature retirement to follow another dream. 
   He tried baseball but returned 2 years later. I was at his first comeback game. He was still good, but rusty, and a lot of men might have been discouraged by that and decide to walk away. He did not. He rededicated himself to his skills, honed them, developed a new fade-away shot, and led the NBA in statistics as well as MVP, taking the Bulls to the championship again. Defying conventional wisdom, Jordan and the Bulls picked up where they left off in 1993. With a new set of teammates, including the remarkable Scottie Pippen, whom we will miss in Chicago, a rejuvenated Jordan played the best basketball of his life, and the Bulls registered the best league record in history with 72 regular season games and a world championship in 1996. They added another title in 1997, and completed the double three-peat last June, 1998--six titles in 8 years in two clusters of three. The unifying link? Michael Jordan. 
   Time was running out and the Bulls were trailing the Utah Jazz by a point when Jordan stole the ball from Karl Malone, dribbled up court, and with everyone in the world knowing what he was going to do, answered with a perfect swish--all net--on the last shot of the last game of his career to win the Bulls' sixth NBA title. Jordan was named the most valuable player in the playoffs again. In all six Bulls' championships the most valuable player each time was Michael Jordan. He has done his work well, always with dignity, always with class, and always with dedication. 
   He takes care of his own family. He has now said that he is going to dedicate his life to carpooling--I have to see that. He has dedicated himself to his teammates and friends and to the communities that he lives in. 
   Mr. President, on behalf of the citizens of my home State of Illinois and on behalf of my colleague in the U.S. Senate, Senator PETER FITZGERALD--who truly makes this a bipartisan effort--and for fans throughout America and the world, I am proud to offer S. Res. 23, honoring Michael Jordan for his incredible accomplishments both on and off the court.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me speak briefly, because I see the Senators from Iowa and Minnesota are here. Let me say, about the President's State of the Union Address last night, we are very proud of the fact that the Democratic leadership in the House and the Senate offered a battery of legislation supporting the President's goals. I was heartened by the fact that the President lifted our eyes from the drudgery of our Senate trial and spoke again to the many issues which really have brought us to Congress in an effort to try to improve the lives of Americans and American families. 
   The President has taken a fiscally responsible approach by suggesting, for example, that as we stabilize Social Security we do not run up greater deficits. He is pledging a percentage of the future surpluses to stabilize and protect Social Security. That is a responsible approach and one which future generations will certainly applaud. He has made a similar commitment to the Medicare system, saying that some 15 or 16 percent of the surplus will be dedicated to make certain that it is solvent through the year 2020. 
   I was heartened by two other things that the President suggested. At the turn of this century, as we embarked upon the 20th century, America distinguished itself and the world as a nation dedicated to public education. We became a nation of high school students, and during a span of some 20 years on average a new high school was built once every day in America. We democratized education, we created opportunity, and we created the American century. 
   Will we do it again for the 21st century? President Clinton challenged us last night as a Congress to come together, Republicans and Democrats, dedicated to public education. I think we could and should do that. I am happy that he has shown leadership again in this important field. 
   And finally, and this is on a personal note, for more than 10 years in Congress I have joined with many of my colleagues, including the Senator from Iowa, Senator HARKIN, and Senator WELLSTONE from Minnesota, Senator LAUTENBERG from New Jersey, and so many others in our battle against the tobacco industry. We believe it is nothing short of disgraceful that we continue to have more and more of our adolescents in America addicted to this deadly product. The Senate dropped the ball last year. We had a chance to pass meaningful legislation to protect our kids, but a partisan minority stopped the debate. The tobacco lobby won. 
   Now I hope that we can reverse that on the floor of the Senate and the floor of the House of Representatives. But if we cannot, President Clinton said last night we will join, as some 42 other States have, in court, suing the tobacco companies as a Federal Government for the costs that American taxpayers have incurred because of their deadly product. 
   I salute the President for doing that. I applaud him for his leadership, again, in this field of issues that is fraught with political danger. I believe that his speech last night gave us some hope that we can move forward, even if Congress fails to do the right thing and protect our children. 
   We stand at an important crossroads. There is no inherent reason why the change in calendar from 1999 to 2000 should matter. Some say it is just another year. But we humans find significance in that event, and the question is whether the 106th Congress, which will bridge the centuries, will be a 
   Congress that will be remembered as a productive Congress that came together on a bipartisan basis to help Americans, not only today, but in generations to come. 
   We have to continue to ask ourselves why we are here, how we can make America a better place, and the President's State of the Union Address gave us the direction. 
   I yield the remainder of my time.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this past Saturday, January 16th, marked the one-year anniversary of the signing of the Baltic Charter. 
   I attended that historic ceremony at the White House and our efforts that day were important not only to Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia but to the U.S. as well. This is an issue dear to me; my mother came to this country from Lithuania in 1911 and I've visited this country and the Baltic region several times. 
   Now Mr. President, the Baltic Charter solidified the international relationship between the U.S. and the Baltic nations by defining the political, economic, and security relations between our countries. It affirmed a  shared commitment to promoting harmonious and equitable relations among individuals belonging to diverse ethnic and religious groups. It also stressed the promotion of close cooperative relationships throughout the Baltic region, on such issues as economics, trade, the environment, and transnational problems like the bilateral relations between the Baltics and its neighboring states. 
   President Clinton welcomed the Baltic nations' efforts to improve relations with Russia. The four presidents involved discussed developments in Northeastern Europe, and President Clinton pledged more U.S. involvement in that region's development and cooperation with its neighbors. 
   The Baltic Charter does not commit the Baltic states to NATO membership. I believe these nations would be included in NATO, but they will have to meet the same criteria and standards expected of other states that wish to join NATO. 
   A year ago I noted that this charter would bring the U.S. and the Baltic nations closer than ever before. And, Mr. President, I'm happy to report that the United States has made good on its promise to these nations and I hope we'll do everything we can to strengthen these great new democracies and reaffirm their desire to become full members of the European Union and NATO. 
   For over 50 years, we have recognized the sovereignty of the republics of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. These great nations are now at the threshold of realizing their important role in the peace and security of Eastern Europe. Therefore, I am proud to submit S. Con. Res. 2 and hope that all members will seize this opportunity to support the Baltic states and their endeavors to further democracy and peace in the region.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, very shortly we will be joined by the minority leader, Senator DASCHLE, who will speak to the issue at hand. Of course, the issue is one that is positively dwarfed by the events that will occur in this Chamber later this evening. It is very difficult to stand here in the context of the impeachment trial and to speak of legislation, but I think we would be remiss in our responsibilities to the American people if we did not realize that although the impeachment trial is an important constitutional responsibility, we have other responsibilities to the American people, as well. 
   The Democratic package, leadership package, of legislation speaks to specific issues which many families across America consider paramount in their lives. I think it is a very realistic and a very forward-looking approach to the problems which challenge us. It addresses the day-to-day issues that matter the most to the American people: Health care, education, income security, crime, child care, a safe and stable food supply, and other critical issues. 
   I am sorry to report that the last Congress--the last 2 years of Congress  on Capitol Hill--was largely unproductive. The results of the last national election, I think, verified the fact that most people were disappointed by the outcome of the 105th Congress. There were so many opportunities missed in that Congress, so many chances to make real changes to improve life in America that were squandered. We failed to address patients' rights, we failed to reduce tobacco use by our children, we failed to reform the sorry state of campaign financing, and increase the minimum wage. In each instance, we were stymied by the other side of the aisle that simply did not want to deal with these issues. 
   It appears that the only issue of great moment--and I say that advisedly--was the decision to rename Washington National Airport after our former President, Ronald Reagan. Sadly, many of my colleagues in the Senate, once they had achieved that, decided to go straight to the airport and catch a plane and go home instead of sticking around and working on the issues for which we were called to Washington. 
   I think the American people have other things on their minds, and I think they are looking to us for leadership. 
   I am happy at this point to yield the floor to the Democratic leader, our minority leader in the U.S. Senate, who will speak to the agenda which we will try to forcefully address during this session of Congress.

   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this is indeed a strange day on Capitol Hill--January 19, 1999--and I am sure that history will look back on this day as one of stark contrast. It is a day when the President will deliver his State of the Union Address, and of course that is a historic ritual which began 
   with President Wilson and will continue with President Clinton this evening. 
   The oddity, of course, is that some of the same Members of the House of Representatives who over the span of the last week have stood on the floor of this Senate Chamber and at various times described the President as being ``corrupt'' or ``felonious,'' as being ``one who has turned his back on the law'' will be, tonight, in the House Chamber applauding this President as he comes to the floor. 
   Many people might view this as somewhat hypocritical. I do not. I think it reflects two basic values in American life: The first and most important is a presumption of innocence, a presumption which is extended to every person when they are accused by their accusers, be it government or otherwise, until proven otherwise. 
   Today, there is a suggestion that we will hear for the first time the defense of the President and hear the other side of the story. That presumption of innocence, I think, argues that all of us come to the State of the Union Address tonight with an open mind to the issues at hand, serious issues facing the country. 
   The second and equally important value that will be tested this evening is one which I have seen in my time on Capitol Hill tested time and time again. I can certainly recall at the height of the Iran-contra affair when President Reagan came to give a State of the Union Address. I had very serious concerns about the Iran-contra affair, the sale of arms to an avowed enemy of the United States, the diversion of proceeds from that sale to contras, rebels, in Nicaragua, in direct violation of the law, and all of that proceeding and all of that controversy which led to the eventual prosecution of members of the President's Cabinet. 
   In the midst of that was a State of the Union Address by President Reagan. Many of us who were critical of the Iran-contra affair came to that State of the Union Address and gave appropriate respect to the President in his presentation to Congress and to the American people. 
   I expect the same thing to occur tonight. And I expect that what we have heard this morning on the floor from the Democratic side about the agenda that we are hoping to propose and push forward during the coming months will be addressed by the President in his speech. At this point, I reserve the balance of my time. 
   Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.
