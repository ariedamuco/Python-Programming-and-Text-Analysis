 Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the Schuylkill Training & Technology Center on celebrating its 30th year of graduates in their Licensed Practical Nursing (LPN) Program. 
In June, the program marked 30 years of graduations with its 62nd daytime class and ninth part-time evening class commencement. Since its start, the program's class size has increased from 33 graduates in 1968 to 55 graduates this year. To mark the 30th anniversary of the program the Schuylkill Training & Technology Center will hold a celebration of the program and the success of its graduates on October 18. 
Over the past 30 years, acceptance of LPNs by other health-care professionals has increased dramatically. Today students are enrolling in the LPN Program because of multiple job opportunities, and I am proud to say that a large percentage of all graduates find job opportunities in Pennsylvania. 
Mr. President, I commend the Schuylkill Training & Technology Center for its excellence in job training, and I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating them on their 30th year of graduates.

Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator from Virginia and would be happy to engage in a colloquy. The conferees noted the Navy's progress with the Advanced Technology Avionics Subsystems project as exemplified by its recent demonstration using Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) technologies for avionics applications. The conferees were aware of the difficulties associated with using and integrating commercial technologies and recognized the merit of the project which is designed to develop viable solutions for transitioning affordable technologies.

 Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, Communities across our nation are being plagued by the numerous problems associated with drug and alcohol abuse, and this disease is playing an increasing role in the lives of our children. I rise today to commend Somerset County in Pennsylvania for its efforts to raise awareness and show our children that by choosing a drug-free lifestyle, they can reach their full potential. 
The Somerset County Red Ribbon Committee is sponsoring its annual Red Ribbon Campaign, which offers citizens throughout Pennsylvania the opportunity to demonstrate their commitment to a drug-free lifestyle. The Committee has designated October 23-31 Red Ribbon Week. Businesses, schools, churches and community organizations across the state will play an active role by participating in drug education and prevention activities throughout the week. 
Our children are the future of our country. By joining together to fight the war on drugs we are investing in that future. I commend Somerset County for their efforts in confronting this difficult challenge. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join Pennsylvania in recognizing Red Ribbon Week so that all of our children's futures may be promising, healthy and drug-free.

 Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the fine work of Guide Dogs and Working Dogs who, through demonstrated intelligence and dependability, have made life so much easier for their owners. 
Today Guide Dogs and Working Dogs assist not only individuals suffering vision loss, but also those suffering hearing loss and those with orthopedic problems. The intense training program that Guide Dogs and Working Dogs endure enables them to assist their owners with courtesy and confidence. 
These well-trained dogs have not only won the respect of their owners but the public as well. They have allowed countless individuals to enjoy freedom and independence and lead richer lives. 
I would like to mention that the City of Philadelphia and the Pennsylvania Legislature have also recognized these exceptional animals. 
Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join with me in paying tribute to these remarkable dogs who have afforded their owners a better life in their community.

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Child Nutrition Reauthorization, but also to express disappointment with the manner in which it is being considered by the Senate. While I support the reauthorization of the federal nutrition and feeding programs, I had hoped for the opportunity to offer an amendment to the bill. 
The amendment I had hoped to offer would enable the United States Department of Agriculture to purchase lower-priced, non-quota peanuts for use in school feeding programs. Adoption of this amendment would make school feeding programs more cost effective and free up funds to buy additional peanuts and other foods for both the school lunch program and other federal food assistance programs. The amendment would save $14 million for the federal nutrition programs, money that could be put to use feeding more children and families. 
I want to offer an explanation for why the amendment will not be considered and also to express my appreciation to those who were prepared to support it. Several Senators were ready to debate the merits of the amendment, and I appreciate their support. Other supporters include nutrition advocacy groups who have worked very hard on behalf of the amendment. 
After our return from the August break, the Senate tried to clear this bill for action. Several Senators executed holds on the bill as a result of the amendment I intended to offer. Given the inability to remove those holds and given the few days that remain in the legislative calendar, I asked my Agriculture Committee Chairman, Senator Lugar, to proceed with the bill so that he may get it to conference and hopefully enacted before adjournment in October. 
For the benefit of my colleagues who know my longstanding opposition to the peanut program, let me make clear that my amendment would have done nothing to improve the price of peanuts for manufacturers of peanut products. Instead, it simply aimed to improve the operation of the school nutrition programs. 
Generally speaking, peanuts cannot be grown and sold for human consumption in the United States unless the grower has a quota. This quota is really a license, and it enables growers to obtain a premium price for their production. Non-quota peanuts grown in America are no different than their quota cousins, except for the price. Non-quota peanuts that are grown in the U.S. for the export market have an approximate price of $350 per ton, whereas quota peanuts run as much as $650 per ton. 
My amendment would simply allow the United States government to buy non-quota peanuts at the same price that we sell American peanuts to foreign countries. 
This step is not without precedent. In fact, the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact, which Congress authorized in 1996, has a similar provision to allow schools to be exempt from paying the artificially higher milk prices that are the result of the dairy compact. 
Additionally, Congress has weighed this step in the past. The House Committee on Appropriations twice called attention to this problem in FY 1994 and FY 1995 Agriculture Appropriation Subcommittee Reports. The Subcommittee found that USDA would save approximately 
$14.4 million in peanut and peanut product purchases for the food assistance program if USDA purchased non-quota peanuts. 
In these two committee reports for the FY 1994 and FY 1995 Agriculture Appropriations' bills, the Committee directed the USDA to prepare and submit legislation to the appropriations committees of Congress to amend the peanut program. That legislation would require USDA to purchase non-quota peanuts at world prices for use in domestic feeding programs. To this point, I am not aware that the USDA has ever responded to the Committee's direction. 
Mr. President, passage of this amendment makes sense. Peanut products are an extremely popular and nutritious food for millions of people, especially children. High concentrations of important minerals and valuable nutrients make this food an especially important one. If we provide a means for the federal government to buy peanuts for American school children for the same price that we sell American peanuts to consumers in other countries, we can save millions of dollars and enable the government to purchase nutritious food to help additional people. 
Moreover, we can improve the school nutrition programs with a minimal cost to growers. Despite the suggestion of doom and gloom from the defenders of the peanut program, the amount of quota peanuts purchased for government food assistance programs is less than 2 percent of the national peanut quota production. Thus, this amendment would have a negligible effect on peanut quota holders--many of whom, I hasten to add, do not grow peanuts themselves. 
Mr. President, federal feeding programs are very price sensitive. In times of high prices for specific commodities, it is not uncommon for USDA to seek substitutes for even the most popular food items. in the early 1990s, for example, USDA temporarily suspended feeding program purchases of peanut butter because peanut prices had risen sharply. If the primary goal of the National School Lunch Program and food assistance programs is to alleviate this nation's malnutrition and hunger, it is wrong for the federal government to waste limited financial resources on buying quota peanuts to further support a small special interest group of peanut quota holders who are already subsidized by the American consumer. 
Again, Mr. President, I support passage of the child nutrition reauthorization, but am disappointed in not being able to offer my amendment. I thank those that have worked so hard on its behalf. While the opportunity is not available today to offer the amendment, I have every intention of offering this proposal to relevant legislation in the future.

Mr. SANTORUM. Let me respond directly to the Senator from California. Let me quote from the 39,000 OB/GYNs letter that was sent up here. It says that the policy committee of this select panel--`could identify no circumstances under which this procedure would be the only option to save the life or preserve the health of the mother.' 
They went on to say that, `However, it may [I underline may] be the best or most appropriate procedure in a particular circumstance to save the life or preserve the health of the mother.' 
However, after more than a year, ACOG has given no specific example of any circumstance under which a partial-birth abortion would be the most appropriate procedure in any circumstance. The silence from that organization is deafening. And the reason they cannot give a circumstance is because there is no circumstance. There is no circumstance where this is the best procedure. There is no circumstance where this is needed to be performed for the health of the mother. 
This is the last, which I thought was the last, of a series of misinformation that has been spewed out here on the Senate floor and across the country on the issue of partial-birth abortion. I will chronologically go through the lies that have been told by all of the abortion rights organizations, to stop the passage of this bill. 
The first lie, when Bob Smith and Charles Canady introduced the bill they maintained in a letter, the National Abortion Federation did, that illustrations of this procedure are `highly imaginative and artistically designed, but with little relationship to the truth or to medicine.' 
They denied it existed, denied it was ever done. What was the truth? Three years prior to this statement, Dr. Haskell, who performs this procedure, appeared before the National Abortion Federation meeting and described the procedure shown in the drawings that Bob Smith used here on the floor of the Senate, and talked about partial-birth abortion to this very group. Lie No. 1. 
Lie No. 2, they said that this was a procedure where the fetus would feel no pain because of the anesthesia. I will combine No. 2 and No. 3. Lie No. 3, they went on to say the `anesthesia ensures fetal death.' 
Planned Parenthood, in a factsheet of October 1995 says, `The fetus dies after overdose of anesthesia given to the mother intravenously.' 
That is just absurd. Dr. Martin Haskell, again, who is one of the great users of this procedure, in the American Medical News: 
Let's talk about whether or not the fetus is dead beforehand. . . . 
Dr. Haskell. No, it's not. It really is not. 
In fact, a group of anesthesiologists came up to the Senate and pleaded to testify to debunk this myth that somehow anesthesia kills, or somehow could anesthetize the baby in the womb, because women were refusing to get anesthesia for fear that they would harm their baby. 
Lie No. 4, this was a great one: Partial-birth abortion is `rare.' 
Testimony after testimony, a letter signed by the Guttmacher Institute, Planned Parenthood, National Organization of Women, Zero Population Growth, Population Action, National Abortion Federation and a myriad of organizations said there are fewer than 500 cases in America. None of the reporters here or across America challenged them on it, except one little reporter in Bergen County, New Jersey, who called an abortion clinic and they found out at that clinic 1,500 were done, in that clinical alone. Another lie debunked. 
Lie No. 5, another doozy of a lie. This lie said that partial-birth abortion is used only to save the woman's life or health or when the fetus is deformed. 
Ron Fitzsimmons on ABC Nightline: `The procedure was used only on women whose lives were in danger or whose fetuses were damaged.' Ron Fitzsimmons, fast forward, 2 years later, `What the abortion rights supporters failed to acknowledge is that the vast majority of these abortions are performed in the 20-plus week range on healthy fetuses and healthy mothers. The abortion rights folks know it, the anti-abortion folks know it, and so, probably, does everyone else.' 
Another great lie but, by the way, that lie continues to be perpetrated here on the Senate floor, that this procedure is necessary for the health of the mother. 
Let's move on to the last great lie, No. 6, partial-birth abortion protects the health of women. Let me tell you what the American Medical Association said when they endorsed this legislation. They say: `Thank you for the opportunity to work with you towards restricting a procedure that we all agree is not good medicine.' 
There is no reason--there is no reason, this goes on to say in another publication, `There is no health reason for this procedure. In fact, there is ample testimony to show that all of the health consequences are more severe for this procedure than any other procedure used.' 
If you are really concerned about the health of the mother, then look at all of the information that has been put out there by a variety of different organizations that says that this procedure is dangerous. It would never be used to protect the life of the mother. It is a 3-day procedure. If a mother presents herself in an emergency situation, you don't wait 3 days to evacuate the uterus. You do the procedure immediately. This is not. 
Just think, common sense, we are delivering a baby. It is almost born. It is this far away from being born. Why is it healthier for the mother to insert a pair of scissors into the baby's skull, fracturing and shattering that skull inside the mother, causing potential harm to that mother by doing so? It is a blind procedure. Why don't you just let the baby live? The baby is almost outside the mother. Let the baby live. There can be no rationale, can be no rationale for destroying this little baby by executing this little baby at that point in time, when it is almost born. 
Let me show you a couple of pictures, because the Senator from California has shown many pictures here on the floor of the Senate of women who have had partial-birth abortions as the reason this procedure needs to be kept legal. Let me show you the picture of a young man who is here in Washington today, Tony Melendez, who is a Thalidomide baby. People like Tony Melendez, came here to the House and the Senate to testify. It was said we need to keep partial-birth abortion legal because of people like Tony Melendez, who don't have arms or don't have legs or may be blind, those people should be aborted--those 
people who are not worthy to live. That is why we need to keep this, because of those poor deformed babies. 
Yes, Tony Melendez was disabled in the sense that he had no arms, but Tony Melendez has been an inspiration to millions across the world in his ability to sing and play the guitar, yes, with his feet, as he did for us this morning downstairs in the Capitol. 
The Senator from California will have women standing out there in the hall. Tony will also be there as a stark reminder that this bill is aimed at people like him, people who just are not perfect enough for us to deserve to be born. 
I find it absolutely incredible that last year when we debated this bill, right before this bill came up, we had a vote on the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Passionate people on the other side of the aisle, whom I respect greatly for their defense of the disabled, got up and talked about how it was so important to give these people meaningful lives. They gave impassioned speeches, and yet, in the very next vote, they said that while they want to give them the right to education, they don't want to give them the right to live in the first place. 
The Bible says, `A house divided against itself cannot stand.' You cannot in any way conceivably fit in that you are willing to fight for the disabled, but only after they survive birth; you won't fight for them--in fact, you point the finger at them and say that those, in particular, should not be born. 
The Democratic Party, over the last 100 years, has had a wonderful, wonderful reputation for fighting for those who are the least among us, for civil rights, for rights for women, rights for minorities, rights for the disabled. They have continued to try to open the American family, and I salute them for that. But they do a great disservice to that legacy when they turn their backs on people like Tony Melendez and Donna Joy Watts. 
One of the cases that is cited often by the President is cases of children with hydrocephaly. Donna Joy Watts had hydrocephaly with no chance to live. Her mother had to go to three hospitals just to get Donna Joy delivered. They wouldn't deliver her. They would abort her, everyone would abort her, but they wouldn't deliver her. And Donna Joy is here today at 6 years of age. She just earned her white belt in karate. 
Mr. President, I have been asked many times what pulled me to the Senate floor to debate this issue, because I had never spoken a word in the House or Senate about the issue of abortion, and I have given a lot of answers as to why I joined Bob Smith in this fight. 
I finally realized after the birth of my son and the death of my son, Gabriel; it finally came to me what pulled me to the Senate floor. What pulled me here was something that my son revealed to me in his short life--that we draw lines that don't exist in our society with respect to life. He revealed to me, in the love that I had for him, that what pulled me to the Senate floor was the love that I have for little children like Donna Joy and Tony and so many others. 
I ask my colleagues today if they will open their hearts and love them, too. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, today we begin debate on the issue of partial-birth abortion, the override of the President's veto, which he vetoed last year. 
I believe this is one of the most important issues, if not the most important issue, we will face in this session of Congress because it deals really at the core with who we are as a country and to what degree we respect life in this country and recognize life, recognize an individual's inclusion into our family and our society. In many cases, just as we did in voting with respect to banking laws, we have to draw lines. Part of the legislative process is, in fact, drawing lines. Sometimes those lines are not clear. Sometimes the votes are very difficult, and it is hard to understand in the area of gray where exactly you do draw the line. 
I have always felt, with respect to the issue of partial-birth abortion, that it was a very good place to at least draw the first line, in a very emotional and confrontational issue, because we are not really talking about abortion at that point, we are talking about infanticide. I think if you took a poll in this Senate and asked whether Members of the Senate were in favor of infanticide, I hope and pray that the answer would be 100 percent `no,' that they are not in favor of infanticide. Well, I believe, as many Senators have said, that this is infanticide. This is a baby that is just 3 inches from being delivered and is brutally killed. 
Let's do a little rundown of how we got to the point where we are today. In the last session of Congress, Congress passed a bill to ban this procedure, sent it to the President, and he vetoed it. We had a vote to override in September of 1996. We had 59 votes on the floor of the Senate. They overrode in the House. Last year, the Senate and House passed the bill. The House, in July of this year, overrode the President's veto with a vote of 296-132, I believe. So now it comes to the Senate. 
Earlier this year, we had 64 votes on the floor of the U.S. Senate to ban this procedure. Unfortunately, as overwhelming a vote as that is, it is three short of the votes necessary to override a Presidential veto. So that is the state of play; three votes in the U.S. Senate separate us from what I believe is a clarion call to the world that we are a civilized country that respects life which is born in this country, or nearly born in this country, and a signal to the country that we are just not quite ready to open our arms as a society and welcome every member to it. 
Let's first go through the particulars of what this procedure is, because I think it is important to define the procedure so everybody knows exactly what we are talking about. These charts that I am going to show you, while they are not particularly easy to look at, they do accurately describe, according to several doctors who perform them, what a partial-birth abortion is. It is performed on babies that are at 20 weeks of gestation, roughly halfway through the gestational process. Between 20, 24, 26, and longer, it can be performed. One of the reasons, in fact, that this procedure was developed was to perform it on solely late-term and very-late-term babies. So at 20 weeks, and thereafter, this procedure is used. The baby, as you see, in the mother's womb is usually in a head-down position at that age. The doctor, over a 3-day period, will begin to dilate the cervix, open up the cervix, so the doctor can reach in with forceps and grab the baby's foot and turn the baby around and pull the baby out in a breach position. 
I want to state that again. This is a 3-day procedure. It starts with the dilation of the cervix over a 2-day period. On the third day, when the cervix is sufficiently dilated, the doctor goes in with these forceps, grabs one of the baby's limbs --usually the foot--pulls the baby, turns the baby around into a breach position, and begins to pull the baby out of the birth canal in the breach position. As most people understand, that is a very dangerous position for a normal delivery. You try to avoid breach births because of the danger to the mother, as well as the baby. In this situation, they deliberately turn the baby around and deliver the baby in a breach position. The baby is then pulled out feet-first until all of the baby is outside of the mother, with the exception of the head. The reason for that is, the head being a hard part of the body, even at that age--certainly a harder part of the body at that age--and it is the biggest single part of the body, it is left inside of the mother. 
The third thing that happens is, the physician reaches in with one hand and finds the back of the baby's skull. You can't see the back of the baby's skull because the skull and neck are still inside of the mother. So they probe and find the soft part here, right at the base of the skull. Then they take what is called a Metzenbaum scissors and thrust it into the back of the baby's skull, open up a hole in the baby's skull, introduce a suction catheter, which is a high-powered suction device, and suck the baby's brains out, which causes the collapse of the skull, and then a dead baby is delivered. 
This is the brutal procedure that the President of the United States has said must remain legal. This is the brutal procedure that we have the opportunity here in the U.S. Senate to say has no place in a civilized society. 
I would think that would be enough reason--that simply its brutality, its shocking, barbaric, horrific nature would be enough reason to ban this procedure. But there is much more. There are so many reasons to ban this procedure beyond its horrific and barbaric nature. 
In a few minutes, I will detail exactly all of those reasons. I will detail all of the lies that have been put out by the other side to protect this rogue procedure, which is not done in any hospital, not taught in any medical school, has not been peer-reviewed and studied by others to make sure that this was a proper, safe procedure. This is a rogue procedure done only in abortion clinics, when no one else is watching. 
Mr. President, I will yield the floor, as I know the Senator from Missouri is here and has other time commitments. I will yield and turn it over to the Senator from Missouri, Senator Bond.

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Missouri for his excellent comments and for his strong support for this legislation. 
Mr. President, I think it is important to understand a little bit more about this procedure and what has been said about this procedure over time by those who defend its use. I think it is very instructive to understand the history of what has been said so we can better understand what really is the final thread that those who oppose this ban hold onto in order to justify their vote against banning this procedure. 
The first, I guess, almost incredible thing was when this bill was first introduced in the House--and in the Senate, by Bob Smith here in the Senate--the original response by those who were opposed to this bill was that--this is the National Abortion Federation that called the `. . . illustrations of partial birth abortions highly imaginative, artistically designed but with little relationship to truth or to medicine.' 
Myriad other reports denied that this even occurred; that there is no such thing as partial-birth abortion; or, as they like to call it, intact D&X. The truth is that Dr. Haskell, who was one of the originators of this procedure, described this procedure at a National Abortion Federation meeting in 1992--by the way, the original quote that I quoted from was in 1995--3 years later. Yet, 3 years prior, a doctor spoke before the group and described this very procedure using the very drawings that you saw earlier. Yet, 3 years later, that same federation that Dr. Haskell spoke before denied it exists and denied those pictures and depictions of the procedure had anything to do with reality. Lie No. 1. 
Lie No. 2: This was used by several of the people you may hear from. Those who will defend this procedure on the floor today cite several women who have come forward to say that this procedure was necessary to preserve their health and future fertility, or life. One of the women who has been used--in fact, the President called her up to the White House and brought her before the American public in testimony that she has given. She said she was told by her anesthesiologist that the fetus would endure no pain. This is because the mother is given a narcotic, analgesia, at a dose based upon her weight. The narcotic is passed via the placenta directly into the fetal bloodstream. Due to the enormous weight difference, a medical coma is induced in the fetus and there is a neurological fetal demise. There is never a live birth. The baby dies. 
This was the testimony of a doctor who does this procedure before the House Judiciary Committee. Obviously, lots of anesthesiologists who provide anesthesia to women who are going through labor and delivery become incensed that someone would make such a statement--that by giving a woman anesthesia, enough would pass into the baby to kill the baby. In fact, they came up here to the House and Senate pleading to testify to set the record straight, because there were women who were not taking anesthesia because of what they had heard. 
This is Norig Ellison, president of the American Society of Anesthesiologists, 4 years ago: 
In my medical judgment it would be necessary--in order to achieve `neurological demise' of fetus in a `partial birth' abortion--to anesthetize the mother to such a degree as to place her own health in serious jeopardy. 
In other words, it wouldn't happen. Another lie. 
Third lie, again, about anesthesia, that: 
The fetus dies from an overdose of anesthesia given to the mother intravenously. 
Again, Planned Parenthood said the first one. 
Dr. Haskell, who, again, is one of the abortionists who does this procedure, said to the American Medical News: 
`Let's talk about whether or not the fetus is dead beforehand. . . .' Haskell: `No, it's not. No, it's really not.' 
Lie No. 3, being perpetrated on the American public and the Congress, in almost all cases rebuffed by their own people. 
Lie No. 4--this was a doozy: 
Partial-birth abortion is `rare.' 
Once they got past the point of accepting the fact that it happened, that they admitted that it happened, they then went out and said that this was `rare'; it only happened a few hundred times a year: 
This surgical procedure is used only in `rare' cases, fewer than 500 per year. It is most often performed in the cases of wanted pregnancies gone tragically wrong, when a family learns late in pregnancy of severe fetal anomalies, or medical condition that threatens the pregnant woman's life or health. 
This was signed by a slew of abortion rights organizations: The Guttmacher Institute, Planned Parenthood, National Organization of Women, Zero Population Growth, Population Action International, National Abortion Federation, and others. They all signed this. They all signed this letter to Congress. They testified in a letter to Congress that this was the fact, 
that it was only tragic cases and there were only a few. But according to the Bergen County Record--and I have to tip my cap to them because, unfortunately, the entire press corps in Washington, DC, read this letter and accepted it as fact and reported consistently that that was the fact. I asked many of the press corps did they bother to check, did they bother to check to see whether, in fact, the number and the circumstances were accurate? Did anyone bother to call a local abortion clinic in their city and ask? 
The answer was a resounding--that's right--nothing. The Bergen County Record was one newspaper that did. September 15, 1996, just 10 days before the vote to override the President's veto in 1996:  
But interviews with physicians who use the method reveal that in New Jersey alone, at least 1500 partial-birth abortions are performed each year--three times the supposed national rate. 
Several months later we find out what really was going on. 
Ron Fitzsimmons has suggested that between 3,000 and 5,000 partial-birth abortions could be performed annually. 
Now, how do we know that he is right? We have absolutely no way of knowing he is right. I will quote from the American Medical Association, Journal of the American Medical Association just last month with respect to how we know how many of these are done. 
First of all, States do not provide abortion-related information to the CDC. 
Second, data gathered varies widely from State to State with some States lacking information on as many as 40 to 50 percent of abortions performed within their jurisdiction. 
Third, the category the CDC uses to report the method of abortion does not differentiate between what is called dilation and evacuation, D&E, and intact D&X, or partial birth abortion. 
We have no way of knowing, and even if they accurately reported it, some States don't collect the data and those that do, don't report 40 to 50 percent of the data. So how do we know? Those of us who are here trying to argue that this procedure should be banned have to rely upon Ron Fitzsimmons for the information. And who is Ron Fitzsimmons? He is the chief lobbyist for all the abortion clinics in this country that oppose this bill. So we have to use the information given to us by those who, by the way, have consistently lied, who also don't want the procedure to be banned. We have to accept their numbers as fact because there is no other way to independently check them. So I would just allow you to use your imagination as to what the number really is in this country. If they admit to 3,000 to 5,000, what is the real number? 
Lie No. 5. `Partial-birth abortion is only used to save a woman's life or health or when the fetus is deformed.' 
This is Ron Fitzsimmons 2 years previous. Let's rewind 2 years back to 1995. 
The procedure was used rarely or only on women whose lives were in danger or whose fetuses were damaged. 
And I can give you lots of other quotes, by the way, from the Senate floor and from the House floor that maintained this position, as well as all the other organizations that you just saw on the last chart, that that was the reason this procedure was created for those who it is used on, and that is why it needs to remain legal. 
The truth: New York Times February 26, 1997: 
Ron Fitzsimmons admitted he `lied through my teeth' when he said the procedure was used rarely and only on women whose lives were in danger or whose fetuses were damaged. 
Ron Fitzsimmons, again quoted in the American Medical News March 3, 1997: 
What the abortion rights supporters failed to acknowledge, Fitzsimmons said, is that the vast majority of these abortions are performed in the 20-plus week range on healthy fetuses and healthy mothers. `The abortion rights folks know it, the antiabortion folks know it and so probably does everyone else,' he said. 
Well, of course, we knew it. We knew it because Dr. James T. McMahon, who is now deceased, about 6 years ago said that he performed most of the abortions, partial-birth abortions on healthy mothers with healthy babies late in pregnancy, in his case up to the eighth and ninth month of pregnancy. He classified only 9 percent of that total of the 2,000 partial-birth abortion procedures he alone did, he classified only 9 percent of that total as involving maternal health indications of which the most common maternal health indication that he gave as a reason for doing the abortion was depression; 56 percent were for `fetal flaws,' and those are his words, that included many nonlethal disorders, a sizable number as minor as cleft palate. 
Yes, we knew. We came to the floor and we said here are the facts. And the other side stood behind the lies. They parroted them knowing that they weren't true. They parroted them either knowing they weren't true or praying that they could hide behind others who would try to fool the American public. 
The sixth untruth and the final one, at least to date the final one. This is the last untruth that those who continue to oppose banning this procedure hold on to, this last thread of deception. And that is that `partial-birth abortion protects women's health.' 
President Clinton, in his veto message, April 10, 1996, when he vetoed the first ban: 
I understand the desire to eliminate the use of a procedure that appears inhumane. But to eliminate it without taking into consideration the rare and tragic circumstances in which its use may be necessary would be even more inhumane. 
Fast forward to October 10, 1997, a year ago, when he vetoed this bill. 
H.R. 1122 does not contain an exception to the measure's ban that will adequately protect the lives and health of the small group of women in tragic circumstances who need a an abortion performed at a late stage of pregnancy to avert death or serious injury. 
One comment first. This bill clearly has a life-of-the-mother provision. If this procedure is in any way necessary to prevent the death of the mother, it can be used. 
The President says `to avert the death or serious injury.' To try to convince the American public that we do not have a life-of-the-mother exception, again, is disingenuous at best. 
`Serious Injury,' let's go to the American Medical Association. Who is the American Medical Association? Most people know it is the largest association of doctors in this country. What is the American Medical Association position on abortion? They are in favor of abortion rights; very strongly in favor of abortion rights. 
What is the American Medical Association's position on banning medical procedures? They abhor banning medical procedures. They believe that medical procedures should be left to physicians to determine what is good medicine and bad medicine. So, on two counts we should have a tough time getting the American Medical Association to endorse a ban on a medical procedure having to do with abortion. But the American Medical Association last year endorsed the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. They stated that it was `not medically indicated.' 
Let me quote from a group of obstetricians, several hundred across the country, most of them board certified: 
The partial-birth abortion procedure, as described by Dr. Martin Haskell, the Nation's leading practitioner of the procedure, and defined in the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act, is never medically indicated and can itself pose serious risks to the health and future fertility of women. 
Four female OB/GYNs were here today to have a press conference, here on Capitol Hill, to talk about partial-birth abortion, and all of them indicated that not only is this not medically necessary, but this procedure, this rogue procedure, is incredibly dangerous to women and to women's health. 
So, I go back to the point that I made before. There is enough grounds on its sheer barbarism and the fact that it is an affront to our sensibilities and to our culture that we would allow this kind of horrific procedure to occur. When you compound that with the fact that it is not medically necessary, ever, to protect a woman's health, when you compound that with the fact that it is medically dangerous to women to have this procedure done, and it is always done at an abortion clinic, where there are inadequate facilities to deal with these circumstances promptly if something should go wrong, if you combine just those facts it appears obvious that this procedure should be banned. 
So, what I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do is to do something that is very, very difficult to do here on the issue of abortion. When you mention the word `abortion' on the floor of the U.S. Senate or the U.S. House of Representatives, people dive into their trenches. They dive into their trenches that they feel comfortable with because the last thing you want to do is, during this battle, jump from trench to trench, to try to get to both sides. That is because you end up getting shot at a lot, if you go from what would be considered the pro-life side and try to run the battlefield over to the pro-choice side, or vice versa. So what all the political consultants say is, `Stay in your trenches when you hear the word `abortion'.' That is both sides. `Do not lift your head up because you either get shot by those who you are trying to join or your folks will shoot you in the back.' 
So let me say, first, to the Members of the Congress, the House and the Senate, for those Members who are `traditionally on the other side of this issue,' who are in the other trench, for them to climb out of that trench to face the fire and to stand with us, as they will tomorrow and vote for what they know in their heart is morally, ethically, and medically right, I salute them and I thank them. That is political courage. 
You hear a lot of talk these days about political courage. Will we have the political courage to do the right thing with respect to the President? Just let me suggest that there are many Members of this Senate who tomorrow will show political courage and do the right thing. It is political courage to follow your heart, to follow what you know inside you is right, not just right for the children or for the mothers, but what is right for our society and the message we send to all the people listening and watching what goes on here. 
For those who have yet to climb out of the trench, I will tell you a couple of things. No. 1, the fire is not that intense once you climb out. The American public overwhelmingly supports banning this procedure. All of the medical evidence that has been out there to support keeping this procedure legal has been debunked and discarded. There is nothing left except zealotry, except this concept that we cannot infringe on this right of abortion--even if, as I would argue, this is not even abortion, as others have argued this is not even abortion once the baby is outside the mother's womb. But we cannot even touch limiting that right. 
I would say there is not a right in America that does not have a limit on it. There is not one. Certainly, when it comes to taking the life of a little baby, we in Congress should be able to muster the courage to put some limit, to draw some line that says `enough.' 
I would also say that for those to whom I have talked, who have run that gauntlet and come over and voted on this issue to support this ban, there has been communicated to me a great sense of relief and satisfaction that they could break those chains and stand up and do what in their heart they knew was right; what in their conscience they knew was right. So I appeal to your conscience, I appeal to your heart. And I appeal to your reason--I appeal to facts. On every score, on every score, we must override the President's veto. 
I see the Senator from New Hampshire is here--I am sorry, I turned my back and he is gone. Let me just say something about the Senator from New Hampshire. The Senator from New Hampshire, Senator Smith, was the first person to introduce this bill in the last session of Congress. He did so when there was not a whole lot of popular support in the polls for this because the knowledge of the American public was minimal at best. He stood here when the votes were a lot closer than they were today and the public was a lot less informed, and all these lies that I showed to you were all out there being accepted by the press as truth. But the Senator from New Hampshire stood here in the well, armed with what he knew was truth. He stood here and argued and tried to focus the American public's attention for the first time on this gruesome, gristly procedure. He is one of the heroes in trying to bring the consciousness of the people to this Chamber. So I salute him for that. I suspect he will be back in a minute. It gives me the opportunity to talk about a couple of other things. 
I want to get back to the moral issue at hand. What we are talking about are babies who are in the 20th week of gestation and later. Now, for most Americans, they have a hard time understanding, `Well, what's the 20th week? What does the baby look like? What are its chances of survival? What are we talking about here?' 
At 20 weeks gestation, a normal baby, `healthy' baby, most normal healthy babies delivered at 20 weeks of gestation will be born alive. That doesn't necessarily mean that they will survive. In fact, very few, if any, babies born at 20 weeks will survive. But they will be born alive. 
Let me give you some of the statistics we have, if we can get that chart, about survival rates of babies who are subject to partial-birth abortion. 
When the Supreme Court came down with the decision on Roe v. Wade, back in the--actually early seventies, but in the late seventies, the information I have, the viability, the time of viability was considered to be around 28 weeks. Babies born before 28 weeks gestation were not considered to be able to be saved. They were not considered to be viable. So much has happened with medical science since that time, and the numbers have changed and changed dramatically. 
Let me share with you some numbers from The Journal of American Medical Association. It is an article I referred to earlier, and I will give the citation. It is called `Rationale for Banning Abortions Late in Pregnancy,' by Leroy Sprang, M.D., and Mark Neerhof, D.O., Northwestern University Medical School, Evanston Northwestern Healthcare. 
Here are some of the numbers that we have used in past debates. 
According to a 1987-1988 NIH study of seven hospitals, you can see at 23 weeks, about a quarter of the babies survive; 24 weeks, 34 percent; 25 weeks, 54 percent. 
From 1986 to 1994 at Minneapolis Children's Medical Center, 45 percent at 23 weeks; 53 percent at 24 weeks; 77 percent at 25 weeks; and 83 percent at 26 weeks. Remember, these weeks gestation during Roe v. Wade when the decision was decided, all of these were considered zero. 
In a Michigan study from 1994 to 1996, you see the numbers--27, 57, 77 and 82 percent. 
Let me give you some updated numbers from this report that was published last month:  
Recent data from our institution [at Northwest]. . . indicate a survival rate at 24 weeks-- 
The second line. A survival rate of 24 weeks of 83 percent--83 percent and at 25 weeks at 89 percent. 
Remember, these are all children born at that hospital, some of whom had abnormalities, some of whom had severe problems. They are not all healthy babies being born, and even at that, the survival rate is in the eighties. If you filtered out those who had fetal anomalies who would have died irrespective of when they were born, I suspect this number is substantially higher. So we are performing partial-birth abortions most commonly on babies who would be almost certain to be able to live. 
Some people suggest I shouldn't draw that distinction. A baby at 20 weeks, whether the baby can survive or not, is still a baby. I happen to subscribe to that. We draw lines that don't exist in our society about what is life and what isn't. There is no doubt in my mind that when my wife became pregnant with a child, I knew that was going to be a little boy or little girl and there wasn't much doubt that it was going to be a dog or a cat. But we draw lines here as to what is life and what isn't. 
Some people feel comfortable drawing lines here. It comes to viability, whether they can live outside the womb. The Supreme Court was one of those entities that did decide that was the place they had to draw the lines, where the rights of the child would increase and the rights of a woman to kill her child would diminish. By not banning this procedure, we allow little children--imagine, most of them, the vast majority, according to the people who perform it, healthy babies, healthy mothers, with very high probability of surviving, who for just one small period of time in the life of that child it is unwanted. For but a moment in the life of a child, that baby is temporarily unwanted by the one person who has absolute control over its destiny. 
We read in the paper so much about parents who are seeking to adopt children. There probably isn't a person here in the room who doesn't know someone who has gone to extraordinary lengths, who has waited an extraordinary long period of time to adopt a baby, to love a baby, to accept it, that little gift from God as their own. And yet because for just a moment in time of what could be a long and beautiful life, that baby is unwanted, and because it is not wanted at that very moment in time, its life is taken away. 
We are talking about if the mother didn't want to carry the pregnancy to term, if the feeling was, `Well, I just don't want to be burdened with this pregnancy anymore,' deliver the baby, give the baby a chance. There is no medical need to kill the baby. There may be medical needs to terminate pregnancy. The doctors today talked about that at their press conference. There may be the need for the health or life of the mother to terminate a pregnancy, but there is never a need to kill a baby in the process of terminating the pregnancy. There is never a need to drag this baby out--a baby that feels pain. In fact, in Great Britain right now the Parliament is considering requiring doctors who perform abortions after 19 weeks to anesthetize the baby because of conclusive research that shows that these babies feel pain. In fact, there are articles that have been written by physicians who say they feel pain more intensely than we do. 
I quote again from this Northwestern study that says:  
When infants of similar gestational ages are delivered, pain management is an important part of the care rendered to them in the intensive care nursery. However, with intact D&X-- 
Partial-birth abortion-- pain management is not provided for the fetus who is literally within inches of being delivered. Forcibly incising the cranium with scissors and then suctioning out the intercranial contents is certainly excruciatingly painful. It is beyond ironic that the pain management practice for an intact D&X on a human fetus would not meet Federal standards for the humane care of animals used in medical research.  
We have laws in this country--imagine--we have laws in this country that require us to treat animals--animals--better than we treat these little gifts from God. What is to become of us when we simply cannot see what we do? 
I see the Senator from Illinois is here. I have used a lot of time on our side. I would be happy to yield the floor to Senator Durbin. 
Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, if I can take a moment to specifically respond to a couple of things from the Senator from Illinois. I commend him for coming forward and expressing his views. We don't agree, but as is appropriate here in the U.S. Senate, we can disagree without being disagreeable. I respect his right to articulate his viewpoints. 
With respect to the letter from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists that the Senator from Illinois read, they did say they: 
. . . could identify no circumstances under which this procedure would be the only option to save the life or preserve the health of a woman. 
And they do go on to say: 
. . . however, [it] may be the best or most appropriate procedure in a particular circumstance to save the life or preserve the health of the woman. 
However, no specific examples or circumstances under which an intact D&X would be the most appropriate procedure are given. In fact, they have never been given. 
They have never put forward any procedure, any circumstance in which they say it may be, but they have never given any hypothetical where it says it would be. That is somewhat troubling, to sort of hang your hat on a possibility when the very organization you are hanging your hat on refuses to give a possibility of whether it meets their definition. 
With respect to the constituent in the Senator's State, I can't tell you how sorry I feel for her and for what she had to go through. But, unfortunately, many people in this country do not get the best medical information. One of the things I hope we can accomplish with this discussion--and I think to some degree we have--is to improve the quality of information women get in this country with respect to decisions about pregnancy, particularly late-term, and particularly when it comes to disabled children or children who maybe just aren't perfect. 
I just know from all of the information we have been provided from the AMA, from the physicians--and Senator Frist is going to talk about it from the point of view of a physician --in every case the President cited, including the case the Senator referred to in Illinois, there were other, better alternatives available to her that would have been safer for her to have as opposed to this. It doesn't mean her doctor didn't want to perform this. The doctor may well have. But the fact is, we don't always get the best doctors who give us the best advice. We went to the experts, and what the experts have told us is that this procedure is not the safest. 
With that, I yield to the Senator from Tennessee, the only physician in the U.S. Senate, to talk about that very subject.

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I will respond in one quick way to the comments of the Senator from Virginia. What has been sort of taken as a matter of record is that 80 to 90 percent of the partial-birth abortions performed in this country are on healthy women with healthy babies and that these are done for truly elective reasons. The idea that somehow we are holding on to this myth that we are doing this to save unhealthy women or because a baby is so severely deformed that they cannot live just isn't what the facts dictate. And that is from admissions from folks who perform the procedures, not our side coming up with these numbers. 
I hope we can stick with the facts as to what we are really talking about. 
I have no speakers on my side, so I will be happy to yield.

Mr. SANTORUM. I suggest to the Senator from Illinois, if you read the definition of partial-birth abortion in the bill, partial-birth abortion is partially vaginally delivering a living fetus. 
So if the baby in this case had an injection in the heart to stop the heart, the baby would have died at that point, and then the baby would be removed from the uterus, the baby would be dead, and therefore would not fall under the definition. 
So in the case that you mentioned, she did not have a partial-birth abortion by definition. She couldn't, because the baby was dead at that point.

<DOCNO>105-santorum-pa-15-19980917</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. SANTORUM. I respond to that by saying I think it points out the cruelty, unnecessary cruelty, of doing the procedure that we are attempting to ban here. 
What was done by the woman and the doctor in this case, I think, first off, the baby was not delivered, was not outside the mother, and then painfully and brutally killed. The baby was killed in utero by an injection. While I don't like abortion, period, I think that less shocks the conscience of our country than delivering a baby, as in the case of partial birth, 
most of them being healthy with healthy mothers. In this case, that is not the case. But there is a real distinction here, and what I think your case points out is that there are viable, less-invasive, less-dangerous-to-the-mother alternatives available, even for cases where you have pregnancies that have gone awry, and that are less cruel and barbaric to the baby and less dangerous to the woman. 
You talked about preserving maternal health. There is nothing more that I want to accomplish with this bill than preserving maternal health. But we have ample evidence, including from the AMA who testified, that this procedure is not healthy for women, and there are other procedures, such as the one the Senator outlined, that are safer for women who may elect to have an abortion--a legal abortion, which we don't outlaw with this bill. We just say that there are alternatives. The letter you read says, in fact, a viable and often-used alternative to a partial-birth abortion that would continue to be available, which is less risky to the mother, and that is less gruesome, barbaric, and horrific to the child.

<TEXT>
Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator from Alaska for his leadership and support. He has always come to the floor and spoken in strong support of this, and he has been a great and committed warrior in this cause. I thank him for that. 
Mr. President, the Senator from California gave her remarks and she talked about women here in town who had horrible things happen to them during pregnancy, and that they were faced with very difficult decisions to make. I understand that those are difficult decisions. She said, in one case, that a baby was well along and was, unfortunately, hydrocephalic, which means water on the brain. They could not do a vaginal, natural delivery. For some reason, she did not want to do a C-section. There were no other options available to save this mother's health. Let me just read to you what a doctor said, a board-certified OB/GYN: 
Sometimes in the case of hydrocephalus, in order to drain some of the fluid from the baby's head, a special long needle is used to allow a safe vaginal cephalic head-first delivery. In some cases, when the vaginal delivery is not possible, a doctor performs the Cesarean Section. But in no case is it necessary, or medically advisable, to partially deliver an infant through the vagina and then cruelly kill the infant. 
Another piece of information that the Senator from California and the Senator from Illinois were talking about is that women would have their health and life at risk with having an abortion, going through with the pregnancy later in term. The facts are just the opposite. The Senator from Illinois said, `Let's not deal with anecdotes, let's deal with facts.' 
Here is the statistical evidence: At 21 weeks or more--that is the time in which partial-birth abortions are done because they begin to be done at 20 weeks gestation--the risk of death from abortion is 1 in 6,000 and exceeds the risk of maternal death from childbirth, which is 1 in 13,000. 
You are twice as likely to die if you have an abortion than if you deliver the baby after 21 weeks. 
So this whole concept that these procedures are necessary--a procedure that is much more risky than others, much more dangerous than other procedures to the mother--aside from the fact that they are brutal procedures, this is a procedure that is much more risky to the mother; that just the medical evidence shows, the statistics show, that having an abortion--and there are other complications--termination of a pregnancy at more advanced--again, this is from an article, from the Journal of the American Medical Association, August 26, 1998, current edition, which talks about two obstetricians from Northwestern University. It says: 
Termination of pregnancy at more advanced gestational ages may predispose to infertility from endometrial scarring or adhesion formation. 
It is documented in one study that 23.1 percent of patients had induced midtrimester abortions. Nearly a quarter of those. Again, that is all midtrimester abortions. You hear the argument in this paper and by hundreds of physicians that partial-birth abortion is even more damaging to the cervix and to the future ability for a mother to carry a baby to term. 
It continues on: 
. . . and from pelvic infections, which occur in 2.8% to 25% of patients following midtrimester terminations. Dilation and evacuation procedures commonly used in induced midtrimester abortion may lead to cervical incompetence, which predisposes to an increased risk of subsequent spontaneous abortion, especially in the midtrimester. Cervical incompetence is more prevalent after midtrimester termination of pregnancy than first trimester termination because the cervix is dilated to a much greater degree. 
And other physicians have gone on to say that because this is a procedure that takes 3 days to dilate--you hear so much about this may be necessary to save the life or health of the mother because of some emergency. This is a 3-day procedure. The cervix is dilated over a 3-day procedure, which makes the probability of an incompetent cervix, which means the ability to carry a baby in future pregnancies--it inhibits the ability to carry a baby in future pregnancies. It increases the risk of infection, because now for 3 days the cervix is open. And they are not in a hospital setting. They are out, either back at their home, or in a hotel, waiting for the procedure to be done. This is an unhealthy procedure for women. 
If we are concerned about women's health, let's look at the fact about what this does to women's health. Frankly, it sounds to me, if you look at the evidence, there seems to be a sort of pushing aside of all of the nonanecdotal evidence about women's health and putting forth legal arguments about what the Supreme Court says. They are one of three branches of Government, folks.

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, they are focusing on legal arguments. The fact of the matter is we are one of three branches of Government. We can put forward things that we believe are constitutional. We can test what they are. I have seen a lot of decisions at the Supreme Court that have moved all over the place on this issue. 
It seems very clear to me that we are not providing an undue burden. We are here. We are eliminating one procedure that is not taught in any medical school, that has not been peer-reviewed, that has not been done in a hospital. It is done in clinics, and, in fact, was invented--created--not by an obstetrician. 
Someone referred to earlier that Senator Frist and C. Everett Koop are two people who testified against this procedure. They are not obstetricians. That is true. But the person who invented this procedure is not an obstetrician, either. He was a family practitioner who did abortions. 
So the fact of the matter is that C. Everett Koop was a pediatric surgeon--someone who dealt with these little babies, who understands very well what damage is done to these little babies, and, in fact, what is available to save their lives. He knows very well about what he talks about, as does the Senator from Tennessee who has studied this issue thoroughly, and who has reviewed the literature thoroughly. 
Let's walk away from the facts for a moment. Let's deal in the realm of what the other side seems to point to--the pictures. 
The Senator from California suggested that there will be women here who have had this procedure who will be in the Halls looking at Members as they come in to vote tomorrow to insist that they keep this procedure legal. I only wish, I only wish, that the children who have fallen victim to this would have the opportunity to stand in that Hall and look at the Senators and plead with them to ban this procedure. 
We may have one such person which I will talk about in a moment. 
But I am going to talk to you first about a little boy--a little boy who was the first child of Whitney Goin. Whitney was 5 months pregnant with her first child. She went in for her first sonogram, and a large abdominal wall defect was detected. She described her condition after learning that there was a problem with the pregnancy:  
My husband was unreachable so I sat alone, until my mother arrived, as the doctor described my baby as being severely deformed with a gigantic defect and most likely many other defects that he could not detect with their equipment. He went on to explain that babies with this large of a defect are often stillborn, live very shortly or could survive with extensive surgeries and treatments, depending on the presence of additional anomalies and complications after birth. The complications and associated problems that a surgical baby in this condition could suffer include but are not limited to: bladder exstrophy, imperforate anus, collapsed lungs, diseased liver, fatal infections, cardiovascular malformations, ect. 
A perinatologist suggested she strongly consider having a partial-birth abortion. The doctor told her it may be something she `needs' to do. He described the procedure as one where the baby would be partially delivered except for the head, and the pregnancy would be terminated. 
The Goins made a different choice. 
If there is one thing that those who are listening to this debate--if there is one thing that I hope for that results from this debate today, it is that people who will be watching this debate understand one thing: Whether we pass this override of the President's veto or not, please understand that there are other choices. There are other options--and to follow your heart, to follow your love for your child, and pursue those options, as Whitney Goin did. 
The Goins chose to carry the baby to term. But complications related to a drop in the amniotic fluid created some concerns. Doctors voiced to the Goins that the baby's chances for survival would be greater outside the womb. So on October 26, 1995, Andrew Hewitt Goin was delivered by C-section. He was born with a condition in which the abdominal organs--stomach, liver, spleen, and small and large intestines--were outside the baby's body. 
Here is the picture. In the incubator there is little Andrew Hewitt Goin. 
Andrew had his first of several major operations 2 hours after he was born. Andrew's first months were not easy. He suffered from excruciating pain. He was on a respirator for 6 weeks. He needed tubes in his nose and throat. They continually suctioned his stomach and lungs. He needed eight blood transfusions. His mother recalled, `The enormous pressure of the organs being slowly placed into his body caused chronic lung disease for which he received extensive oxygen and steroid treatments.' It broke his parents' hearts to see him suffering so badly. 
Remember how we heard about someone who said that it would just break your heart to see your child suffer so badly. And I understand what she feels. But it breaks the hearts of thousands of parents every day to see their children suffer. But that is no reason, that is no reason, to kill your child. It is all the more reason to love that child, to draw that child near to you, and to accept that child as part of your family. 
Andrew fought hard to live. And he did. This is Andrew Hewitt Goin at 3 years of age. 
I would also note that Andrew will not be the only child for much longer. Next March, the Goins will welcome their second child into the family. Contrary to the misinformation about partial-birth abortion that has been so recklessly repeated, carrying Andrew to term did not affect Whitney's ability to have future children. 
I think if you asked Andrew a few years from now whether he would prefer to have suffered that pain or be listening to music, or not be listening to that music, or not be alive today, the answer would be pretty clear. 
Not all the stories turn out as happily as Andrew's. Not all of them do. But what does turn out happily in so many more instances is for parents to have the recognition that they have the capacity to love their children even when it is so hard to do that. Whether we override the President's veto is less important than that simple fact that I hope the people listening here will understand. 
The next case I want to talk about is Christian Matthew McNaughton. For 4 years, Christian Matthew McNaughton fought the odds. An ultrasound revealed that he had hydrocephalus 30 weeks into pregnancy--again, the condition that has been described as one that is necessary to kill the child and perform a partial-birth abortion, the very case just cited in this Chamber as the reason for keeping this procedure legal. 
After Dianne McNaughton learned of their son's dim prospects because of hydrocephaly, which can cause a variety of problems including, because of the water on the brain, the lack of brain development, Dianne asked for information on hydrocephaly. The counselor called doctors on staff and explained the request, and imagine Mrs. McNaughton's surprise when the counselor told her the hospital felt `it was better if she didn't know anything.' 
Still, Dianne and her husband, Mark, determined to educate themselves on what to expect from now and how to care for a child who had hydrocephaly. They continued to persevere. Life was very stressful for the McNaughtons after the diagnosis. Dianne suffered from nightmares. She never considered aborting the baby, but she worried about how her other two children would be affected by having a disabled child in the home. With the help of Dianne's brother, who happened to be a doctor, the McNaughtons found a specialist in Philadelphia to deliver their baby. 
As we learned last year with the case of Donna Joy Watts, another child with hydrocephaly, the Watts family had to go to three hospitals in Maryland before they could find a physician team and a hospital that would deliver their child, because children with hydrocephaly are thought not to have the ability to live and are simply seen as abortion clients; they are seen as disposable. 
They were advised again to end their pregnancy. They were warned that hydrocephaly is associated with spina bifida, Down's syndrome, and cerebral palsy. The baby might never achieve bowel or bladder control; he might not be able to move his arms or legs; he might be born blind; he might not even be able to swallow. 
The McNaughtons were offered a partial-birth abortion. As a doctor explained it, the baby would be partially delivered, a sharp surgical instrument would be inserted into the base of the skull, and the brains would be extracted--of course, the doctor noted, `what there was of the brain.' The rest of the body would then be delivered. This option was rejected. 
As if the shock of being advised to undergo a gruesome partial-birth abortion was not enough, one doctor said the shunt surgery to relieve the pressure and the fluid in the baby's brain would not be performed if the child's `quality of life' prospects did not warrant it. 
I again go back to the case of Donna Joy Watts just so you don't think this is one isolated case. For 3 days, Lori Watts had to plead with the doctors at the hospital to do a shunt operation to relieve the fluid pressure on the brain, and the doctors refused to because the doctors didn't think she had any chance of a quality life. Donna Joy Watts is here in Washington today. She is 5, almost 6, years of age. 
Christian was born June 20, 1993. He was a beautiful, 8-pound baby boy. He did require a lot of medical care. A CAT scan revealed that he suffered a stroke in utero which caused excess fluid to build up in his brain. It also showed that the lower left quadrant of his brain was missing. Within a week of delivery, Christian had his first shunt surgery to drain the fluid. He had a follow-up procedure in 3 months. 
As he grew, Christian exceeded everyone's expectations. A baby that doctors initially believed would be blind or could do virtually nothing was a little boy who walked, ran, talked, and sang. He played baseball and basketball. He attended preschool. His heroes were Cal Ripken, Jr, Batman, Spiderman, and the Backstreet Boys. He loved whales and dolphins. His favorite movie was `Angels in the Outfield.' And he especially loved his baby sister who was 2 years younger than he. Christian McNaughton brought joy to all who were fortunate enough to know him. 
In August of 1997, Christian began experiencing severe head pains. His shunt was malfunctioning. It had to be replaced. He went into surgery and experienced cardiac and respiratory distress in surgery, and he slipped into a coma. Christian fought hard to live but he never recovered. He died on August 8, 1997, at the age of 4. 
But if you talked to his parents and you talked to those who knew him and you asked them whether they would have traded those 4 years for denying Christian's humanity by aborting him in such a brutal and inhumane way, they would have said no. 
On the anniversary of his death, they entered these memorials to Christian in the Harrisburg Patriot News:  
Christian, we love you. We miss you. We wish we could kiss you just one more time. Until we meet again. Your loving sisters, Meghan and Kelly. 
The McNaughtons were worried about whether their children would accept a disabled child in the home. I think it is pretty clear that they accepted him very well, and he added to their lives, and he affirmed their lives. 
A letter from the brother: 
Dear Christian. I have a poem for you. 
Blue jays are blue and I love you. 
Robins are red and I miss you in bed. 
Sparrows are black and I wish you were back. 
I am sorry for the bad things I did to you. You are the best and only brother I ever had. Please watch over us and take care of us. 
We wonder whether those children accepted this child. This is a sad story, but it is a joyous story. It is a story of acceptance and love. 
One of the things that often confounds me about how people deal with this issue is that people who are in the tradition of the Democratic Party, who have sought for the past 100 years to be inclusive in our society, to welcome those who are on the outside of society, to fight for civil rights, to fight for rights for the disabled, are always fighting to include those who are most vulnerable, now turn their backs to the most vulnerable of all. 
How does that speak to a country where Hubert Humphrey once said: `We are judged by how we treat the least of us.' Can you think of anything less in our human family than a little baby outside of the mother's womb, 3 inches from life, asking only to be given a chance; prone, with its back to the abortionist, helpless from what might happen next? Just like baby Phoenix, helpless. But, thank God, a moment, finally a moment of conscience hit him and he decided, no, I can't thrust those scissors into this child. And now this temporarily unwanted baby is so loved and wanted somewhere in Texas, by parents who cherish that little girl every day. 
The question is, in this debate--you can talk about legal axioms, you can talk about medical theories, you can talk about ethics, you can talk about all sorts of things. The question here is how inclusive are we going to be in our family? As I see the empty seats on this side of the aisle, and I look for the men and women who have given great talks on the floor of the U.S. Senate about the need for rights for the downtrodden: Find me a more helpless creature in our human family, a more downtrodden, helpless, beautiful creation of God than a little baby, his back to the doctor who is going to kill him or her, waiting for the pain to stop. 
Mr. President, do we have any time?

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I want to speak for a couple of minutes. I know the Senator from Ohio, the Presiding Officer, will be coming down and speaking. 
I want to point out one thing. Several comments have been made on the other side about the life-of-the-mother exception in the bill. I just want to read it. There is some concern that there is no life-of-the-mother exception in the bill. Let me assure everyone in this Chamber and everyone within the sound of my voice that there is a clear life-of-the-mother exception that gives physicians the right to make those critical medical decisions that unfortunately may occur that would necessitate the killing of a baby in a crisis situation that is in the 
process of being delivered. 
If you do not believe me, let me read from a letter that was written during the debate last year by the American Medical Association that endorsed this bill. I will read the pertinent language with respect to the life-of-the-mother exception.  
Our support of this legislation is based on three specific principles. First, the bill would allow a legitimate exception where the life of the mother was endangered, thereby preserving the physician's judgment to take any medically necessary steps to save the life of the mother. 
This is a group of physicians who in the previous paragraph said: 
Although our general policy is to oppose legislation criminalizing medical practice or procedure, the AMA has supported such legislation where the procedure was narrowly defined and not medically indicated. 
So while they have reticence, and had reticence, about supporting any kind of a ban on the procedure, one of the things that made them comfortable about supporting this particular piece of legislation was the language having to do with the life-of-the-mother exception. They felt it gave physicians sufficient room to be able to make that call if in fact someone was in a life-threatening situation and a baby would have to be killed in the process of saving the mother's life, if so determined by the doctor. We have provided that. 
I think it is very unfortunate that Members on the other side have raised this red herring that has no basis in fact--no basis in the legal language. 
I don't want to go any further. I will come back and read the exact language in the bill for anyone who has a question. 
It is a very clear life-of-the-mother exception that gives plenty of leeway for the physician to be able to take whatever action is necessary to save the mother. And to perpetrate that hoax on Members of Congress and those who might be listening who might not have the bill in front of them is really, I should add, another lie to the lies that I enumerated earlier, the six lies. Now I have to add a seventh--that there is somehow no life-of-the-mother exception in the bill when the very organization whose physicians are going to be practicing says there is a legitimate exception, thereby preserving the physician's judgment to take any medically necessary steps to save the life of the mother. 
I don't know how more clear you can be. I will have more to say. 
I will yield the floor so the Senator from Ohio, who is one of the great champions of pro-life in this country, someone who is outspoken not just here on the Senate floor but around the country, and he has lived by example as well as by his speeches. I yield to the Senator from Ohio, Senator DeWine. 
Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, first, again, I thank the Senator from Ohio for his excellent comments and particularly his latter focus on the legal issues that were not brought up earlier. I had not had the opportunity, and neither did anybody else, to focus attention on why this particular legislation is, in fact, constitutional and that should not be a reason to not vote for this legislation. An excellent job done.

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I find it quite ironic that I am, at the closing here, passing this bill about which I have strong reservations because I was not able to place an amendment in and have an amendment debated on this bill. But this is the child nutrition bill, and I understand a lot of very important things need to be done. 
I very much would have liked to have had the opportunity to debate something that all the nutrition groups, all of the public interest groups, as well as a lot of manufacturers who use peanuts, would love to have seen, and that is an opportunity for us not to have the Child Nutrition Program paying an exorbitant amount of money, more than they need to, robbing children of the ability to get food in other places because we pay such high prices for peanuts in this country for food programs. 
It would be nice if we would have been able to debate that amendment, but we can't.

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill, S. 2286, be considered read a third time, and the Senate then proceed to the consideration of calendar No. 480, H.R. 3874, the House-passed companion measure. I further ask consent that all after the enacting clause be stricken and the text of S. 2286 be inserted in lieu thereof, the bill be read a third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table. I further ask consent that the Senate insist on its amendment, request a conference with the House, and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate. I finally ask that S. 2286 be placed back on the calendar.

Mr. SANTORUM. If I can, let us return to the issue that we have spent a great deal of the day debating. I know the hour is late. Let me thank the staff who are here, the pages, and others. The pages are actually very happy I am up here talking, because if I talk for a little while longer they will not have school in the morning. So that will be a good thing for them--as I see the smiles down there and the encouragement to wind it up and get going. 
I thank the Senator from Arkansas for his indulgence in presiding during these remarks. But as I mentioned today, I think this is one of the most important issues we can face here in the U.S. Senate. As the Senator from Ohio eloquently said, it begins the process of defining who we are as a country and what will become of us as a civilization if we do not begin to draw lines where lines need to be drawn. 
I just find it remarkable that we seem to create these fictions when it comes to life. When it comes to the life of little children, we create this fiction in our mind. And it was a fiction that was created back when Roe v. Wade was decided that these were not really babies. 
We did not have good ultrasounds then and the kind of technology where we could really see how developed these little babies were in the womb. They were just sort of passed off as these sort of blobs. Yet, we now know, through the miracle of ultrasound, and other techniques, that these are precious little developing babies. 
It is very difficult as a father who has seen those ultrasounds of our children to dismiss the humanity, that my wife Karen was carrying a blob of tissue or something that was prehuman. But we tell these lies to ourselves in order that we can go on and in order that we can sort of live with our own internal inconsistencies. 
One lie you cannot tell, one lie that is inescapable--inescapably alive--is the lie of partial-birth abortion being something that is medically necessary or that simply this baby is just sort of this blob of tissue. This baby is outside of the mother. Its arms, its legs, its torso, outside of the mother--just inches away from being born. 
One of the things I often marvel at--and I just do not understand--is why wouldn't you, if you have gone through the process, as I described earlier today, of dilating the cervex over 3 days, reaching in with forceps and pulling the baby out in a breached position, which is dangerous, again, for the baby and mother, and you deliver that entire baby, why wouldn't you just let the rest of the baby come out? 
Why is it necessary to protect the health of the mother at that point in time--now that you have gone through all this other procedure--at that very crucial moment when the doctor takes those scissors and begins the process of killing that baby? Why at that moment is the mother's health in less danger if you kill that baby than if you just gave that little, helpless, defenseless and, yes, even at times imperfect life the opportunity for life? 
Why does that so endanger the mother to do that? Why is it necessary to thrust these Metzenbaum scissors into the base of the baby's skull? Why is it necessary to suction the baby's brains out? 
So many doctors have described to me in testimony--and today at a press conference--the complications resulting from this blind procedure where the physician has to feel for the base of the neck and could slip and miss. As the Senator from Tennessee testified today, there are large vessels, blood vessels within a centimeter from the point where this procedure is done that a minor miss could lacerate and cause hemorrhaging and severe complications, or by thrusting the scissors in the back of the neck, through a bony part of the brain, you could only imagine what would happen to the skull of that baby and what damage that skull could do to the mother. 
How can we--how can we--continue to contend or pretend that this is healthy for the mother to end this baby's life when it is this close and a delivery could be performed? Let's get away from that charade because it is a charade. It is not about the health of the mother; it is about killing a baby. It is about making sure, beyond any certainty, beyond any doubt, that the result of this abortion you are going to have is a dead baby. 
That is what this is about. This is about a lethal form of abortion, not a healthy form for the mother--far from it. Even folks who disagree with this legislation will tell you that this very well may not be the safest form. In fact, that organization has not done any studies to prove it is safe, that is, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists. They have done no studies to prove that this procedure is safe, that this procedure is preferable. 
They say--they say--and I will quote them--they say: 
[We] could identify no circumstances under which this procedure . . . would be the only option to save the life or preserve the health of the woman. 
That is an admission by the organization that all those in opposition to this bill use as their medical shield. Listen to what they say. They never read this part of the letter. They only read the second part, which I will read to fully disclose. I will read it again, an ACOG policy statement emanating from the review declared that: 
A select panel [the panel they selected to review this] could identify no circumstances under which this procedure [partial-birth abortion], would be the only option to save the life or preserve the health of the woman. 
They went on to say that a partial-birth abortion: 
. . . however, may be the best or most appropriate procedure in a particular circumstance to save the life or preserve the health of a woman. 
They say that: 
. . . only the doctor, in consultation with the patient based upon the woman's particular circumstances can make this decision. 
That is what you hear from the other side. What you do not hear from the other side is that this report lists no circumstances to support that claim. They can give, and in fact have given--this was written well over a year ago--they have given no medical situation, no scenario, no hypothetical where what they say may happen would, in fact, happen, 
which is that a partial-birth abortion would be preferable to some other procedure. They just think it might. 
Now, I might be wrong, but there are probably very few things that are happening in obstetrics today that haven't happened for the past several years. There are not a lot of new things coming up. There are problems that come up routinely. There may be some strange problems; they are probably not new. 
To make this kind of statement and support it with no evidence is irresponsible. To use this organization and this statement as a shield when they cannot provide one single example where this procedure would be preferable, again, just builds up the record that I have laid out. This entire debate is based upon a series of misleading statements to try to divert attention away from the horrible, barbaric reality and the fact that this is not a medically necessary procedure. 
I want to get back for 1 minute to the issue of life of the mother which I addressed a few minutes ago. I said I would read the piece of legislation itself to put to bed, if you will, any concern by anyone who might be listening that there isn't a legitimate life-of-the-mother exception. I noted the American Medical Association's letter of endorsement of this bill. They believe there is a legitimate exception if the life of the mother is in danger. 
Let me read the actual legislation, the paragraph on prohibition of partial-birth abortion:  
. . . shall not apply to a partial-birth abortion that is necessary to save the life of a mother whose life is endangered by a physical disorder, illness, or injury. 
Now, I cannot imagine a life-of-the-mother situation this does not cover. In fact, I don't recall any example from the other side of a life-of-the-mother situation that this does not cover. They just say it is different from other life-of-the-mother exceptions that we put forward. But they don't say where the `hole' is in the exception. 
I think it is very clear and very certain that there is an adequate protection in that case. 
I will say that I cannot imagine--and I have talked to many physicians on this point--I cannot imagine a woman coming into an emergency room where her life is in danger, whether she is hemorrhaging or has preeclampsia--I can't imagine a doctor, being presented with this emergency case where they must act within a short period of time, saying, `We are going to dilate your cervix over a 3-day period of time and we will perform this procedure.' That just wouldn't happen. It is almost absurd to suggest that this would actually be used in a situation where the life of the mother was threatened. 
Yes, there is a life-of-the-mother exception, but there is absolutely no circumstance I could conceive of--and I don't recall any information from any of the medical experts by the other side coming out and saying medical experts believe that there is a case where the life of the mother is in danger in an emergency situation where they may use this. I don't think they even made claims of the woman presenting herself to a hospital or a clinic, where her life is in danger, that any practitioner would use a 3-day procedure. 
While there is a life-of-the-mother exception in there, and I think it is a solid one, it is certainly not one that I believe will ever be used, because this procedure certainly doesn't comport with a life-threatening situation because of the time it takes. 
Since I have the AMA letter here, I want to read it. I think it is important for the Record to reflect the support of the American Medical Association, `physicians dedicated to the health of America.' That is their saying under their logo. 
They say: 
Our support of this legislation is based on three specific principles. First, the bill would allow a legitimate exception where the life of the mother was endangered, thereby preserving the physician's judgment to take any medically necessary steps to save the life of the mother. Second, the bill would clearly define the prohibited procedure so that it is clear on the face of the legislation what act is to be banned. Finally, the bill would give any accused physician the right to have his or her conduct reviewed by the State medical board before a criminal trial commenced. In this manner, the bill would provide a formal role for valuable medical peer determination in any enforcement proceeding. 
The AMA believes that with these changes, physicians will be on notice as to the exact nature of the prohibited conduct. 
Thank you for the opportunity to work with you towards restricting a procedure we all agree is not good medicine. 
Not good medicine. 
With respect to the points they make, many of the courts--while some have validated the statutes, some of the courts have been concerned about vagueness, of what procedure we are actually defining. 
We worked with the American Medical Association to come up with a new definition, a tighter definition that put the physician, as they say, on notice as to the exact nature of the prohibited conduct, which I think is important to meet constitutional scrutiny. 
Second, we provide an opportunity for the procedure and the conduct of the physician to be reviewed by the State medical board to see whether, in fact, it was necessary under some circumstance, which was an important peer review element that we think is a safeguard, if you will, for the physician. 
A couple of other points that I want to make before I go back to talking about what I was talking about when we had to conclude debate earlier today. 
This is a picture of a young man by the name of Tony Melendez. That is Tony. Tony Melendez will be here in Washington tomorrow up in the Senate gallery watching the vote on partial-birth abortion, because Tony's disability, Tony's handicap, is one of the disabilities that has been mentioned here on the floor as a good reason to perform a partial-birth abortion. 
Senators come up and say there are children who will be so grossly deformed. They may be blind--I am not making this up; this is what was said--blind, or without arms or without legs, and they went on with other deformities. Well, Tony Melendez is a thalidomide baby. Tony Melendez doesn't have any arms. Tony Melendez was born in Rivas, Nicaragua. His father was a graduate of the International Academy of Agriculture in this town and had a good job in the sugar refinery. 
Sara, his mother, was an elementary school teacher. They had their first child, named Jose. In the summer of 1961, she had a second pregnancy. She was given thalidomide to treat her morning sicknesses because it was hailed as a safer alternative to other sedatives to deal with morning sickness. On January 9, 1962, Sara gave birth to Tony. He had no arms, 11 toes, and a severe club foot that would require surgical repair if he were ever to have a chance to walk. He was typical of babies who were exposed to thalidomide at the early stages of pregnancy. 
Well, his family was very concerned about showing the baby to the mother because of the fear of her reaction. When they did give little Tony to his mother, she embraced her child with the confidence that he would live a full and meaningful life, regardless of his flaws. Still there was question of how he could live a normal life with no arms. Young Tony answered the question one day when he was in his crib. His mother had put away the toys that he had been given as gifts because she assumed he would be unable to enjoy them. However, Tony showed he could play just like any other child when a red balloon landed in his crib. He began bouncing it up and down with his feet, laughing and giggling. She placed the toys in the crib and vowed that day that she would never assume Tony could not do anything because of his disability. She would let him try. 
Tony needed corrective surgery for his club foot. Since Nicaragua did not have adequate facilities, or the level of care he needed, they went to Los Angeles. Due to the nature and length of time involved in Tony's corrective surgery, the family decided to stay in the United States and become citizens. Tony spent most of his childhood in Southeastern California. 
Tony enjoyed sports, particularly volley ball--volley ball?--where he would hit the ball with his head back over the net. And, of course, he liked soccer. As a sixth grader, Tony wanted to play a game that the neighbor kids were playing, in which his brother Jose excelled--basketball. He tried, with great difficulty, with his feet to do what his peers did so easily with their hands. After being told by his brother that he could not do it, he was determined to do it, and despite blistering and even bleeding toes, one day he eventually succeeded. The one thing Tony hated more than anything else was growing up and not being treated as an equal. When once asked whether he preferred to be called handicapped or disabled, Tony responded that he would like to be called `human.' 
At the age of 14, in high school, he demanded to be transferred out of a handicapped class to the regular classroom with students. He was allowed to go to a normal gym class. In his first gym class, he was watched intensely by the others when class started. Jumping jacks? How would a kid with no arms do jumping jacks? The other kids tried to determine that, and they watched and tried to be subtle in looking. And Tony jumped and shouted and counted in unison with the others. The rest of the class accepted him readily. 
In his teenage years, Tony showed a talent for music. He learned to play the guitar with his feet. At first, he played at various events, such as weddings, funerals, and special events at his church. Eventually, he turned his guitar talent into a full-time vocation. Here is a picture of Tony Melendez today. In connection with his church, he would also talk to groups of kids about his story and how one can overcome difficulty. Tony's life was such an inspirational story, and he was selected to be a `gift' to the Pope by a Catholic youth group during a papal visit to California in 1987. Tony gave a performance to a live audience of 6,000 at the Universal Amphitheater in Hollywood. He performed at World Youth Day in 1991 and World Youth Day in Denver 1993. He also has appeared on numerous television shows and performed at major sporting events, recently singing the National Anthem at Yankee Stadium, I believe. Tony now resides in Dallas, Texas. 
Why do I talk about Tony Melendez? Today on the floor of the Senate, the Senator from California referred to some people up in the galleries as women who needed to have partial-birth abortions, and that they would be here tomorrow standing in the Halls staring at Senators as they walked in here to make sure they knew--that we knew they were there to keep this procedure legal. Tony Melendez, and so many like Tony who are not perfect in the eyes of our society--but, of course, are perfect in the eyes of God--will be there also to represent the millions of little babies who could not be there themselves, to remind every Member that walks on this floor that there is a severe cost, a human cost to what we will be voting on tomorrow. And the ones who have the arrow or the bull's-eye on their back, who are the target of partial-birth abortion--at least if you believe the arguments on the other side--are people like Tony Melendez who, because they are not perfect, don't deserve to live. 
I have always found it ironic, and I will never forget the last time we brought this bill up on the floor of the Senate. I remember standing here waiting for the debate to begin and working on some remarks, and the debate that was going on around us. The vote that was finally taken was on a bill to provide individuals with disabilities the right to an education in a classroom. I will never forget the Members, many of which oppose banning partial-birth abortions; I will never forget those Members coming to the floor and standing up with passion, which I respect, admire, and support, about how children with disabilities should have the right to live a fulfilling, complete life, and should be given rights to education. Or as they did under the Americans With Disability Act, where they should have the right to public transportation, the right to have access to buildings, to cut the curbs at the corners so they can have access to sidewalks--rights, rights, rights--with the passion that was the hallmark of liberalism in this country--until this issue, because with the very next vote they cast they made this statement: If you can survive the womb, we will defend your rights. But we will not defend your right to be born in the first place. In fact, you are the very reason this procedure needs to continue, because we don't want you. You are not what we are looking for in people. 
What a loss this country would have without Tony Melendez. But had partial-birth abortions been around when Tony was in his mother's womb, many on this floor would stand up and argue that he is just the kind of baby that we need to get rid of with this procedure. The Bible says, and Abraham Lincoln quoted, `A house divided against itself cannot stand.' You cannot stand up and passionately argue for the rights of the disabled, and with the same breath not give them the right to exist in the first place. It doesn't make sense. It isn't logical or rational. Oh, it may be political; it may make sense because little babies in the womb don't vote, but it makes no logical sense, and it makes no moral sense to draw that line where it doesn't exist. 
The Senator from Illinois said today that we should not have this debate with anecdotes. Yet, this debate has been all anecdotes on the other side because the facts are not in their favor. So I thought it was important to present some anecdotes on the other side, to lay out what we are missing. Tony's is a happy story, but earlier today I talked about some stories that were not so happy. The endings were so fairy tale-like. 
Let me talk about another one of those stories--a little girl named Mary Bernadette French. In 1993, Jeannie French was overjoyed to learn she was pregnant with twins. Four months into her pregnancy, tragedy struck and Jeannie learned her daughter Mary was not developing normally. 
Specialists identified an opening at the base of the baby's neck. Mary was diagnosed with occipital encephalocele, a condition in which the majority of the brain develops outside the skull. Prospects for a normal life for the child were very dim. Jeannie's doctors advised her to abort Mary due to the severity of the disability and in order to reduce the complications of the twin birth. 
What a horrible thing she must have had to deal with--two lives within her, one, according to the doctor, potentially threatening the other. Because Mary could not have survived normal labor, Jeannie and her husband opted for a cesarean section. In December of 1993, Mary was born 1 minute after her twin brother, Will. Hospital staff promptly moved Will to the nursery. Mary stayed with her parents, was welcomed into the world by her parents, grandparents, and close friends of the family. Mary was held, loved, and serenaded for 6 hours. She quietly passed away that afternoon. 
That is little Mary in the arms, I believe, of her grandmother. 
In memory of her daughter, Jeannie French testified in favor of the ban on partial-birth abortions before the Senate Judiciary Committee. She explained that Mary's life was short but meaningful. She entreated the committee: `Some children by nature cannot live. If we are to call ourselves a civilized culture, we must allow that their death be natural, peaceful, and painless. And if other pre-born children face a life of disability, let us welcome them into society with our arms open in love.' 
For the Record, Jeannie French requested meetings with the President, pleading with him on more than one occasion to listen to a fellow Democrat, she said, who is on the other side of the debate. She explained in the letter:  
We simply want the truth to be heard regarding the risks of carrying disabled children to term. You say that partial-birth abortion has to be legal, for cases like ours, because women's bodies would be `ripped to shreds' by carrying their very sick children to term. By your repeated statements, you imply that partial-birth abortion is the only or most desirable response to children suffering severe disabilities like our children. 
What she showed is that instead of giving her child a death sentence, she found it within herself to love that child. She found it within herself to name that child, to welcome that child into the family, to commit to that child as a child who will always be part of the family, who will always be in her memory and in the memory of her twin brother--not a bag of tissue discarded and executed, ignored, and put behind them, but loved, accepted, welcomed, and committed to memory; with pain, yes, but with the knowledge that in the 6 hours that little Mary Bernadette French lived, she knew love. She was loved by her mother and father. What greater gift can a parent give? What a life, as short as it was, to know only love and her parents. 
Jeannie continues her efforts today to educate the public about partial-birth abortion. She also works to ensure that people know that the lives of disabled children, while short, are sometimes painful and not in vain because they teach us so much about us. 
Finally, a case--I hate to say `case'; a little girl--a little girl who I talked about a lot last year, a little girl by the name of Donna Joy Watts who, with Tony Melendez tomorrow, will be here as another example--in this case, a real life example--of how a mother, who was not only asked and encouraged but almost forced to abort her child, could not find a hospital to deliver her child. 
The Watts family, Donny and Lori Watts, had to go to three hospitals in Maryland to find a hospital that would deliver their child. We hear so much talk on the floor about, `We need to make sure that women have access to abortion.' What we are finding out and what I have found out through this debate is that we actually need to make sure that women who want to deliver their baby have access to a hospital to deliver their baby and have access to care once that baby is delivered. 
The Wattses ended up at a hospital in Baltimore. Their daughter was diagnosed with multiple problems. Hydrocephalus was the principal one. Again, hydrocephalus is water on the brain. She had so much cerebral fluid that it impeded the normal development of the brain. In her case, they believed that she had little to no brain. But the Watts family said they were going to move forward, that they were going to accept and love their child, and they wanted to deliver their child and give it every opportunity for life. 
At every step of the process, even the last step, the OB/GYNs recommended abortion, because not only did she have hydrocephalus but part of her brain was developing outside of her skull, and that this baby had no chance of survival. 
She was born on November 26, 1991, through cesarean section. Again, an option available for hydrocephalus, because the baby's head is too big to go through the birth canal, is to do a cesarean section. There are other methods: Draining the fluid from the head and then delivering through the vagina. In this case, they chose cesarean section. 
She was born with very serious health problems. The most remarkable thing after the birth was that the hospital staff made no attempt to feed her in the traditional sense. The doctors at the University of Maryland where she was delivered believed that Donna Joy's deformities would prevent her from suckling, eating, or swallowing. Because a neural tube defect made her feeding difficult, Donna received only IV fluids for the first days of her life. But Lori refused to give up. Initially, she fed breast milk to Donna Joy with a sterilized eye dropper to provide sustenance, because they wouldn't feed her. Then, at 2 weeks of age, the shunt that was placed in Donna Joy's head--by the way, the shunt. It took 3 days for Lori and Donny to convince the doctors to do an operation on her brain to relieve the pressure from the fluid. The doctors thought she was just going to die, so they didn't want to treat her. 
But finally after 3 days of pounding away at the doctors they did the procedure. Two weeks later, the shunt, which allows the fluid to drain from the brain, failed, and she was readmitted to the hospital for corrective surgery. 
When the tray of food was delivered to their hospital room by mistake, Lori had a brainstorm. She mashed the contents together, created her own food for the newborn with rice, bananas and baby formula, and she fed the mixture to the baby one drop at a time with a feeding syringe. Unfortunately, Donna Joy's fight for life became even more complicated. 
After 2 months, she underwent an operation to correct occipital--I won't get into the terms but another problem. After 4 months, a CT scan revealed that she also suffered from another condition which results from an incomplete cleavage of the brain. She also suffered from epilepsy, sleep disorder, and continued digestive complications. In fact, the baby's neurologist said, `We may have to consider placement of a gastronomy tube in order to maintain her nutrition and physical growth.' 
She still had hydrocephaly, or water on the brain, and she couldn't hold her head up because it was so heavy. She suffered from apnea--in other words, a condition where breathing spontaneously stops. She had several brushes with death. She had undergone eight brain operations. 
Finally, through all of that trauma and all of the problems, she survived and she will be here tomorrow. Donna Joy continues to be, at 6 years of age, an inspiration. She continues to battle holoprosencephaly, hydrocephalus, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, tunnel vision, and Arnold-Chiari Type II malformation that prevents formation of her medulla oblongata. 
Despite these hardships, having only a small fraction of her brain, she runs, walks, plays, has a healthy appetite and even likes Big Mac's, and she is taking karate lessons now. She has earned her white belt and performed in karate demonstrations. 
Before Donna Joy moved to Pennsylvania, Greencastle, PA, Franklin County, Maryland Governor Parris Glendening honored her with a certificate of courage commemorating her fifth birthday. Mayor Steve Sager, of Hagerstown, MD, proclaimed her birthday Donna Joy Watts Day. Members of the Scott Bakula Fan Club, who is someone who helped Donna Joy get through some very difficult times with his songs, have sent donations and Christmas presents to the Watts family. People from around the world have learned about Donna Joy on the Internet and write, e-mail her, and send her gifts. But perhaps the most important thing was because of Donna Joy's determination, it inspired a Denver couple to fight for their little boy under similar circumstances. 
This is Donna Joy's story, this little girl who was considered by the medical world as somebody who was not worthy to live, someone on repeated occasions who would have been aborted using partial-birth abortion, who I have had the time to spend time with, and my children have, too. She is not a burden, although I understand from Lori she can be a handful like any other 6-year old. She is not a heartache or a sorrow, as some would describe children with disabilities who need to be aborted. She is a beautiful, marvelous, wonderfully made gift from God, who has inspired so many to understand just that fact. She will be here tomorrow, possibly standing next to the women who want to keep this procedure legal, so we can kill people like Donna Joy Watts in a brutal fashion, in an inhumane fashion, in a painful fashion, in a fashion, as I quoted today from the AMA Journal, that would violate Federal regulations on the treatment of animals used in research. We could not do to animals used in research legally in this country, we could not do what we do every day in this country to little babies because they are not wanted, in some cases not wanted because of their deformity but in the vast majority of cases they are just simply not wanted. What a high price to pay for one person not wanting you to be around, the ultimate price to pay. 
Tomorrow, we are going to have the opportunity to show the world the direction the United States of America is taking. We are involved right now in a moral crisis in this country, on the front page of the paper every day. It is no wonder that we are in a moral crisis. 
Back in 1972, 1973, when Roe v. Wade was decided, many people said that this was going to be a breakthrough for women and for children, that all these wonderful things would happen to our society as a result, to children and to women, as a result of the legalization of abortion. We would eliminate unwanted pregnancies, and the result of that would be less child abuse because we wouldn't have all these children nobody wanted, illegitimacy would go down, child poverty would go down because we wouldn't have all of these poor kids around that we don't want. Spousal abuse would go down, divorce would go down, less complications in marriages and relationships. 
It is a cruel joke. It almost seems laughable to think back 25 years and look at what has happened on every single count. All of the culture indicators that I mentioned go down worse and worse and worse. Those who feared Roe v. Wade back in 1973 were very much on target. The fear was that we would lose respect for life and that we would become so insensitive to life that abortion would be just the beginning of the end of our selectivity of who we include in our society. 
And so it has gone, to the point where now we can't even save a little baby almost born. I wish that were the worst. We now have State-assisted suicide laws. We now have debates, active debates on euthanasia. We even have an article from a professor at MIT who argues, or at least makes the case for infanticide--not infanticide on partial-birth abortion but actual infanticide. And then we have the cases of prom mom and the Delaware couple and so many others where we hear around the country of babies being born and then murdered shortly after birth. 
The initial reaction, while horror, at the same time is sympathy--sympathy for this difficult situation in which these children or kids were put. 
We somehow see little children, little babies, different than older children. Older children--if you have killed your older children, that is really bad. We have no sympathy for you. But somehow, if you killed a baby just born we try to figure out a way to get around it. We try to figure out a way that that does not quite meet the threshold of murder. If you look at the punishments meted out--substantially lower. They are substantially lower than other murder cases. We just do not value those little babies as much. 
Why? Why? Is it any mystery why? If we start, as we have, down the path of not valuing those little babies because we do not value them in the womb, or four-fifths outside the womb, or just newly outside the womb, who is next? Look around. Who is going to be next? Who is going to be the next group of people who we are not going to value, who does not have the might to force down what they believe is right? I made it. I am here in this body. I am whole. I am healthy. If you have not made it yet, watch it, because it then depends on whether you are on the committee that decides, or you are on the court that decides who lives and who dies. Because there is no line anymore. There is no truth on which we are basing this. There is no `life or nonlife.' There is might. There is political power and that is what determines who lives and dies, who is valuable and who is not. 
Tomorrow, 34 Senators can exercise their might on who lives and dies. They can decide for a country that a group of people, a group of little helpless babies, do not belong. 
I am hopeful that when tomorrow comes, after much prayer tonight by so many people all over the country, and the world, that three more Members will open their eyes when they wake up in the morning and realize that but for the grace of God, there go I, and that we have to open our hearts more and include the least among us, the little children. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

 Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes of Senate business to recognize National Payroll Week 1998, which has been designated as September 14-18. 
National Payroll Week was founded by the American Payroll Association in 1996 to honor the men and women whose tax contributions support the American Dream and the payroll professionals who are dedicated to processing those contributions. 
In particular, the Susquehanna Valley Chapter of the American Payroll Association represents 186,000 residents in Pennsylvania who are employed by 21 businesses. These taxpayers and businesses contribute millions of dollars to the federal treasury through payroll taxes each year. These taxes go toward important civic projects including roads, schools and crime prevention. In addition, taxpayers and payroll professionals are partners in upholding the Social Security and Medicare systems. 
Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join with me in commending the taxpayers and payroll professionals who, through the collection, reporting and payment of payroll taxes, have set a national precedent of what works in America.

 Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Benny Golson for his extraordinary career as a musician and a composer. 
I am proud to say that Mr. Golson began his professional career in Philadelphia. He went on to compose music for many household names such as Diana Ross, Sammy Davis, Jr., Mickey Rooney and Dizzy Gillespie. He then began writing for the hit TV shows `M*A*S*H' and `The Partridge Family' as well as pilots for CBS, ABC and NBC and the Academy Awards. 
During a two year residency at William Paterson College, Mr. Golson wrote a symphony and a piece for violin virtuoso Itzhak Perlman. He also lectured to students and received an honorary doctorate degree. In 1994, Mr. Golson was awarded the Guggeneim Fellowship and, in 1996, a Jazz Masters Award from the N.E.A. 
On Sunday, September 27, the Big Jazz Band `Impro-Vista' will perform a tribute to Benny Golson to benefit Philadelphia youth involved in jazz. 
Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in applauding Benny Golson for his remarkable professional achievements and his extraordinary contributions to society.

Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Mr. President. Now that the Senator from Vermont has agreed to support the motion to proceed--that is heartening--we can now get to this. 
I came here to plead that we at least be given the opportunity to discuss this issue. On this bill, while it is obviously important to the entire country, the case which has been highlighted, which is the one that is the most disturbing, is the case from Pennsylvania of a horrible situation where a young girl 12 years old was raped by a boy 18, was given alcohol, and was impregnated while she was unconscious. The stepmother of the boy, without the knowledge of the little girl's mother, took her across the State line to have an abortion. 
In fact, there are a series of false pretenses, which I will outline in the debate that we hope now to have on the full bill. It shows how this law is necessary to protect the rights of parents, and the State of Pennsylvania wants to protect them. The State of Pennsylvania has a law in place that says you need parental consent. Parents in the State believe they should be able to rely upon the law, that they should be able to have that right that the State of Pennsylvania suggested that we have, that the people of Pennsylvania should have their laws honored, and that people, by crossing State lines, should not be able to evade what is the law within Pennsylvania. This is less an abortion issue than it is a State rights issue. 
As Senator DeWine mentioned in his debate, we have done things just recently with child support to get better enforcement of State decisions across State lines to protect children and to protect families. This is just another instance where we should do that--protect the rights of parents and protect the rights of children within the borders of the State, as the State legislatures and Governors have enacted laws to do so. 
I commend the Senator from Michigan for his work to fight through the Judiciary Committee and to get this bill to the floor, and to now get it to a point where hopefully we can begin the debate and we can begin to move forward with the debate of these amendments. 
I understand States rights and enforcing State laws is an important issue that we debate here often in the Congress. But there is none more important, as far as I am concerned, than to protect the lives and health of children and the rights of parents. That is exactly at the heart of this legislation. 
I congratulate the Senator.

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, in conversations with the leader over the last couple of days, we have set a date for the Senate vote on the override of the President's veto of the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1997. It is going to be September 18, which is just a couple of weeks from now. I am hopeful, even though the numbers do not look good right now, that we will be able to muster sufficient support to do what the House did, which is to override the President's veto. The House voted, with I believe six or seven votes more than necessary, to override his veto. Here in the Senate we are three votes short of overriding the President's veto, of getting the 67 votes. We had 64 Senators vote in favor of the ban. We will need three more Senators to change their vote and support this act and override the President's veto. 
I want to pick up on what Senator Thomas was talking about and what is being talked about around the country, which is the President and his unwillingness to come forward with the truth, and his propensity to look at a factual situation and skew it some. Some would say lie; I would just say maybe skew it some, to put a different spin or color on what the real facts are. 
I think we have maybe the first opportunity here in the Senate, since the President's admission a couple of weeks ago, to really pass judgment on the President's ability to be truthful with the American public. How many people in this Chamber are going to stand by this President when he has blatantly not told the truth about the issue of partial-birth abortion and the need for it to remain legal? He has stood behind this notion that this procedure needs to remain legal because of the potential impact on the health of women who have abortions and that this needs to be an option available to them because there may be circumstances in which women need this procedure to avoid serious health consequences. That was potentially a legitimate argument, even though I could give, and I will when the bill comes up, lots of reasons why from a medical perspective that makes no sense. We have made those arguments time and time again, and others have made those arguments, including Dr. Bill Frist. 
But, just prior to the vote last year here in the Senate, the American Medical Association came out with a letter that said that a partial-birth abortion is never medically necessary to protect the life or health of a woman. And this is an organization, by the way, that supports abortion rights. This is not a right-wing, radical, pro-life organization--take your pick, right-wing, radical, or pro-life, or all of the above. It is none of those. It is an organization that in principle supports abortion rights, but came out and said that there is no medical necessity here. It is not necessary. Yet the President, just weeks after this letter was released--and by the way, there are hundreds if not thousands of obstetricians who have come forward and said the same thing--the President stood up and said I need to veto this bill because--I think it was on a Friday night he vetoed it, so not too many people were around to watch the veto--this is medically necessary to protect the health of women, when we have experts upon experts and the definitive body representing physicians in this country saying that it is not necessary and that, in fact, the President is not telling the truth to the American public or to Members of Congress. 
So we are hiding behind a lie. I guess the question I have is how many Senators are going to continue to hide behind Bill Clinton's lie on the issue of partial-birth abortion? Many Senators--many Members of his Cabinet, many people--were apologists for Bill Clinton for the past several months because he told them one thing and we found out later that it was not true. And a lot of people were hurt by that, burned by that, the fact that the President wasn't coming clean with the American public. We have another instance right here where the President has not come clean with the American public on this issue. How many people are going to continue to go out and defend this President and his veto on a bill where his rationale for vetoing it is not true? Hopefully: Fool me once, shame on you. If Senators allow this President to fool them twice, shame on them. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today that will offer protection from government discrimination to health care providers who have religious or moral objections to performing abortions. 
As HCFA prepares to implement the Medicare+Choice program, the need for this bill has become evident. Congress created Medicare+Choice to give beneficiaries more options in their health plans. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) requires all health care providers who participate in the program to provide all services covered under Medicare Parts A and B, except hospice care. HCFA is interpreting this mandate to require coverage for abortion, consistent with the Hyde restrictions. The problem is that many religious health care systems--and even some secular providers--have strong misgivings about performing, providing coverage for, or paying for any elective abortions. Absent specific legislative clarification, these providers will be shut out of the Medicare+Choice program. 
HCFA's interpretation of the BBA has come as a surprise to many health systems wishing to participate in the Medicare+Choice program. The issue of whether providers would have to cover abortion services was never addressed during last summer's extensive debate. Instead, this Congress focused on designing a program which would give seniors the broadest possible range of health care choices, so they could choose a provider based on their own individual needs. 
In 1996, Congress prohibited government discrimination against health care providers who choose not to teach abortion procedures in their graduate medical programs. The Senate approved this legislation as an amendment to the Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act by a vote of 63-37. The Health Care Entity Protection Act merely clarifies that these protections extend to all providers who have religious or moral objections to performing, providing coverage of, or paying for induced abortions. I would emphasise that nothing in this bill prevents providers from voluntarily offering abortion services; it simply gives them a right to choose whether they will so do. 
I believe that my colleagues on both sides of the abortion debate can support the Health Care Entity Protection Act. I would like to reiterate that this bill simply clarifies protections that already exist under current law. I hope the Senate will recognize the moral gravity of the abortion issue and forge a consensus across party and ideological lines to protect institutions, doctors, and health systems who, as a matter of conscience, cannot perform or provide for abortions.

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I today introduce legislation pertaining to the federal excise tax on beer. 
The federal excise tax on beer was doubled as part of the 1991 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act. Today, it remain as the only `luxury tax' enacted as part of OBRA '91. While taxes on furs, jewelry, and yachts were repealed through subsequent legislation, the federal beer tax remains in place with continued and far reaching negative effects. 
The excise tax on beer is among the more regressive federal taxes. Since the 100 percent tax was levied in 1991, it has cost the industry as many as 50,000 jobs. Beer in particular continues to suffer under a disproportionate burden of taxation. Forty-three percent of the cost of beer is comprised of both state and federal taxes. This legislation seeks to correct this inequity and will restore the level of federal excise tax to the pre-1991 tax rate. 
Mr. President, this bill represents companion legislation to H.R. 158, introduced by Representative Phil English. The House bill currently carries 95 cosponsors. I commend this Senate legislation to my colleagues for their consideration.

 Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, this amendment to S. 2132, the Fiscal Year 1999 Defense Appropriations Act, seeks to add $8.2 million for the procurement of M888, 60-millimeter, high-explosive munitions for the Marine Corps. 
The additional funds would help alleviate training constraints for Marine Corps units due to shortages in this term, and will help reduce the coming `bow-wave' of procurement requirements we may not have the resources to fund in future years. The Marine Corps has stated that procurement at this level would be consistent with its acquisition strategy regarding ammunition. 
I would like to clarify that funds for this procurement have been identified. In order to fund this important acquisition I have identified the Air Force war reserve materials account.

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and mourn the passing of two cherished members of our Capitol Hill community, Officer J.J. Chestnut and Officer John Gibson, slain Friday in the line of duty. 
As we mourn their deaths and pay tribute to them, perhaps we should recall the particular, even paradoxical, quality of who they were and what they did: They stood among us, as members of this community, but they also stood apart. 
As many have noted since their deaths, both officers were familiar to those of us who work in the Capitol. They stood guard in these halls--and so they stood, literally, among us. And their lives resembled many of our own lives; they were husbands, fathers, sons, and brothers. They took pleasure from their families and pride in their work. If but for the sad events on Friday, they might have continued to live as so many of us do: simply but decently, content to be known and loved mostly by those closest to them. 
But they stood guard in these halls--and so they also stood apart. They belong to that small but remarkable group of people whose profession requires the willing forfeiture not just of their time and talent but, if necessary, of their very lives. Unlike most of us, their daily work was to offer their life in the place of another's. More dramatically and compellingly than most of us, they embodied the qualities that sustain our democracy: selflessness and courage. In this, they stood guard over our democratic tradition. 
As individuals and citizens, we are defined not only by who we stand with, but by when we choose to stand apart. I am honored that these men stood among us everyday and grateful that, when the critical moment came, they also freely chose to stand apart. In tribute, in these halls they guarded, we stand as one and grieve their deaths.

 Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the youth group from Devonshire Memorial Church in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. On Sunday, July 26 ten students from the church traveled to Manning, South Carolina to assist in the rebuilding of the Macedonian Baptist Church which the Ku Klux Klan destroyed by fire in 1996. The young people worked to renovate homes of church members that suffered damage due to the fire. 
The teenagers, who raised their own support for the trip through things such as church-wide dinners and fundraising letters, joined approximately 250 other young people from across the nation to work on painting, hanging drywall, repairing roofs and caulking windows. 
Church burnings are a violent act of hatred against the free exercise of religious faith. Arson, which has destroyed many southern African American churches, has also destroyed our dignity and our humanity. By dedicating their time and effort to rebuilding the walls of a church burned by hatred and bigotry, these young men and women are tearing down the walls of violence and racism and restoring faith to the Christian community. 
Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in commending the young men and women of Devonshire Memorial Church for their dedication to restoring a church and a community, as well as the ideals of freedom in this country.

 Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Earl V. Jones, Sr., from Pittsburgh, PA, on his efforts to promote world peace. 
Mr. Jones started his grassroots movement, Peace on Earth, to teach children about peace and understanding. The project has since expanded to include a sister city in Russia, the Siberian industrial town of Novokuznetak. Children in each of these cities write essays answering the question `What Can Each of Us Do for Peace on Earth?' 
Essay winners receive medals fashioned from metal produced in Pittsburgh and from Novokuznetak. Among the honorary medal recipients are President Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin. Mr. Jones believes children will have an added incentive to compete in the contest when they know that two Presidents have the same medals that they can win. Furthermore, Mr. Jones included a third set of medals in his gift to the presidents which he hopes will be carried into outer space. He explains, `If you're going to have peace on Earth, you better start up above and come down.' 
Mr. President, I commend Earl Jones for his tireless work on the Peace on Earth campaign. I ask my colleagues to join me in extending the Senate's best wishes for continued success to Mr. Jones and his worthwhile project.

 Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation transferring Schuylkill County from the Eastern Judicial District of Pennsylvania to the Middle District. I am pleased to work on this needed effort with the senior Senator from Pennsylvania Senator Spector, who has signed on as an original cosponsor. 
Many of the residents of Schuylkill County have voiced concern about the hardship they face in performing jury duty as they are often forced to travel as far as Philadelphia. Most of the counties adjacent to Schuylkill County are in the Middle District, where courtrooms are generally twice as close as those in Philadelphia. In addition, transferring Schuylkill County will help relieve the Eastern District of its much larger caseload. 
Both the Chief Judge of the Eastern District, Edward Cahn, and of the Middle District, Sylvia Rambo, have raised no objections with this transfer. The Schuylkill County Bar Association, the Schuylkill County District Attorney, and numerous judges and attorneys have expressed strong support. 
This legislation serves as a companion bill to H.R. 2123, a bill introduced by my esteemed colleague in the House of Representatives, Representative Tim Holden, whose district includes Schuylkill County. Representative Holden has worked diligently on passage of his bill or over a year, including a successful effort at incorporating its provisions into the Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1998. H.R. 2294, which passed the House on March 18, 1998. I congratulate my colleague on his success. Now, it is the responsibility of myself and Senator Specter to shepherd this legislation through the Senate. 
I look forward to working with the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, and the Ranking Member, Senator Leahy, and the rests of my colleagues in securing passage of much needed legislation.

It is a very important amendment to proprietary schools, career schools, who are doing the real lion's share of the work in educating in the poor communities, with disadvantaged people in our society. They are doing a great job in some of the toughest settings to try to make up the skills deficit that we have heard so much talk about in this country for the working poor and for those, in many cases, coming off of welfare. 
We are moving from welfare to work, and we are going to have to have educational institutions in poor communities, in the cities, to be able to educate the poor. As a result, I have worked with the working group. And I will send the amendment to the desk I am offering with Senators DeWine and Coverdell.

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, this amendment does three things, all of which will, I believe, aid career colleges in proprietary skills and in their ability to hold down at-risk default rates. They are serving populations who, as a result of being at risk, have a tendency to have higher default rates. They want to work with the system to be able to help hold down those default rates because, obviously, they want to stay in business and continue to educate. 
So the first provision that we put in this amendment is to require the guaranty agencies and lenders to contact institutions when they are doing skip-tracing of borrowers who have gone into default. In other words, this will allow the schools to be notified when former students of theirs are going into default because, in many cases, through their placement offices they know where to locate these people and can, in fact, aid the lending institutions and guaranty agencies in bringing these people back on to a payment schedule, to avoid default, and to keep the default rate low, but also to help the young people who are out now in the working environment avoid a bad thing on their credit. And, obviously, it will save the Federal Government some money. 
Secondly, it sets September 30 of each year as the deadline for the Department of Education to release its annual default rate for schools. This will help schools in their planning process, giving more certainty in how to deal with potential problems they may have with the default rate down the road. 
Third, it creates a liaison position at the Department of Education for proprietary schools, similar to the liaison position created several years ago for community colleges. Community colleges and proprietary schools, in many cases, serve similar populations. There have been problems in communicating, in getting information, and having a voice at the Department of Education. This is a mechanism for those who are sometimes considered somewhat of a `stepchild' in the higher education community to get some real responsiveness from the Department to their needs and to their concerns. 
That is the sum total of the amendment. I believe it will help these career and proprietary schools better serve an at-risk population that is in desperate need of making up a skills deficit. It will put them in a better position to keep the default rates down and improve the program overall. 
Again, I thank the chairman, the ranking member, Senator Coats, and Senator Dodd for working with me and my staff in coming up with this amendment. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the amendment offered by the Senator from Iowa. This amendment, which purports to lower guarantee fees on student loans, would, in actuality, increase fees for borrowers in Pennsylvania and elsewhere. 
Under current law, student loan guarantee agencies participating in the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP) have the option of charging borrowers a guarantee fee of up to 1% for subsidized Stafford loans, unsubsidized Stafford loans, and PLUS loans. Amendment No. 3117 would eliminate the optional guarantee fee for subsidized Stafford loans, and it would reduce by 1% the guarantee fee on Direct subsidized loans administered by the Department of Education. The costs of this provision would be offset by obligating guarantee agencies to charge the full 1% guarantee fee on all unsubsidized Stafford loans and PLUS loans. 
The Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency (PHEAA), which guarantees loans for borrowers within the Commonwealth, presently waives the guarantee fee for both subsidized and unsubsidized Stafford loans, as well as the fee for PLUS loans. In addition, PHEAA also waives all guarantee fees for borrowers in West Virginia and Delaware, the two states for which it has been designated by the state's governor as the guarantee agency. Should Amendment No. 3117 become law, PHEAA would be compelled to begin charging a 1% fee on unsubsidized Stafford loans and PLUS loans. Consequently, total guarantee fees charged to student borrowers in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Delaware would actually increase. 
Consider that in FY1997, PHEAA guaranteed $651 million in unsubsidized Stafford loans for 172,000 students and $171 million in PLUS loans for 28,000 parents. None of those borrowers were charged a guarantee fee. However, if this amendment had been law, it would have cost those borrowers $8.22 million in total guarantee fees. Moreover, 20% of FFELP borrowers nationwide receive fee waivers or fee reductions from their guarantor. Consequently, Amendment No. 3117 would increase fees for borrowers in states other than just those serviced by PHEAA. As such, I must oppose this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to join me in doing so.

Mr. President, the 1999 Defense Authorization bill before us contains a demonstration project that would allow some DoD-eligible retirees to join FEHBP plans, under a separate risk pool. It is my understanding that this ensures that DoD retirees who enroll in this demonstration project are able to choose from competing, private sector FEHBP plans. It is also my understanding that retirees, like other FEHBP-eligibles, will be able to choose among plans that offer fully integrated health care benefits that use market-based competition to control cost and improve quality of care.

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, this amendment to S. 2057, the Fiscal Year 1999 Defense Authorization Act, seeks to add $17 million for the procurement of M888, 60-millimeter, high-explosive munitions for the Marine Corps. 
The additional funds would help alleviate training constraints for Marine Corps units due to shortages in this item, and will help reduce the coming bow-wave of procurement requirements that we may not have the resources to fund in future years. 
I would like to clarify that funds from the Marine Corps' OPTEMPO and base support lines, both Operations & Maintenance accounts, have been identified to offset this additional funding. The offset draws on funds that were authorized in excess of what was appropriated for these particular funding lines. 
Initially, I had identified Marine Corps' initial use and base support lines as an offset for this amendment. I wish to alert the Senate Armed Services Committee and the full Senate of this specific change. 
Lastly, it is my understanding that the Marine Corps supports this amendment.

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, this amendment to S. 2057, the Fiscal Year 1999 Defense Authorization Act, provides authority for the United States Marine Corps to enter into a barter agreement with a commercial entity for the purpose of allowing existing Marine Corps ribbon bridges to be remanufactured into an Improved Ribbon Bridge configuration. 
The Marine Corps has 250 bays [length] of ribbon bridge, of which 180 require repair. The ribbon bridge is the Marine Corps' only floating bridge capability and is used to allow vehicles to cross streams and gullies. The ribbon bridge bays used by the Marine Corps are approximately 20 years old. Due to limited fiscal resources and higher priorities, it is unlikely that the ribbon bridge upgrade will successfully compete for funding. 
It is my understanding that a remanufacture of these existing bridges to the Improved Ribbon Bridge configuration will provide an additional 15-20 years of service from these bridges. I am aware that the Marine Corps and Office of the Secretary of Defense supports this amendment.

 Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the courage and bravery of Rabbi Alexander D. Goode and the three other chaplains aboard the U.S.A.T. Dorchester on the night it sank into the icy waters off the coast of Greenland. 
On February 3, 1943, the Dorchester, filled to capacity with over 900 men, was struck by German torpedoes around 1:00 am. The Germans succeeded in knocking out the ship's communication, injuring and killing scores of men, and fatally wounding the Dorchester. As the crew realized what had just occurred, chaos and panic erupted on all sides. In the midst of the confusion, four Army Chaplains, Lt. George L. Fox, Methodist; Lt. John P. Washington, Roman Catholic; Lt. Clark V. Polling, Dutch Reformed; and Lt. Alexander D. Goode, Jewish, brought hope and light to those around them. 
The Arctic air made protection from the cold essential to those hoping to survive the night. As one sailor, Petty Officer John J. Mahoney, tried to return to his cabin to retrieve his gloves, he was stopped by Rabbi Goode. `I have two pairs,' the Rabbi said, handing the sailor the pair he had been wearing. In retrospect, Mahoney realized the Rabbi could not have had an extra pair and had sacrificed his only gloves to aide the sailor. 
As the ship sank, the four chaplains distributed jackets and words of encouragement to those remaining. When there were no more life jackets left, the four removed their own preservers and handed them to the sailors next in line, sealing their own fate. Approximately 18 minutes after it was hit, the Dorchester sank. The last sight many of the survivors recall was the four chaplains, arms linked, praying together with over 600 men still on board. 
The sinking of the Dorchester 55 years ago not only showed the chaplains' tremendous strength of spirit, but also illuminated their racial and religious tolerance. In an era of prejudice, these four men embraced ideas on interfaith relationships. These men shared a special brotherhood which lasted until the very end. 
Mr. President, there are people in history who stand apart from the rest, and who go above and beyond what is demanded by their fellow men and women. Rabbi Goode and the three other chaplains were such men. I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the memory of these truly remarkable heroes. Their story and the lessons it teaches will not soon be forgotten.

 Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Mrs. Rosemarie Pecillo Knowlton. For almost 50 years, Rosemarie has dedicated her life to education. She will be sincerely missed after her retirement from Sacred Heart Parish School. 
At the age of four, Rosemarie asked to attend school with some of her older friends. The principal allowed her to begin, believing it was probably just a `phase.' This phase turned into a teaching career. Such was her desire to teach, that immediately after graduating high school, Rosemarie took a teaching position which required her to travel on four modes of public transportation just to commute back and forth. 
When Rosemarie transferred to a position closer to home, she decided to continue her own formal education by taking night classes at Villanova University. There, she met her future husband, Arthur L. Knowlton. They were married in 1956. As her son, Arthur, Jr., graduated from high school in 1975, Rosemarie also received her degree from Villanova. 
Rosemarie never saw teaching as a job that began and ended with morning and afternoon bells. She enriched her students through forensics, the annual Science Fair, and CCD classes. She also directed the school's music shows, the Parish Living Stations of the Cross, and the Living Rosary. 
Mr. President, the lives Rosemarie has touched are too numerous to count. She is leaving a legacy of dedication and accomplishment, and her son, Richard, carries on the family's teaching tradition. I ask my colleagues to join me both in congratulating Rosemarie for 46 years of dedication to the children of southeastern Pennsylvania and in extending the Senate's best wishes to the Knowltons as Rosemarie retires to devote all of her time to her husband, children, and seven grandchildren.

 Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, on May 30, the Rutherford Elementary School Memorial Committee commemorated the history of the Rutherford Elementary School. I rise today to mark the closing of this building. 
The community of Rutherford has been served for 89 years by the current elementary school, which is scheduled for demolition. Amidst music, civic organizational displays, and food vendors, students past and present gathered to reflect on their childhood experiences. Members of Rutherford's first class still fondly reminisce about the `good old days.' 
Mr. President, the Rutherford Elementary School symbolizes strength and continuity in education. I ask my colleagues to join me in acknowledging this memorial.

 Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the outstanding drug and crime fighting efforts of Mr. Herman C. Wrice. 
Mr. Wrice, once called the `John Wayne of Philadelphia' by President Bush, is one of today's most effective non-violent community activists. His grassroots approach to cracking down on drugs and crime has been successful in cities, towns, and Indian reservations across the country. Herman's career as a social activist began in the late 1960's after a personal tragedy; his wife, Jean, was caught in gang crossfire at a local supermarket. 
Mr. Wrice's organization, Turn Around America, unites ordinary citizens and police who are determined to take back their neighborhoods. They organize street marches and all-night vigils at identified drug houses to separate drug dealers from their customers. This partnership depends on trust, cooperation, and mutual respect. Citizen efforts enhance, but do not replace, law enforcement efforts. I am pleased to say that Turn Around America has yielded impressive results. In neighborhoods where demonstrations have taken place, crack houses have closed. Children play in parks that were once littered with drug paraphernalia. The number of drug-related arrests have risen, several of which were directly linked to citizen involvement. Even veteran police officers have been inspired by Herman's anti-drug crusade. 
Mr. Wrice's relentless efforts to fight crime and violence have received wide-spread attention. Villanova University honored him with an honorary doctorate degree for his activism. His programs have been described in many publications, including the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, Readers Digest, Policy Review, and Philadelphia Magazine. Mr. Wrice and his anti-crime program were even featured on 60 Minutes. This exposure led to requests for training from over 200 cities and towns across the country. In 1994, Herman was one of six activists to receive an America's Award for Courage during special ceremonies at the Kennedy Center. The following year, he was named a Join Together Fellow by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. On a local level, Herman has been a two-time recipient of the Mayor's Outstanding Citizen Award, and a three time honoree as the Junior Chamber's Outstanding Young Man of the Year. Finally, he has received the Freedom Foundation's Citizenship Award, the NAACP Unsung Hero's Award, and was named the Citizen Crime Commission's Crime Fighter of the Year. 
Mr. President, Herman C. Wrice is a man with a purpose. He has dedicated his life to community service, and he has made a difference. He has worked to make the streets safe for neighborhood children, and he has raised 17 of his own--11 of whom were adopted. I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Mr. Wrice and in extending the Senate's best wishes to his family.

 Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, on May 2 through May 4, 1998, more than 1200 students from across the nation came to Washington, DC, to compete in the national finals of the `We the People. . . The Citizens and the Constitution' program. I am proud to announce that the class from Hampton High School of Allison Park represented Pennsylvania. These young scholars worked diligently to reach the national finals by winning local competitions in Pennsylvania, and ultimately won the Northeastern States Regional Award. 
The distinguished members of the class representing Pennsylvania were: Angela Ambrose, Rebecca Amrhein, Aren Bierkan, Christine Brady, Heather Gahagan, Emily Huie, Jessica Kiefer, Lauren Klemens, Jessica Lin, Rina Mansukhani, Lauren Montgomery, Laura Ostapenko, Andrew Scharff, Christian Spearline, Courtney Vetter and Katrina Werger. 
I would also like to recognize their teacher, Mrs. Tara O'Brien, who deserves much credit for the success of the class. The district coordinator, Ms. Jennie-Lynn Knox, and the state coordinator, Ms. Christine Crist, also contributed much time and effort to help the class reach the national finals. 
The `We the People. . . The Citizen and the Constitution' program is the most extensive educational program in the country developed specifically to educate young people about the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. The three day national competition simulates a congressional hearing whereby students are given the opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge while they evaluate, take, and defend positions on relevant historical and contemporary constitutional issues. The simulated congressional hearing consists of oral presentations by the students before panels of judges. 
Administered by the Center for Civic Education, the `We the People. . .' program has provided curricular materials at upper elementary, middle, and high school levels for more than 75,000 teachers and 24 million students nationwide. Members of Congress and their staff enhance the program by discussing current constitutional issues with teachers and students. 
The `We the People. . .' program is designed to help students achieve a reasoned commitment to the fundamental values and principles that bind Americans together as a people. The program also fosters civic dispositions, traits of public and private sector character conducive to effective and responsible participation in politics and government. 
I congratulate these constitutional experts from Hampton High School for their success in the `We the People. . .' competition and commend them for their great achievement of winning the Northeastern Regional Award.

 Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Lehigh Valley Hospital and Health Network, along with the American Nurses Association, who declared May 6-12 National Nurses Week 1998. 
The theme of the week, `Nursing: Health Care With a Human Touch,' was in commemoration of the ways in which registered nurses strive to provide safe and high quality patient care and find ways to improve our health care system. 
The 2.2 million registered nurses in the United States comprise our nation's largest health care profession. The far-reaching duty of the registered nursing profession is to meet the emerging health care needs of the American population, while registered nurses' education focuses on restoring and maintaining the health of the individual. 
Registered nurses will continue to be an important component of the U.S. health care system. They play an integral role in the safe, quality care of hospitalized patients, as well as contributing to the growth of home health care services and advancements in life-sustaining technology. 
Mr. President, I commend Lehigh Valley Hospital and Health Network and the American Nurse Association for honoring National Nurses Week 1998. I ask my colleagues to join with me in recognizing the registered nurses who care for us all.

 Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, in 1948 when Israel was fighting its most costly war ever--the war for independence--Israel's future Prime Minister was told by the greatest military experts in the world that his newly created State of 600,000 had no chance of surviving. Now, in 1998, Israel is celebrating its 50th year of independence. 
I commend the Jewish Federation of the Scranton-Lackawanna community for observing this historic occasion the weekend of May 1-3. 
The State of Israel became a home for Jews after more than 6 million European Jews were massacred during the Holocaust. Over the past 50 years, Israel has acted as a refuge for thousands of Jews throughout the world and integrated them into their society, while rebuilding a nation and creating an active democratic political system. 
On May 17, I joined Mayor Edward Rendell and Israeli Consul General Daniel Ashbel in Philadelphia to celebrate Israel's 50th Independence Day birthday party. During the opening ceremonies, I thought of how Israel is a land of wonderful contrast. It is both a nation of great history and a nation of great accomplishment. From the historical perspective, the events that have sprung forth from that land over the centuries are overwhelming to even consider. No matter what religious tradition one might follow, the basic laws that went on to frame many of the tenants of our democratic form of government, and the rules of conduct in a civil society, came out of the land we have always called Yis-ra-el. 
Today, Israel has a growing economy, farms on land that were once claimed by the deserts, and high-tech companies producing cutting edge products for our global marketplace. No other society in the course of human history can claim such progress in 50 short years. No other nation can claim to have risen to these heights from the horrors of the Holocaust. That is why Israel is so unique, so special, and so deserving of our unyielding and unconditional support. 
The United States has always maintained a relationship with Israel that is based on mutual respect. America's commitment to Israel's security undergirds the entire peace process and provides Israel the confidence it needs to take very real risks for peace. I encourage the United States to continue to act in a respectable manner by not imposing a settlement on Israel that is contrary to its national security interests.

 Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Dr. John H. Moore Jr. for his humanitarian efforts on behalf of Operation Smile, an organization that provides free medical care to children around the world. 
Dr. Moore distinguished himself when he started the Philadelphia Chapter of Operation Smile in 1988. Since then he has expanded this group to provide annual missions to Nicaragua, the Philippines, Vietnam, Liberia, Kenya and other third world countries. Locally, Operation Smile provides free care for school children in the Philadelphia area. Working with philanthropic organizations, the group brings physicians from other countries to Philadelphia for advanced training in techniques used to reconstruct child deformities. 
Operation Smile consists of reconstructive surgeons, professional nurses and concerned citizens who have dedicated themselves to providing relief for children suffering from congenital and acquired deformities. 
Through a spirit of selflessness, Dr. Moore has given both this heart and time to Operation Smile. He has served as the President of the chapter's local board and is currently its medical director. 
Mr. President, Dr. Moore's dedication is a great source of pride, not only for Pennsylvania, but for the United States. I hope my colleagues will join with me in honoring Dr. Moore for his spirit of community and faithful service.

 Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the importance of the National Association of Letter Carriers Food Drive. The National Association of Letter Carriers Food Drive, held in conjunction with the U.S. Postal Service and local United Way, is the largest one-day collection of food in the nation. Last year almost 5,000 pounds were collected in Horsham, Pennsylvania while some 73 million pounds were collected nationwide. 
On Saturday, May 9, letter carriers in Horsham and across the nation reached out to help their neighbors who fell on hard times by collecting nonperishable food donations along their mail routes. Each year, their efforts help to restock the shelves of local food pantries. Likewise, the donations raided through this annual event prepare charities for the overwhelming demand for food during the Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday seasons. 
Mr. President, I commend the letter carriers, the men and women of the U.S. Postal Service, and the United Way for making this collection possible. On behalf of the United States Senate, I would like to recognize the dedication of these public servants and the generosity of the families who donated to this worthy cause. I ask my colleagues to join me in extending the Senate's best wishes for continued success to all those who participated in the National Association of Letter Carriers Food Drive.

 Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to reaffirm my support for the tireless efforts of the Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Association of Lehigh Valley to fight Chronic Fatigue and Immune Dysfunction Syndrome (CFIDS), or Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS). 
For six years, the CFS Association of Lehigh Valley has been dedicated to finding a cure for CFIDS, increasing public awareness, and supporting victims of this disease. The Lehigh Valley organization is actively involved in CFS-related research. In addition, they regularly participate in seminars to train health care professionals. Public education is an essential aspect of the association's mission. Likewise, the Lehigh Valley organization raises public awareness through the International CFIDS Awareness Day, which is held on May 12 each year. I would also note that the CFS Association of Lehigh Valley received the CFIDS Support Network Action Award in both 1995 and 1996 for their initiatives in public advocacy. 
Although researchers have made some advances in the study of this condition, CFIDS remains a mysterious illness. Presently, there is no known cause or cure. Victims experience a wide range of symptoms including extreme fatigue, fever, muscle and joint pain, cognitive and neurological problems, tender lymph nodes, nausea, and vertigo. Recently, the Centers for Disease Control gave CFIDS `Priority 1' status in the new infectious disease category, which also includes cholera, malaria, hepatitis C and tuberculosis. Until this disease is obliterated, the CFS Association of Lehigh Valley will continue its research and education campaigns. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in commending the Lehigh Valley organization and in supporting the following proclamation:  
Proclamation 
Whereas, the Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) Association of the Lehigh Valley joined the Chronic Fatigue and Immune Dysfunction Syndrome (CFIDS) Association of America, the world's largest organization dedicated to conquering CFIDS, in observing May 12, 1998 as International Chronic Fatigue and Immune Dysfunction Syndrome Awareness Day; and 
Whereas, the Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Association of the Lehigh Valley, a member of the Support Network of the CFIDS Association of America, is celebrating their sixth year of service to the community; and 
Whereas, CFIDS is a complex illness which is characterized by neurological, rheumatological and immunological problems, incapacitating fatigue, and numerous other symptoms that can persist for months or years and can be severely debilitating; and 
Whereas, estimates suggest that hundreds of thousands of American adults already have CFIDS; and 
Whereas, the medical community and the general public should receive more information and develop a greater awareness of the problems associated with CFIDS. While much has been done at the national, state, and local levels, more must be done to support patients and their families; and 
Whereas, research has been strengthened by the efforts of the Centers for Disease Control, the National Institutes of Health, and other private institutions, the CFS Association of the Lehigh Valley recognizes that much more must be done to encourage further research so that the mission of conquering CFIDS and related disorders can be achieved; 
Therefore, the United States Senate commends the designation of May 12, 1998 as CFIDS Awareness Day and applauds the efforts of those battling the illness. 
I appreciate the Senate's consideration of this issue, and I thank my colleagues for their attention.

 Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the inventors, manufacturers, marketers, entrepreneurs, investors and media from across the United States and over 35 countries that are convening in Pittsburgh for the Invention/New Product Exposition (INPEX XIV). 
INPEX is held in conjunction with The Business Show, the region's business-to-business trade show, and the Global Partnership with Pennsylvania Conference. The conference provides the opportunity for international entrepreneurs to meet with representatives from the region's businesses. This conference helps to promote economic development and job creation in Western Pennsylvania and encourages participants to establish their operations in the region. Participants can attend the educational seminars to learn how to do business in Pennsylvania and network with Pennsylvania chambers, businesses and regional associations. 
Most inventions and new products displayed at INPEX are eligible to be a part of the INPEX Awards Program. Entries are judged by an International Jury, with winners determined on the basis of usefulness, overall appeal and creativity. Past sponsors of corporate awards include AAA, the World Trade Center Association, NASA and the Pennsylvania Institute Of Culinary Arts. 
Mr. President, I am pleased that Pittsburgh is the site of such innovation, business development and global partnership. I ask my colleagues to join me in extending the Senate's best wishes to participants and organizers of this conference, and in recognizing the week of May 11 as Innovation Week, Business to Business Week and Global Partnership With Pennsylvania Week.

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the outgoing chair of the YMCA of the USA National Board of Public Policy Committee and a fellow Pennsylvanian, Judge Charles C. Brown, Jr. 
For the past three years, Judge Brown has steered the public policy initiatives of the YMCA of the USA through good and bad times. As a result, the YMCA of the USA now enjoys a strong and credible standing in the public policy arena. Under Judge Brown's leadership, the YMCA has earned the respect of other nonprofit organizations, administration officials, senators, and congressmen alike. Sadly, this month Judge Brown will step down as chair of the YMCA of the USA National Board of Public Policy Committee. 
During his tenure as chairman, Judge Brown was instrumental in shaping a new direction for the YMCA movement. The quintessential professional and team builder, the Judge--as he is respectfully called by his colleagues--was never satisfied to let the nation's largest youth-serving organization remain on the sidelines of public policy advocacy. Through Judge Brown's vision and guidance, the YMCA of the USA developed legislation which was introduced in Congress to expand youth development programs; held three national conferences to educate policy makers on the role and impact of YMCA programs; took the lead in coordinating a national coalition to support school-age child care provided by nonprofit organizations like the YMCA; helped shape and direct national legislation on juvenile justice; and became a leading national resource on the state of America's children, youth and families. Although one of these achievements would have been impressive in and of itself, the Judge insisted on a comprehensive, integrated advocacy role for the YMCA. For these and many other reasons, Judge Brown's leadership will be sincerely missed by the YMCA of the USA National Board of Directors. 
Mr. President, I believe it is important to recognize Judge Charles C. Brown's contributions to one of the nation's oldest and most respected organizations, the YMCA. As he prepares to pass the reigns of leadership, I ask my colleagues to join me in extending the Senate's best wishes for continued success to Judge Brown and his family.

 Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, this year marks the 150th anniversary of Coudersport, PA. Today, I rise to discuss the establishment, growth, and achievements of this town. 
Coudersport was named for Mr. Coudere, a European investor in the Ceres Land Company which owned 175,000 acres in this area of Pennsylvania. Established in 1848, the town had only 48 buildings and about 200 residents. After it was approved as the seat of the Potter County government, the village slowly grew. Just before the Civil War, Coudersport's population nearly doubled. Anti-slavery sentiment ran strong in this town. Residents held fundraisers to benefit abolitionist causes. Reminders of the town's rich history still stand. Six of the original 48 buildings are still inhabited. Today, the population of Coudersport stands at 2,854, and it is still the hub of Potter County. Although Coudersport has changed with the times, it never lost its small town charm. 
Mr. President, the people of this town are proud of their history and their traditions. I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Coudersport on its 150th anniversary.

Mr. SANTORUM. I want to bring a rider to the attention of Members. 
In conference, a rider was added, not debated on this floor or in the House, that extended for 2 months the period of time in which Secretary Shalala and the Department of Health and Human Services--for regulations on organ donation policy to be implemented. 
The organ donation policy advocated by patient transplant organizations, to have a much more equitable system of organ donation, was put forward on a bipartisan basis support. 
The Senator from Louisiana put in an amendment to delay the implementation for 2 additional months over the objections of the administration. People will be dying as a result of this. Sick people who need organs are not going to get those organs as a result of this delay. 
We should not allow this to continue. I'm going to vote against this, and I hope that we will not continue this kind of delay.

Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer for his recognition. 
Mr. President, let me thank Senator Coats for his tremendous leadership on what is, really, a new paradigm. Those listening to the debate on the Senate floor and the discussion of the Renewal Alliance agenda--renewal, empowerment, achievement learning for life--may be hearing some things for the first time, as to a different approach. 
One of the things that I know Senator Coats talked about and, in a sense, schooled many of us in here on this side of the aisle and on the other side of the aisle, I might add, is the importance of understanding the problems of this country, the real intractable problems, the ones that we sort of don't believe that there are any quick fixes to and are not going to be fixed in Washington. In fact, many of us would argue that many were exacerbated by attempts by Washington to fix those problems. 
As a result of Senator Coats' urgings, the more I have gotten out into the neighborhoods in the last few years--poor neighborhoods, in particular, in Pennsylvania--to see what works and what doesn't: What are people doing at the local level that is making a difference in people's lives, that is taking absolute hopelessness and despair and turning it into productivity and optimism? 
What I see is that, almost without exception, they are not Government programs and, almost without exception, they don't take Government dollars because, in so doing, it would corrupt what works for them because the Government would have some way of dictating to them how this program must work or what hoops they must jump through. And they have designed a program that meets the needs of the people in that community, designed by people in that community who have, in many, if not most, cases experienced the same kind of hopelessness and despair before they arrived where they are today--in a state of now helping those come out of the problems they have. 
So what I have learned from my discussions with those very people is that we need to look here in Washington as to how we can help them, help them do the mission--and it is a mission, it is not a job. I don't know of anybody I have met in these communities who is making any money, who is getting a good night's sleep at night, who is profiting in any real financial way from, or any tangible way from, their work, but profiting enormously in the intangibles that are, frankly, the most satisfying. 
It is a true labor of love for people in these communities, whether they are in the economic development area, or in the community development area, or in dealing with homelessness, or abused women, or doing a charter school, or running a small parochial school. Whatever the case may be, these are people who are convicted, who care deeply--not about education, not about homelessness, not about drug abuse; they care about that person sitting across the table from them. It is not a macroissue. It is a one-to-one, person-to-person challenge to save someone's life. They do it because they care. They do it because they love that person. That is the magic that no Government program can provide. 
What Dan Coats, Spencer Abraham, and Sam Brownback--those of us who are members of the alliance having looked into the eyes of those who care, not those who appropriate money here in Washington who say we care, but those who are there across the table shedding the tears, holding the hands, embracing those in real pain, those people who care--how can we help them? How can we help the world ministries, the real healing agents of our society to solve those intractable problems that, believe it or not, they solve, and do so so well? How did we help them do it better? How can we help them turn more lives around and replicate the great accomplishments they have made to so many neighborhoods? There isn't a neighborhood in America where there is not at least one person or one organization--whether it is a school or whether it is a rehab center or whether it is a homeless shelter or a soup kitchen--that isn't touching and changing people. 
We have come forward with this agenda that is not, as the speaker said before, a Washington-based solution to the problem. But it is, in fact, a way that Washington can, one, get out of the way; two, maybe help with some of the things in a legal sense to get out of the way; three, give financial resources to those organizations that need those resources to either help the community or help the economy; and, next, give resources to the hands of parents and children so they can have the opportunity to hope through an education that gives them the tools to be able to be successful in our society. 
But I am going to focus my couple of minutes more to talk in the area of education. I cannot tell you the number of employers I talked to just within the southeastern Pennsylvania area the other day, Philadelphia. Employer after employer, factory or industry, they told me how they desperately need skilled people. They desperately need people who are even semiskilled who can be trained. There are such shortages in the workplace today. Then I asked--the unemployment rate in the city of Philadelphia, the center city, or in Chester, or in Levittown, or places like that is very high, and there is available work? They say, `Yes, there is. We have job fares. We ask people to apply, and they don't.' I said, `Why don't they?' They said, `Well, by and large, they don't have the education. They can't, in many cases, fill out applications, or they just simply don't have the education necessary to even meet what is a minimal skilled job.' 
The jobs are there. But we just do not have people who are educated enough to take advantage of those opportunities. That is, in fact, a shame, and, as a result of a variety of factors, a breakdown in the family, the breakdown in the community, and, yes, the breakdown of the educational structure. 
There are lots of things we can do to solve the first two 
problems that have been talked about. I am going to talk about the third, which is the breakdown of the education structure. I am not going to profess to you I have the answer--the silver bullet to make public education work in America's poor neighborhoods. I do not have a silver bullet. I can sit up here and suggest a variety of things that may or may not work to solve that intractable problem in educating poor students in poor schools. I do not have that answer off the top of my head. What I do have is a solution that will give children and families the opportunity to send their child to school where they can get a good education tomorrow. We have to step back and say, `Well, is that good enough?' Some may say, `Senator, you are not solving the big problem tomorrow in public education in the poor neighborhoods of our country.' I will answer, You are right. I am not. I am not going to solve that problem tomorrow. But what I am going to start to do today is to give that young person who may have a dream, or that mother or father who sees the spark in that young child's eye and believes that spark can lead them to somewhere in life if given the educational tools. I am going to give them the chance to get that child a chance. That is all we can do right now--to give them a scholarship, to send them to a school where they will have the opportunity to see that spark catch fire, to feed them what they need to take on the world. 
Our program, called Educational Opportunities for Low-Income Families, is to provide scholarships through existing block grants that go to the States right now. We would allow that block grant to be used for scholarships to go to low-income children and 185 percent of poverty and below in the poorest neighborhoods in our country so that it will give low-income kids in poor neighborhoods the opportunity to have a scholarship that pays up to 60 percent of the cost of their tuition and would give them the opportunity to go to school and learn. I think it is a great opportunity for us to help one child at a time. I believe that in the long run helping one child at a time and giving that choice will, in fact, cause dramatic reforms in the whole educational system in those communities. 
I have been given the high sign here. I will follow my chairman's lead. Again, I thank Senator Coats for his tremendous leadership on this.

 Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, on April 26, the Bethel Church of God in Christ will celebrate `A New Work.' Not only will this two year old ministry install a new pastor, Elder George Shepherd Christopher, but also, the congregation will dedicate its new church in Pittsburgh. The theme for the installation service comes from Psalm 118:23, `This is the Lord's doing, it is marvelous in our eyes.' 
The Bethel Church of God in Christ is a community based, Bible believing, Christ centered, Spirit directed fellowship. For the past two years, this church has selflessly dedicated itself to community service. The congregation believes it is necessary to minister to the whole person for the glory of God. Having pledged to provide `Ministry to the heart of East Liberty and beyond,' the church looks forward to the challenges and promises of the future. 
Mr. President, the parishioners and clergy have worked and prayed tirelessly for both the new building and their new pastor. In closing, I ask my colleagues to join me in extending the Senate's best wishes to the Bethel Church of God in Christ. With God's help, this church will be a light for lost souls in East Liberty and throughout Pittsburgh.

 Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Mrs. Louise Chase, a very special constituent from Horsham, Pennsylvania. A Navy veteran during WWII, Mrs. Chase continues to serve her country and her community as commander of the American Legion, Pennsylvania Department. 
Last summer, Mrs. Chase became the first woman to serve as commander of the Pennsylvania Department of the American Legion. She was elected at the conclusion of the 79th convention. Such an honor came as no surprise to those who have followed her involvement in the American Legion. In 1979, Louise was elected as the Department of Pennsylvania's first female vice commander. She has twice served as District Commander. Her Legion service also includes terms as adjutant of Philadelphia County and the Eastern Judicial Section, two terms as post commander, and 12 years as adjutant of Tioga Post 319. Other positions she has held within the organization include state legislative chairman, and chairman of the Select Committee on Economics and Benefits. Moreover, she is one of only two Pennsylvania Legionnaires who served on committees of the two National Conventions held in Pennsylvania. 
In the business world, Louise proved to be an equally hard-working and dedicated employee. She was the controller and office manager of Philadelphia's prestigious Germantown Cricket Club for 13 years. She managed two high rise apartment buildings. Mrs. Chase was also a manufacturers' representative for paper container companies. Recently, she retired as an international marketing representative of a major computer manufacturer. 
Mr. President, Louise Chase has continued her family's tradition of service to the nation, which literally spans from the Civil War to the Space Age. I ask the Senate to join me in extending the Senate's best wishes for continued success to Mrs. Chase and her family.

 Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, the Jewish Community Relations Council (JCRC) hosted the annual Holocaust Memorial Ceremony starting on April 19 in remembrance of the six million Jews who died in the Holocaust. The theme for this year's ceremony is `A People Survives: From the Gates of Hell to the Gates of Jerusalem.' This memorial service draws over 3,000 people every year to honor the stoicism and faith of all people who were unjustly massacred by the Nazis. The Holocaust Memorial Ceremony is one of the most profound events in the Jewish Community. 
The JCRC was established in 1938 and works to promote issues of Jewish communal concern and is driven by Jewish values of humanitarianism, respect for others, and the sanctity of human life. To this day the JCRC has worked to create a society in which there is equal opportunity for all, freedom of thought, opinion, religion and constructive, amicable relationships between people of all races and creeds. They pledge to do all this while maintaining the integrity and character of the Jewish faith. 
In 1980 Congress established the United States Holocaust Memorial Council and mandated it to lead the nation in civic commemorations of the victims of the Holocaust (called Days of Remembrance), to sponsor the national annual civic commemoration and to encourage appropriate Remembrance observances throughout the country. This year Yom Hashoah was April 23. The Days of Remembrance of the victims of the Holocaust are being observed from Sunday, April 19 through Sunday, April 26. 
Before there was a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Days of Remembrance was established and carried out, not only in the Rotunda of the United States Capitol, but all across the nation. This annual, national commemoration program is the United States Holocaust Memorial Council's longest-running program and is essential to the Council's Congressional mandate. 
We have now reached the time at which many of the Holocaust survivors are passing on. It is imperative that all of humanity maintain respect for and never forget the tremendous suffering of the Jewish community. It is true that this event is a wholly Jewish experience, and yet, the entire world still reels from its impact. It is the responsibility of the people of the United States and the world to ensure that the memory of the Holocaust lives on. 
Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to give their blessings to the Holocaust Memorial Ceremony and to praise the efforts of the JCRC in maintaining awareness of the Holocaust.

 Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, the Knights of Columbus recently honored Mr. Walter Hauk, Jr. for his contributions as the State Advocate over the past two years. I rise today to recognize Mr. Hauk and to discuss some of his outstanding contributions to his community. 
A resident of Plymouth Township, Pennsylvania, Walter has taken a very active role in local affairs. Over the past 25 years, Walter has been a cornerstone of the Knights of Columbus. In fact, he has held all of the top offices in the organization. In addition, he has served as member of the Conshohocken Zoning Board, assisted in the Conshohocken Soap Box Derby, and served as a Scout Master. Furthermore, I would note that he earned a degree in accounting by attending evening classes at St. Joseph's University. 
By all accounts, Walter is a dedicated husband and father. He and his wife, Carol, were blessed with four children--two sons and two daughters. They are also proud grandparents. 
Mr. President, Walter has dedicated his life to his family and his community. I ask my colleagues to join me in extending the Senate's best wishes for continued success to Mr. Hauk and his family.

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I felt compelled, while I was in the chair in the last hour, to comment on the statements of the Senator from Massachusetts and the Senator from Ohio. I found it quite remarkable, sitting and listening to what was laid out, I think, somewhat factually about the problems we have in education, that the educational system is not meeting the needs of our country in providing good citizens, the education necessary to be good citizens, and the education necessary to perform needed functions in our economy. 
The response to the problem in education from the Senator who spoke, and from others who oppose this bill, is two things. I hear two things. One, we need more bricks and mortar. If we had better looking schools and more nicely appointed schools, or even better equipment, somehow the problem would go away. On top of that, we need more teachers. So if we just did more of the same, only did it better, with nicer buildings and more people, things would improve. 
I am not too sure that most Americans who are interfacing with the school systems in this country right now would accept that as the reasonable course, that what we need is just a few more teachers in the schools and better looking buildings. I have been to a lot of schools. I have been to about 120 public school districts in my State. I go to schools all the time. I spend a great deal of my time as I travel the State talking in the public schools. I have been to a few private schools, too. By and large, I would say that the public schools I went to were in much better condition than the parochial schools and private schools I went to. No comparison. Much better equipment, much more state-of-the-art, much better teacher ratios than the parochial schools I went to. So if the problem in the public schools was better buildings and more teachers, then the results that I would get in going to a public school in inner-city Pittsburgh, and one that is a parochial school, should be dramatically different based on this criterion that more teachers and nicer buildings make good school districts and educate children. 
In fact, the results are just the opposite. It is not bricks and mortar. It is not numbers of teachers. It is structure, it is discipline, it is order, and it is caring and concern, it is love, it is involvement--all of those intangible things that have to do with families and people who are committed to educating children. So what those of us on our side believe is the answer is not to pump more money into bricks and mortar and existing structures, but to pump more money into the people who make a real difference in children's lives, and that is families--families, who can help their children by assisting them with some resources, help them in their public or private or parochial education. That is just a fundamental difference as to what we believe works in education. 
I don't think that continuing to throw money at the system would work. This is truly remarkable. You would think this bill took money from the public schools. For the record, there is nothing in this bill that takes one dollar out of the Federal commitment to education. In fact, there is more money in this bill, but you would not know that. I have been here for the last hour and 15 minutes, and you would not know that by listening to the other side. You would think that this were stripping money out of Federal support for education in the public schools. That is not true. Not one penny. In fact, more money for school construction is in this bill. So there is 
not one dollar being taken away, not one dollar being diverted away. This is in fact `new Federal support' for education. 
Where is it going? It is going to families. This is sort of funny. I almost feel bad saying, `Where is it going?' `To families.' We are letting it stay there; we are just going to be benevolent enough to let them keep it if they do with it what we want them to do, which is to help support their children in education. It is saying that if you do what we want you to do with that money, we will let you keep it. 
It is very nice of us to do this, isn't it? It is sort of nice to come around and say we will let you keep the money if you do what we tell you. What the other side wants to do is say, `No, we are not going to even let you have the choice to take that money. Excuse me, we are going to give it over here to build more schools and give it to more teachers.' They say that is the problem, that we don't have nice schools and we don't have enough teachers. 
Again, I don't think too many people really believe that. What we want to do is get at the heart of the problem, which is to give parents the opportunity to educate their children, not to give schools more money. 
There is another remarkable thing here. When I say not to give schools more money, what we are talking about here with these A+ accounts is $100 million a year. You would think we were talking about huge amounts of money vis-a-vis what we spend on public education. We spend roughly one-quarter of a trillion dollars on public education per year. The Senator from Georgia told me that. This bill is $100 million per year. This is hardly a division plowing into the main line of the educational establishment; this is a sniper, at best, saying, `Look, we are here.' This is a very moderate, very modest proposal, to say: Let's allow families to have some choices here. We do a great job. 
This is another astounding thing. The amendment of the Senator from Ohio says that we should not allow this money to be used for K-12, let it be used for postsecondary education. I travel around the State of Pennsylvania a lot and around the country a little bit. I hear a lot of people complaining to me about the quality of K-12 education and the problems in primary and secondary education. I hear a lot of complaints about higher education, but it is not about quality. It is not about quality. It is somewhat about access and about costs, yes. But I think we are the envy of the world when it comes to colleges and universities and technical schools after primary and secondary school. 
Yet, what do we want to do? We want to put more money where there isn't a problem as far as quality and producing good products, and not put it into the area where people think the biggest problem exists. Now, I am telling you, if I were running a company and I had two divisions, one that was doing well producing good product and the other that was not, and someone came forth and said they thought we could change the system by which we produce this product, look at a different approach, because we have been trying this old approach now for decades and it just isn't keeping up with the requirements of the new age that is out there, as far as the need for education, this product isn't keeping up with standards and we need to look at how to change it, some folks might come forward and say, `See these old machines here. We need to put more bells and whistles on to make them look nicer. We don't need to change the structure or how it works, it just needs to be run better and we need more people running it.' That is what their answer is. 
Some of us are saying, as well, that maybe we should try other machines or look to change this machine so it doesn't function a little differently than it has done in the past. We want to put some money in to do that. This board of directors is saying, `Oh, no, no. Leave this system just the way it is. Clean it up a little bit, put a few more operators on the machine, and put the money over here where we have the good product. Don't fix the old product.' 
I don't think that makes sense to most Americans. It certainly does not make sense to me. So what we are trying to do here in a very modest way is to say the future of education is going to be just like the future in everything we do, as we become more and more decentralized as an economy and as a country, with people demanding and expecting more choices and more freedom and needing it to be flexible enough to deal with the changing economy and the changing world. Instead of setting up institutions and structures that may or may not--in most cases, they will not--meet the changing needs of our economy and our educational needs, to invest that money into the flexible family, if you will, into the family that in my community in Penn Hills, PA, maybe have very different needs as to what their child needs to be educated for, 
given the capability of the child, given what the economy is in the area, given what skills are necessary in the region, whatever it is, than someone in Birmingham, AL, who may have a very different set of skills needed, a very different community, very different needs, but allow that family to make that decision, give them the resources if they want to send the child to the public school and use that money to buy some software, or to buy a computer, or to buy other kinds of teaching aids, or to buy tutorial services, whatever it is, give them the flexibility to meet the needs of their child instead of putting more bricks in a school. 
It is just common sense. It makes sense. It is so obvious on its face that, if we are going to do anything to allow the family and the individual student to have the flexibility to deal with this changing environment in education and our economy, it is the only direction we can take rather than put money into the old machine to just make it look nice and put more operators pulling the gadgets. I mean, it is just inconceivable that anybody thinks that is the answer to this dynamic educational marketplace that we have. We have a great opportunity here to show that we get it--that we in our hallowed Halls can walk outside and go into a community school to see what makes the difference in education is not nice buildings or small classrooms. Those are nice things. But it is committed families, committed teachers, and it is community involvement--someone going to a school where they can take part of something that is good for them, they can contribute to their well-being. That can only be done through families and giving them the resources to maximize their own children's future. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

 Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to pay my respects to several young people who recently lost their lives in a cabin fire. 
Two weeks ago, 11 friends from Northumberland and Lancaster Counties planned a weekend retreat at the Wehry family cabin. The site of many memorable family gatherings, the newly remodeled cabin seemed to be the perfect setting to eat, play cards, and enjoy rural Centre County's outdoor recreation. On Sunday morning, March 22, the friends' fun-filled weekend came to a devastating end. The `mansion in the mountains' caught fire at 5:20 a.m. All of the 11 friends died in their sleep from smoke inhalation. 
Each of these young people was special in his or her own right. A quiet girl, Toni Wehry wanted to be a teacher. Amanda Wehry was bright, outgoing, and popular. Tyrone Wehry, who was working for the House Republican caucus in Harrisburg, planned to pursue a career in politics. Warwick High School's former basketball star, Erik Gray was learning to be an electrician. Nicholas Berkey was lovingly described as a dependable young man who was saving money to buy a house. The versatile James Giliberti enjoyed martial arts, music, and finance; he had planned to invest in an IRA this year. Kip Snyder is remembered as a prankster who pitched for the Line Mountain High School baseball team. Chad Hain, who enjoyed hands-on technical work, had a promising career in carpentry. Quiet and sensitive, Jason Herrold was studying business administration at Susquehanna University. The Wiest brothers, Toby and David, owned a paint ball supply store. By all accounts, the vivacious Toby and the pensive David were best friends. 
Friends and neighbors have rallied to console the victims' families. Well wishers tied blue and gold ribbons--Line Mountain High School's colors--to telephone poles, lampposts, and front doors. These poignant memorials hang beside Easter decorations. Students at Line Mountain High signed banners in the auditorium to bid their friends farewell. Signs expressing words of comfort and encouragement hang in the windows of local businesses. One reads, `Now they're in God's cabin.' 
Mr. President, words cannot describe a parent's grief upon the death of a child. I ask my colleagues to join me in extending the Senate's condolences to the victims' families. Our prayers and heartfelt sympathies go out to them.

Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Mr. President. 
I would just suggest that if you went to a movie theater you would not see a Government-regulated movie because no one would go to it because it would be of such poor quality. It would be so burdened down by bureaucracy and red tape, because it simply could not produce the quality that the free market produces. 
There have been dramatic changes in health care. This continues every day. I met the other day with the chairman of the national board that certifies health care plans. She told me they are constantly updating quality standards, constantly updating to see whether patients are getting the kind of care and access through these plans that are certified. It is important to let this dynamic system of health care operate in the system of the free market which has brought us so far. Do not burden it down with all sorts of bells and whistles and bureaucracies and red tape that will just stifle innovation, stifle quality, stifle progress in medicine, result in more uninsured, result in less comprehensive care. This is about patients. 
Look, I am not a great fan of managed health care. But I am a fan of the marketplace working and getting the response. I would suspect that the Senator from Illinois knows that there are managers of health care companies who probably saw that movie. In fact, they didn't have to see that movie. For years, they have been coming to my office--and I know offices around this Capitol--and they have been going out in America getting the message. The Senator is right. A lot of people are upset about managed care. I am not a big fan of it, but I understand that, in time, the marketplace, the employers, and the employees will work much more effectively through that place in changing the system to produce quality where people will go somewhere else. Employers will go somewhere else. In fact, they are already. It is working out there. It takes time. 
What we don't need to freeze in place is some Government standard implemented by a bunch of bureaucrats who take 4 years to implement regulations to control something that is already out of date. Let the dynamism work. Don't put the hand of the Federal Government over the system that has improved the quality of health care so dramatically for so many millions of people. Allow that system to continue to improve. Allow that system to continue to grow to serve more people more compassionately. Yes; there are problems. But don't add the ultimate problem--Government suffocation to a dynamic system where `change' is the operative word of the day. 
Senator Kennedy suggests that his bill is supported by the President's commission. His hand-picked commission does not support the legislation that the Senator has proposed. He would give you that impression. They recommended no legislation. They recommended the marketplace. It is in the process of working. It is working. In many areas it is working, and will continue to work. Managed care is still a relatively new thing. 
Again, I repeat. I am not a big fan of managed care. But it is new. It is improving. Like any new product, it takes time to work out the bugs and to get to the point where they are doing the kind of customer satisfaction and quality that we need. But the last thing we need is to put the Government in charge of health care plans, the Government in charge of regulating what is quality and what is not. Oh, my goodness. Compare any private sector organization on quality. Compare what goes on at HCFA, at the IRS, or a whole variety of other agencies. Are we now, in Government, the arbiters of quality? Think about that. Do you really want the Government of the United States through their regulation process to dictate to you what quality is? I don't think so.

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise in very strong support of Chairman Roth's amendment. There is nobody in this Chamber who has done more to look out for the retirement security of Americans than Senator Roth from Delaware. It is with his Roth IRA and other kinds of innovation in his work on the Finance Committee that he has helped to provide for retirement security for millions of Americans, which is legendary. I commend him for that and for firing, if you will, here on the floor of the Senate, the first salvo in what I believe will be a long debate, and I hope will not be a hostile debate, on the issue of transitioning Social Security. 
What we have seen is now a bipartisan agreement that personal savings accounts must have a very significant role in transitioning Social Security. Why is that? Social Security is in trouble. It is not in trouble next year or the year after, but Social Security, which was `saved' back in 1983 with the most recent revision--it was supposed to save it for generations to come, but it is now scheduled to go bankrupt some 30 years sooner than originally expected. That number is not set in stone either. It is now 2029 when the system goes bankrupt. In the year 2013, the system starts running a deficit, paying out more than it takes in. Now is the time, before that bulk of the population, the baby boom generation, goes into retirement, to begin to look at how we can begin to solve this problem. Well, there are things you can do within the current structure, like changing benefits--when I say `changing,' I don't mean raising them, I mean cutting benefits--increasing taxes, and do a whole lot of things to try to preserve a pay-as-you-go system that will not work over time because of very simple demographics, the most important of 
which is that people are living much longer, which is a good thing, and also we have very low birth rates in this country. You have people living longer and fewer people to pay for them. So you are looking at dramatic increases in taxes or cuts in benefits, and that is a mindset of a finite, fixed pie. 
What Senator Roth is suggesting here is, let's grow the pie. So when he says let's grow the pie, let's invest this money, not, as Senator Domenici said, in Treasury bonds that earn a very small rate of return--in fact, if you are entering the work force now, the rate of return on Social Security taxes you are going to pay is below zero. That is not a good deal for young people in this country. But what we have to do is transition the system using the ideas of growth in producing more retirement income for people who are just entering the work force, or who have been in the work force a relatively short period of time, but at the same time, make sure that we do not change what has been promised to those at or near retirement. 
That is our challenge. But with challenge comes tremendous opportunity; in crisis comes a tremendous will to be innovative in using the private market systems that work so well in this country to provide wealth. As the Senator from Delaware said, our modest amount of money being paid on Social Security was never intended to be the sole source of retirement. As a result, it is a very modest amount. People living on Social Security today will tell you that if that is their only income and they have no other pension income or savings income, they are hard pressed to make a living. This is not an adequate savings system. What we need to do is enhance that, create an opportunity for more growth in people's wealth and, at the same time, protect those who are in the system or have been in the system such a long period of time, so that they will keep at least what we have promised in the past. 
We can do that, but we must use the power of the marketplace, the power of investment and savings. In so doing, we will not only open up the opportunity for wealth and a better retirement income for generations to come, but open up huge economic benefits for this country with the amount of money that is going to be poured into the capital markets and the debt markets, to be able to finance future economic expansion and growth, better jobs, and higher standards of living and real wage growth. I heard earlier today from Jose Pinero, who was the Secretary of Labor during the time Chile went to a private personal saving system there, some 17 years ago. He said that 30 years prior to Chile going to that system, they had a real wage growth of 1 percent a year, on average. Since they passed the personal savings accounts in Chile, they have had a real wage growth of 7 percent a year, for almost 15 years, in that country. 
What they have done is dramatically increase--over double; two and a half times--their savings rate. People now understood. Senator Roth said a very important thing, that only 40 percent of the people in this country have some investment in the marketplace and understand the dynamics of how the market works, how our economy works. That is a disability, if you will, for millions of Americans who don't have that advantage. The average, ordinary Chilean has that knowledge now and understands the marketplace and uses that knowledge to their own benefit--and not only their own benefit in their personal savings account, but in their life and in their savings and other skills of interacting in the economic marketplace. It 
creates such synergy that it will have a dramatically positive impact on the future of this country. 
This is the opportunity that is before us, and what I am so excited about is what I see is a real chance for a bipartisan solution to this problem. With Senator Moynihan's proposal of putting 2 percent aside in private savings, I think that is a very healthy initiative. We want to build, in my opinion, from that as to how we can transform this system to provide the security for those at or near retirement, put it in the law, which is not the case today, so that those benefits will be there as long as they are alive, that we will not change the benefit structure as long as they are alive--there is no law that says that right now--guarantee it. Then we can create opportunities for those, frankly, who have very little expectation that Social Security will be there. 
I talk to a lot of young people. I have been to over 110 high schools in my State since I have been in office. I can tell you, when I ask the question, `How many believe Social Security will be there when you retire?' if anybody raises their hand, the other kids in the crowd look at them and laugh at them. They have no expectation that Social Security will be there. They think it is, in fact, a pyramid scheme, a ponzi scheme, some sort of thing that the folks who are in power right now are just going to make them pay and then slash the heck out of Social Security when it comes their time. 
Well, what we are going to do here is create hope. One of the things I hear so much about is how young people are cynical in this country and they don't believe in our institutions and our culture, and what we are doing here is, in fact, giving them something they can hold, they can have a passbook with their money in it so they can track it every day and see how it grows, and they can say, `This is my money,' from the first day they worked flipping that first hamburger at a fast food restaurant. That money goes into their account and is building for their retirement security. 
They can see that happening with them at work. They can see hope. They can see the potential for wealth and for a good life. They will understand the dynamics that are so important for all of us to understand that have to survive economically in this country and in the world that is out in front. This is truly not something we should be looking at and saying, how are we going to fix Social Security? Such a problem, such a crisis. What are we going to do and have money? But to walk hand in hand and jump at the opportunity to create a whole new way of looking at providing opportunities for millions of Americans upon their retirement and energizing and uplifting an economy through that process, this is a great opportunity for all of us. 
What the chairman of the Finance Committee has done today is to lay down the first mark on the budget where it should be laid down, because what we will be doing by allowing private investment is dramatically lower--not everyone talks about how we are going to use the surplus in transition. That is a big concern we have to worry about--how we transition these costs. That is the big nut we have to crunch. But at the end, what will happen is that budget deficits and the huge unemployment liability in $7 trillion or $8 trillion of unfunded liability in the Social Security trust fund today will in effect over time vanish because of the dynamics of allowing private savings to occur. 
This is in fact a multifaceted solution to many problems that are out there, one of which is the long-term problems of the budget deficit in the outyears when the baby boomers are beginning to take retirement--not only Social Security but Medicare as well--when the budget deficit comes back again. You hear so much about surplus. It comes back again. That is the era, that is the time that we can, by acting now, keep surpluses coming long into the future and grow the economy, create stability, create hope for those who now do not have it. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to offer tribute to the late Ms. Colleen Cleary-Myers and to offer condolences to her family on their loss. 
Mrs. Cleary-Myers was a beloved wife, daughter and mother. I describe her this way not only because it is true, but because, in a very literal way, it was these ties to these people that helped to define her life. It is these ties which are her legacy. 
Mrs. Cleary-Myers, only 30 years old, died of complications associated with a rare form of leukemia called chronic myleogensis. When she learned she was suffering from this illness, she was joyfully pregnant with her first child. Her husband, Michael, shared in this joy and grateful anticipation. In this way, she resembled most other young mothers. But unlike them, she was faced with a cruel choice: she could be treated immediately and risk the life of her baby or she could delay chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant, be treated after the child's birth and be unable to have more children. When faced with this dilemma, she did a noble thing. She chose to postpone treatment and looked forward to the birth of her son, Derek Vincent. 
Upon learning the news, Mrs. Cleary-Myers' family resolved to support her in any way that they could. Two of her sisters were compatible matches for the required bone marrow transplant and both were eager to assist her. 
Tragically, Mrs. Cleary-Myers died on March 15th. While I join her family in mourning her untimely death, I also am uplifted by the example and the standard she sets for all of us. Her example is the example of unselfish love and the standard she sets of willing and uncomplaining sacrifice for the sake of another life is one to which we can all aspire. Because this young woman knew, in an intimate way, a simple truth: Every life is infinitely precious and valuable. 
Too often, when confronted with an example of courage and sacrifice, we tell ourselves that others are capable of , and perhaps called to, such behavior, but we, most surely, are not. I believe this conclusion is a mistake. The example of Mrs. Cleary-Myers, a young woman living happily and without notoriety, reminds us that we are all capable of such gallantry and, in different ways, are called to it. Her son, Derek Vincent, provides us with eloquent testimony that such gallantry can sometimes mean nothing less than the protection of life itself. May God bless her, her husband and little Derek Vincent.

 Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a constituent who has distinguished himself at home and abroad. This week, Edward J. Piszek will be honored in Philadelphia for receiving one of the Republic of Poland's highest civilian honors. 
On March 16, 1998, President Aleksander Kwasniewski bestowed the `Polonia Restituta,' or the `Commander's Cross with a White Star' upon Mr. Piszek. This medal is presented for extraordinary service to the nation of Poland. Recipients of the Polonia Restituta are celebrated for their achievements in government and public activities, for contributions to promote Poland's independence, or for advancing Polish culture in the areas of education, literature and the arts. 
The son of Polish immigrants, Ed exemplified his parents' strong work ethic. It was a lesson well learned. In 1946, with $350 and the help of a close friend, Ed founded Mrs. Paul's Kitchens, Inc. Under his direction, the company became one of America's largest producers of prepared frozen seafood and vegetables. 
Ed began his philanthropic work in Poland during the 1960s. After witnessing the tremendous suffering caused by the high incidence of tuberculosis, he donated an ambulance to the hospital in Tarnow in memory of his parents. Later, he would provide 11 mobile x-ray units and 42 support vehicles to transport technicians. 
Mr. Piszek's commitment to the Polish people did not end with those initial acts of kindness. When the country suffered from food shortages in the early 1980s, he donated 10 million pounds of fishcakes. After the nuclear disaster in Chernobyl, Ed participated in an airlift of powdered milk and food to those who were affected in Poland. Mr. Piszek has also worked to help the Polish people elevate their culture. He and author James A. Michener established a Young Polish Writer's workshop. Similarly, Ed supported the `United States Peace Corps Partners in Teaching English' which has already trained 25,000 new English teachers in Poland. 
On the home front, Ed has worked to elevate the image of Polish Americans. He purchased the home of General Thaddeus Kosciuszko--a Polish engineer who came to fight in the American Revolution and then later designed West Point--and donated the property to the National Park Service. In 1972, he founded the Copernicus Society of America. This private non-profit foundation strives to promote and encourage artistic, scientific, and historical activities throughout the world. 
In countless many ways, Ed Piszek has helped build a cultural bridge between the U.S. and Poland. For instance, he hosted a visit from Lech Walesa at the Copernicus Society's headquarters in Fort Washington, PA. He was instrumental in making arrangements for ABC News to go `behind the walls' of the Vatican and film John Paul II in his work day and private moments. The end result was The Pope and His Vatican, an ABC News Special which aired Easter Night, 1983. Another of Ed's noteworthy achievements was coordinating with the Copernicus Society and Penn State University to hold Agricultural Economic Development Summits in the Pzeszow Province of Poland. These one-week seminars allow agricultural experts from Poland and Penn State to share their knowledge and their expertise with neighboring countries. Finally, Mr. Piszek is working to promote the national pastime in Poland. A board member of the Little League Baseball Foundation in Williamsport, PA, Ed is deeply involved in developing the Little League Baseball European Training Center in Kutno, Poland. He hopes that baseball will teach children of all nations the concepts of teamwork, leadership, and character. All things considered, Edward Piszek was an obvious choice to accompany President Clinton to Warsaw in support of NATO membership for Poland. 
Mr. President, one man can truly make a difference. Mr. Piszek's work has touched thousands of lives. As he is honored at the Kosciuszko House on April 2, I ask my colleagues to join me in extending the Senate's best wishes for continued success to Edward J. Piszek and his family.

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, the Senator from Texas did an excellent job of outlining the amendment. I think his comments are very persuasive. Let me add one element to the veracity of the comments of the Senator from Texas. 
He said this bill has some $2.5 billion for offset emergencies. He said but on average, about this fiscal year, that we will get up to five. There was discussion in the Cloakroom about an amendment to add another $1.6 billion of emergency spending. So maybe before the day is out, as opposed to before the year is out, we will get to our $5 billion in emergency spending for this year. 
When I say `emergency,' people tend to think when you hear the term `emergency,' an ambulance, or something that has to be done right away. A lot of these things don't have to be done right 
away. As the Senator from Texas laid out, a lot of this spending doesn't get spent right away. It gets spent in the long term. 
What we are trying to do is say, look, if you have an emergency now, we have to spend the money now. We are in the middle of the fiscal year. We understand that to go back and ask to try to offset this money within the FEMA budget, or the Defense Department, or wherever the other spending proposals come from, would be very difficult. We understand the difficulty in these departments. 
But there is no reason why our good friends, the appropriators, cannot within the context of this year's budget for this additional spending that we are going to pass today and appropriate today--whether they can't put it within their appropriations amounts for the fiscal year. That is responsible budgeting. That is, in fact, truth in budgeting. 
The Senator from Texas is right about the issue of Social Security. I chair the leader's task force on the issue of Social Security here in the Senate. I was one of those people who stood up and applauded the President for saying `Save Social Security First.' Use that money, use that surplus out there to direct the Social Security to save the Social Security system in the future. 
If we are going to box this money, remember, we said we are going to put this money and set it aside. Well, here is the money. Here is the money. Here are those first few dollars that we had planned to set aside. They want to spend it right now. 
That is not a good-faith promise to the American public. We know the President is not going to keep his promises. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't keep our promises. 
I noticed, because I was watching across the aisle, that every single one of my Democratic colleagues jumped up when the President said `save Social Security first.' Use that money that is there, that surplus that is coming down the road, and use that to save Social Security. They jumped up, and said, `Yes; we are going to use that money to save Social Security.' 
Here is the first vote of whether we are going to use the surplus to help transition for future generations the Social Security system, or whether we are going to use it for current political needs. 
I will be honest with you. These are not emergency needs in the real sense of the word. These are not unpredictable needs. As the Senator from Texas said, with respect to defense, I think most Members of the Senate knew we were going to be in Bosnia. I certainly believe the President knew we were going to be in Bosnia. He certainly knew the costs associated with being in Bosnia. I think the President and the people at FEMA and the people here in the Senate knew that the money we appropriated for disasters was not going to be sufficient to be able to fund it. It has not been for the past 7 or 8 years that I can recollect since I have been here. We have always, or seemingly, had some money--some years more, some years less--for disasters, natural disasters that are out there because we never adequately appropriated. 
I have to say I took my hat off to the Senator from Missouri, Senator Bond. That is his subcommittee. He has done a tremendous amount of work in trying to get FEMA to come forward with reforms so we don't have this open spigot where the money just flows out of here for natural disasters in some places not particularly well-accounted for. He has done a great job, and, in fact, has a bill before the Environment and Public Works Committee, I believe, to make some reforms in FEMA so we aren't back here every year with the President having this wide latitude to declare emergencies and spend all sorts of money outside of the confines of what we believe emergencies should be. 
So we have hopefully in place some tools in the future to control the growth or the expansion of these emergencies we have to end up dealing with. But the issue before us now is a very simple one. It is one that I hope we can agree to because it does not affect current outlays, it does not affect the current year budget, and it doesn't put any pain on the administration to come up with 
money in this year's budget cycle. 
I had a meeting the other day with the Chief of Naval Operations. He told me that as a result of the operations they deployed--whether it is the gulf, Korea, or Bosnia, or whatever--because of these extended deployments that they have had they have had to continually reprogram--not money; they can find the money other places within the Defense Department--he is 
spending more of his time doing bookkeeping or reprogramming money than he is out there leading our sailors. That is not a good position for our CNO to be in. We want him to pay attention, not just to the accounting within the service, but how we are going to be an effective fighting force. 
So I understand the problems and the concerns. Senator Gramm's amendment and my amendment deals with the issue of not making the CNO go back and find money and shift it all around, but it says: Declare the emergency. You have the money this year, but in future years when we do have an opportunity to put it in context, keep it under the caps. 
I know the caps are tough. I know Senator Gramm and I, as well as every Member of the Senate, will come to the chairman of the Appropriations Committee and say: Mr. Chairman, I am going to need help for this project, or I am going to need this--and I understand that. But I also expect him to do it within the caps, as I expect him to do this within the caps for future year funding. 
If we do not do that, then that downpayment on transitioning Social Security, that downpayment on creating that pool of money that is going to be so crucial for us to begin to develop a system in Social Security which is going to allow that transition for future generations of Americans to have some hope, some hope that Social Security will be there when they retire, will be frittered away, and all the promises that were made about how we are going to put Social Security first will go by the wayside when some other thing comes up first. 
I suspect this will not be the last time we do this. We will be back with another emergency bill, I am sure, before the end of the year, and we will have other plans. The President in his budget already has spent some of the surplus with overprojecting his revenues and underprojecting his expenditures, and so the surplus has already been eaten up. 
Look, I think there is a sincere feeling in this Chamber actually to take the surpluses that we are expecting in the next few years and use them for Social Security. I believe my colleagues, when they say that is what they would like to do with it, that they would like to save Social Security first, we can say that and we can mean it, but we have to do something to ensure that it is there. We have to make sure we are not robbing future generations with appropriations bills, year-to-year appropriations bills, spending more than the caps and thereby winnowing away that surplus. 
This is our first opportunity to stand up and say we are going to live within the budget and thereby, living within the budget, we will have money available to do what is right for the American public and that is create a Social Security system that will be there for future generations. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, first, I say to the Senator from Alaska, he is absolutely right. I do not think either Senator Gramm or I are intending, or what the Appropriations Committee did here, is somehow outside the Budget Act or illegal or against the law. Absolutely not. The chairman and the committee followed the Budget Act to a `t.' They declared the emergency. The President asked for emergency spending. They went ahead and spent the money outside of the parameters of the budget that we have for the country this year and for future years. 
We just do not agree that we should do that. I think we do have the right, because we have done it in the past, to make that spending this year, frankly, for future years, to stay within the caps and to allow some reprogramming to be done within those accounts. 
So my argument has never been, and I think the Senator from Texas would admit that his argument has never been, that what they have done is somehow wrong. Not wrong; certainly it is within the law. But to suggest that it is the right thing to do is another matter. 
I understand the problems that the Senator has with the defense budget. I have as many concerns as he does with the top line number of defense. I think we are at a very tight defense budget for this year. I serve as a subcommittee chairman on the Armed Services Committee, and I understand the tough choices that have to be made. 
I do not have as big a budget to oversee in my authorization. I have about $9 billion to oversee. But I have to make tough choices, and sometimes projects in Pennsylvania do not make it on there. They did not make it on there because they are not worthy projects, not because they are from Pennsylvania or from North Carolina or Texas or anywhere else. And I will assume and I will hope that the appropriations process is a similar one; that we look at the merits of the projects that are on there being requested by the Department and we sort it out on the basis of merit. 
That is what I will continue to do and that is what I hope the Appropriations Committee will continue to do. It is a tough job. The resources are very slim. I accept what the Senator from Alaska is saying, that if we adopt this amendment, it will make that job somewhat tougher to do--next year by the tune of about $1.6 billion, and the following year $391 million, and then it sort of trails off to a couple million. But I understand that is a difficult task. 
The point we are trying to make is, we did not require you to do it this year because you are halfway through the budget year and it would be very difficult to reprogram that money having been put in a cycle where you had a certain expectation of money, you spent to that level, so you spent half your money and then you are basically taking savings out of the last half of the money that is there, which requires a commensurately higher percentage of cuts than the overall amount. 
So I understand that problem. That is why we tried to avoid that problem by saying, if you spend the money this year, you do not have to reprogram it. You can declare the emergency and you can spend it above the budget level. 
I find it somewhat curious that the Senator from Alaska would 
attack our amendment by saying it creates an incentive to spend the money unwisely this year and that he opposes this amendment because we are going to have money being forced out of the pipeline prematurely so it can be spent on an emergency basis as opposed to being kept under the caps in future years. 
The only reason we have released the pressure valve, if you will, for this year is because we know the objections that the Senator from Alaska would have if we put the caps on it this year. He would be opposed to it, I suspect, even more vociferously if we made the relevant departments stay within the caps every year as opposed to just future years. So I am not too sure that is necessarily a valid argument. 
The bottom line here is very simple. What we are suggesting is to take the money that we know is going to be there for the surplus and use it for Social Security, not for emergency spending, particularly given the fact that I understand from the cloakroom there is another $1.6 billion to throw on top of this bill. It is going to be spent out over the next few years, money that the President has just asked for. 
I have voted against disaster bills in the past. In fact, I stood on the floor of the Senate just a few years ago and said I would vote against a disaster bill when most of the money for that bill was going to Pennsylvania--my State. And I said I would do so unless we did something to make sure that that money was offset within the budget, because I feel it is that important. I think there is not truth in budgeting with this administration and with our budgets in the past when it comes to disaster assistance. We chronically have this problem that we do not appropriate enough money. 
Again, I do not point to Senator Bond and his subcommittee as the problem. I point down to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue to a President who just willy-nilly, in many cases, declares items eligible for assistance and expands the definition beyond what congressional intent is as to what is covered. Not that he declares disasters willy-nilly. In fact, they are very serious disasters. But what should be and is eligible to be paid for by the Federal Government is, in fact, where I think we have a problem with this administration, which I think the Senator from Missouri, Mr. Bond, is attempting to correct. So I give credit to him. But we still have the problem. 
The problem has shown up in huge amounts of outlays that we spend every year on disasters because we continue to pay ever-increasing amounts from the Federal level on disasters around this country. That is a problem. All we are doing is allowing that spending to continue and not keeping within the discipline that we promised the American public. We promised, us right here in the Senate, we promised the American public that we would stand here and stick to our agreement, that we would not continue this stream of red ink, we would not just continue to spend money like there was no tomorrow, that we were going to put a budget agreement in concrete, we were going to stick to it, and, as a result of that, we would have surpluses, we would have a balanced budget, and we would have surpluses and, as a result, the economic prosperity that would come with that. 
Right here today we are just saying, oh, we didn't mean it. You know, we had an unexpected--not so unexpected--expense so we have to break the deal. We are going to break the deal. We are just going to say, fine, we are going to spend more. 
I am surprised there is just $1.6 billion more in the cloakroom ready to come down here to be spent. Let us throw in some more. I mean, this is open season. We have lied once. We have broken our promise once to the American public. We said we were going to keep the deal. Now we are not going to keep the deal. Why just 1.6 billion? Let us throw in a few more billion. Once you break it--I mean, it is like being a little bit pregnant--let us really have a party. Let us spend it all. Let us throw some more money down here and find out how much more we can throw on that we can consider an emergency that all we have to do is 
declare. We do not have to follow any law here. For those of you who think that there is a law that we follow that says `this is actually an emergency' and `this isn't an emergency'--no, no, no. We just have to say it is. That is all. We just say it is, and it is an emergency. 
So let us bring all the turkeys out. Let us start flying around and shooting everything around here. And, by the way, there is lots of stuff in here that is not emergency, just supplemental spending that we are just going to throw out here and say, `Well, we'll just include it in. It's something we really wanted to do. Couldn't fit it in last year's budget, may not be able to fit it in this year's budget. It's going to fly. It's going to pass and we can help out some of our Members.' It is just not the way we should do business.

That is what we will be putting money aside for. That is what we appropriate the money for in FEMA, for anticipated disasters and for spending on those disasters.

Mr. SANTORUM. I understand that. All I am saying is that money is going to be spent next year. That money is going to be spent next year. And in the appropriations bill that deals with 
these different accounts, we are saying we want to keep it under that cap, and that means to find money other places in the legislation, absolutely. That means that we are going to have to reduce other accounts to make sure we stay within those caps. 
This is about, in our opinion--I know the Senator from Texas agrees--controlling the growth, controlling Government spending. What we are doing is saying, there is in fact a budget that says there is so much to spend, and whether we declare an emergency or not we are going to stay within that. If we declare an emergency, we can spend the money for that particular purpose --fine--but it is still going to stay in the aggregate cap for our total spending. That is the point we are trying to make.

I think in our opinion it is $3.1 billion--no; less than that--it is $2.5 billion overall. And we are allowing this year's to go as an emergency. So I think $1.5 billion. So we can find $1.5 billion out of the next 5 years'--out of the next 5 years--spending. I think we can do that.

Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I rise today to talk about the issue that was going to be voted on tomorrow, the nomination of Judge Massiah-Jackson to the Eastern District Court of Pennsylvania. As you know, she withdrew her name today from consideration for that position. She did so, I believe, in light of the information that has come forward, the controversy surrounding her nomination, and what looked to be very little hope for that nomination to succeed here on the Senate floor. In fact, it has come to my attention that there would have been very strong bipartisan opposition to her nomination and the chances of it succeeding were not very good. So I think, under those circumstances, she decided to withdraw her name. 
For her sake, I think she did the right thing. I think she has acquitted herself, as an individual, very well and was very restrained under this rather arduous process she has gone through. I know it has been a very difficult time for her and her family. For that she has my empathy and my sympathy, for the difficult time that she had in what turned out to be a very prolonged process that somehow looked more like a Supreme Court nomination as opposed to an eastern district court nomination. That being said, I think it was the right thing for her to withdraw. As I said publicly last week, I was not going to be supportive of her nomination. 
All in all, what I tried to accomplish from the very beginning of this process was to give Judge Massiah-Jackson--as I would any person nominated from my State by President Clinton--the benefit of the doubt, No. 1, and, No. 2, a fair process--that she would have a fair process, or anybody would have a fair process, when it comes to the commission that I set up with Senator Specter to review judicial nominees or potential judicial nominees from all across Pennsylvania for the district courts. We have what I believe is a stellar commission that is made of terrific people who work very hard to review those nominees. They are, in fact, hamstrung, however, by the limited amount of information that they have. 
In the case of Judge Massiah-Jackson and others, they are given information, frankly, provided by the candidate--by the person who is interviewing for the position. There is--at least has been--very little done in the way of background checks beyond what the candidate provides or references given. If I can be self-critical here of that process, our process, I would say that probably has to change in the future, that we have to do a little better job of delving deeper into the background of some of the potential nominees for the court. So, in that sense, the process maybe didn't work as well as it should have. 
The second step in the process was the process of nomination by the President. Again, I suggest the President's process probably did not work as well as it should have, because a lot of information continues to come out. 
Even today more cases have come forward. 
The commission, in part, can take blame, but, in part, the White House has to take a little of the blame for not doing a thorough check of the record and finding these problems so these issues would not be coming up so late in the game, that we would have had all these issues before us when we were making the initial decision. In fact, it wasn't done, or, if it was done, it certainly was kept from me and other Members of the Senate until a very late date. So, again, the process, in a sense, failed. 
Having said all that, we had a nominee in the committee. The committee, I believe, gave Judge Massiah-Jackson a fair hearing at the time given the information that they had. Again, more information continued to come to light, some because, I suspect, it was difficult to ascertain; others, I don't know why. But information continued to come to light and information that, frankly, we had to look at. That was statistical evidence as to the judge's abilities in office, or potential abilities in office. 
Again, what I was striving for, for this nominee, as I do for all, is to give her a fair hearing, a fair process. That is why Senator Specter and I fought and persuaded the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, as well as the majority leader, to withhold any vote on the Senate floor, to allow Judge Massiah-Jackson to go back to committee after these more recent allegations came forward, to be able to respond--in a sense, almost redoing the process again and, in a sense, starting de novo from the second hearing to begin to set the record straight, if you will. 
In that regard, I thank Senator Lott for his willingness to stand by both Senator Specter and me in support of that second hearing. I think it has to be said that Senator Lott had the right--and, frankly, any other Member in this Chamber had the right--to come forward and ask to table her nomination. When the nomination was before the Senate, anyone could have come out here on the day when it was before the Senate and could have asked for that nomination to be tabled. We would have had a vote, and I think it would have been unfortunate and untimely at that point because she would not have been given an opportunity to respond, as many Members were passionate in opposition to her and felt there was no way by what she said or did at that hearing that she could redeem herself in their eyes. But they were willing to defer to both Senator Specter and myself and to the leader, and to Senator Hatch, to give her an opportunity to respond to her critics. 
In the end, she did not do so adequately. There were many issues brought up, and, to some, she was able to shed some light on some of the disconcerting information. In the end, at that hearing, she decidedly did not address the grave concerns that had been brought forward on a variety of different subjects, on a variety of different cases, a variety of extrajudicial activities that she was involved with in her courtroom. 
At that point, I think my sense was, while this process took longer than it should, and certainly the way in which this information came out and all the other oddities with respect to this nomination, I think, in the end, she was given the opportunity to address those issues. I do not believe she did so to the satisfaction--certainly she didn't to my satisfaction, and I don't think she did to a very strong bipartisan majority in the U.S. Senate to overcome the opposition of so many in my State. 
I received over 500 letters, the vast majority of which were in opposition to her nomination. I received letters from a variety of law enforcement agencies, as well as prosecutors and others in opposition, which I take very seriously. These are officers of the court who do not normally speak out on such issues. I have to take that kind of correspondence and that kind of communication very seriously. I thought they brought out some very relevant and cogent issues with respect to her nomination. I considered those. I wanted to give Judge Massiah-Jackson an opportunity to shed some light on those and perhaps change my perception of those issues. She did not do so in that hearing, in the final analysis. So, as a result, I announced late last week that I would end up opposing her nomination. I did so. 
It was a very difficult decision. It was very difficult for me to arrive at that decision, as I said earlier in my remarks. I wanted to give, as I do with all nominees of the President--they are not my nominees; they are not people I would have selected. I understand he is the President, opposite party, opposite philosophy. I don't expect him to appoint people I would appoint. So I provide a lot of latitude to his nominees, but within certain range, within certain bounds. 
In this case, while I tried to give the benefit of the doubt throughout the process, in the end, she was outside the bounds of what I believe to be reasonable conduct and temperament. As a result, I thought it better to oppose her nomination to be promoted to the Federal bench. 
I will say in closing, I wish Judge Massiah-Jackson well. I, again, have great sympathy for what she went through in the process. Even though Senator Specter and I tried to make it a fair process, it was, nonetheless, a difficult process, one that became somewhat national in scope. Certainly in the city of Philadelphia, it was a very contentious and, unfortunately, overpoliticized atmosphere surrounding this nomination. I understand the difficult time she went through. She, again, has my sympathy. 
In the end, the withdrawal of her nomination was probably the best thing for all concerned. 
Thank you, Madam President. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise to talk about an amendment being offered by Senator Specter, myself, and Senator Moseley-Braun to the transportation bill before us, the mass transit section. 
Over the past several years, when I was in the House and then here in the Senate, on the issue of welfare reform, one of the great concerns I had with putting time limits on welfare and requiring work was the ability of people, particularly in the inner city, urban areas, to be able to find job opportunities. We know that the urban core is not a job center and a lot of urban poor neighborhoods are not economically well off in the form of job creation. So people who live in these poor urban areas have to have some sort of transportation access to get to the jobs. It has worked in the past fairly well when from the urban neighborhoods outside the center of town--in many cases where the job centers were--people could hop on transportation, a bus, rail, whatever, and go into the downtown area for jobs. That had worked well in the tourism industry, hotel/motel, et cetera. A lot of those jobs are not particularly high skilled because a lot of the urban poor don't have a lot of job skills starting out. 
The problem with the current economy is that, in many cities, Philadelphia being one of them, the job creation boom is not taking place in the inner city; it's taking place in suburban corridors. In the case of Philadelphia, it is taking place in what's called the Route 202 corridor. In fact, we are not an anomaly. Two-thirds of all new jobs are being created in the suburbs. So you have a very odd situation happening. You have the dramatic increase in jobs; in fact, there is very low unemployment in most areas of the country. But there is still chronically high unemployment in the inner cities and, as a result of the new job creation happening in the suburbs, no transportation link for people in the urban neighborhoods out to the suburbs. Now, they can get to maybe a train station in the suburbs, or a bus station, as the bus that went into town for the commute comes back out of town. But they can't get from that station to their job, which may be in an industrial park somewhere. So that creates a real problem for the suburban business because the suburban business--and I have talked to a lot of suburban manufacturers who tell me they cannot find workers to get to their job sites. 
Yet, we have a great pool of workers in the inner city. So what Senator Specter and Senator Moseley-Braun and I have sponsored is an authorization of $100 million to be used to encourage and develop reverse commutes. It's a very flexible program. It's a program that says the money is designated by the Secretary, and the Secretary can accept bids from a variety of different regional organizations. The transit organizations, different communities, a whole variety of entities can apply, which will create a tremendous amount of, I believe, and a very positive competition for these dollars and will require innovative plans to get people to the workplace. I believe if we are going to follow through with our commitment of requiring work--and we are reaching that time now with the bill--and stating that there is a 5-year time limit on benefits where people are going to exhaust that 5-year period of time and they are going to lose their cash benefit--and if there is no opportunity for a job in their own neighborhood or there is no opportunity for a job within transit distance, then we are, in a sense, locking these people into a desperate situation. 
I don't think that was the intention of the U.S. Senate. It certainly wasn't my intention. So I believe that at least one of the keys to unlocking that situation is to create the opportunity to get out to the suburbs, to get out to where the job growth is occurring, and to provide a transportation network in the area of a reverse commute to do that. 
I hope that we will get strong bipartisan support for this initiative. This is something that is essential if we are going to follow through. I speak specifically to the Members on this side of the aisle, many of whom are not big fans of mass transit. But mass transit is the lifeblood for millions of people who live in urban America. Millions of people could not go to work; they can't own cars; they don't have the money; they can't afford it in many of the neighborhoods because of insurance rates and everything else, not just the cost of the car. Mass transit is the only way for these people to get to work, and it is essential for us to provide the link. Particularly in the time that we are going to be forcing people off the welfare rolls, it is essential for us to provide the link for those people to get to the job site. We are doing the right thing with welfare reform. We have done the right thing. But now we need to follow up and make sure that those people who want to work, who have in many cases worked hard to get the skills to get into the job market, now have the access to take those jobs. 
So I thank my colleagues, Senator Specter, Senator Moseley-Braun, and others who are supportive of this amendment. As I said, I hope that we can get very strong bipartisan support for this amendment to be added to the mass transit title. If we do not, then I think we are going to see a lot of big city mayors and a lot of activists descend upon Washington in a couple of years when that 5-year time limit is up, and they are going to say, `You are telling us to cut these people off and there are no jobs where they live, no jobs within commuting distance of where they live, and we can't do it.' Welfare reform will have failed. We can't let the transportation issue be the reason for that failure. This money will create incentives for businesses and other people in the suburbs and the city to create a network that doesn't exist now. Once that network is created, then I think we can begin to see, and, in many cases, employers will begin to see, the profitability of having this network in place. I think this money will go a long, long way in inspiring and instituting these kinds of plans. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I support the McConnell amendment. I believe the constitutional arguments are persuasive. As a member of the Renewal Alliance, I must say that the substitute or the replacement program Senator McConnell put forward is a step in the right direction. I disagree with Senator McCain, who said it is not sufficient. I believe it is. It is, in fact, a good step. 
Also, if we are able to not table the McConnell amendment, I will be working with Senators Abraham and Coats to see if we can do more, in fact, to put an agenda in place that really will do something for economically disadvantaged areas, and particularly urban areas in this country, so we can in fact create more hope and opportunity in those neighborhoods. That is really the ultimate goal, and I think the McConnell amendment begins to go in that direction.

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, this amendment codifies a time line for the Administrator to promulgate final designations under the new ozone and PM standards. Is it the Senator's intention that areas in violation because they are heavily impacted by dirty air from other states should be `held harmless' in the interim period or not be penalized with more air-pollution controls by being `bumped up' to a higher nonattainment status?

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered by my colleague from Oklahoma, Senator Inhofe. 
The Senator's amendment will ensure that federal funding is available to construct and operate a nationwide monitoring system for fine particles, and it will allow future designation decisions to be based on three complete years of monitoring data. The amendment would also provide Governors with two years to consider regional transport issues prior to submitting new ozone redesignations. 
This amendment will not, as some opponents may contend, roll back or delay the new standards. On the contrary, the amendment does not change the new standards and adheres to the President's own time table for achieving them. In fact, this amendment may actually strengthen the new standards by establishing a legally certain schedule for putting them into place. Moreover, this amendment is critically important because it will make sure that future Clean Air Act designations will be based on actual air quality data rather than guesswork and extrapolation. In view of the anticipated costs associated with meeting the new standards, we must take this very simple step. 
Last summer, when the President announced new air quality standards for soot and smog, he also promised that the Federal Government would work closely with states and local communities to implement these standards in a fair, flexible and cost-effective manner. For many communities in Pennsylvania, the imposition of new standards has been a very bitter pill to swallow, but the promised implementation plan has offered a spoonful of sugar to help the medicine go down. While the President's pledge has been appreciated, it is my view that this amendment is necessary in order to give states and communities reassurance that the promised implementation plan will be followed. Thank you, and I urge the adoption of this amendment.

 Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a very special group of young men from one of the oldest African American Boy Scout units in the nation. On February 7, 1998, eleven members of Troop 358 were officially honored as Eagle Scouts. 
Troop 358, sponsored by Grace Baptist Church of Germantown, Pennsylvania, has a proud tradition of achievement. In 45 years, Troop 358 has produced a total of 33 Eagle Scouts--including this year's class. To put this in perspective, consider that only 2.5 percent of the nation's 4.5 million scouts ever become Eagle Scouts. Moreover, only about 1 percent of African American scouts reach this goal. 
Eagle Scouts learn valuable lessons in leadership, honor, and pride in their communities. In fact, the community service projects that the Scouts completed to earn their badges are as extraordinary as the young men themselves. For instance, one new Scout set up a workshop for inner city kids who wanted to prepare for the Scholastic Aptitude Test. Another young man wrapped up his Eagle service project painting a school. Still another ploughed through months of paperwork to complete 8 of his 29 merit badges in one week. 
Mr. President, these 11 new Eagle Scouts--Jarrett Coger, Jerece Barnes, Askia Fluellen, Bruce Frazier, Andre Kydd, Jared LeVere, Sean Long, Kyle McIntosh, Robert Redding, Ernest Stanton and Anwar White--are a credit to their families and to their scoutmasters, A. Bruce Frazier and Charles M. Whiting. They are also living tributes to the late Earl Grayson, who led Troop 358 through both good and bad times for 36 years. 
In closing, I ask my colleagues to join me in extending the Senate's best wishes for continued success to the new Eagle Scouts and to all those who have sustained Troop 358 over its 45 year history.

Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, first, I commend the job that the Senator from Kentucky, Senator McConnell, has done this year on this debate, today on this debate, and for his stalwart defense of the first amendment. 
Let me make a couple of comments about the Snowe-Jeffords amendment and then move on to more general debate. 
First, let me say about my colleague Senator Snowe, she is constantly here in the U.S. Senate trying to find areas to bring people together to try to solve problems and issues that she has concerns about. She has worked tirelessly, I know, on this and on a variety of other issues to try to find common ground and make things work. I commend her in her effort. I don't agree with the approach she has taken, but I think it is a sincere and honest attempt to meet what she perceives is a great problem in this country. We just happen to disagree on what the problem is, and, thereby, the solution she perceives doesn't meet up with what I see as the problem. We see a different problem. 
The Senator from North Dakota, maybe unwittingly, said something which I think is exactly the way those who want to restrict the first amendment--to restrict speech--see speech, as other than speech of the candidate. He said, and I am fairly sure I wrote it down at the time, he said, `Those who want to interfere with Federal elections.' I just found that remarkable. `Those who want to interfere with Federal elections,' as if the election between me and the guy or lady I am running against is 
really just the two of us and anybody else who wants to speak is interfering with our election: How dare you interfere with my election. Really, that is what this is all about. 
If I was just concerned about me and my election, I would vote for the Snowe-Jeffords amendment. It is a great thing for me, because what it says is the labor unions, who are going to be salivating to run nasty ads against me in my election, can't do so. That would be a wonderful break for me. And the other groups that want to get together and run nasty, horrible things about me--and I am sure they can find nasty, horrible things to say about everybody in this Chamber--can't do so. That is a wonderful thing for me. 
I would like this to apply to the newspapers and everybody else so nobody can criticize me and I can get up and say what I want and the other guy can say what he or she wants. That is fine; it is just the two of us. But that is not the way democracy works, nor should it work that way. 
I think the problem this amendment tries to address is a nonexistent problem. The problem is, as the Senator from North Dakota eloquently said, that they believe there are too many people interfering with our elections. I don't believe there are too many people. I think that is part of the public discourse. It is something I don't like. When my kids see a nasty thing about their daddy on television, I don't like them to see it. Their mom doesn't like to see it. My parents don't like to see it. But I am going to defend on the floor of the U.S. Senate to my dying day the right to say it, because that is how democracy works best. 
When plenty of people interfere with the election, the more people we can get to interfere the better, because the public is then heard. It is not always pleasant, not always to my advantage, certainly, but it is important to be heard. 
So I stand up today and say, yes, labor unions should be able to run ads, they should be able to run ads right up until the day of the election and voice for their members who voluntarily contribute to their PAC their concerns about issues and their concerns about the candidates for election. It is their right to do so. In fact, I believe it is their obligation to do so. 
On the broader issue of the McCain-Feingold bill or the Snowe-Jeffords amendment and others, what they try to do is put up roadblocks. What this reminds me of is a tax bill. You say, `How does this remind you of a tax bill?' Do you know what it does when Congress passes a tax bill? What it does is employ a lot of lawyers and accountants to figure out ways to try to beat the bill, because this is what it is about. We put up little roadblocks here and there to catch money to fill in the cracks to fill our coffers. That is how the tax bills work, to try to plug these loopholes or get rid of this subsidy, or whatever, that was `unintended.' 
That is pretty much what they are saying. These were `unintended things.' We didn't want all this speech out there, so we just need to plug the loopholes. By plugging the loopholes, all you do is put a lot of smart people to work figuring out how to beat it. That is how soft money was created. Soft money was created because we have a limit on how much money you can give directly to a candidate. 
In Pennsylvania, we have Governor races and attorneys general races, statewide races. There is no soft money in Pennsylvania. You don't need soft money in Pennsylvania. If you want to contribute to a candidate, you can give any amount you want. It is reported, everybody knows about it, but there is no need to give money to XYZ organization to indirectly spend the money on something to benefit the candidate. You can give it directly to the candidate. 
The reason soft money has grown in importance is because we have a limit of $1,000 per person in each election cycle set 25 years ago. I can tell you some have suggested inflation has tripled during that timeframe. I can tell you campaigns have probably gone up tenfold or more in expense during that timeframe, and we have kept the contribution limit the same, thus the need for 
some way around the system. The original campaign finance reform put barriers in place, and so smart people figured out how to get around the barriers. 
We can stand up here and say, `Oh, well, we need to plug this loophole and we need to stop here.' All we are going to do is create some other legal fiction out there to walk their way around it, in so doing, hiding from the public people's participation in the process. 
The greatest campaign finance reform we can do is dramatically increase the limits on contributions. Do you want to solve in great measure soft money? Do you want to solve independent expenditures and all those other things? Dramatically increase at least three or fourfold the amount an individual can give directly to the candidate, increase the disclosure of that amount so it has to be much more prompt than it is today, and I will tell you what you are going to do. Soft money will be a thing of the past. Oh, there will still be some around here and there, but it will not be the big factor that everybody thinks it is now, because the money will go directly to the candidate. I guarantee it. That is where they want it to go now, but it can't go there, so they find the loophole. I guarantee you, if you plug one loophole, another one will come along, if, in fact, the Court allows you to plug the loophole in the first place, which I don't believe it will. 
So we have well-intentioned people here who see this as a problem of money, too much money. I hear this when I go back home: `Don't Members of Congress spend all this time raising money?' I might be wrong, maybe Senator McConnell has a number on this, maybe we have taken a survey within the Senate, but I would bet that roughly half the Members of the U.S. Senate don't pick up the phone and raise money as a rule. Maybe Members won't pick up the phone and raise money. They hire people to do that. 
I occasionally pick up the phone and raise money. I probably do so more than most. Usually, I am not raising it for me; I am trying to raise it for other folks back home who need help or other Senators running in other places, and I try to help them out. But I will tell you, if it takes at most a half hour out of the week--at most a half an hour out of the week--that is a busy week on average for me raising money. If you find that to be too much time on the phone raising money, I would beg to differ with you. I can think of lots of things I can do for a half hour a week that is a greater waste of time than raising money on a telephone, that I could use my time more productively. 
Again, we sort of prop up these straw figures and say, `Here is the problem, here is the problem; there is too much money.' 
I think democracy is important, I think what we do here is important, and I think people should have a right to express their opinion. Yes, people can go out on the street corner and talk all they want, but if nobody hears them, that really isn't very effective speech. 
I don't think we should put any limits on people being able to take out a newspaper ad or to sign onto an Internet provider and post something up on a bulletin board somewhere saying, `Rick Santorum voted the wrong way on this, and you folks who are concerned about [whatever issue] should know this.' I think that is fine. I don't like it, but I think it is fine. 
It is essential--it is essential--for us to be accountable to the people. What we are trying to do with all these restrictions and all these limits is isolate the people. I hear this talk that this is not about speech; this is about power. I agree. There is no comment--I heard it yesterday--there is no comment I agree with more. You are right; this is about power. It is where the power is going to rest, in the citizens of the United States, or the power is going to rest right here or in the boardrooms of NBC, ABC and all the other affiliates and newspapers and media outlets around the country, because that is where the power is going to go if things like McCain-Feingold and other measures pass. 
They are going to go out--this great sucking sound; that is a common thing we hear now--it is going to come out of your ability to speak and right into the corporate boardrooms that own media outlets. 
Senator Roberts was absolutely right, the reason the media is foursquare behind this is because when they shut you up, their voice becomes more important. It is as simple as that. If you can't speak, what they write in their newspapers becomes much more important, because it is one of fewer things out there. It is not overstating the fact, the case, that this debate is central to democracy in this country, 
and that those who, well-intentioned as they are, want to solve the money problem, it is not by muzzling people in the process. Give people the right to speak and democracy will be just fine. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise to continue the discussion on the judge of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, Judge Massiah-Jackson. Within the past 24 hours, I and Senator Specter have been talking to the majority leader, to the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, to those who are in opposition to her nomination in an attempt to resolve a lot of issues. And what Senator Specter and I have referred to, to complete this process of consideration in what we believe is the only fair way to do so, is to have an additional hearing for her to be able to respond to the information that has been presented so publicly now to the Congress and the Senate with respect to her nomination. 
The majority leader is intending to come down in the next 15, 20 minutes to make a statement, which I fully support, and I know Senator Specter supports, which will, in a sense, move this nomination aside for now and have this nominee be given the opportunity to appear before the Judiciary Committee and answer this new information, or respond to the questions of members of the Judiciary Committee. 
That is all I have been asking for since the leader scheduled this nomination. I am hopeful that after we go out on recess next week, there will be scheduled a Judiciary Committee meeting for people who have provided the information to present that information formally to the committee, be questioned by committee members, and then for Judge Massiah-Jackson to have the opportunity to answer the charges that have been leveled against her. 
That will complete, in my mind, the process of fair consideration. 
Her nomination will remain here on the floor. It will remain on the Executive Calendar, and subsequent to the hearing, the majority leader will call the nomination up for a vote at that time. 
That is, again, all I have been requesting from the leader--is to give this process time to play out, fairness dictating the order of the day, and then give the Senate the opportunity to pass judgment as to whether we believe that she should be a judge in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. 
So I see this as a very favorable resolution of what I have been asking for in the past 24 hours. 
I thank the majority leader for his patience. This has been somewhat of a difficult ordeal having to juggle all the different sides on this issue. 
I thank the chairman of the Judiciary Committee for his willingness to hold another hearing. He knows that he has not been formally requested to do so by the Senate but has volunteered to make the committee available to further give Judge Massiah-Jackson the opportunity to respond to this new information that has been provided. 
Mr. President, I know the Senator from Missouri has more to say on this nomination. He is ready to go. So I yield the floor. 
Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I just want to thank the majority leader, again, for his willingness to cooperate with both Senator Specter and me in our request that Judge Massiah-Jackson's nomination not be voted on here in the next few days but that the process be able to be worked out and worked through, a hearing to be held. I know Senator Specter, who cannot be here right now, fully supports this process that we now have begun to get her a hearing in the Judiciary Committee. And then I hope very promptly to bring her back to the floor of the U.S. Senate for a vote. 
I would not like to see this nomination hang out for a long period of time after the hearing. I don't think that would be fair, again, to her or to the process, or to the President who I know, in having conversations with the White House, they would like to see this matter be dealt with in an expeditious fashion after the hearing takes place. A hearing will not be able to take place until the week after next because we are not in session next week. So I am hopeful we can bring this judge up for a final vote here in the U.S. Senate within a 3-week period of time, maybe a 4-week period of time. I think that would be appropriate for her and I think appropriate for the Senate at some point to pass judgment on this nominee. I think it is important when the President puts a nominee up who has had, certainly, the amount of attention that this nominee has had, that the Senate, all Members, get an opportunity to express their opinion as to whether this nominee has the credentials and qualifications and qualities necessary to serve on the Federal judiciary. 
With that, I again thank the majority leader and thank my colleagues for allowing this procedure. There are things that could have been done. I talked to several of my colleagues about those things that could be done. The Senator from Missouri and others would have liked to vote today. In fact they could force a vote today. It is within the right of any Senator on this nomination to offer a tabling motion, which would bring the debate to a stop and cause a vote. They have agreed to not do that and I appreciate that very much. 
They could have derailed this effort. But their indulgence in allowing what two home State Senators believe is a fair process, their indulgence in allowing what we believe to be a fair process, in acquiescing to those desires, is noble indeed and very much appreciated. So I thank the Senators from Alabama, Missouri, and others who have expressed a willingness to expedite consideration of this nominee, for their willingness to withhold and allow the process to work out just a few more weeks. And then take the nominee back to the floor. 
There will be no vote in committee. She will not be recommitted to committee. There will be no action necessary by the committee. Her nomination will remain on the floor of the U.S. Senate and will be eligible to be recalled by the leader at his discretion, 
which is our understanding, subsequent to the hearing in the Judiciary Committee. 
So that is the state of play, if you will, of this nomination, and it is one I find wholly acceptable at this point. I know my colleague, Senator Specter, does also.

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise to support what seems to be a growing notion on the floor that we not vote on this nominee today, that we take an opportunity for the sake of fairness to give Judge Massiah-Jackson the opportunity to respond to the new information provided by the district attorneys association. 
I had to leave the floor for the past few minutes, and I missed most of the remarks of my colleague from Pennsylvania. There were some folks from Core State who wanted to talk about the Core State-First Union merger which is a very important issue in my state. I have been informed that Senator Specter went through some of the history of how this nomination came to this point, and I think it serves us well to understand that this information has come out late, that the opportunity was made available to anyone to not only testify in Philadelphia--Senator Specter and myself and Senator Biden held a hearing in Philadelphia to seek information, as well as the Judiciary Committee held its hearing. Information could have been provided. 
I must admit that for a period of several months prior to the nominee coming up before the committee I was provided a whole bunch of information slid under the door, thrown over the transom, but not information that was in fact stood behind by anybody willing to come forward and say this is what the record indicates and go on the record. It led me to have some very serious concerns about the nominee, but, as Senator Hatch said, I am not going to make a 
decision on a judge based on information that someone is not willing to stand up in the public light and testify to. Senator Specter and I have a joint committee that reviews nominees to be district court judges in Pennsylvania. We both have an equal number of representations--a bipartisan committee. They review the qualifications of a judge, basically resume and other kinds of information. In fact, we ask several questions of the judge, but the judge provides us with the information, and we make a decision based on that information we receive. Judge Massiah-Jackson was approved by that commission. As a result, my policy is to support anybody who gets approved by the commission and then subsequently nominated by the President, to support that nominee's right to come out of committee and come to the floor of the Senate. I have on occasion not too long ago actually held judges and objected to judges being considered by the committee and coming to the floor of the Senate from the State of Pennsylvania because the commission that Senator Specter and I have did not find that individual to be qualified. They did find Judge Massiah-Jackson to be qualified. Therefore, I agreed to support her through this process until it reached the floor. 
I always left open the opportunity, and still do, to judge as to whether I believe that person should be finally approved by the Senate. In the case of Judge Massiah-Jackson I have very serious concerns that she is in fact going to be a good judge on the Eastern District in Pennsylvania. The charges that have been put forward by the district attorneys association and others I think are very serious. The cases you have heard from Senator Hatch and I know others will be talking about today raise very serious concerns about her respect for law enforcement and her treatment of criminals on both her record as far as a finder of fact in nonjury trials as well as her sentencing as a result of being the finder of fact. 
So those things I have very grave concerns about, but having said all that I don't think it is fair for the Senate to move forward and vote on a nominee who has not had the opportunity to respond. I just think that would be unprecedented. These allegations, unfortunately, came in at the last minute, came in almost after the last minute. Judge Massiah-Jackson actually almost was approved before we left at the end of last year but an objection was raised by two Senators for that approval. Otherwise, she would have been approved by unanimous consent here. Two Senators objected to that approval. It was only after that--in fact not immediately after that because that happened in November. It was 2 months later that this information came out--not 2 months but almost 2 months later that this information came out in a letter from the district attorney of Philadelphia and the neighborhood who voiced her concern and her opposition and obviously the district attorneys association followed suit, or I guess about the same time came forward and said they objected. Subsequently, the fraternal order of police in Philadelphia objected, then the State and then the national. So we had this sort of drip, drip, drip of opposition come out, and I am not questioning whether it is legitimate or not. 
These are, obviously, very important substantive issues, but I must admit I am a bit concerned and bothered by the fact it came out at such a late time and in such a, I think, unprofessional fashion. We needed to have this information before the committee when the committee brought her nomination up for confirmation. It was only fair to the judge to do that. And I think these allegations coming out at the time they are have not been fair to her, so I think for the Senate to move forward at this point would be an additional unfairness to this candidate. And so I would encourage my colleague, the Senator from Utah, as well as the Senator from Vermont, Senator Leahy, to coordinate, whether we have to do it by some formal action in the Senate or preferably by some informal action, that we delay this nominee today, give her the opportunity to come before the Judiciary Committee and have an opportunity to be heard and to respond to these allegations, and 
they are serious, but I frankly think the more serious the more I feel compelled to give her the opportunity to respond. If they were not so serious, then I would say, well, let's just move forward. But the fact they are serious I think fairness requires her to come before the committee and give her accounting of these fact situations. 
And what are they? Well, 50 cases have been brought to our attention here in the last few weeks, 50 cases that have been delivered to us for the last year in which she was a judge. I believe she was a criminal court judge about 7 years. I could be wrong by a half year or so. The last year they went through her records and of 400 some cases, they pulled 50 to show what they believe is conduct that shows a disrespect for the rule of law and a very soft approach on crime. 
I must admit I have read the summaries of all 50 of those cases and I am troubled by not all of them but certainly most of them. I also understand that is the synopsis of the district attorneys association as to what the facts were in the cases, and I would think it is only fair that we hear what the judge's perspective is as to what the facts at least alleged in these summaries are before we make the decision in the Senate. 
And so again I think on that count the judge deserves an opportunity. Other information has been brought forward as to her sentencing record. Again, that was somewhat reviewed by the committee. They are taking a little different angle. But these are nuances that I think are important, when it comes to sentencing, she have an opportunity to provide at least some light on the subject. 
There is the issue of her acquittal rate. According to the district attorneys association, her acquittal rate is much higher than the average judge. When I say acquittal rate, acquittal when she sits as finder of fact in a nonjury trial--that her rate of acquittal is higher than the average rate of acquittal, on all charges I might add, on all charges of the average judge in Philadelphia. In fact, in the last 4 years it is three times the rate of the average judge in Philadelphia. Again, I am not an expert in the way the court system functions in Philadelphia. I don't know what division of the court she was sitting in. I don't know what that means. Is it maybe as the result of the kind of cases she was hearing? I think those are important questions we have to ask her and, frankly, ask the district attorneys association or the district attorney of Philadelphia at a hearing so we can understand in a little broader picture what the facts are with respect to her acquittal rate. 
So those are just some of the things that while on the face of it I must admit are troubling and may continue to be troubling if the response, Judge Massiah-Jackson's responses are not satisfactory, I think the opportunity to respond is imperative. 
So I rise to support what hopefully will be the order of the day here which is to give everyone an opportunity to be heard but hopefully then give Judge Massiah-Jackson the opportunity to be heard. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I want to associate myself with the remarks of my colleague from Pennsylvania. I too feel that we here in the Senate, when it comes to justice, really should be jurors, and that we should get all the information. The information shared, I think, as correctly stated by my colleague from Pennsylvania and by the Senator from Alabama, was well presented. But that is information that we received from the District Attorneys Association opposed to her nomination, without any rebuttal or explanation from Judge Massiah-Jackson. I will admit that some of those cases I find it hard to find out what a good explanation would be. But that is not for me to prejudge, nor as a juror should you prejudge those things. 
So I am willing to listen. I think she needs to be given an opportunity. 
The leader has not been on the floor since we brought up this nomination. I am not too sure that we are going to get a resolution today as to how to proceed with her nomination. But I am hopeful that either this evening or sometime tomorrow we will be able to come up with a plan on how we are going to proceed with her nomination and have her nomination received in a fair fashion. 
Again, I respect her. I think Senator Hatch and Senator Leahy mentioned that a hearing by the Judiciary Committee would accord the judge an opportunity to face this new information and respond to it, and give the police and the prosecutorial community an opportunity to present such evidence and such testimony to the committee that they believe is important for us to consider. 
So I hope that a full committee hearing goes through, if necessary. I am not on the committee. So I can charge them with whatever I please because I don't have to sit through it; but at least take a number of these cases as a representative sampling of these cases and go through them one by one and make a determination as to the justification that Judge Massiah-Jackson had in making these decisions. 
So I am hopeful that that is the next order of business, that somehow or other we can come to some accommodation with the leader, who I know wants to vote on this nominee as quickly as possible in response to the President's urgings of up-or-down votes on his judges. I know that many here, as you heard, would like to vote on this judge today. We are not going to vote on this judge today. Senator Specter and I don't want to vote on this judge today, and I believe there are many Members on the other side of the aisle who don't want to vote on this judge today. But we would like the judge to be given a chance and then to have a vote. Let's let the string run out, if you will, give her an opportunity to respond, have a vote somewhat promptly thereafter, and then let the Senate act as the jury, which we know it is very good at doing. 
Mr. President, with that I will yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a distinguished public servant upon his retirement as President Judge of the Philadelphia Traffic Court. Born and raised in Philadelphia, Charles Cuffeld devoted his life to the city. Charles will be sincerely missed not only for the vision and leadership he brought to his office, but also for his integrity and character. 
On December 24, 1991, Governor Robert Casey appointed Charles President Judge of the Philadelphia Traffic Court. Charles became the first African-American President Judge to serve in either the Traffic Court or the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Prior to this appointment, he had served as an elected Traffic Court judge since 1982. 
Early in his tenure, President Judge Cuffeld established goals to improve the Court's productivity, increase public accessibility, and foster public respect for the law. Most would agree that great strides were achieved in each of these areas. For instance, President Judge Cuffeld modernized the Court's operations. Internal communication was enhanced through technological improvements. A clear chain of command was established for the Traffic Court departments. Supervisors were educated on personnel regulations. Several departments were reorganized, and employees were cross-trained in all departments. Even the judges were sent to annual training and recertification programs. Likewise, the Traffic Court under President Judge Cuffeld developed working relationships with other law enforcement agencies, interdepartmental units, and the local media. Other initiatives made Traffic Court more accessible. Expanded payment operations, night court, motion court, and outreach court, in which surrounding neighborhood police stations hosted Traffic Court, were among these important programs. Finally, President Judge Cuffeld strengthened traffic law enforcement programs. In fact, some initiatives have been so successful that Canadian and other foreign officials have expressed interest in duplicating them. 
Beyond his judicial service, Charles has participated in many community-oriented organizations. He has served on the Mayor's Office of Community Services Advisory Board and the Boy Scouts Unity District Council. Currently, Charles is a member of the Salvation Army Advisory Board and a Director of Concerned Black Men, Inc. I am also very proud to note that Charles serves on my own Military Academy Review Board. 
An even more revealing testament of Charles' commitment to public service is the fact that organizations across the political and ideological spectrum have honored him. Both the V.F.W. and the N.A.A.C.P. named him Man of theYear. For outstanding community service, he received a Congressional Certificate of Merit. He is a two-time recipient of the Governor of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Highway Safety Award. WCAU-TV Channel 10 presented him the Spirit of Philadelphia News Award. He has received a Certificate of Appreciation from the Philadelphia Police Department. Finally, Charles has also been honored with the North Philadelphia Youth Investment Award. 
In closing, Mr. President, Charles Cuffeld set a new standard for the Philadelphia Traffic Court. He worked to raise awareness of the law, to enforce the law, and to bring justice to the people. During his tenure as President Judge, Charles bought the same passion for the law to his work as an administrator. He skillfully modernized the court, handled personnel matters, ensured his judges kept up to date on legal developments, and improved communication operations. Equally important is the care and compassion he has shown for the community. Charles is the product of hard work, focused determination, and a strong sense of civic responsibility. He is a fine role model for those who have been fortunate enough to know him. As President Judge Charles Cuffeld retires from public life, I ask my colleagues to join me in extending the Senate's best wishes to him and his family.

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that will phase out the peanut quota program over 6 years, with the quota system being eliminated beginning in crop year 2002. I am joined in this effort by my colleague from New Jersey, Mr. Lautenberg, as well as other original cosponsors. 
Under our legislation, the price support for peanuts grown for edible consumption is gradually reduced each year from the current support price of $610 per ton to $445 per ton by 2001. In the year 2002 and ensuing years, there would be no quotas on peanuts and the Secretary of Agriculture would be required to make non-recourse loans available to all peanut farmers at 85 percent of their estimated market value, consistent with the non-recourse loan program available for other agricultural commodities. In year 2002, and thereafter, the non-recourse loan is capped at the current world price of $350 per ton. 
In determining quotas for the crop years 1998 through 2001, the Secretary would be required to consult with representatives of the entire industry. The Secretary would also be required to consider stocks in Commodity Credit Corporation's inventory at the beginning of the new crop year as well as a reasonable carryover to permit orderly marketing at the end of the crop year. 
The bill also authorizes the complete sale, lease or transfer of poundage quotas across county and state lines. It abolishes the current limitation that now restricts sales, leases, and transfers to no more than 40 percent of the total poundage quota in the county within a state. 
Under current law, additional peanuts (those produced in excess of the farmers' poundage quota) may only be sold for export or crushing. The bill would permit additional peanuts to also be used for sale to the Department of Defense, as well as to other federal, state or local government agencies, including for use in the school lunch program. 
Mr. President, the federal peanut program is an anachronism. Born in the 1930's during an era of massive change and dislocation in agriculture, the program is sorely out of place in today's vibrant agricultural sector. While other farm commodities are seeking new export opportunities abroad, building new markets and helping to improve our national balance of trade; the peanut industry is building new barriers to protect its rapidly diminishing industry. Certainly imports are a factor, but the true threat to America's peanut farmer is the very quota system that he so stubbornly protects. Industry statistics show that the quota program is causing the demand for peanuts to fall sharply. The quota system stifles freedom for farmers, and it fosters a set of economic expectations that cannot be sustained without continued government intervention. Moreover, failure to reform this program costs consumers $500 million annually, and adds to the cost of feeding programs for low-income Americans. 
This program must be changed. As sponsors of this measure, however, my colleagues and I recognize that the peanut program cannot be repealed overnight. That is why we are proposing a fair transition period to enable farmers and lenders to adjust their expectations to the marketplace. Following completion of the phase-out period, the peanut program will operate like most other agricultural commodities. 
I am pleased that Senators DeWine, Chafee, Coats, Gregg, and Feingold have joined Senator Lautenberg and I as original sponsors of this measure, and I encourage my colleagues to support swift enactment of this important legislation.

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise to offer a measure to revise the Honey Research, Promotion and Consumer Information Act, the statute under which the National Honey Board is organized. 
Briefly, my bill would impose a penny per pound assessment on handlers and importers of honey. This will increase the research budget of the Honey Board by approximately $500,000; and enable the industry to fund research programs aimed at addressing the serious problems caused by viruses, parasitic mites, and Africanized bees. 
The bill also changes the constitution of the National Honey Board to improve packer representation on the board to reflect the imposition of a new assessment on honey handlers. Under my amendments, packers would have a total of four seats versus the current two. Producer and importer representation on the board will not change. 
In developing my legislation, I worked the American Beekeeping Federation, which represents more than 1,400 honey producers nationwide. The amendments have the support of a broad coalition including producers, packers, and importers, and I encourage my colleagues to join me in this effort by approving this legislation.

 Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the Chester-Wallingford chapter of the American Red Cross. The third oldest Red Cross chapter in the United States, this organization will, in 1998, celebrate 100 years of continuous service to the community. 
With 400 volunteers and 4 staff members, the Chester-Wallingford Chapter carries out the Red Cross's mission of `providing relief to victims of disasters and helping people prevent, prepare for, and respond to emergencies.' Following disasters, the Red Cross supplies victims with groceries, clothing, temporary housing, transportation, and medicine. Blood drives are another important initiative. Every 2 seconds, somebody needs a blood transfusion. The Chester-Wallingford chapter proudly helps satisfy this need by providing thousands of gallons of blood to area hospitals. As members of our Nation's Armed Forces serve overseas, the Red Cross facilitates communication between the soldiers and their families. Other public services provided by this organization include first aid, CPR, and swimming lessons. 
The Chester-Wallingford chapter has helped soldiers and veterans of WWI, WWII, Korea, Vietnam, and Desert Storm in times of need. The Red Cross has provided financial assistance to servicemen and servicewomen for emergency travel, health needs, and in some cases, burial assistance. Likewise, dedicated workers and volunteers have helped many veterans settle benefit claims. Finally, the Chester-Wallingford chapter has provided numerous supportive services to patients in VA hospitals. 
Mr. President, I commend the Chester-Wallingford chapter of the American Red Cross for its commitment to the people of southeastern Pennsylvania. I ask my colleagues to join me in extending the Senate's best wishes for continued success to the staff and volunteers as they prepare to celebrate the chapter's centennial.

 Mr. SANTORUM. I rise today to congratulate the Defense Industry Initiative on Business Ethics and Conduct for its 11 years of active effort in creating high standards of business ethics, business conduct, and compliance in the defense industry. I know that many of my colleagues in the Senate are not familiar with the unique DII effort. 
In 1986, the DII was created as an outgrowth of the work of the President's Blue Ribbon Commission on Defense Management, known as the Packard Commission. At that time, a number of leading defense contractors drafted a set of DII Principles. These Principles obligated signatory companies to have written codes of conduct, to distribute the codes to all of their employees, to have ethics training programs which made certain that employees understood the codes, to have a hotline or ombudsman system, to have systems to make voluntary disclosures of violations of law or regulation to the Government, to attend annual best practices forums, and to participate in a public accountability process. 
The group of DII signatory companies has grown over these 11 years to 48 companies, including virtually all of the largest defense contractors. To be frank, I would think that at least all of our hundred largest defense contractors should be willing to sign up publicly to the Defense Industry Initiative Principles. Therefore, I call upon those companies that are among this group which, for whatever reason, are not presently signatories to sign this statement in order to pledge themselves to the Defense Department and to the public as being committed to these ideals. 
On June 5 and 6, 1997, in Washington, DC, the DII conducted its 12th Best Practices Forum. This session included some 160 representatives of the signatory companies and 40 senior Government officials. The program was a state-of-the-art exploration of best practices in corporate ethics and compliance programs. 
I understand that the Defense Industry Initiative is the only industry ethics initiative of its type. There are any number of other industries which have had sufficient ethical problems and should consider something equivalent. 
I will conclude by saying that all the evidence available to me suggests that the participation of these 47 companies has had a very positive impact on their levels of compliance, as well as in the tone of the relationship with the Government. I am certain that we all recall the events that gave rise to the creation of the Packard Commission--things such as high price spare parts or improper labor charging. It is my understanding that the Government audits show that the level of such problems has dropped dramatically among these DII signatory companies. Furthermore, I believe that the DII effort has forged a true partnership in the best sense of the word between Government officials responsible for procurement and those in industry who design, develop, and manufacture the items necessary for our national defense. 
So that the contribution that has been made and the excellent work that has been done can be fully recognized, I would like to place into the Congressional Record a list of those companies which are signatories to the DII. All of these defense contractors are to be congratulated for the leadership they have shown and their accomplishments to date. I am sure that we can count on them to continue this exemplary work in the future. And I hope other defense contractors can be counted on to join this important effort.

Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Madam President. Hopefully this will provide an opportunity for the chairman to get some of the Members to the floor, and break up this discussion which is using all of your time. 
Let me first rise, having sat in the chair for the last hour. I listened to much of the debate. As someone who has been listening and who voted against NAFTA, someone who had some of the same concerns that the Senator from South Carolina voiced about the structure of the Government, judicial system, and other things, and as a result I felt very comfortable voting against NAFTA. But in the House I voted for fast track because I believe that it is important for us to continue to expand our trade horizons. We are not debating the trade agreement. We have seen lots of things about the trade deficit, balance of trade, and all of these other things. But that is not really at issue here because we are not debating a trade agreement. We are debating really a process--not an agreement. 
And the process is for the ability of the President to be able to sit down and negotiate a deal that is going to open up markets around the world, hopefully in South America. The Senator from South Carolina said he was ready to vote for an expansion of NAFTA to Chile possibly. We may have that opportunity. I don't think we get to that opportunity, which I think is an important one for this country, unless we have fast-track authority for this President. I would like to see the same frankly for Argentina and Brazil. I think it would be a tremendous opportunity for this country to expand our markets in the hemisphere to countries that are capable of competing on a fair basis with this country. Those are great opportunities for American workers as well as for better economic and diplomatic relationships between the countries in North and South America. 
So, I see this not only as economic but also as a cultural and diplomatic opportunity for us. But it does not happen unless we put the process in place for the President to negotiate these agreements. 
I know the Senator said there are lots of other agreements that have been negotiated. That is true. But these are major negotiations. These are negotiations that without a structure such as fast track I don't believe you are going to get an honest negotiation with one side sitting across from the other and saying, `Let's put together our best agreement. Let's work on give and take. You give. I give. We work on all of the details on how we structure a formalization of free trade between to two countries.' And say, `Oh, by the way, after I have given up some and you have given up some, and we have been able to negotiate as best we can to a final agreement, I am going to take it back to the Congress, and they can change it and put it all back in our favor.' 
I don't know of too many countries that are going to be willing to do that, who are going to be willing to sit down in the 
first place and say, `We are going to negotiate with you in good faith, and, by the way, your good faith means nothing because you cannot stand behind your word because the Congress can come, amend, and change what we negotiated in a final agreement.' 
That is what makes this debate somewhat vexing in my mind because we are talking about all of these horrible inequities that have resulted as a result of our trade policy. The people who are arguing against fast track want to continue our trade policy. This policy they say is so bad, they want to keep it in place by not allowing the President to negotiate better agreements with other countries or in the world bodies to be able to open up trade to create a better trade opportunity for us around the world. 
So I don't understand, and frankly, I am a little disturbed that we keep hearing the rhetoric of bad trade and horrible agreements at the same time not wanting to change those to make them better for this country. I think fast track is the opportunity to do that.

Mr. SANTORUM. I am accepting the Senator's arguments as true--that in fact what you are signifying happened is true. By staying there and not changing things does the Senator think things would get better? To me that is the sin of when you believe that you tried the same thing, and you are going to get a different result by trying the same thing. Then you start to wonder what the thinking is.

Mr. SANTORUM. I voted against NAFTA. So I think I have some legitimacy here. I am not debating that some of the agreements we have entered into in this country--you can't say only the ones entered into under fast track. We have entered into a lot of other agreements that have had an impact. But I am not debating that there are agreements that have not been beneficial to the balance of trade to this country. What I am debating is that by not changing any of those agreements somehow things are going to get better. That is really the argument here--unless we make change in those agreements things will not get better. We cannot make those changes unless we have fast track.

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his kind comments earlier, as well as for his tremendous support of the issue which I rise to talk about in the bill. He has been very cooperative, to the nth degree, in making sure this funding is in the bill. What I am talking about is actually an increase in the amount of funding for a national park that I think is one of the most significant and important national parks we have in this country, the Gettysburg National Battlefield, a battle which represents the high-water mark of the confederacy. It is in my State of Pennsylvania. I have had the privilege of being there on many occasions and, for the most part, they have been very sad occasions. They are times when I have to go up and look at the state of disrepair of the battlefield, the absolute horrendous conditions in which some of the most significant Civil War artifacts are kept. They are kept in basements that are damp. There is rot on most of the artifacts, uniforms, soldiers' diaries, archeological artifacts, and historical photographs. They are rotting away because we have absolutely no place to put them. We also have many farmhouses that were there used during the battle, which are crumbling and falling apart because we don't have any money to fix them. 
Mr. President, there was an article in the Washington Post today on Gettysburg, and there was one in USA Today also on Gettysburg. One referred to the `next battle of Gettysburg,' which is the attempt by the Park Service--I think a very important attempt--to relocate the visitors' center, which sits on Cemetery Ridge right in the middle of the Union line. New facilities are desperately needed given the condition of the artifacts I mentioned, to restore the battlefield to its intended condition, which should be its condition at the time of the battle, and to move the visitor center to another location in or near the park. 
The proposal referred to in the news articles is to move the visitors' center to a location in the park where there was no fighting that occurred and where no one died. 
The primary reason for the Park Service seeking a public-private partnership to build the new facilities is, No. 1, the current facilities are located in a place where they should not be and to provide better preservation and restoration of the artifacts and monuments. I visited the battlefield a month ago and reviewed some of the cannon carriages. There are some 400 cannons of which 380 are in absolute horrible condition. In fact, they are breaking apart, cracking, and the paint is chipping off. You have little kids running around on the battlefield climbing on top of the cannons with paint peeling away. If that happened in a city, or in a house, all the inspectors in the world would say that you have to do something to repair these cannon carriages. 
But we don't have the money, at least not until today. As much as the funding today will help, Gettysburg also needs the new visitor center, and they need the private-public partnership because there just isn't enough money in the budget to build a new facility. We can't get the capital funds. 
This new proposal, however, is meeting with some controversy from preservationists who feel we should leave things alone. If we leave things alone, though, Gettysburg won't be here very much longer--at least the historical documents and artifacts and monuments. I was at the Pennsylvania monument recently, one of the largest at the park. It is a grand thing. It is a dome-shaped monument. You can walk through it and under it--but not when it rains because it leaks, the water drips right down on you. You walk around and you see monuments that you can't even make out who it is a monument to anymore because they are just worn. 
That is no condition for this hallowed ground to be in. I, again, thank the Senator from Washington because I came to him with this plea after being, frankly, shocked and emotionally moved, after having been to that battleground on several occasions, and pleaded with him to do something about this state of the battlefield. He said, `Tell me what you need and we will make sure that we fight for it.' And through the process he was there every step of the way and did fight valiantly, and we have succeeded in getting an additional million dollars. 
But I will be very honest with you. That is a start. We also need to move forward with this new visitor center. I know it may be controversial. I know people are saying we have to wait and see. I am willing to listen to the preservationists and to those who have concerns about the new location being proposed by the Park Service. But we cannot delay long. We need to move forward to construct, No. 1, a suitable place for us to keep these artifacts. If we do not move forward and build a new facility that has the kinds of conditions, whether it is humidity, temperature, sunlight, and other things, to adequately display the park's treasures, they will be lost. One such treasure is the cyclorama painting that was painted back in 1880's. Today, the canvas is rippled. It is being destroyed, damaged by time, by humidity, by the misconstruction of the building when it was first put in. We need to act now to preserve and restore it. 
Today is a first step. I commend the committee and the Senator from Washington. We have made a first step today. We need to be vigilant on this. We need to come back and work further for more aid for this park and others to make sure that we can keep these hallowed grounds in a condition that we can be proud of and that we can preserve for posterity. 
So I rise to make my colleagues aware of the reasons for which this appropriation was targeted, and I encourage the President to be supportive of this additional appropriation. I also encourage him to do all he can to make sure on the Executive side that we move forward with the Park Service in some way quickly to get this new visitor center constructed, so we can begin to turn this park around to preserve our terrific assets, as well as to present a much better historical educational opportunity for people who come to visit the park. 
I thank the Chair.  
Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.

 Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the professionalism, dedication, vision, and public service of Mr. R. Noel Longuemare, who is retiring from the Department of Defense [DOD] after serving 4 years as the Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology, and most recently as the Acting Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology. 
Mr. Longuemare's tireless support for improved acquisition management practices, work force empowerment, and reduced life cycle support costs dramatically improved the DOD's acquisition management. He was instrumental in establishing Integrated Product Teams [IPT's] in all acquisition decisionmaking activities within the acquisition community. As the acquisition work force has been significantly reduced, IPT's have enabled commands to focus their expertise and to empower their managers in ways unmatched by traditional, functionally aligned organizations. Through his emphasis on IPT's, he has generated a climate of cooperative problem solving between industry and its DOD customers. 
Along with IPT's, Mr. Longuemare led the efforts to redefine the ways in which DOD specifies the products it acquires. He was the driving force in the shift to performance specifications for complex defense articles. Through his emphasis on what new systems should do rather than how they should look, industry has enjoyed unparalleled opportunities to bring technical creativity to bear on the most complex requirements. Mr. Longuemare successfully ushered the reform of military specifications and standards. In fact, nearly 2,700 specifications and standards have been rescinded as formal acquisition requirements since the program's inception. Thus, barriers to industry's own rate of technology acceleration have eroded, and industry continues to improve the way they do business with the Department of Defense. 
In addition to his leadership through difficult institutional changes, Mr. Longuemare personally pioneered many innovative acquisition concepts such as cost as an independent variable [CAIV] and the single process initiative [SPI]. CAIV provides program managers and engineers a practical method for treating cost as a true systems design criterion, and it directly supports the DOD transition to performance specifications. The SPI approach, which replaces separate Government and commercial processes, is one of the most powerful techniques available for reducing overhead and accelerating process proficiency. 
Mr. Longuemare has been a champion within the DOD for more effective communications. He initiated a systems engineering directorate to better define this crucial, but often elusive, discipline within the acquisition system. He advocated continuing education for the acquisition work force and fostered significantly improved coordination between the military departments, particularly in the requirements definition process. 
Mr. President, the work of this exceptional public servant will continue to have a lasting impact on the DOD for many years to come. Mr. Longuemare has rightly earned the highest respect of all who know him in Congress, the DOD, and private industry. I ask my colleagues to join me in extending the Senate's best wishes to Noel, his wife Julie, and their daughter Maria.

 Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, the Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War [SUVCW] is a congressionally chartered organization dedicated to preserving the memory of Union veterans and their sacrifices on behalf of our Nation. Today, I rise to recognize an exceptional Pennsylvanian, Mr. Richard D. Orr, who was recently elected commander-in-chief of the SUVCW. 
Richard's forefathers answered the call to duty during the Civil War. His great-great-grandfather, Pvt. Peter Paul Gallisath, served in the 5th Pennsylvania Cavalry. Another great-great-grandfather, Sgt. Martin Schaefer, served in Pennsylvania Militia of 1863, which defended the arsenal at Pittsburgh during the Gettysburg Campaign. His great-great-grandfather, Sgt. David Orr, was a member of the 14th Pennsylvania Cavalry. Other Union veterans in Richard's family include his great-great-great uncle, Capt. Bardele Gallisath of the 5th Pennsylvania Cavalry, and Medal of Honor recipient Col. Robert L. Orr, of the 61st Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry. 
Since joining the SUVCW on April 11, 1981, Richard has been very active in the organization. A life member, Richard has served the Pittsburgh Davis Camp as camp commander and treasurer. After attending his first department encampment in 1982, he immediately took an active role at the department level. He has served the Pennsylvania Department as patriotic instructor, junior vice commander, senior vice commander, counselor, department council member, and department commander. In the national organization, Richard has held the positions of committee chairman, trial commissioner, national treasurer, national counselor, junior vice commander-in-chief, and senior vice commander-in-chief. 
I am pleased to note that Mr. Orr is equally active in his community. A former Eagle Scout, the new commander-in-chief continued his affiliation with the Boy Scouts of America as a volunteer for more than 35 years. In fact, Richard was awarded the District Award of Merit for his many years as a volunteer with the Boy Scouts. Similarly, the Boy Scouts' National Court of Honor presented him the Silver Beaver Award--the highest honor that can be conferred upon a volunteer. Likewise, the National Catholic Committee on Scouting recognized his contributions to youth with the St. George Award. 
Mr. Orr is employed as an environmental health administrator by the Allegheny County Health Department [ACHD]. He has worked for ACHD for the past 19 years in a variety of programs including public drinking water, waste management, food protection, housing, community environment, and emergency response. Currently, he is responsible for evaluating, acquiring, and coordinating the training needs for all ACHD employees. Richard has earned the respect of colleagues and subordinates alike for his uncompromising dedication to sound principles of environmental health and environmental protection. Others outside the ACHD have taken notice as well. Richard received two community service citations from the Allegheny County Board of Commissioners. Also, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers presented him with the Planning Excellence Award for his role in the development of an intragovernmental plan to provide an uninterrupted supply of drinking water during environmental emergencies. 
Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in extending the Senate's best wishes for continued success to Mr. Orr and his family.

Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you. I thank the leader. 
I just wanted to ask a question. The Senator from Massachusetts talked about the job of the Senate as it moves forward on legislation. I just wanted to harken back to his statement about FDA reform, and what has been done by some people trying to block consideration of FDA reform and comptime-flextime. If you will correct me, I believe it is still on the calendar at this point because we do not have 60 votes to move forward with the comptime.

We have not had that debate yet.

Let me ask this question. My question is, can you come up with a reason why someone would want to be debating the changing of the underlying law with respect to campaign finance at a time when there is another debate going on out here about violations of current existing law? Can you possibly postulate for me what you think the motivation of some might be to question the underlying existing law of campaign finance in the face of overwhelming evidence and even new evidence that has come out, as recently as other day, that there are existing violations of campaign finance law? Could you answer for me or postulate for me what the reasons are that someone may want to divert attention away from a debate and examination of the breaking of existing campaign laws to talk about something completely unrelated, which is changing the existing law?

Do you think there is some sort of strategy involved here? I am just curious as someone sort of on the outside.

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, let me first address the issue the Senator from Massachusetts was referring to with respect to deportation of immigrants in this country. I am a very strong supporter of the Mack amendment. I believe people are entitled to due process and the right to be heard. Promises were made by many administrations and Congresses. These people were welcomed into this country as a result of the political strife that was going on in various countries in Latin America. I think it would be a true injustice for us to have changed the rules in midstream for many, literally thousands of people who are awaiting deportation hearings right now, to deport them in lieu of that hearing. 
So I stand with Senator Mack and Senator Graham from Florida, Senator Kennedy, and Senator Abraham from Michigan in support of the Mack legislation.

Mr. SANTORUM. The subject matter on which I want to spend the majority of my time speaking on is the issue of campaign finance reform. As Members have gotten up to discuss the issue, I think one might be led to the impression that those of us who oppose McCain-Feingold are not for any changes in campaign finance rules and that we don't see that there are some problems there. I want to make it very clear that, as a Senator who is on the Rules Committee, which is the committee that has the jurisdiction on this subject matter--we have been bypassed by these floor maneuvers but we do have jurisdiction and have looked into this subject quite extensively--that I don't know of anybody on the Rules Committee on either side who does not believe the current campaign finance system has some problems with it and there are things that we can do to fix it. 
We disagree on how to do that. Let me just, if I can, draw the differences between how one side wants to do it and the other side; sort of the big picture, not really talking so much about specifics but a general philosophy. Then I will get into more specifics. 
The general philosophy of those of us who oppose the McCain-Feingold approach is that we believe that we can fix the campaign finance system in this country by making it purely voluntary, so that no one is going to be forced to contribute to an election. That is something that you would think is as fundamental as any right that we have in this country, that you should not be forced by your employer, by your union, by your association, or by your family to contribute to anyone the resources that you have worked hard to earn. So, one general tenet is that contributing to campaigns must be completely voluntary. I think that is a tenet you would suspect would be universally shared. It is not universally shared. People in support of McCain-Feingold, by and large--there are some exceptions, but few--do not support the concept that campaign contributions should be voluntary. That is one difference. 
Second, that we achieve a better campaign system, a better campaign and a better campaign financing system, by increasing participation, by having more voices in the political discourse, not fewer. Those of us who oppose McCain-Feingold strongly hold to that reading of the first amendment that ensures, guarantees, one of the highest guarantees in the Constitution, the right of speech, political speech, and political discourse. 
In this country today, political speech does not mean--it means this, what I am doing. But it does not only mean standing up on the street corner and sounding off on what you believe in. These days, if you are standing on the street corner sounding off on what you believe in, basically you are labeled some sort of freak. We believe the first amendment covers organized political speech, that is, people who ban together, who want to speak on a particular issue and marshal whatever resources they have, whether it is resources in manpower to distribute fliers that they print at a half a cent apiece, or to buy a radio ad on a local radio station or to, in fact, hold public meetings and public debates. Whatever medium they want to use, I think is appropriate to be protected by the Congress and by the first amendment. 
On the other side, you have people who want to limit that activity. They want to limit people's ability to speak in the political arena because they find certain kinds of speech offensive, like people who advertise in opposition to a Member of Congress or a Senator saying that they voted in such a bad way and don't vote for them, and they do it within 60 days of the election; that is bad; somehow people getting together and expressing their opinion in a public forum is a bad thing that has to be prohibited by the Congress. 
I don't believe that. I don't like it when someone does it to me, and it's been done to me and it will be done to me unless we pass one of these bills that says you can't. By the way, even if we did do that, I believe the Supreme Court would strike it down in a heartbeat. But I believe it will be done again. 
I don't have a problem with it, even though it happens to me, because I think people have a right if they don't like what I am doing to speak up about it, even if I think the attack is unfair, because I trust the American public. I know a lot of people around here on a pretty regular basis don't trust the American public, but I trust the American public and the voters of America to sort of figure out all of those things on their own with the help of all the other information that they are going to get from networks like C-SPAN2, as we are on today, and other independent sources, that that ad, as nasty as it is, as horrible as it is, is not going to change somebody's opinion overnight. People are smart enough to take all that information, realize it is an ad, discount it to the degree they usually do and filter it into the mix, as we do with all speech. 
But the other side believes that it is dangerous speech. I believe that there is nothing inherently dangerous about speech; there is something inherently dangerous about limiting speech, because once we start to limit speech, then that takes freedom away from the masses, from the people and gives that freedom and control to a bunch of people in Washington, DC, who think they know what is best for you. 
You probably hear many Senators talk in those terms when it comes to a variety of other subjects in Washington, DC. I suggest that this attempt to take power away and freedom away from people and centralize it in Washington is consistent with what the other side of the aisle generally wants to do when it comes to every decision in your life. As a result, we have the huge Government that we have in Washington, DC. We have grown and grown and grown because we have taken more and more freedom away from people, whether it is in the form of freedom to use the money that you have earned by higher and higher taxes, or whether it is freedom in the form of regulation on regulation on every aspect of business and your life. 
We have taken that responsibility, we have taken your freedom and have centralized that decisionmaking in Washington, DC. This is another attempt to do that. This has the salutary effect, from those who believe in big government, of stifling your criticism of big government. This is a win-win. This allows them to continue to grow government without you being able to speak out against it. So they can stifle you at the same time they continue what they want to do in the first place. I think that is very, very, very dangerous to the future of this country. 
Columnist George Will called the filibuster--I don't know whether that is what it is or not, but let's use that term--that the filibuster of the McCain-Feingold finance reform is the most important filibuster in the history of America. I don't know if I agree with that, but I would say it is certainly one of the most important because it goes to the heart of our democracy, it goes to the heart of the political discourse in this country and how free are we going to allow this country to be at its most fundamental core, its democratic core. How free are we going to allow you to be, the average citizen in America? 
There are those who say, `Well, you are just too free right now and you have too much power right now. We need to take some of that back for your own good. For your own good we're going to take some power away from you so you don't go out and do things that are going to hurt you.' 
My, my, and believe it or not, you have the national news media just along for the ride. They think this is great. And why not? Because if we limit your speech, the speech of those who are speaking everyday on the network news and in the newspapers and on the radios becomes that much louder, because the din of your speech has quieted down, and so their speech becomes much more important to the whole debate. You have the media very much for squelching other input, so they become much more powerful and much more important in the political discourse. 
I suggest that if Congress were proposing a law to limit the amount of speech that newspapers and radios and television reporters can speak, there would be an absolute hue and cry of `freedom of the press'; `How dare you restrict'; `It is the most essential element of our democracy.' `The first amendment'-- `Oh, I'm sorry, just this part of the first amendment,' because when it comes to the other part of the first amendment, they are all for shutting you up. They want to shut you up, but they don't want to be even in the least infringed upon. That is the hypocrisy that is going on in the national media today. 
Let's get down to the bottom line here. What do those of us who would like to see campaign finance reform see as a solution to some of the problems? 
No. 1, I suggest we make sure the system is voluntary; that there should not be a system where any individual in America is forced to contribute against their will. That is not the law of the land today. There are tens of thousands, probably hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, of workers in this country who are forced to contribute money to campaigns in which they do not believe. That should be an embarrassment to every single Member of the Senate and should be an outrage to every member of our society. When it comes to union dues being used for political purposes, that is exactly what occurs. So we have a very simple provision that says you can't do that anymore, it has to be voluntary. 
Poll union members--not the union bosses, union members--and ask them whether they would like the right to be able to give money voluntarily instead of having it taken out of their dues. By overwhelming numbers--I just saw a poll in California--by a 4 to 1 margin, union members themselves said they want that choice. 
Yet--and I always find this really funny because people for McCain-Feingold say, `well, we have to fight the special interests; it's the special interests that are the problem.' Then they stand up here and fight against a bill that says all contributions should be voluntary. Why? Because the unions and their big money backing them in their campaigns won't allow them to do what's right. This just exposes it for what it is. This 
is about power. They just want to make sure that they can keep all the money funneling toward them, and then go about taking away power from you. Keep the money flowing on that side and then take the power away from you. 
I don't necessarily think that is the right approach to take. When it comes to union dues being used involuntarily for political campaigns--there is absolutely no excuse for not having the voluntary campaign finance system. That should be at the fundamental core. The only reason it is not is because of the special interests supporting the other side of the aisle, the special interests that they get up and rail against: `Oh, this is horrible; special interest money and, by the way, we're going to stop campaign finance reform because of the special interest money we get from involuntary contributions being maced out of the people who work in unions. Maced is actually too kind of a word because some people get maced when they don't go along, because they have no choice. It is not a matter of being maced and losing your job. You just have to go along. You can't even say no. 
So No. 1, it has to be a voluntary system. 
No. 2, a goal of a campaign finance system should be to increase participation by the people who are most affected by the election, and that is your constituents. The goal of the bill that I am going to be introducing is to increase the amount of influence--I use that term advisedly--influence that constituents within the State in which you reside, such as my State of Pennsylvania, to influence the election disproportionate from anybody else, whether they be political action committees or people from California--I like people from California but they are not from Pennsylvania and, frankly, the people from Pennsylvania should have more of a say who the Senator is from Pennsylvania than the people from Washington State, Maine or anyplace else. 
What I have suggested in my bill is we are going to increase the amount of contributions that can be given by people in Pennsylvania. The proposal that I have is to take the $1,000 limit and increase it to $4,000 per individual per election for people who reside in the State in which you run. Everybody else is kept at the $1,000 limit. But people in your State are going to have more of an ability to contribute. 
I know, because I was a challenger twice. I am a rare breed of cat around this place. I defeated an incumbent Congressman to get into the House and defeated an incumbent Senator to get into the Senate. There are not very many of us around who have that honor, I guess, or burden, one of the two. So I know what it is like to be a challenger. I know what it is like to be the big underdog. I know what it is like to be outspent 3 to 1, and I didn't like it. 
But I will tell you what I didn't like more than anything else. I didn't like the fact that my opponent, who was a sitting Congressman, had the ability to raise money all over the country. Because of being in Congress, he had connections. He could raise money from all over the place. He was known, not only all over the country, but all over the State. Nobody knew who I was. 
I remember when I first ran for office, they took a poll 6 months before the election in 1990, and my name recognition in my district was 6 percent. I thought that was pretty great; `Yea, it is 6 percent.' Then my pollster informed me that usually when they put somebody's name on the ballot, they get about 8 percent, because about 8 percent of the people are afraid to answer that they don't know the person, figuring if they were on the survey, they should know the person. So I got below what Mickey Mouse would get. Nobody knew me. 
It was hard for me to raise money. I didn't have any money. And it was harder only because I could raise $1,000 at a time. If I was lucky enough to find someone who would support me who had any kind of resources, all I could get was $1,000. That makes it very, very hard for a challenger. You have to find a lot of people to help you, to get at least a bit of seed corn to build a campaign organization. 
There was a comment from a person who was going to run for the U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania next year. She was headed toward running, but she announced abruptly she was not going to run. The reason she gave for not running was that she found it incredibly hard to find so many people to give her $1,000 at a time. She just couldn't find that many people to build up the seed corn necessary to start a campaign. Once you start a campaign, you can broaden out your search, you can get, as I have done--I have 35,000 donors, I believe, to my committee. 
And that is a lot of donors. I am very proud of that. 
The average contribution is well under $100. But you have to get to there. And it takes time. It takes some money to start. Unless you are a millionaire, which I plead guilty of not being, then it is very difficult for the average Joe Citizen to get enough resources together to start a campaign when you have to raise it $1,000 at a time. 
When you consider the fact that in a Senate race in Pennsylvania it is going to cost about probably $9 or $10 million, someone giving you $4,000 hardly warrants notice in the big scheme of things. 
So to suggest that somehow, you know, this person has inordinate influence is ridiculous. And you are going to get hundreds of people to give you that kind of money. I guarantee you, within those hundreds of people there will be hundreds of different opinions on probably the same issue. So to suggest you are going to do one for one--it just doesn't work that way. 
Anybody who believes--this is another fallacy of campaign financing--that Members of Congress get donations to do favors for people, I mean, that is just ridiculous. I mean, it is absolutely absurd. And that is why I am for limits on contributions, and I am for low limits. I think $4,000 is a low limit because I don't want someone to be able to give $100,000 or $200,000 or $500,000 because then, whether it occurs or not, the appearance of impropriety is there. With a small donation, relatively small, I am talking in terms of a $10 million campaign, $4,000 does not, I think, stick out to say they are buying a more disproportionate interest here. 
The fact of the matter is, we have low limits. I think we should keep them relatively low, but they should be high enough so people can have some ability to form a little bit of seed corn to start a campaign if they want to run for office. So I believe that raising the limit, oddly enough, would help challengers and open-seat candidates more than it will help incumbents. 
Incumbents can raise money now. They are one of the few who can raise money now. This is to help challengers. The other thing--follow me on this concept--what I believe has happened over the past 25 years and why campaign reform has come to be such a `scandal,' although I think it is a somewhat created scandal in some respects; in many respects it is a scandal because people are breaking the laws--is what we did in 1974. It was well-intentioned. It was to limit the influence of special interests and limit the influence of big donors. Remember, $1,000 was set in 1974. If you index that to inflation, it would be over $3,000 today. That is why we increase it from $1,000 to $4,000. And campaigns have increased by 10 or 20 times as far as expenses since 1974. 
What we have done--if I can give an example of a heart--you have a main artery that flows into the heart that provides the blood for the heart muscle so the heart can pump. What we did in 1974 was we occluded partially, we blocked that artery. We said, we are no longer going to allow a free flow of resources, blood, into the heart muscle, the candidate; we are going to block it. 
It was an artificial block. It was artificial in the sense that the heart still needed the resources, but you have limited the ability for direct resources to flow into that heart. 
If you are lucky, what happens if you are a human being and that happens? What happens is, you build up what is called collateral circulation, other circulation to feed the heart, to keep it alive and going and working. 
Collateral circulation in politics is called soft money. By limiting the amount that you or anybody can give directly to a candidate, you have not stopped the need for the money to get to the candidate; all you have done is stop the main, most efficient, most disclosed, most apparent way of feeding that heart muscle, of feeding that candidate. 
So what has happened is the money still wants to get there because the candidate needs it to run a race, and so what has happened is these collateral sources have been built up. We have built up all these soft money trees to feed the candidate behind the scenes, undisclosed or disclosed not as efficiently or not as readily as the direct pipeline to the heart or to the candidate. 
So what I want to do is do a little angioplasty. Let us clear out the heart artery to allow some more resources and blood to flow so you can watch it. What I propose in my bill is to require monthly reporting--not quarterly, but monthly. Let us have more disclosure. Let us have more prompt disclosure. Let us find out who is giving the money and how much they are giving. 
So we have, by doing that, and by raising the limits of people who live in the State, you will reduce the need for this other circulation for this other money to come into the system. 
I think the best way to cure soft money is not Government to restrict it because, you know, we restricted hard money, that money, that direct pipeline, that main artery going into the campaign, we restricted it, and what happened? They figured out another way, constitutionally another way. We try to restrict that, and guess what will happen? They will figure out some other way. I mean, look, the big problem here is that Government is too big, it spends too much, and it regulates too much. It is involved in everything. We have this huge Government that people want to have some say in how the Government governs. They want to have some say in who is elected to make those decisions. And they have every right to do so. 
What the folks who are for McCain-Feingold say is, `Well, we don't want you to have that right. We want to limit your right to do that.' I think that is ridiculous. I think that is, frankly, undemocratic, certainly undemocratic, and I will go as far as to say it is un-American. We are a country that fought hard, we fought wars, we fought a Revolutionary War and many others to maintain our freedom. And first among them--the first amendment--first among them is the freedom of speech. 
What this debate is fundamentally about is the freedom of political discourse, of your right to influence the course of an election, and, therefore, the course of the country. It is your only chance. This is a Republic, not a democracy. We are not all gathered here in the Senate--we do not get all 250 million people in the room and everybody says `aye' and `no.' That is not how we do things. You elect me for better or for worse. You elect a Member of the Senate, two Members in the Senate from each State, and however many House Members you have, and those people represent you. 
If you want to be represented here, you have to work 
through the electoral process to influence the decision as to what Member of Congress is elected and what Senator is elected. That is your outlet. What the people in this room, many who are for McCain-Feingold, want to do is limit the people's ability to impact that election. When I say `people,' I don't just mean individuals, but associations and others who have every right under the first amendment to be heard. 
So when you hear all this talk about, `Oh, special interests,' remember one thing, the biggest special interest that is holding up this bill is labor unions who do not want voluntary contributions to be the law of the land. That is No. 1. So anytime you hear `special interests' from people who support McCain-Feingold, ask this question: `Are you for voluntary contributions for every member of society?' When they say, `No,' then you say, `Don't talk to me about special interest because I know what special interest is buying you. So don't talk to me about, `Oh, we need to get rid of special interests when your first vote is to defend it and to exhibit the power.' 
Voluntary contributions, increased participation, particularly from people who are within the boundaries of the district or your State, and increased disclosure. It is much easier for the cardiologist to be able to find a problem with the flow of blood to the heart by looking at one source where it is supposed to be. It is much easier to determine where the problem is than looking at all the other different sources that may be feeding that heart. 
So if we allow the resources to be channeled, and we have disclosure of those resources promptly--monthly--then you are going to have a system that I think everyone will be proud of that will encourage participation, that will be voluntary, and that will be disclosed. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the chairman of the Rules Committee for one of the most difficult tasks that any Member will be called upon to take in the U.S. Senate, and that is to look into the election of another Member of the Senate. It immediately has partisan overtones and can take a very ugly turn. 
I can say that having sat through many of the hearings, both open and closed hearings, having sat with the chairman and seeing the efforts of this case and seeing the level of detail to which he took personally getting involved in this investigation and trying to ferret out the validity of the charges that were alleged, I am very proud of Senator Warner's work on this investigation. He did it with the skill of the trained lawyer that he is. He did it in a way, really as the Senate's counsel, if you will, and also did it with, I believe, an extraordinary air of bipartisanship when, in fact, the partisan wranglings had boiled over far beyond what he actually deserved. 
He did an excellent job. He did a thorough job. He used the resources that he had to the greatest extent that he possibly could. He took lots of arrows, in many cases in the back. But he stood tall and kept his eye on the ball, and that was to find out what happened in Louisiana, whether these charges that were put forward were, in fact, legitimate. He is determined, as well as the other members of the committee, that at this point there is not sufficient evidence to suggest that there was a systematic case of fraud in Louisiana, and so the investigation must come to a conclusion. 
I support the chairman in that decision. I supported him, as did every other member of the Rules Committee, in the decision that he came to after this thorough and thoughtful investigation of the information that was presented to him. 
I just wanted to take the floor today to commend him for a job well done. No doubt he will be criticized by many for ending this investigation, but I want to stand with him in saying that I think he reached the conclusion that was the only conclusion that could be reached at this point. 
Having said that, obviously, just like with any of us, if information comes out subsequent that is a smoking gun or that is really problematic, then that evidence can be brought before the Rules Committee and we can take a look at it. To this point, that has not occurred, and I think the chairman has acted judiciously with respect to the evidence before him. 
I wanted to stand and offer my gratitude for his excellent work and state my support for his effort. Thank you, Mr. President.

 Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize an outstanding citizen from Allison Park, PA. On October 3, Lt. Col. Thomas Miller will retire from his position as the joint program office site director at the Software Engineering Institute [SEI] of Carnegie Mellon University. 
Thomas was born in Valley View, PA. He earned an undergraduate degree in computer science from Utah State University. Later, Thomas received a M.S. degree in systems management from the Florida Institute of Technology. 
In 1974, Thomas received his Air Force Commission from the Reserve Officer Training Corps. Since then, he has had an exemplary military career. Lieutenant Colonel Miller has served as a computer systems acquisition engineer at the Air Force Electronic Systems Division for the Joint Tactical Information Distribution System Joint Program Office; the computer systems acquisition manager for the seismic portion of the Atomic Energy Detection System; the software division chief at the Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar Systems [JSTARS] Joint Program Office; and the chief of the Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile Systems Division at Eglin AFB. 
Lieutenant Colonel Miller became the joint program office site director at the Software Engineering Institute in 1992. During his tenure at SEI, Lieutenant Colonel Miller earned the respect and admiration of his colleagues. A proven leader, Thomas will be sincerely missed. 
Mr. President, after many years of service to his country, Lieutenant Colonel Miller is retiring to private life. In honor of his service, I ask my colleagues to join me in extending the Senate's best wishes to Lt. Col. Thomas Miller, his wife Colleen, and their three children.

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Bryan amendment for a lot of reasons. But the one I want to focus on is what I believe is the fiscally irresponsible nature of this amendment. 
This is being put out as a budget-cutting measure. But the fact of the matter is, by having a fund that says we are going to hold the counties harmless--and I appreciate being held harmless. We have a national forest in Pennsylvania and our counties rely upon that money. That is going to cost money in the sense that by reducing the amount of roads built, you are going to reduce the revenues in the fund. That money is no longer going to be there to fund those counties in the money that they traditionally have received, and the Federal Government is going to have to come up with that money in exchange to fund the counties. 
That is, in a sense, almost a welfare payment from the Federal Government because we have eliminated the funding source of timber harvesting from those counties and those communities. So not only have we hurt them economically, hurt their counties economically, but we are now creating welfare for those counties by giving Federal dollars to them in place of the jobs they have. This is not only bad, I think, from a policy perspective, but also bad from a fiscal perspective. 
Despite the assertions of the amendment's sponsors, the timber sales program and the purchaser credit program are not subsidies. Since 1964, roads needed for timber harvest have been built by timber purchasers and the U.S. Forest Service has permitted the use of purchaser credit for road building. In fact, this program is entirely off-budget and this appropriations bill contains no funding for it. In President Clinton's budget request to Congress, elimination of the program results is no savings to the Federal government. Rather, the costs of the credits are explicitly absorbed by timber purchasers in the contracting and bidding process. According to a report by Price Waterhouse, `Economic analysis shows that the forest roads program does not contain a subsidy for timber purchasers; it provides an efficient and effective mechanism for financing road construction and reconstruction.' 
Second, eliminating the Purchaser Credit Program would harm local communities near national forests--including Warren, Forest, McKean, and Elk Counties in Pennsylvania. Counties containing forest lands receive 25 percent of gross Forest Service receipts. In 1996, these counties received a total of $6.2 million, three quarters of which went directly to local school districts. 
Finally, the amendment would effectively cripple efforts to meet the stewardship needs of our national forest land by cutting the funding by which we maintain its infrastructure. Eliminating this program would not only cut funding for road construction, it would cut funding for road reconstruction and maintenance to fix environmental and safety problems remaining from an era when construction standards were far less rigorous. A well-developed road system is indispensable to forest plan implementation, fire suppression and forest health. 
As many of my colleagues know, the General Accounting Office has just released a report which identifies questionable policies and practices that nearly caused the Forest Service to default on revenue sharing payments to rural counties in fiscal year 1996. The report raises fundamental accountability issues for both Congress and the Forest Service, and I believe that these issues will be exacerbated by the Bryan amendment. 
Specifically, the GAO found that reductions in Federal timber sale receipts, coupled with increased obligations to spotted owl counties, and an apparent lack of sound financial controls over the National Forest Fund resulted in a shortfall in revenue-sharing funds available to rural counties. 
Receipts from the resource sales are deposited in the National Forest Fund, which is a 
receipts-holding account from which the Forest Service obligations are distributed. After normal county payments were paid, the Forest Service used the National Forest Fund in fiscal years 1994 and 1995 to make additional spotted owl guarantee payments in certain counties in California, Oregon, and Washington. This caused two problems. First, there were insufficient moneys in the fund to pay counties because of the dramatic drop in timber sales receipts. Then, the Forest Service was forced to borrow from other funds and the Treasury to pay the obligations to the counties in a fashion that GAO found `was an unauthorized use of the funds.' 
It is my understanding that Congressman Bob Smith, chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, has written Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman requesting a full accounting of the specific steps he will take to ensure that the Forest Service advises Congress when such shortfalls occur and properly manages these funds in the future. 
Mr. President, the amendment before us will only make this dire financial situation worse for the Forest Service. Senator Bryan's amendment will again modify the formula for sharing Forest Service receipts with the counties. I understand that it is the sponsors' intent to protect counties from fiscal harm as the result of this amendment. Included in the amendment is a provision to make up for the inevitable shortfall in payments to counties that will occur as the direct result of a $10 million reduction in spending for new forest road construction and the elimination of the purchaser road credits. Since Pennsylvania has four counties that benefit from timber sale receipts, I commend Senator Bryan for his concern about the effects of his amendment. But I must point out, Mr. President, that the concern of the Senator from Nevada betrays the folly of this amendment. You see, should this amendment be enacted into law, timber sale receipts will go down sharply at the same time that our payments to counties will be held constant or even increase. This is the very same tortured accounting formula that helped to lead the Forest Service to brink of default recently over the spotted owl payments. 
In fact, let me point out for the benefit of my colleagues that the GAO found the Forest Service had shifted money originally intended for trust funds for reforestation and forest health in order to cover the deficit in the National Forest Fund. While I hope the Forest Service will be successful in addressing the serious accounting shortcoming that led to the crisis, I must caution my colleagues that passage of the Bryan amendment makes it more likely that the National Forest Fund check will bounce again during fiscal year 1998. 
The amendment directs the Forest Service to compute the costs associated with road construction by timber purchasers and give the counties an equivalent of 25 percent of these costs from the National Forest Fund. This is ludicrously impractical. First, we do not have enough money in the National Forest Fund to meet our current obligations to the counties. Second, the task of calculating private sector costs is a complex accounting task for an agency. Further, the amendment directs the Forest Service to collect private sector costs, that in many cases, are proprietary. 
In view of the GAO's very critical report, this is not the time to add to our obligations to the counties. Nor is it appropriate to burden the Forest Service with additional financial responsibilities. I urge my colleagues to defeat this fiscally irresponsible amendment. It is imperative that we maintain funding for Forest Service road construction and maintenance and the Forest Service's Purchaser Credit Program. It remains the most efficient and cost-effective method we have to help maintain our national forests and serve the needs of the surrounding populations.

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I have a question for the Senator from Minnesota. It is not about the subject matter at hand. It is about this rather disturbing assertion by the Senator from Minnesota and the Senator from Massachusetts about the motives behind the Nickles amendment. It is disturbing. And I think the Senator from Texas is right when he said that in fact this borders on a violation of rule XIX. 
Let me make a statement. And then I would like the Senator to respond.

Mr. SANTORUM. Let me put the information out, and then I would like the Senator to respond to it. I can do it in the form of a question. But the Senator from Minnesota makes the assertion that this comes right on the heels of a Teamsters strike when they were successful in negotiating some changes in their contract. The Senator talks about the chronology. Let's also talk about the chronology of when Barbara Zack Quindel, who is the overseer of the election, came out with her order following the strike. That didn't occur 3 months ago. That didn't occur 6 months ago. It occurred 3 or 4 weeks ago over the break. The first opportunity for us to address this issue is this bill. 
To suggest that we somehow waited until after this Teamsters strike to do this is ridiculous. The timing is perfectly appropriate. It is appropriate because it is the first legislative opportunity to address this issue after the overseer ruled on the election. If we waited 6 months and there happened to be a strike and we happened to come forward with this after that successful strike by a union, then you can make the argument. But that is not what is happening here. 
To suggest and imply and impugn the integrity of the Senator from Oklahoma and his motives I think is really below the dignity of this Senate given the chronology that the Senator from Minnesota is well aware of. I hope that given that knowledge--and maybe he did not have that knowledge--but given the knowledge that this in fact was right after this decision was handed down by the overseer of the election, and that this was in fact timely, and had nothing to do with the Teamsters strike, in fact one might add that the fact that Ms. Quindel sat on this report for a couple of weeks might have had something to do with the Teamsters strike. But that is not the issue here. What is at issue is the Senator from Oklahoma addressed this issue expeditiously right after the decision was made on the first legislative vehicle to do so. And I think any other construction of motivation really does not hold water very well. 
So I would be pleased with a response, given that information.

 Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a very special native of Philadelphia upon her retirement from the U.S. Air Force. This extraordinary woman, Maj. T.A. Taylor-Hunt, has served her country and her community with grace and distinction. 
To say that T.A. has had an exemplary military career is an understatement. Her promise as an officer was evident when she received an American Spirit Honor Medal upon graduation from basic training. After completing technical school at Shepard AFB, she began a career in accounting and finance at Dover AFB, with follow-on assignments that took her around the world. At the Strategic Air Command NCO Academy, she was recognized as an Honor Graduate, Distinguished Graduate, Commandant's Award winner, Academic Champion, and Flight Speech Champion. She was the first person in the 25 year history of the Academy to receive so many awards. Likewise, T.A. received an Instructor's Abilities Award at NCO Leadership School as well as the Officer's Training School Flight Academic Achievement Award. As a comptroller, T.A. played a critical role in the financial operations of Operation Desert Storm. In Europe, she helped to establish an Army medical unit in the former Yugoslavia. At the time of her retirement, she was the Deputy Chief of Wartime / Contingency Planning at the Defense Finance and Accounting Service, Denver Center. 
I would also note that Major Taylor-Hunt graduated summa cum laude from the University of Maryland, and she received her masters degree with distinction from Webster University. Currently, she is attending the University of Denver College of Law. 
In addition to the awards I mentioned earlier, Major Taylor-Hunt has received numerous other commendations for her military performance, as well as her extensive community service. Her military awards and decorations include the Meritorious Service Medal, the Air Force Commendation Medal, the Outstanding Unit Award, and the Air Force Special Recognition Ribbon. Some of her other awards include the 1988 Delegate of the Year for the Coastal Charter Chapter American Business Women's Association, the Federal Women's Program Military Officer of the Year, a Community Service Award for the Defense Finance and Accounting Service, and inclusion in the 1996 Who's Who Among Students in American Colleges and Universities. 
Mr. President, given T.A.'s tireless efforts to help the less fortunate, it is clear that the recognition she received has been well deserved. Her business card describes the way she lives her life. The inscription reads, `Take Care of Others, God Will Take Care of You.' And take care of others she has. T.A. devotes a substantial number of hours each week soliciting, collecting, sorting, and distributing donations to the homeless, without the assistance of staff. She not only meets the basic needs of homeless families such as food and clothing, but she also works to correct their credit problems so that they can find permanent housing. Likewise, T.A. volunteers at several shelters, delivers Meals-On-Wheels, and tutors a fourth grade student. 
I am proud to say that Major Taylor-Hunt's compassion has been contagious. What started as an effort to help one family living in a school bus has grown into an extensive support network spanning the Denver metropolitan region. Through her leadership, families have found homes; furniture has been donated; hungry people are being fed; children are receiving decent school clothes; and holiday meals and gifts are donated regularly. 
In closing, Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Maj. T.A. Taylor-Hunt and in extending the Senate's best wishes to her family.

 Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I would like to engage the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations in a brief colloquy concerning funding for the National Education Center for Women in Business at Seton Hill College. 
Mr. President, in the decade between 1982 and 1992, women-owned businesses grew substantially, increasing by over 55 percent between 1987 and 1992 alone. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's women business owners helped make this happen, as my state ranks sixth in the nation in the number of firms owned by women. These firms contributed over 290,000 jobs to my state's economy. The Center conducts collaborative research, provides educational programs and curriculum development, and serves as a information clearinghouse for women entrepreneurs. I have heard only good things about the Center's work in the promotion of women business ownership, both in the Commonwealth and across the nation.

Mr. SANTORUM. The Center has received funds in five previous Commerce-State-Justice appropriations bills through the Small Business Administration's Office of Women's Business Ownership and, as originally envisioned, it was to receive $5 million in federal funds over five years. The fiscal year 1997 appropriations bill for the SBA included $500,000 for the Center, which leaves $500,000 in federal funds that are needed to complete the total $5 million federal contribution to the establishment of the Center. I understand that the Small Business Administration would generally continue the program through the next cycle, even though it is not specifically listed in the bill, as the Center has been successful in its mission on behalf of women in business. Would the distinguished Chairman of the Subcommittee be willing to work with Senator Specter and me to examine options for allocating funds for the National Education Center for Women in Business?

Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I wanted to make a couple of comments also on the budget bill that we have before us here this evening and that we will be voting on, I guess, tomorrow morning. 
I come here excited in a sense that we are finally doing something that when I first ran for office back in 1990 I pledged to do, which was to come here and try to balance the Federal budget. Not to put schemes out there that say, well, we will target this and we will adjust to this number when we get there, but actually pass a law that will get us there without Congress having to do one more thing. 
I think that is what we have accomplished here in this legislation. We will pass the changes, the needed reforms, in the entitlement programs that will get us to a balanced budget, that will save an estimated $270 billion over the next 5 years, will require no further Federal action other than just passing our appropriations bills under the limits we have set, and we do a pretty good job at that. If there is anything I can say Congress has done in the past few years it is that we have kept to the budget caps. I do not anticipate that being a problem. In fact, I think many of us would advocate trying to come in below those caps. So I think this bill will accomplish what we set out to do, balance the budget by 2002. And hopefully, if we do not have any kind of major recession, we will be able to balance it sooner than 2002. 
So, I am very excited about that. We have been able to face that problem, and we have been able to deal with it in a responsible fashion. 
I must admit, though, that I am somewhat disappointed at some of the things we did not accomplish here that we, in fact, passed in the Senate bill. We took, I think, some courageous political stances here in the U.S. Senate in dealing with the issue of Medicare. The Senator from Oregon was talking about that just a few minutes ago, some of the changes that were not made that he believed in. In fact, some of them, even though I notice he didn't support them, need to be made. 
Senator Gramm, during the debate here on the budget last month, talked about the demographic cliff that we are going to fall off in the year 2011. I share that with you again this evening. In the year 1995, in fact for the years pretty much throughout the 1990's, roughly 200,000 people will turn 65 per year--200,000 people. In the year 2011, 1.6 million people will turn 65. That is just a cliff. That is 1.6 million people going into a system, no longer paying into that system, into a system that today cannot absorb 200,000 a year. It is going bankrupt absorbing 200,000. We are asking that same system, that same program, to now absorb eight times the number, and that is not just a blip. It is not 1.6 million in the year 2011 and then back down to 200,000. No; it's 1.6 million and then it levels off to about 1.5 million a year throughout the years of the baby boom generation and their retirement. 
It has been estimated that if we don't change Medicare and Social Security in the next few years, the payroll tax will double within a generation. That is from 15 percent of every dollar that is earned in America up to $60,000 for Social Security tax and 1.45--actually 3 percent if you take the employee and employer share for every other dollar, irrespective of income. We are going to have to double that payroll tax. That's an optimistic projection. Pessimistically, we will have to triple the tax if we keep Medicare and Social Security just the way they are. 
So, to the people who run around and say, `We don't need to fix Medicare now, we don't need to fix Social Security now, everything is fine; those people who want to change Medicare and Social Security are just out to get the elderly,' I would just suggest this: Anybody who is not talking about long-term structural changes to those two programs is out to get the elderly who are yet to be elderly, who are waiting to be elderly, because those are the folks who are going to pay--and big. I think it is only fair that we spread this out a little bit and we begin to make changes now. 
The two major things I wanted to see done that were not done were, No. 1, as the Senator from Oregon talked about, means testing part B benefits. This is a chip shot. I mean, this is a layup. I can't think of any other term. This is an easy one. This affected about 4 percent of the population of seniors in this country who were the highest income-earning seniors. What were we going to do? For Medicare, part A, part B--there are two parts to Medicare. Part A is hospitalization, major medical; part B covers some of the other things. It is a voluntary program. It covers some outpatient, labs, doctors, things like that. It's a voluntary insurance program. You don't pay one penny into Medicare part B over the course of your earnings before you turn 65. But when you turn 65 you can opt into this, in a sense, public insurance program. It is voluntary. If you choose to get into part B, you pay a premium. It is about $45 a month. 
That $45 only covers 25 percent of the cost of the program. Who picks up the other 75 percent? Mr. and Mrs. Taxpayer. That's fine if you are a senior who needs subsidies from the Federal Government to be able to afford insurance, but in my mind it's not fine to give a subsidy to people who don't need a subsidy. I am not someone who comes to the floor on many occasions and talks about class warfare. I don't believe in that. I don't believe in a lot of the arguments that the rich don't pay their fair share. I think a lot of it is just hooey, and in fact class warfare. 
What we are talking about here is we are talking about subsidizing people at a higher income. I am not for that. I am not for taxing them more, but I am not for subsidizing them, either. So, to the extent that we subsidize, we said, `Look, if you are earning over $70,000 as a couple, you are going to pay a little bit more for your Medicare part B premium.' It's still a good deal. It's a pretty big group, and you get a nice group rate. 
We should have done that in this bill. I can tell you, I have been to senior center after senior center after senior center, and I have gotten up and I talked about this. I have never heard an objection. No one has ever objected to this. They thought that's pretty reasonable. We should not be subsidizing Ross Perot in his Medicare part B premium. It's crazy. He doesn't need it. Most of these people don't need it, and they probably wouldn't want it if they realized what it was costing the Federal Government to do it and what it was costing their children and grandchildren. So that's one of the things we missed, in my opinion. It's unfortunate. 
The second--I know this is a tougher issue--and that is raising the eligibility age for Social Security. I know this is not a very popular issue, but I can tell you we got 62 votes here in the U.S. Senate, I will say very proudly, in a bipartisan vote. The eligibility age for Social Security, to be able to qualify for full Social Security benefits, is going up. Most people in this country don't know that, but it is. It is going up. In 1983, when they passed the Social Security reform, they did a couple of things. They raised taxes and they raised the eligibility age from 65 to 67. They didn't start doing it, though, for 20 years. The first people who turn 65 who are going to be affected by this raise in the eligibility age are people who retire in the year 2003, 20 years after the bill passed. 
You will hear the people who were here in the Congress who said, `We waited 20 years to enact this so people could prepare for this time.' It is funny, because I talked to a lot of people who are planning to retire who are about that age, in their fifties right now, who are going to be retiring, late fifties, retiring in 2003. Most of them don't know the retirement age is being moved back. I talked to most younger people, and they have no idea the retirement age is being moved back. These people, as far as I am concerned, who passed this thing in 1983 and put it off 20 years, put it off 20 years because they will be gone in 20 years, most of them, and so they won't have to take the wrath of the American public, if there is going to be some. I hope there will not be, once they understand the problem of having to deal with the issue. I think we should deal with the issue now. 
We should tie the Medicare eligibility age to Social Security, which phases up over a 20-year period. It doesn't hit 67 as a retirement age until the year 2025. We should tie the two together, because most people, most lower and middle income people, are not going to be able to retire prior to being eligible for Social Security, so there should not be much of a problem with tying in Medicare because they are going to retire when they hit the retirement age for Social Security. That will also be the retirement age, in a sense eligibility age, for Medicare. 
For those who can afford to retire sooner, they probably are more well off, by and large, or they may have a disability. But in that case they qualify for Government benefits through disability. But, for those who are more well off, then we should create an option for them to buy in at age 65, they can buy into Medicare if they can't continue their private insurance. 
There was a way to work this out that I think would have been, again, the right thing to do for the long term for Medicare. If you really care about providing a health safety net for the future, those were two things that were really missed opportunities. It is unfortunate we missed them. 
I will say, overall, we have taken a positive step here. I think we missed an opportunity to do something really lasting, really significant. We stood up and made a courageous vote, a vote that, frankly--if Members would go out and take the time to talk to people and explain the demographic problems that we have, the fact that people are living substantially longer and they are substantially healthier, that these kinds of changes only make sense to make sure that future generations have these retirement security programs like Medicare and Social Security to rely on for the future. 
So, I am disappointed that we blinked, the White House was not supportive, and frankly our colleagues in the House were not supportive. I think that is unfortunate for both of those entities. I stand with particular pride at the U.S. Senate, that it had the courage to look ahead, to not make decisions just based on short-term fixes. Frankly, the Medicare provision here is a short-term fix. We had long-term fixes in the Senate bill and we didn't follow through, and I think that is unfortunate. 
We did do a lot of other positive things in this bill, and I will support it as a result of that. But I think this piece of legislation, given what the Senate did in their courageous action by going out on Medicare and setting the course, missed a tremendous opportunity. 
One final comment. There is an additional concern I have about a provision in the welfare bill. There is welfare reform--or, in my opinion some of it is a backtracking on reform from the last bill. We have some positive things in this bill with respect to work, but we also have a provision in there that is very worrisome for me, as far as the ability for work programs, workfare, to work in the States. This gives the President and the Department of Labor the opportunity to designate people on workfare in an employment setting as workers covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act, the minimum wage laws, and all the other laws that apply to all other employees. The problem with that is that you get into a whole host of complex things that drive up significantly the cost of providing a work slot for someone on welfare. 
If you believe, as I do, that the most important thing for most of the people on welfare today is to get them into the workplace, to teach them the value of work, to give them the sense of pride which so many millions of Americans for the first time are feeling now, to get off the welfare rolls and get them into the workplace where they are doing positive works, where they are getting positive reinforcement for the things that they are accomplishing, where they are learning the ability to get up, get their children off to school or to day care or to a relative and get to work, keep those hours, work hard and come back home and manage their life--those are important life skills. If we put the barrier too high for the States, we are going to limit the number of work spots available for, really, millions of people and, I think, destroy a lot of the tremendous progress that we have made in creating an environment under this welfare reform bill that we passed last year for people to rise out of poverty, to get the kind of experience necessary to get the sense of accomplishment and self-pride that is necessary to rise out of poverty. 
I am very concerned about that. I hope the administration does not pull the trigger. They are getting immense pressure from the unions to do so because the unions want to protect their piece of the pie when it comes, particularly to the public sector spots that will be filled in some cases by welfare recipients. 
So, I hope the President does not bow to the unions at the expense of millions of people who want to get out of welfare and who need these work opportunities to be able to do so.

 Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise in remembrance of the 228 victims of the TWA airline crash off the Long Island coast which occurred just 1 year ago today. In that accident, the community of Montoursville, PA, lost 16 of its young citizens--students from the local high school who were traveling abroad as members of the school's french club--and 5 adult chaperones. 
While its cause remains unknown, I believe it is critical that our remembrance of the accident not be defined by this uncertainty, difficult as it is for those who mourn the death of family and friends. Because we do know, with certainty, what we lost: sons, daughters, classmates, as well as mothers, fathers, and neighbors. We know of their contributions to their communities, schools, and professions. We know, especially in the cases of the youngest victims, of their promise and of their vitality. We know of their importance in the lives of their families. It is with this sure knowledge of who the victims were and of what they did in their lives that we should remember them. 
The loss of the young Pennsylvania students--and all the members of that flight--to unexplained tragedy is terrible to bear. I know that the Montoursville students were the pride of their community. Responsible and accomplished students, cherished sons and daughters, they undertook the much-anticipated trip to France with gratitude, excitement and hope. By remembering them in this way perhaps we will always somehow know their presence in our lives.

<TEXT>
Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Mr. President. 
I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
Let me just say first in response to the Senator from Iowa's comments about the compensation levels of certain executives, No. 1, the Grassley previous amendment only applied to cost-type contracts; it did not apply to fixed-price contracts. When you negotiate a contract and say, here is the price we are going to pay you, it is a fixed price, and you produce the product for this price, we do not really care who you pay or how much you pay, just as long as you give us the product at this price. So they can pay their executives anything out of that as long as they deliver the product as per the price. 
Also these companies that have been listed by the Senator from Iowa, many have very large and substantial commercial entities who are not limited at all to what they pay their executives on that. So to suggest that there is some error here, some problem here, I just do not think is accurate. I think it is accurate to suggest that this approach does not work and is wrong, and I will go through as to why I believe it is. But to suggest that there is something funny going on here, I think is simply not accurate. 
Let me first start by saying what the Subcommittee on Acquisition and Technology did when it was presented with this issue. Last year, in the authorization bill, we requested the administration to come up with a suggestion on how to deal with this issue because the Congress every year seems to deal with this issue of setting levels of caps on compensation for, quote, `executives.' 
The administration came back with a suggestion. The suggestion had four parts. No. 1 was to limit the reimbursement of senior executive salaries to the median salary of executives in companies of similar size. Now, what does that mean? They take the large corporations and they figure out--they take the median salary of the large corporations, then the medium size and the small, and they have different compensation levels. The problem with that is that the committee saw that for some corporations, the large ones, the average median compensation was $4 million. To set a cost cap at $4 million does not appear to be much of a cost cap, even to this Member who does not particularly agree with the Senator from Iowa on compensation levels. 
So we decided to go back and relook at that. They did do some things that we adopted. No. 1, they defined executive compensation, 
which had not been done before, and we have adopted that definition in the committee's mark. I believe the Grassley-Boxer or Boxer-Grassley amendment adopted that definition of compensation. So on that we agree. 
We also disagree on the people that it should apply to. The administration has suggested just the top five most highly paid executives of the contractors should be limited here. The Boxer-Grassley amendment covers everybody. I will explain later why I think that is a problem. 
Senator Lieberman and I, the ranking member on the subcommittee, worked on what we thought was a compromise, something that was workable and took care of the concerns that I will enumerate in a few minutes. The compromise was to take the median salary of all companies who have sales over $50 million. So if you have sales over $50 million and you take the median salary from those executives, we came with a figure of $340,000. So $340,000 would be the cap under ours. Now the administration opposes this cap. The administration believes this is too low. Now, what Senator Boxer and Senator Grassley are suggesting is even going below what the administration believes is too low. But we believe this is a reasonable level to go. 
Now, why? Let me just explain what I believe is sort of the reality of what this amendment is. This is a huge antismall business amendment. Why? As you saw from Senator Grassley's chart, the big corporations do not have any problem paying their executives, particularly ones that are diversified, because they have price-type contracts, they have commercial business, so they can pay their executives from a variety of sources. The folks that really get nailed by this are the small businesses who do primarily defense work. They are the ones whose compensation is effectively capped at the level we set here. 
You say, what is the big deal? The big deal is these small businesses are in a very competitive industry and, yes, they are competing for high-priced talent, not just in managerial, and we limit it to managerial, the top five executives--but they compete even more fervently. Remember, what are we moving to in the Defense Department? We want high technology. We are drawing down our defense. We hope to be investing more and more into high technology. We want our vendors to be more efficient, more high technology. 
I will read from the Information Technology Association, what they suggest this amendment will do to, I believe, small contractors in particular, and I will quote from a July 2 letter from the Information Technology Association of America to the Chairman, Strom Thurmond.  
It will limit the government's ability to contract for personnel with specialty technology skills. A recently completed Information Technology Association of America study found that there are approximately 190,000 unfilled technology positions nationwide, with almost 20,000 unfilled positions just in the Washington metropolitan area. The shortage is even more acute for people with cutting edge skills who command far more than $200,000 in wage and benefits in the marketplace. 
What I am suggesting here that this amendment will do is it will not hurt McDonnell Douglas, it will not hurt Boeing, it will hurt the local organization in your community, the small business who is competing for defense contracting work, trying to get the best technology available, the highly skilled people who are in very competitive prices, and they will not be able to employ them. They will not be able to keep them. I am surprised some of the big businesses do not love this, that they are not supporting the Grassley-Boxer amendment. This is a boon to big business because it lets them cherry pick all these skilled people to employ them at their business because the small contractors simply cannot do it under this amendment. 
Now we improve things a little bit. We allow them to go up to $340,000. You hear $200,000 is the salary of the President. Well, $200,000 is about one-quarter what a shortstop hitting .190 for the Baltimore Orioles makes. If we are going to compare worth here, who is more important to the future of our country--someone who will redesign the air traffic control system in this country to make it safer and use the high technology and the skills they have, or someone hitting .190 for the Pirates? I think the answer is pretty clear. But on this floor, they are saying that guy hitting .190, we can pay him anything we want, but the guy who has high technology skills, the guy who has the skills that can add to the national security of this country, we cannot have. They will go off to Hollywood and make movies. That is where they go. They go to Hollywood and they make action pictures instead of redesigning systems to make our Nation more secure for the future. 
This is an unwise piece of legislation. This really does strike at the core of what the future is for our country. I will be honest. I frankly do not care if the CEO's of some companies do not make a lot of money. What I do care about is that we have the scientific expertise employed in the defense industry to move our country forward, to stay ahead. This amendment will hurt national security. This amendment will limit our ability to get the best and the brightest into the defense industry and 
keep them there, particularly for the small entrepreneurial companies and the small companies that get involved in the defense industry. So this hurts national security. It devastates small business' ability to compete. Just for those two reasons alone we should be against this amendment. 
I hope we do not get blinded by what appears to be populist. It looks populist to say we should only pay certain people who get paid from the Government a certain amount of money, except for the fact that when you do that, you lose good people and you hurt small business, both of which are vital to the national security of this country. 
I reserve the balance of my time.

You then accept the fact that by limiting the compensation to everybody, particularly those firms that do 90 or even more percentage of their work with the Federal Government, you in effect put a salary cap on everybody at that firm, even the scientists, who they have to go out and compete for?

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may need. I want to respond very briefly. The Senator from Iowa says it is a market decision on how much people should be compensated. They use the term `executive compensation.' This is not a limitation on that; it is a limitation on anyone's compensation. They do not designate certain executives, as we do in our underlying bill. We designate the top five executives. They limit it to every person in the company, including maybe that guy who sits in the cubical and doesn't come out very much and 
drinks a lot of coffee, who makes the place run because he has all the ideas. He may not be the executive, but he is the brains behind all the research going on in that company. They limit him, too. Let's understand that. 
They said it is a market decision. Well, it is only a market decision as to what you pay your people if you have other markets, because if you are just in the defense market and have cost-type contracts, the decision is made by the Senator from Iowa, not by the company, because the Senator from Iowa will say, if your company does defense work and you have cost-type contracts, you can only get paid this amount, no matter whether everybody else--those brilliant technologists--get paid a lot more somewhere else, like in Hollywood, which is where they will go. It is not a market decision. It is in some cases, but not always, and those are the cases I am most worried about. 
The Senator from California is suggesting that I was concerned about how much executives got paid. I said during my statement, and I will repeat it, that I don't care how much executives get paid. I care about keeping the best and brightest, particularly the people with the technology and the skills, those needed skills, to work in the sector that does work particularly for national security. 
When we limit compensation--at least that is what is being suggested--to those individuals who are out there on the leading edge of technology and we drive them out of the Government procurement area--particularly in the area of national security--we have hurt the national security of this country. I know it wasn't deliberately intended to do that, but that is exactly what this does. I would, in fact, change the name. I think our underlying bill is an executive compensation amendment or provision. The Boxer-Grassley amendment is a scientist compensation limitation amendment. Let's call it what it is because it doesn't just limit executives. In particular, it gets scientists compensation who work for defense contractors or for contractors in the national security area. That is a very serious decision this Senate is going to make today as to whether we are going to go out and drive the leading-edge technology people in this country out of national security issues and put them--maybe there is a motive here, to send them out to California to work for the movie industry. Maybe that is what is involved. I say that tongue-in-cheek, but that is exactly what will happen, and that is not right. That is not in the best interest of this country. 
As the Senator from Iowa points out so eloquently, these caps on executives for the big companies don't work. Why? Well, quite aside from any claim of fraud or not telling us the real numbers is that a lot of the contracts that these corporations have are not cost-type contracts. They are fixed-price contracts. So the executives can get paid anything they want on fixed-price contracts, because as long as they deliver the item being procured at a certain price, they can pay anybody in the organization anything, and they do. That is OK as long as they give it to us for what we agreed to pay them for it. 
So to suggest that somehow this cap works on lowering the compensation of high-priced executives in big corporations, it doesn't work; it will never work. We will come back every year with these charts because we don't do all cost-type contracts, nor should we. In fact, it goes against one of the things we have been pushing for in reform of our acquisition in defense. Instead of just looking at low cost, we look at best value. We look at the best value for the taxpayer--not just cost, but value. And so what I think we are going to increasingly see is that this amendment is, in a sense, irrelevant for the large companies, but incredibly relevant for the small defense contractors who are leading-edge, doing leading-edge technology, many of whom are in California, I might add, and some of whom are in Pennsylvania, I am proud to say. But we are going to lose those people--the best and the brightest in the science fields--to industries other than national security, and that would be the crime if this amendment 
would succeed. 
I yield to the chairman for such time as he may consume.

Mr. SANTORUM. What would happen is a couple of things. According to the Grassley amendment, it is my understanding they would be roped in no matter whether they did any work or not. They would be covered under this because their company is. It doesn't limit it just to people involved in defense contracts. It is anybody in the country. 
That is No. 1. 
No. 2, it would shift the cost of paying those salaries away from the defense contract to the private sector, which would make them less competitive out there in the private commercial sector, which would then probably say, Look, we can't be as competitive out there in the private sector. We are just going to walk away from this defense contract.

Mr. SANTORUM. He is chasing the wrong--in this case, the dog is chasing the wrong person. What you end up chasing is chasing very skilled technical people and very highly competent managers of people out of the business who want to be more and more competitive. 
Again, I chair the subcommittee on Acquisition and Technology. My real concern here in the committee is the technological advances. What we are hearing in the testimony is more and more we will have to go out into the commercial sector and get the technology that is being put together in the commercial sector to bring that into the defense area at a lower cost that is more 
efficient and more effective. If we limit the compensation, we are just simply not going to get those commercial entities involved in the defense industry. That is a real crime. We are giving up resources and talent and capability by limiting it, as we are here, to a salary of one-quarter of what a shortstop of the Pittsburgh Pirates makes who bats--actually the shortstop is batting over .200, but not much over .200 right now. That is not right. And I think it is counterproductive for national security. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I have sympathy for what the Senator from Iowa is saying. The fact of the matter is the amendment doesn't accomplish what he wants to accomplish. We will be back here next year, if the Senator's amendment passes, with the same because all the Senator's amendment does is limit cost-type contracts. It does not limit those contracts in which we purchase things from contractors for a fixed price. We tell them when we purchase it for a fixed price, You can pay whoever you want. You can pay whatever you want for the material. You can pay the executives anything as long as you deliver the product at this price. So they allocate some substantial portion or what looks like at least some portion of these contract dollars. That is perfectly legal. 
If the Senator wants to say that we should not do any fixed-price contracts, come with an amendment that says that. If he comes with amendment that says we don't limit fixed contracts --I don't think he would support it, but the Senator from California supports it--then we can deal with this issue. But if all you are going to deal with is one type of contract which is cost, then go out and show compensation levels that include moneys from fixed-pricing contracts. That is what they have done. 
So for all of the passion--and I believe in the passion of the Senator from Iowa, and the Senator from California--it doesn't solve the problem; at least what they perceive as the problem. What I perceive as the problem with their amendment is it does hurt since technology and the highly competent people we need to be in the national security area. And, frankly, not just national security but in all areas of Government, if we can get them. 
As I mentioned before, wouldn't it be nice if we had a more modern upgraded air traffic control system? And we have the ability to pay scientists the amount of money in contracts to be able to design those. Under this amendment we could not get the best and the brightest to do that. 
So what this executive compensation amendment really effectively does is limit the amount of money that we can pay people in the high-technology field, the scientists and the information specialists that we need to move the national security front forward. 
So for that reason alone it should be soundly defeated. We cannot afford, as we draw down defense, as we reduce our troop levels, as we continue to rely more and more not only on high-tech--which is certainly something we rely more upon, high technology but on commercial technology and commercial contracts--contracts with commercial organizations who will steer clear of Government contracts, if they are going to be limited in how much they can reimburse their scientists and other personnel through their technology that they are sharing, because if they limit it they have to pass that cost on to their private sector clients which makes them uncompetitive. So they will choose not to compete in the defense area. So we lose valuable commercial technology. 
So we are not only losing the scientists. We are losing the opportunity in the commercial area. We are creating a disincentive for people to be involved. And, even with all of that, if we adopt the amendment, it wouldn't work. 
So it accomplishes all those negative things, and the one positive thing they choose to accomplish it does not accomplish because it does not limit anybody's salary except those small businesses that have primarily cost-type contracts. Those small businesses, 80, 90 percent of the contractors that have principally cost-type contracts, they get nailed by this amendment. All the big guys it does not bother. It nails the small companies and their ability to compete, to get compensated for the technology that they are inventing in many cases and to get good people to work in those businesses in towns all across America. 
This is a dangerous amendment for national security. It is an amendment that I hope is overwhelmingly rejected. It is an amendment that I know the Senator from Connecticut, the ranking member, opposes and I know the ranking member on the full committee, Senator Levin, opposes. They support the underlying committee decision which, I would add, is opposed by the White House because they believe our cap is too low. 
I know that this amendment has passed in the past, and the Senator from California said it was passed overwhelmingly, but I would implore that the Senate come to its senses in this case and realize its impact. 
I now yield the remaining part of my time to the Senator, the ranking member, from Connecticut, Mr. Lieberman.  
Mr. LIEBERMAN addressed the Chair.

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, Senator Lieberman, who is on the subcommittee, looked at this issue and asked the administration last year to come up with a proposal. They came up with a cap of $4 million. We didn't think that was particularly salable on the floor of the U.S. Senate. 
So we came up with a different calculation that put the cap at $340,000. That is the median salary of the executives of companies that have sales of over $50 million. 
What this amendment does is lower that cap to $200,000, and in so doing it applies to not just executives but scientists--people who are in demand, who are going to be taken away from high-technology firms and national defense and are going to other places where they can make a lot more money because they are going to be capped under this amendment. 
This is a bad amendment. It is going to hurt national security. It also hurts small businesses, because those are the businesses that are primarily defense businesses that are not going to have the opportunity to compensate their employees from other sources like commercial entities. 
I encourage a strong no vote on this. 
I yield the remaining time to the Senator from Connecticut.

 Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the memory of one of the most beloved sons of Pennsylvania, Mr. Jimmy Stewart. A native of Indiana County, Mr. Stewart honored all of us by identifying himself, in the fullest sense, as one of us. 
Throughout his career, he was hailed as the Everyman, the quintessential American male, an example of `inspired averageness,' as one writer put it. And that was his special gift--doing the extraordinary in a way that didn't call attention to itself. But what he did with his life, what he accomplished, did, in the end, call attention to itself, because Jimmy Stewart was not ordinary. 
In `Liberty Valance,' one of Mr. Stewart's movies in which he plays a Senator returning to town for a rancher's funeral, a newsman says to him: `This is the West, sir. When the legend becomes fact, print the legend.' I would like to recall today, Mr. President, how the fact of Jimmy Stewart became the legend. Because with Mr. Stewart, the fact and the legend are one. 
Jimmy Stewart was born in Indiana, PA in 1908. His father owned the local hardware store and he always retained ties to his hometown and the traditions that it embodied for him. As he himself said, `This is where I made up my mind about certain things--about the importance of hard work and community spirit, the value of family, church and God.' 
He graduated with honors from Princeton University in 1932 with a degree in architecture and even did well enough to earn a scholarship to pursue graduate studies in that field. But it was acting he chose to pursue and he would eventually appear in 71 films, among them some of the best ever produced, such as `The Philadelphia Story,' `Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,' `It's a Wonderful Life,' and `Rear Window.' For someone with a reputation for uncomplicated wholesomeness, the successful portrayal of so many diverse characters in so many films suggests, as others have remarked, the possession of something more--something deeper and more compelling than simple wholesomeness, although he had that too. 
This `something more' was seen most clearly, perhaps, in Mr. Stewart's exemplary service in World War II. When other stars were content to remain at home and fulfill their patriotic obligation in less hazardous ways, Jimmy Stewart willingly left a thriving and prosperous film career to enlist in the Army Air Corps. He enlisted as a private and by 1945 had attained the rank of colonel. He also aggressively campaigned for combat duty and would eventually fly 20 dangerous missions over enemy territory as a command pilot. By war's end, he had been awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, the French Croix-de-Guerre, and the Air Medal. He stayed active in the Air Force Reserve and retired a brigadier general, the highest rank ever attained by a professional entertainer. 
Just as he had the humility to leave a successful film career to be a soldier like any other in that war, he also had the modesty to return to acting and wonder if he could reclaim a place in Hollywood. And he did, of course. `It's a Wonderful Life' was his first film after the war and it not only returned him to American movie audiences, it gave us and every future generation the wonderful character of George Bailey. George Bailey, who changed so many lives without even knowing it. And, of course for many of us, Jimmy Stewart was George Bailey. Someone who succeeded in so many ways without ever appearing to fully realize how extraordinary those achievements were. 
Jimmy Stewart continued to distinguish himself as a citizen, as an actor, and a devoted husband and father for the rest of his life. Once he retired from the movies, he remained active in charitable and community work, wrote poetry and became an ardent champion of film preservation, often coming to Washington to testify before Congress on the subject of colorizing old black and white films--a practice he opposed. 
With his death, he leaves two twin daughters and a son. He also leaves millions of devoted fans who admired him as much for his work as for the exemplary character and intelligence he projected throughout his lifetime. 
Jimmy Stewart once said that he agreed to do `It's a Wonderful Life' because of one line in it: `Nobody is born to be a failure.' He believed that ordinary Americans, in their everyday life, could, and did, do extraordinary things. Jimmy Stewart may have behaved as if he were just like everyone else. And he may have even believed it himself. But he really wasn't. He wasn't average at all. It was simply a final act of skill and generosity that he let us believe he was.

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment for myself and Senator Lieberman that would extend the authority of the Department of Defense to consider alternative approaches to the fulfillment of the education and training requirements in the Defense Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act in chapter 87 of title 10, United States Code. In the report to accompany the Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998, the Armed Services Committee noted its continuing concern with ensuring that our defense acquisition workforce has the necessary education and training support for the new environment in Government acquisition. 
Section 812 of the Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993 directed the Department of Defense to develop alternative standards for the fulfillment of the training requirements for the acquisition workforce under the Defense Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act. These standards will sunset on October 1 of this year. The amendment I am offering would extend the life of these fulfillment standards for an addition 2 years. This extension will allow the DOD to explore alternatives to formal internal training programs, including completion of courses outside of the Department of Defense educational system.

 Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments of Senate business to give a special word of thanks to the Tasty Baking Co. for its generosity to some very special inner-city children. 
As many of my colleagues may recall, the Philadelphia Flyers recently faced the Detroit Red Wings in the Stanley Cup Finals. To make the game a bit more interesting, Senator Abraham and I placed a friendly wager on the outcome. Unlike most interests in this series, the junior Senator from Michigan and I each picked a food donor and an inner-city school that would receive a complimentary party. If the Flyers lost, the Tasty Bakery agreed to donate 800 Tastykakes--400 to Warren G. Harding Elementary School in Detroit and 400 to William Penn High School in Philadelphia. If the Red Wings lost, Little Caesars Pizza would give a pizza party to both schools. Regardless of the outcome, the children stood to win. 
Mr. President, I'm sorry to say that the Flyers did not bring the Stanley Cup back home to Pennsylvania. So, on June 16, the students of William Penn enjoyed their complimentary Tastykakes and Crazy Bread--which Little Caesars graciously donated despite the Red Wings' victory. Recently, the children of Warren G. Harding Elementary celebrated their victory party. 
In closing, I would like to thank Little Caesars and the men and women at the Tasty Bakery for making these parties possible. I would particularly like to thank Kathleen Grim, Tasty Bakery's manager of community affairs, for coordinating this effort. I ask my colleagues to join me in extending the Senate's best wishes for continued success to the Tasty Bakery in Philadelphia, PA.

 Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Dr. Ruth Wright Hayre upon her retirement as president of the Philadelphia School District's Board of Education. 
Dr. Hayre is a remarkable woman whose successful career was built on the strong work ethic she developed early in life. At the age of 15, Dr. Hayre graduated with honors from West Philadelphia High School. After winning the mayor's scholarship to the University of Pennsylvania, she earned both her undergraduate and graduate degrees. 
Once Ruth completed her studies, she began a distinguished career in the field of education. Dr. Hayre's teaching career began at Arkansas State College, but eventually, Ruth returned to Philadelphia to teach English at Sulzberger Junior High School. At William Penn High School, she was promoted from teacher to vice principal and then to principal. Dr. Hayre's achievements are even more impressive considering that she was the very first African-American teacher in the Philadelphia school system, the first African-American high school teacher, and the first African-American principal of a Philadelphia senior high school. Still, this was only the beginning. Ruth rose to the position of superintendent of district four. Once again, her list of firsts grew, since she was the first African-American superintendent of a Philadelphia public school. On December 2, 1985, she received an appointment to the Philadelphia Board of Education. Five years later, Dr. Hayre was unanimously elected president of the board--becoming the first female to hold this position. In 1991, she was reelected as president of the board. Moreover, she has taught a course in urban education and administration at the University of Pennsylvania. After years of dedication to the children of Philadelphia, she is retiring this year. 
In addition to her commitment to education, Ruth has served her community in numerous other ways. She has served on the boards of many prestigious organizations including Blue Cross, the Philadelphia Council of Boy Scouts, the Afro-American Historical and Cultural Museum, the Educational Alumni of the University of Pennsylvania, and most currently, the Dr. Ruth W. Hayre Scholarship Fund. Dr. Hayre is also actively involved in religious, civic, and community service organizations such as the Northeasterners, the Coalition of 100 Black Women, and the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority. 
Dr. Hayre has received numerous awards and commendations for her contributions to the field of education. For instance, the Governor of Pennsylvania honored her as a Distinguished Daughter of Pennsylvania for establishing the Wings to Excellence Program at William Penn High School. Likewise, she received the Philadelphia Award for her efforts to provide quality education for all. The University of Pennsylvania and Temple University have each granted her honorary doctoral degrees. Similarly, she received national recognition for establishing a fund at Temple University to provide college tuition for 119 graduates of the sixth grade classes of the Kenderton and Wright Schools who complete high school and are admitted to an accredited college. All of her achievements notwithstanding, Dr. Hayre once remarked that her greatest accomplishment was, `Being a wife, a mother, and a grandmother.' 
Mr. President, Dr. Hayre is truly a great American. She has dedicated her life to one of the single most important vocations--educating young people. I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Dr. Ruth W. Hayre for her life-long accomplishments and in extending the Senate's best wishes for continued happiness as she retires.

Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I rise in very strong support of the bill that came out of the Finance Committee, the tax bill that provides tremendous tax relief for all Americans, because what this bill is aimed at doing is creating jobs, creating opportunities, getting an infusion of capital so we can increase our productivity. 
Those are the kinds of things I thought we were going to be debating on the floor of the Senate. I thought we were going to talk about how we can create economic growth, how we can create better jobs for people, how the people at the bottom end of the economic strata can rise as a result of the opportunities that are available in the United States. And now what the Senate has evolved into today has been a bunch of charges that this isn't fair, that we should not look at economic opportunities or growth or jobs, a tune that is heard often here--jobs, jobs, jobs. We shouldn't look at job creation; we shouldn't look at economic growth; we should look at what is fair, who is getting the benefit, and we should draw class warfare lines in the sand here. 
I just want to, if I can--I hate to even sort of get down, though, to that level, but that has really been the focus of this debate. I want to throw out--I hesitate to do this because we just get numbered to death in the Senate, but let me throw out a couple of numbers that I think are very easy to understand. 
The top 20 percent of income earners in this country, the rich, the top 20 percent pay 79 percent of all income taxes. The top 20 percent pay 79 percent of all income taxes. 
Now, they pay 79 percent of all taxes. What percentage of the tax cuts in this bill do the `rich' get? Twenty-two percent. In other words, the group that pays three-quarters of the tax get one-fifth of the benefit. And this is being charged as a tax break for the rich. If I were rich, I would say you are ripping me off. I am paying all the taxes and everybody else is getting all the benefit. 
But, no, they come here to the floor and they charge this is unfair; these people who are poor need tax cuts. Well, let me just straighten this out a little bit. Thirty-seven percent, the `bottom 37 percent,' of income earners in this country pay no taxes net. In other words, with the tax credits and the EITC and the other things that are out there, they pay no Federal income taxes. 
Now, I do not know how you give tax cuts to people who do not pay taxes, but that is what the other side wants to do. In fact, if you go deeper into the analysis, you find that not only does the bottom 37 percent pay no Federal income taxes, the bottom 20 percent pays no payroll taxes net. In other words, all that money, the FICA that you have to pay out for Social Security and Medicare, if you are in the bottom 20 percent of income earners in this country, you get more back in earned-income tax credit than you pay out in payroll taxes. 
But that isn't good enough. So people are getting--not only do they pay no income taxes, they pay no payroll taxes. In fact, they get more back than they pay. The other side wants to give them even more money. I am not opposed to helping people out, but where is this money coming from? It is coming from people who are paying taxes, people who are in the middle class who have been paying taxes for the last 16 years at very high rates, who deserve a break. 
I am really about up to here with people running around saying we are for tax breaks for the middle class, but what they propose is welfare for people who pay no taxes. So let us get it straight. I am going to offer a resolution, a sense of the Senate, that says Federal income tax relief should go to people who pay Federal income taxes. 
Now, you would think that that would be a joke, that everybody would vote for that--anybody who pays Federal income tax would be the only ones eligible to get tax relief--but, unfortunately, you are going to find a whole bunch of people who are not going to vote for that. 
That is how far we have come. This is `Washingtonspeak.' For those of you who have not been in Washington very long, welcome, and this is what it is like. People actually stand around here and talk about giving tax breaks to people who do not pay taxes. While people who do pay taxes, anybody, is rich. Anybody who pays taxes in this country, by definition of what the Democratic plan is, is rich. 
If that is where we have come in America, then I think the Founding Fathers will be turning over in their graves because they thought they created the land of opportunity where people were rewarded for working hard, for taking care of their families, for providing for themselves. What we are saying here is you are the bad guys, you are the ones who have to pay more.

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, we had this debate during the welfare reform bill in the last session of Congress. We said we 
wanted people who are on welfare to work, not to go into more education and training. There is a time for that. We allow for education and training, but at a certain point in time we are going to require people to go to work. 
Now, what this amendment says is, no, you do not have to go to work; continue education and training. This is a weakening of the work requirement. This is not going to get people into the workplace to learn the skills necessary to be competitive and to get good jobs and to improve their future. 
This is more of the same what we have been doing here in Washington prior to the welfare reform bill. The President did not request this change. It is not in the budget agreement. It was not anything that anyone advocated. It should be defeated.

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, after listening to some of the debate on amendments that are being offered and having the opportunity to come to the floor and defend what we did last year on the welfare reform bill, you would think by all of the amendments that are being discussed and by all of the gnashing of teeth that is going on here in the U.S. Senate today, that we have a welfare reform bill--the bill that passed this Congress last session and implemented by the States' 50 Governors--that we are having an abject failure; that horrible things are happening out there in the area of welfare that we have to now come back and save all of these people. I hate to disappoint anybody's party here. But the fact of the matter is that things are not all that bad. In fact, things are doing very, very well in the area of welfare. I will point to a couple of things as illustrations. 
First, I have not seen one major newspaper write one bad article or editorial on the devastating effects of welfare reform passed by the last Congress. I assure you that if there were any devastating stories to be told, they would be telling them because of all these papers that were against the welfare reform bill that went through. The fact that we have not heard of horror stories and that we have not heard any gnashing of teeth from the media about what is going on is certainly a positive sign that things are actually going well. 
I might also add that none of the press has come and said, `Gee, we were wrong.' Welfare in Wisconsin--50 percent of the people have been dropped off the rolls, and are working. Across the country the average is 20 percent of welfare rolls have been reduced, and people are working--in case after case after case. 
I spend at least one visit a week when I am back in the State of Pennsylvania going in and talking to people in education and training programs, homeless shelters--you name it--talking to the people who are intersecting with the welfare programs. And almost unanimously what I have gotten as feedback is, `This program is a program I wish you had passed earlier. I wouldn't be here today working. I wouldn't be here today getting the education and training I need, succeeding, and feeling better about myself had this bill not passed.' 
We have an unmitigated success in welfare. We threw the 
ball up in the air. The Governors of the 50 States jumped. They caught it, and they are running with the ball. They are doing positive things for the poor and for the disadvantaged all across America. I just think that we need to take some time here today in the midst of all of these amendments that says all of these people are being hurt. The fact of the matter is a vast majority are being helped tremendously by what went on in welfare reform. 
I hope Members--frankly, those who supported welfare reform and those who did not--I hope that they will come to the floor and say, `Look, this program is working.' From any objective criteria, people are working; people are going in and getting education and training that they never would have had before because, frankly, they needed that little shove. We are giving it to them. We are supplying them, and the Governors, with the child care that they need. 
We have a lot of work to continue to do on that front and on some other fronts in the area of Medicare and other kinds of health coverage. But the Governors are working on that. They are taking this responsibility that we have given them--this flexibility that we have given them--very seriously and are doing a terrific job. 
So I just want to set the record straight here on a day that might otherwise be seen as a day where welfare reform came under attack here in the U.S. Senate. What we are seeing in reality outside of Washington DC, outside of the Senate Chamber, where we continue to think of the welfare of the past and look to the future--go out there in those communities and find out the success stories, the wonderful, heartfelt stories of people who needed this piece of legislation and who needed this change in the welfare culture. 
I think probably the most dramatic thing that I heard from someone who is not on welfare but someone who worked in the system is from two people who had been in the welfare casework role for 25 years in New Castle, PA. They came to me and said, `I can't thank you enough for changing the law to let me do what I wanted to do 25 years ago but never had the chance'--that is, help people get off welfare, help people actually use their ability and get the respect for themselves instead of just passing out checks and creating dependency. The person was actually thanking me, almost in tears, thanking us for giving him the opportunity to do what 30 years of welfare policy wouldn't let him do--that is, get people off of welfare, give them the incentive and the tools to make it off the dependency of the Government instead of ensuring that they would never leave by creating a meal ticket forever on welfare. 
So I just want to reiterate one last time that anyone in this Chamber who believes that welfare reform is in bad shape and we need to go and rewrite the welfare bill because of all the terrible things that are going on out there, I suggest you go out there and you talk to the Nation's Governors, you talk to the people who are working in the system, you talk to the people who are going through the system, and you will hear a very different story than what you are hearing here today in the Senate. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I support the amendment offered by the Senator from Texas, and I commend her for her diligent work in fighting fraud in the Food Stamp Program. I would also like to thank her for working with me to address a concern of mine with regard to food stamp nutrition education. 
For 2 years, the Reading Terminal Farmers' Market trust participated in a partnership with the USDA to develop a community-based nutrition education program in Philadelphia. Using a Federal share to match private grants from the Knight, Pew and Kellogg Foundations, the trust established the Philadelphia nutrition education network to integrate nutrition education into ongoing food distribution and health programs. The Philadelphia School District, Allegheny University of Health Sciences, WIC, the Archdiocese of Philadelphia and others were engaged as partners in the network, which reached over 17,000 children and adults in 1996. 
By all accounts, this program was a success; and last summer, when the one-time cooperative agreement with USDA expired, the trust sought to continue their important work under the existing food stamp nutrition education program. In June 1996, the trust submitted a food stamp nutrition education plan requesting matching funds for a nutrition education plan in four low-income communities and at the Reading Terminal Market. Unfortunately, USDA regulations only permit a Federal match for local or State government funding. Since the Reading Terminal Farmers' Market Trust relies upon private contributions to fund their programs, USDA determined that they were not eligible to participate in the food stamp nutrition education program. 
Since last summer, my office has been working with Reading Terminal Farmers' Market Trust to find a way for this program to continue. It is my understanding that nutrition education programs in Vermont and New York City have encountered similar problems with USDA matching funds. I have worked with Chairman Lugar of the Agriculture Committee and Senator Leahy to craft an amendment that will address these problems, and I am grateful to the Senator from Texas for including this language as section 2 of her amendment. 
The language in this amendment will enable nonprofits and State agencies to receive grants in order to operate nutrition education programs that are coordinated among a broad range of food distribution and social service providers. In order to reach the maximum amount of eligible individuals and to leverage private funds for this endeavour, private donations will be made eligible to match the Federal grant. 
The amendment provides $600,000 for grants for each of fiscal years 1998 through 2001, and no individual grant may exceed $200,000. 
This provision has the support of Agriculture Committee Chairman Lugar and Senator Leahy.

Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, we have all now just seen and heard why it is so hard to change anything in Washington. Because anything you try to do is wrong. You can look at all the facts. And the Senators from Louisiana and Nebraska and Texas and New Mexico and Delaware laid out chart after chart. For anyone listening to this debate, the facts stare you smack in the face. This fund runs out of money in the year 2001 with the baby boomers retiring in the year 2010. This program is not sustainable in its current form. Everybody who can read a simple arithmetic chart can understand that. Yet, you have everybody flying to the floor saying, oh, yes, it is a problem, but not this. 
Well, then, what? We are going to raise taxes? How many are for raising taxes? There will be a few over there who want to raise taxes. But that is the option: Raise taxes. 
The Senator from Massachusetts talked about rationing care. It is those people who use all that Medicare who are the problem. And unless we start rationing that care, we are not going to get to the problem here. So we can ration care to people who are over 65. That is another option. Or we can cut reimbursements to providers. The Senator from Louisiana talked about that. But if we do that, all of us know if you cut reimbursements to providers, people cannot get care because they cannot afford to provide the care and rural hospitals close, inner-city hospitals close. So you cannot take that option. 
We can cut benefits. How many here are for cutting back Medicare benefits? OK. Well, so there we are. What are we going to do? We have a problem. It is not going to go away. We can sit here and demagog on the issue and say, well, this is not the right thing. 
The only reasonable course is to look at the demographics and see that I, right here, am the first Member of the Senate who is going to retire at age 65--right here, age 39, born in 1958. I will retire at the age of 67. I am ready, willing, and able to take on that responsibility. I feel I have been adequately warned, giving myself about 30 years in advance to be able to figure this out. And I think we are capable of taking it. I am not going to live as my mother and my father and those before me, whose life expectancies were, as I think the Senator from Nebraska said, 73 for a female, 68 for a male. At age 65, my life expectancy, the Lord willing, as a group anyway, is going to be well over 80. I am quite willing and prepared as a generation to save my generation, the folks who are paying the bills, big-time bills that previous generations did not pay. We are paying 1.45 percent of every single dollar we earn. And I would like to say for that dollar you are going to have a program that is going to be there and provide adequate benefits when you retire, and, yes, I am willing to take a little sacrifice. I am willing to pay a little bit more, but I am also willing to take my share of sacrifice to make sure that it is there for not just me but for everyone else in my generation and future generations. 
What we are talking about here is being responsible, not standing up and demagoging to get votes back home. We have got a problem. There are people in my generation who are tired of this language.

Mr. SANTORUM. I go around and I have talked to hundreds of high school students, thousands of them. I have been to over 100 high schools since I have been in office. I ask them, how many believe Medicare and Social Security will be here when you retire? Not a hand goes up. I ask them, how many believe in UFOs? And about 20 percent of the class raise their hand. They believe we are all just joking around, that any time a serious issue comes up about their long-term future, we run away. We hide behind our desk and wait for the bombs to explode around us. 
Stand up for the future. Stand up for these young people who pay and are going to be paying the rest of their lives very dearly for this program, and stand up and make sure it is healthy for them. 
I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, the budget reconciliation bill before us presents a historic opportunity to balance the budget, provide long overdue tax relief for families and ensure that important programs such as Medicare will be here for the next generation of Americans. I intend to support this legislation, but first, I would like to make a few comments about the Medicare provisions. 
We all know that Medicare is in serious trouble. For 2 1/2 years, we have been hearing that Medicare is going bankrupt. Today, we have an opportunity to do something to put Medicare back on the path to solvency. This bill calls for reasonable structural reforms of the Medicare program. It extends Medicare's solvency and promotes more choices for seniors--much like Members of Congress enjoy under the Federal Employee Health Benefits plan. If we truly care about Medicare--if we really mean it when we say that Medicare must be here for our children and grandchildren, then it's not enough to just talk about saving the program. We need to take action. And yes, we need to ask the baby boomers and today's young people--who I might add are already paying for a program which will not benefit them if we continue the status quo--to accept some structural changes that are absolutely necessary to protect and preserve this program. I commend those who have had the courage to come to the floor and explain these reforms in spite of what the special interest groups say. On behalf of the next generation, I thank my colleagues who are constructively working to solve Medicare's problems before it is too late. 
Mr. President, reforming Medicare is not just about saving money. It is also about improving seniors' choices in health plans and treatment options. One way to achieve these goals is by allowing Medicare reimbursements for orally administered anti-cancer drugs which cannot be produced in intravenous form (I.V.). Unfortunately, this change was not included in the bill before us. After considering that orally administered anti-cancer drugs would simultaneously enhance the quality of life for cancer patients and save a significant amount of money, I hope the conferees will include this proposal in the final reconciliation bill. 
Medicare's current policy with respect to coverage of anti-cancer drugs is outdated. Medicare pays for injectable and intravenous anti-cancer drugs. Several years ago, Medicare law was amended to also allow coverage for oral anti-cancer drugs, but only if they are available in intravenous form. This policy recognized that if a drug comes in both an oral and an I.V. form, it makes sense to provide coverage for the cheaper oral version instead of requiring patients to take the much more expensive and often more toxic I.V. version. Since then, researchers have developed oral anti-cancer drugs that are just as effective, easier to administer, and have fewer side effects, but are not--and cannot be--produced in I.V. form. Because they have no intravenous formulation, Medicare does not cover them. 
Efficacy, safety, and quality of life should be the primary factors when a patient and physician select the appropriate cancer treatment. Unfortunately, current Medicare policy forces many patients to make reimbursement the overriding factor. As a result, the patient is subjected to procedures which are more invasive, more expensive, and often less appropriate simply because Medicare will pay for it. At the same time, Medicare absorbs tens of thousands more in extra costs. For example, the cost of intravenous treatment for recurrent ovarian cancer ranges from $20,000 to $42,000 per patient per treatment course. At the same time, the oral therapeutic alternative--which does not come in I.V. form--costs just $3,300. If Medicare covered the oral alternative, the program could save between $17,000 and $39,000 per ovarian cancer patient, and the patient could enjoy a potentially better outcome and quality of life. Wealthy seniors can pay for the oral drug out-of-pocket if that is their preference, but most seniors do not have that luxury. 
Once again, I want to emphasize that when we talk about Medicare reform, we are not just talking about saving money. We also want to create incentives for individuals to seek the most appropriate care. Changing Medicare law to allow coverage of oral anti-cancer drugs meets both tests. I urge my colleagues to incorporate this change in conference. The Health Care Financing Administration supports it. Cancer patients deserve it. Medicare would save money because of it. There is no reason not to do it. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

 Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments of Senate business to congratulate a group of middle school students from Philadelphia. On April 29, the Roberts Vaux Middle School Chess Team won first place in their K-8 division at the National Scholastic Chess Championship in Knoxville, TN. Competing against 4,300 students from almost every State in the Union, team members also earned individual awards for the third and sixth best players in the Nation, as well as for the top sixth and eighth graders in their sections. Additionally, Vaux's Salome Thomas-El won a coach's award. 
Collectively known as the Mighty Bishops, or the `Bad Bishops,' Demetrius Carroll, Charles Mabine, Earl Jenkins, Anthony Harper, Anwar Smith, Denise Pickard, Latoria Spann, Alisca Shropshire, Tanisha Edwards, Tyeisha Falligan, Donzell White, Thomas Allen, and Ralph Johnson have worked hard for this victory. For instance, the Mighty Bishops practiced at least 5 days per week for 3 hours each day. They used a library of chess books and some computer programs to learn strategies for all aspects of the game. More importantly, they sharpened their problem solving, critical thinking, and decisionmaking skills--skills that will help them not only in competition, but also in life. 
Prior to winning the national championship, the team secured significant victories at other competitions. This past January, the Mighty Bishops received first place individual and fourth place team trophies at the Greater New York Junior High Chess Championship. At the U.S. Amateur Team Championship in Parsippany, NJ, Vaux received the top record of any middle school. I would also note that the Mighty Bishops placed second at the Pennsylvania State Championships. 
Mr. President, I am proud of these students. These bright young people are a credit to themselves, their school, their families, and their community. I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the Mighty Bishops and in extending the Senate's best wishes for continued success.

 Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, in 1979, Congress created an award which is specifically designed for young people. This special program, the Congressional Award, recognizes young Americans who make commitments to community service and self-improvement. I would like to take a few moments of Senate business to discuss this program and the important role it plays in promoting volunteerism. 
The Congressional Award is a non-partisan, public-private partnership which teaches young people that they can make a difference in their communities. The program is noncompetitive. Participants set individual goals based on their own abilities. Once these goals are achieved, they can earn bronze, silver, or gold medals. I would emphasize that each Congressional Award is earned--not won. Any 14- to 23-year-old, regardless of their life circumstances or physical and mental abilities, can earn the award. 
Mr. President, this program truly promotes community service. Since the first award was presented in 1982, 1.5 million hours have been attributed to volunteerism. In the last 12 months alone, recipients of the Congressional Award throughout the country performed more than 63,000 hours of community service. Some examples of the volunteer projects include assisting elderly shut-ins, distributing food for the needy, producing a handbook of volunteer opportunities at the United Way, and donating a narcotics K-9 to a sheriff's department. 
Recently, I have chartered the Congressional Award Program in my own State, along with the other members of the Pennsylvania delegation. I encourage each of my colleagues to promote this valuable program. The Congressional Award benefits everyone involved--the participants, their adult sponsors, and the communities at large. I would also note that while this program is a public-private partnership, it does not receive its funding from the Government. It is funded entirely through the private sector. 
Not long ago, I had the honor of participating in the Volunteer Summit in Philadelphia, PA. The success of this event suggests that Americans are eager to help those in need. They simply need more information about how to do so. 
Mr. President, I am a strong advocate of volunteerism, and I sincerely believe that this program inspires a sense of civic responsibility in our young people. The Congressional Award is an effort Congress can be proud it initiated on behalf of our next generation. By working together, we can make this volunteer opportunity and learning experience available to all young Americans.

 Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, the Northeast Peanut League [NEPL] will celebrate its annual All-Star Day on June 8. I would like to take a few moments of Senate business to recognize the NEPL and to discuss the opportunities it offers to more than 7,000 boys and girls between the ages of 5 and 16 in the Philadelphia area. 
Founded in 1981, the NEPL provides recreational activities for children who are not as advanced in their athletic abilities. This organization is based on the concept of simply having fun. The league makes sports a positive learning experience by enhancing the emotional, physical, social, and educational well-being of children. These teams allow children to realize their potential in elaborate all-star events, playoff games, and league awards. In short, the NEPL provides a nurturing environment where all children--regardless of their physical or mental abilities--can play, develop a sense of pride, and receive the fanfare previously reserved for the `A' leagues. 
Another important service the NEPL provides is substance abuse education. Each year, the league distributes thousands of drug prevention brochures to the children and their parents. Moreover, the league sponsors essay contests which encourage children to express their concerns about the drug epidemic. Winners of this essay contest and the Youth Work Award receive their prizes on the annual All-Star Day. 
Mr. President, I commend the Northeast Peanut League for the athletic and educational opportunities it offers to the children of Philadelphia. I ask my colleagues to join me in extending the Senate's best wishes for continued success to the children, coaches, parents, officials, staff, and sponsors of the Northeast Peanut League.

 Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, our nation's children are turning to crime and violence at alarming rates. Perhaps more than ever before, young people need direction from good men and women in their communities who are willing to get involved. They need role models to help them understand that an honest life is not an easy life, but it is a better life. Fortunately, there are people and groups who are reaching out to at-risk youth. Today, I rise to commend the efforts of one such organization. The Philadelphia Martin Luther King, Jr. Association for Nonviolence is making a difference, one child at a time. 
On April 4, the anniversary of Dr. King's assassination, the Association for Nonviolence sponsored a `Youth and the Culture of Violence' town meeting. This event brought a cross-section of the community together to discuss violence prevention programs, current statistics on youth violence, and new ideas for training young people to solve their problems peacefully. Teenagers from the Philadelphia area joined community leaders, educators, juvenile justice officers, psychologists, and other concerned citizens in this important outreach effort. 
Almost 30 years ago, Dr. King gave his life for his dream of a non-violent world. Through peaceful protest, he changed the heart of a nation. Dr. King's dream of a just, peaceful society lives on through the work of those who continue to teach his principle of non-violence. It is fitting that the organization which bears his name is reaching out and offering hope to a new generation. 
Mr. President, I commend the Philadelphia Martin Luther King, Jr. Association for Nonviolence for addressing the issue of youth violence. I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the important work this organization has done and in extending the Senate's best wishes for continued success to the men and women who have dedicated their lives to preventing youth violence.

 Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to reaffirm my support for the tireless effort of the Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Association of Lehigh Valley to fight chronic fatigue and immune dysfunction syndrome [CFIDS], or Chronic Fatigue Syndrome [CFS]. 
For five years, the CFS Association of Lehigh Valley has been dedicated to finding a cure for CFIDS, increasing public awareness, and supporting victims of this disease. The Lehigh Valley organization is actively involved in CFS-related research. In addition, they regularly participate in seminars to train health care professionals. Public education is an essential aspect of the association's mission. For instance, they arranged the broadcast of a video documentary about CFIDS on public television. Likewise, the Lehigh Valley organization raises public awareness through the International CFIDS Awareness Day, which is held on May 12 each year. I would also note that the CFS Association of Lehigh Valley received the CFIDS Support Network Action Award in both 1995 and 1996 for their initiatives in public advocacy. 
Although researchers have made some advances in the study of this condition, CFIDS remains a mysterious illness. Presently, there is no known cause or cure. Victims experience a wide range of symptoms including extreme fatigue, fever, muscle and joint pain, cognitive and neurological problems, tender lymph nodes, nausea, and vertigo. Recently, the Centers for Disease Control gave CFIDS `Priority 1' status in the new infectious disease category, which also includes cholera, malaria, hepatitis C and tuberculosis. Until this disease is obliterated, the CFS Association of Lehigh Valley will continue its research and education campaigns.

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, this is an amendment that I took the floor yesterday to talk about. It is an amendment that I worked out, along with Senator Frist and Representative Canady in the House, and with the American Medical Association to tighten up some of the language to address some of the concerns that the physician community had about the definition of what is partial-birth abortion. 
I believe it is a good amendment, whether it would have gotten the AMA endorsement or not. I think it is a good amendment because I think it is language that is much tighter, and puts in the requisite mens rea, or thought processes that the physician must have been going through at the time of doing the procedure. I think that is important for a criminal statute. 
I think it would be a sad state if, in fact, we passed this legislation and overrode the President's veto, or if the President would see otherwise and decide to sign the bill, that, in fact, this bill would be thrown out for vagueness of criminality, the criminal statute itself would be considered too vague, and it would be OK on the abortion ground but not OK on the criminal statute ground. But I think what we have done is tighten up the language and have taken care of the concerns mentioned here, both on the House and Senate floors, about the vagueness of the statute. 
I don't think anyone will now look at this as a vague statute. It is a very precise statute. It is a complete criminal statute now. 
I am very happy that we were able to work it out, and in working with the AMA I believe we have improved the bill and improved its chances when we reach the stage of the courts which I am very hopeful that we will do because that means that we will have passed the bill and it would have been signed into law, and the President's veto would have been overridden. 
Of the other two provisions in the bill, one clarifies the life of the mother exception and takes out some surplus language which we agreed to which didn't add anything, and we agreed that it was, in fact, surplus language. 
The third element of the amendment deals with the issue of a medical review panel; if a medical review panel was asked by the AMA for the reason of an intermediary step between the indictment of the physician under the statute and a trial. This would be an opportunity for State medical boards to put together a panel of physicians to look at what happened in the case, to do a peer review determination of the procedures that was done by the physician being charged, and to come up with findings. Those findings would then be admissible in court. 
I think that is an appropriate step. It gives the professionals in the field who license, in fact, the physician, an opportunity to make a review of what happened in the context of that as well as add medical expertise to be considered at trial. I think that is only helpful. The fact of the matter is that we are all aware that, if someone is charged under this statute, they are going to have their medical experts testify as to one set of circumstances and the prosecution will have their medical experts. 
So, with having some neutral party, if you will, come up with a more objective standard of review I think helps and provides a professional review of what took place in a case. 
So I think we are making a step forward. 
I am not aware of any objections to this amendment. Whether you are for, or against this amendment, it is a technical amendment in most respects. It is one that hopefully will be supported by everyone. 
I yield the floor at this point to determine whether anyone wants to speak against the amendment. 
I understand now there is no one to speak against the amendment. So I ask unanimous consent the amendment be agreed to.

Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Chair. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
Let me first start out by indicating how important I believe the endorsement of the AMA is here as we approach final passage of this legislation. We have heard over and over and over again that the principal reason this procedure needs to be made legal is to protect the health of the mother. We have in the case of the AMA an organization that is on record as being for abortion rights. This is not the Christian Coalition. This is not the Catholic Conference of Bishops. This is an organization of physicians that is on record as being for a woman's right to choose, if you will, that has come out and said this procedure is not good medicine, this procedure is not necessary to protect the life or health of a mother. So for all of the arguments that we have heard that there is a split of opinion out there as to whether this is an appropriate procedure, I have put forward letter after letter after letter from obstetricians, from perinatologists, experts in maternal fetal medicine who have said that this procedure is never medically indicated, that in fact this procedure is more dangerous to the mother. I will discuss those things today. 
Now I believe the charade is over. We have the preeminent medical authority, organization in the country saying that this procedure should be outlawed; there is no medical reason to keep this procedure legal. 
That is a very powerful statement which debunks all of the arguments people might want to hide behind in saying that, yes, they agree this procedure is brutal; yes, they agree this is barbaric and should never be used, but we want to leave open the possibility that in the case of, and then they go on with the health concerns. 
What we know for a fact is that 90 percent of partial-birth abortions are not done for any health-related reasons. Let me clarify that. Ron Fitzsimmons, who heads up an abortion provider organization of some 200 abortion clinics, said that 90 percent of partial-birth abortions occur in the fifth and sixth months of pregnancy on healthy mothers with healthy babies. They are for birth control purposes. This is fifth- and sixth-month abortions for birth control purposes where you take a baby out, deliver it all but the head and then take a pair of scissors and stab the baby in the base of the skull, suction its brains out and kill it for birth control purposes, not for health reasons. 
Those are what we know as the facts, that information provided to us by people who oppose the bill. These are not facts people who oppose abortion are putting forward. These are people who are adamantly pro-choice who run the clinics where some of these abortions take place, providing us with the information contrary to what you have heard, statements in the Chamber that these are done for the health of the mother, that 90 percent of them are done for birth control purposes, late in pregnancy. The other percentage is done later in pregnancy, and they argue, most of the reasons you hear, because of a fetal abnormality. All of the cases that you hear described with the pictures of the family are the baby was going to die anyway or the baby had a severe defect and that we should allow abortions in those situations, this kind of brutal abortion in those situations because the baby is not perfect or may not live long. 
That takes us off into another area that I think has very, very severe consequences for this country, when we start to say that we should be able to kill children because they are not perfect or that abortions should be legal up until the time of delivery; that we should be able to do this brutal procedure because the little baby may not live long or may have medical complications. 
I found it absolutely ironic that the day the partial-birth abortion ban came to the floor of the Senate, minutes before we passed the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act. What is that? That is an act to guarantee civil rights, the right for disabled children to be educated so they can maximize their 
human potential. The very same day 30-some Senators who voted for that legislation and advocated giving rights to the disabled, those same 30-some Senators who are against the partial-birth abortion ban said we are willing to give you rights if you survive the womb, but we are not going to give you any rights as a disabled child up until the time you are born. You are eligible to be killed just because of your disability. You are different than any other child. If you are a child that is normal, then they do not believe you have a right to be killed. In fact, that is what these amendments are that we heard about. Well, if the baby is healthy and the mother is healthy, we need a health exception. If the baby is fine and the mom is fine, then we do not believe the baby should be killed. If the baby is abnormal, we can kill it. 
These are the same people who believe in special civil rights for the disabled. I do not know how you legitimately can stand and argue those two points. I do not know how you draw the line there with any sense of consistency of care for the disabled. I support IDEA. I support civil rights for the disabled because I know that there are challenges out there, but there is no greater challenge to the disabled in this country today than the challenge of getting born in the first place. And I will discuss, as I have before, Donna Joy Watts and her family and how they had to overcome incredible odds and adversity beyond what you would imagine in this country just to have this little girl born and be treated because she was seen as disabled, not viable, not important to our society. 
I want to talk in specific about the health issue because I think it is important, it is the remaining barrier that many Members hide behind in not supporting the partial-birth abortion bill because it does not have a `health exception.' Let me explain, No. 1, we have the American Medical Association on record now supporting this bill, saying there need not be a health exception to this bill, this bill takes care of all the problems that we as physicians see and that there is no health reason to do this procedure. 
Let me share with you a statement from Dr. Camilla C. Hersh, who is a member of the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology. She says, and I quote from her statement:  
I think it is obvious that for the baby this is a horrible way to die, brutally and painfully killed by having one's head stabbed open and one's brains suctioned out. 
But for the woman, this is a mortally dangerous and life threatening act. 
Partial-birth abortion is a partially blind procedure, done by feel, thereby risking direct scissor injury to the mother's uterus and laceration of the cervix or lower uterine segment. Either the scissors or the bony shards or spickules of the baby's perforated and disrupted skull bones can roughly rip into the large blood vessels which supply the lower part of the lush pregnant uterus, resulting in immediate and massive bleeding and the threat of shock, immediate hysterectomy, blood transfusion and even death to the mother. 
Portions of the baby's sharp bony skull pieces can remain embedded in the mother's cervix, setting up a complicated infection as the bony fragments decompose. 
Think of the emotional agony for the woman, both immediately and for years afterward, who endures this process over a period of several days. 
None of this nauseating risk is ever necessary for any reason. Obstetrician-gynecologists like myself across the U.S. regularly treat women whose unborn children suffer the same conditions as those cited by the proponents of the procedure. 
Never-- 
I underline the word-- is the partial-birth abortion procedure necessary: 
Not for polyhydramnios (an excess of amniotic fluid collecting around the baby), . . . 
Not for anencephaly (an abnormality characterized by the absence of the top portion of the baby's brain and skull), 
Not for hydrocephaly (excessive cerebrospinal fluid in the head). 
In the case of Donna Joy Watts, I would parenthetically say she had hydrocephaly. Her parents were counseled to have an abortion. They chose not to. They had the baby delivered and she is now 5 1/2 years old. 
Sometimes, as in the case of hydrocephaly, it is first necessary to drain some of the fluid from the baby's head with a special long needle, to allow safe vaginal delivery. In some cases, when vaginal delivery is not possible, a doctor performs a Cesarean section. But in no case is it necessary or medically advisable to partially deliver an infant through the vagina and then to cruelly kill the infant. 
The legislation proposed clearly distinguishes the procedure being banned from recognized standard obstetric techniques. I must point out, even for those who support abortion for elective or medical reasons at any point in pregnancy, current recognized abortion techniques would be unaffected by the proposed ban. 
Any proponent of such a dangerous procedure is at the least seriously misinformed about medical reality or at worst so consumed by narrow minded `abortion-at-any-cost' activism to be criminally negligent. 
This procedure is blatant and cruel infanticide and must be against the law. 
Again, this is a statement by Camilla C. Hersh, an obstetrician-gynecologist practicing here in northern Virginia. 
And other statements by other medical doctors in cases that were mentioned here on this floor as reasons that partial-birth abortion must continue to be legal. And I have this as a note. Senator Feinstein brought up the case of preeclampsia, and I have a letter here from Dr. Steve Calvin, MD, who is a specialist in maternal fetal medicine. 
What does that mean? A specialist in high-risk pregnancies. These are people who deal with the very difficult cases that come up in pregnancy where the mother's life and health and the baby's life and health are in jeopardy during pregnancy. 
Dr. Calvin responds to Senator Feinstein's claim that preeclampsia is a reason to do a partial-birth abortion. 
Preeclampsia (with any number of its complications, including renal failure), cardiomyopathy, breast cancer, and lymphoma are all potential maternal medical disorders that may complicate pregnancy. In some situations the pregnancy must be ended to save the life of the mother. 
The proposed ban on this destructive procedure already includes an exemption for the so far theoretical instance when it may be necessary to save a pregnant woman's life. The opponents of the ban realize that they cannot prevail on the merits of their arguments and are therefore resorting to blowing a virtual blizzard of medical terms during the debate. They hope to overwhelm the media and the public so that the fundamental points are missed. I will not try to answer them point by point on each medical condition. The importance of protecting nearly born fetal life is crucial. 
Especially in light of Lori Watts' and Donna Joy Watts' story. 
The fact of the matter is that it is never medically necessary, under any of these conditions, according to Dr. Calvin and dozens of others who are specialists in maternal fetal medicine. As Dr. Calvin said in another letter, none of these procedures are done by groups that specialize in high-risk pregnancies. They are not done in universities. They are not done in hospitals that specialize in these kinds of problems. They are done in abortion clinics. They are not done by experts in maternal fetal medicine, perinatologists; they are done by abortionists at abortion clinics who are not experts in high-risk pregnancies. 
In fact, this procedure was developed not by an obstetrician/gynecologist, not by someone who is an expert in maternal fetal medicine who is concerned about the life and health of the mother; this was developed by a family practitioner who does abortions at an abortion clinic for the convenience of the abortionist. 
So all of these claims about health are just simply a smokescreen. There is no health reason to do this procedure. In fact, as Dr. Hersh says, and hundreds of other physicians have said, obstetricians and gynecologists, including--he is not an obstetrician; that is, C. Everett Koop, the former Surgeon General of the United States, is not an obstetrician. But what is he? A pediatric surgeon who has done surgery on all these little babies who have had these disabilities and saw high-risk pregnancies firsthand, dealt with the consequences of these pregnancies, so he knows the issue well. He said, as well as hundreds of other doctors, that it is never medically necessary. I would like to read the entire quote signed by, I believe, at least a dozen experts in maternal fetal medicine, a group of almost 500 physicians, including Dr. Koop, and obstetricians who oppose partial-birth abortion: 
While it may become necessary, in the second or third trimester, to end a pregnancy in order to protect the mother's life or health, abortion is never required--i.e., it is never medically necessary, in order to preserve a women's life, health or future fertility, to deliberately kill an unborn child in the second and third trimester, and certainly not by mostly delivering the child before putting him or her to death. What is required in the circumstances specified by-- 
Senator Daschle, Senator Boxer, Senator Feinstein and others-- 
 is separation of the child from the mother, not the death of the child. 
Let me just put it simply, for purposes of this particular debate, while a mother may present herself in a condition that may require separation of the child from the mother, it is not necessary to kill the child in that process, to use partial-birth abortion. I don't know why any doctor who is practicing good, solid medicine would deliberately reach in and pull the baby out in the breech position to deliver the child while the mother's life is in danger, while you go through a 3-day process of dilating the cervix over 2 days, risking infection because the cervix is now dilated and the womb is exposed to infection, risking infection, No. 1; No. 2, risking an incompetent cervix, which means the inability to carry future children. 
Unfortunately, one of the reasons cited by President Clinton as needing this procedure to save her health and future fertility was a woman who has had five miscarriages since that procedure was done to her. To make the argument this is necessary for that is just not true. But a woman presents herself with a health problem, and for 2 days, to say, `Here are some pills, we're going to dilate your cervix, go home, present yourself back after 2 days,' where you risk increased infection and increased complications, `come back to the abortion clinic'--not a hospital, because these are not done at hospitals--`come back to the abortion clinic to have this procedure done.' And then what happens? The baby is pulled out feet first, delivered all but the head. 
Why would you, even if you decided to go through that procedure for the health of the mother, why would you, as Dr. Hersh suggests, why would you take a blunt instrument in a blind procedure and stab the baby blindly in the base of the skull, causing all of the damage that could occur, as Dr. Hersh has set forth? Why would you do that? Why wouldn't you just deliver the head and give the baby a chance to live? It may not live. But at least give it the dignity of being born and accepted into our human community without this brutality, this unwarranted, unnecessary, unhealthful, dangerous, brutal stabbing and killing of a baby who is this far away, 3 inches away, from its first breath. Yes, its first breath. Even at 20 weeks, babies live. It is considered a live birth even at 20 weeks. Babies will not be able to survive long because they don't have sufficient lung development, but that baby will be alive when it is born unless 
you kill it. 
Why kill the baby when it is more dangerous to the mother to do that, when it presents more complications to do it? Why does that option have to be necessary that is more dangerous to her health? Why would we want to keep a procedure legal that threatens a woman's health, that is an absolutely rogue procedure, not done by specialists, not done in hospitals, developed by a nonobstetrician? Why do we want to keep this legal? What possible reason do we want to say that we need to endanger a woman's health to allow this procedure to be legal? The only reason I can think of is what Dr. Hersh said, and I will quote from her again because I think she said it very, very well: 
Any proponent of such a dangerous procedure is at the least seriously misinformed about medical reality or at worst-- 
And I daresay that we may be looking, certainly in the case of the abortion rights advocates, we are looking at our `at worst' here-- at worst, so consumed by narrow minded `abortion-at-any-cost' activism, to be criminally negligent. 
There is no health reason to do this. Anybody who stands up on the floor in the face of now the AMA, hundreds of obstetricians and gynecologists, specialists in maternal fetal medicine, who stand up in the face of overwhelming evidence that this procedure is necessary, given the characteristics of the procedure, a rogue procedure, not done in hospitals, not done by specialists, done by family practitioners or people who have no speciality at all in delivering children, just doing abortions, you are defending not the health of the mother when you argue that, you are not defending the life of the mother, you are defending, as Dr. Hersh says, abortion at any cost, any time, anywhere for any reason; that the child, no matter how late, no matter how healthy, is not to be considered. 
That is not where America is. I know where the majority of the Senate is. We will find out today whether it is where 67 Senators are, because that is the magic number, 67. We need 67 votes to override the President's veto.

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, we are now down to 36 minutes of debate on both sides. And I agreed with the other side that I would take up some of the time to bring down some of our time. 
I want to bring up a point, discuss a point that I believe is very important for two reasons: No. 1, I think it is important that Members understand the issues of constitutionality that have been raised by some about this legislation and whether it is constitutional in light of Roe versus Wade and Doe versus Bolton and other decisions on the subject of abortion; and, No. 2, I want to put down a marker for this piece of legislation when it does, if it does, any time in the near future go before the courts. 
I hope that by the actions of the Senate today, and hopefully the actions of the President later on, that he will now decide to sign this legislation in light of all the new evidence that has been presented since his initial veto. 
I wanted to discuss some of the elements of constitutionality, and in so discussing, I would like to read a letter that was sent to Senator Orrin Hatch, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, by 62 law professors from universities all over the country, to state to Senator Hatch their opinion on the constitutionality of the statute. 
I will remark that this letter was written May 8, prior to the amendment that we adopted here on the bill today which I believe tightens the language up even more and makes it more impregnable to constitutional overruling by the courts. 
I will read the letter sent to Senator Hatch: 
Dear Senator: We write to you as law professors in support of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. S 6. We do not write as partisans. We are both Democrats and Republicans, and we are of different minds of various aspects of the abortion issue. We are concerned, however, that baseless legal arguments are being offered to oppose a ban on partial-birth abortions, and we are unanimous in concluding that such a ban is constitutional. 
We have learned that some Senators are concerned about claims that a ban on second trimester partial-birth abortions, or a ban on third trimester procedures without a `health' exception, would be unconstitutional under Roe v. Wade and later abortion decisions. 
The destruction of human beings who are partially born is, in our judgment, entirely, outside the legal framework established in Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey. No Supreme Court decision, including these, ever addressed the constitutionally of forbidding the killing of partially born children. In fact. Roe noted explicitly that it did not decide the constitutionality of that part of the Texas law which forbade--and still forbids--killing a child in the process of delivery. 
Continuing on. 
Even should a court in the future decide that a law banning the partial-birth procedure is to be evaluated within the Roe Casey `abortion' framework, we believe such a ban would survive legal scrutiny thereunder. The partial-birth procedure entails mechanical cervical dilation, forcing a breech delivery, and exposing a mother to severe bleeding from exposure to shards of her child's crushed skill. Before viability, an abortion restriction is unconstitutional only if it creates a `undue burden' on the judicially established right to have an abortion. A targeted ban of a single, maternal-health-endangering procedure cannot constitute such a burden. 
To the extent of its constitutionally delegated authority, Congress may also ban all forms of abortion after viability, subject to the health and life interests of the mother. Under the most recent Supreme Court decision concerning abortion. Planned Parenthood v. Casey, there is no reason to assume that the Supreme Court would interpret a post-viability health exception to require the government to tolerate a procedure which gives zero weight to the life of a partially-born child an which itself poses severe maternal health risks. Furthermore, according to published medical testimony, including that of former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop `Partial-birth abortion is never medically necessary to protect a mother's health or future fertility. On the contrary, this procedure can pose a significant threat to both her immediate health and future fertility.' Even the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists--which opposes the bill--acknolwedges that partial-birth abortion is never the `only option to save the life or preserve the health of the woman.' Banning this procedure does not compromise a mother's health interests. It protects those interests. 
In short, while individuals may have ideological or political reasons to oppose banning the partial-birth procedure, those objections should not, in good conscience, be disguised as legal or constitutional in nature.

Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator from Indiana for his excellent work. I want to address a couple issues the Senator from California raised. 
One, she mentioned support of the American College of Gynecologists. I have 50 letters here from fellows of that organization who are outraged at the organization for the position they have taken. We have a group of over 500 obstetricians and gynecologists who have signed on saying they are supporting the ban on partial-birth abortions and are also outraged at the position taken by the board here in Washington that was not voted on by the general membership. 
So I just suggest that this, as the Senator from California noted but I want to reemphasize, is not speaking for all 
physicians, certainly not all obstetricians and gynecologists, because we have read plenty of statements from them as to why this procedure is never medically necessary. 
She went through her facts. Let me tell you the first fact. This is not about abortion. This is about infanticide. This is about taking a baby that is born, in the process of being born, four-fifths outside of the mother, moving outside of the mother and killing that baby. We can talk about abortion. I know the Senator likes to get it back to the issue of abortion. The reason we believe, as I just read a letter from 62 law professors, it is not governed by Roe versus Wade is because the baby now has rights. It is being born. So do not keep focusing back on this issue of abortion. This is about infanticide. 
If the Senate today does not muster up the moral courage for 67 votes, it will be validating infanticide--not the woman's right to choose, infanticide. 
As one of the listed facts, the Senator from California said the fact is this procedure is done by obstetricians and gynecologists acting in the best interests of the mother to save her life or health. That is not a fact, and we all know that. Even people who support the position of the Senator from California know that is not a fact, admit it is not a fact. It is very difficult to get engaged in a real debate when the other side keeps using misinformation about what is going on here. 
Ron Fitzsimmons, the director of an association of 200 clinics, said that 90 percent of the abortions done, partial-birth abortions done, are done on healthy mothers and healthy babies in the 5th and 6th months of pregnancy for birth control reasons. 
Now, that is not, as the Senator from California suggested, a procedure done by obstetricians and gynecologists. 
Let me make a parenthetical remark there. This procedure was not invented by an obstetrician or gynecologist. It was invented by a family practitioner who does abortions. Obstetricians and gynecologists do not do this procedure. This is not done in hospitals. It is done in clinics, not by, in many cases, obstetricians and gynecologists. So to suggest that this procedure is done by obstetricians and gynecologists acting in the best interests of the mother and that's the fact is not in fact the case. 
This is done by abortionists--some of whom are obstetricians, many of whom are not--who perform in clinics, not in hospitals, who do it on healthy mothers and healthy babies. Those are the facts. That is why this is such a troubling debate today. That is why we have seen the movement across this country and in the Senate today, because the alleged facts that the Senator from California was offering again as the truth muddy the waters a little bit. But now we know what the real truth is from people who support her position. But yet we keep hearing these repeated allegations that have no basis in reality anymore, but they still find themselves on the Senate floor as a defense for an indefensible procedure, and this procedure is indefensible. 
Mr. President, we have heard comments about women who suffered with a pregnancy that had gone tragic. Let me first say that my heart goes out to each and every one of the people whose picture we have seen displayed on the floor of the Senate. I know, I know personally the difficulty that these families face with a child that you hoped for and dreamed for and had something go wrong; that a life that you had hoped to be with and to mother and father would be cut short. I know what they went through. 
I am just suggesting that the fact that the women came to testify, not the doctors, tells you something about the medical reality of what occurred. You have not seen any of these doctors who did these procedures come to the U.S. Senate, the House, or anyplace in a public arena and talk about what they did, because they know that they would not stand the light of day in front of any peer review. In fact, none of these procedures is peer reviewed. None of them is peer reviewed. None of these cases has been peer reviewed, none of them. They would not open up to any discussion by other experts in the field as to whether they acted correctly. 
That is the problem, you see. We hide behind the emotion, and it is real, tragic, and I empathize, but we are hiding behind emotion when we are talking about the life and death of little babies. We owe it to them, we owe it to these mothers who are dealing with these tragic situations today to talk about the facts, to let the light shine in as to what are really the options, what is really necessary, not to hide behind pictures and emotional pleas that have no basis in medical fact, in medical practice. 
I will give you a counterexample. This is a little baby girl, named Donna Joy Watts, who was born with hydrocephaly, the same condition that some of the children of the people Senator Boxer shared had. Her mother and father, Lori and Donny Watts, refused to abort this child. The genetics counselor and the obstetrician suggested a partial-birth abortion for this little baby. They said she couldn't survive, she wouldn't live. She had to go to four hospitals--four places--just to get this baby delivered. They wouldn't deliver her baby. 
We worry so much about the right to choose. How about the right to choose life, to give your baby a chance? Well, Donny and Lori fought for this chance. This baby was born finally by cesarean section. And, by the way, the issue of future fertility, we hear that a lot, Lori and Donny now have another little baby. But this little baby was born and hooked up to IV's to give hydration to, water to, and for 3 days. These doctors, who will never come to testify before the Congress, all these doctors who recommend abortion, who never come to justify before a peer review panel what they do, called this little baby 
lying there breathing a fetus for 3 days. Do you want to know what some of the obstetricians and gynecologists think about little babies who are just not perfect? They called this baby a fetus 3 days after it was born. It is not a fetus, it is a baby. What they wanted to do was kill this baby by stabbing her in the base of her skull and suctioning her brains out, and Lori and Donny said no. 
Through a lot of hard work, a lot of pain, a lot of suffering, a lot of forcing them to treat her daughter because they wouldn't treat her for 3 days, 5 1/2 years later, this is little Donna Joy Watts, who is in my office right now. She would have been up in the gallery of the Senate were it not for the objection of the Senator from California prohibiting her from being there. She is in my office and watching this debate. She is watching to see whether the U.S. Senate is going to allow other doctors to misinform their mommies and daddies so we won't have other little Donna Joy Wattses to be with us, to ennoble us, to give us pride in our culture and in our civilization, that we care even for those who are like little Donna Joy--who runs around and plays in my office, who colors with my kids--but just didn't have the chance. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I just suggest the American Medical Association and the other hundreds of doctors understand the point that seems to elude the Members of this Chamber. By outlawing this procedure they are, in fact, protecting the health of the mother, because this is an unhealthy procedure, this is a dangerous procedure. This procedure, as said by over 500 physicians `is never medically necessary, in order to preserve a woman's life, health or future fertility, to deliberately kill an unborn child in the second and third trimester, and certainly not by mostly delivering the child before putting him or her to death.' 
I will quote another obstetrician/gynecologist, Dr. Camilla Hersh: 
Any proponent of such a dangerous procedure is at least seriously misinformed about medical reality or at worst so consumed by narrow minded `abortion-at-any-cost' activism to be criminally negligent. 
What we are doing here is, in fact, advocating for the life health of the mother by banning a procedure which is a rogue procedure, not performed at hospitals, performed at abortion clinics, not even performed by obstetricians, invented by someone who is not an obstetrician. That is why the AMA wrote to me yesterday supporting H.R. 1122 as it now appears on the floor of the U.S. Senate saying: 
Thank you for the opportunity to work with you toward restriction of a procedure we all agree is not good medicine. 
In other words, it is not in the interest of the health or life of the mother to do this procedure. It is wrong to do this procedure. It is immoral to do this procedure because you are killing a little baby. You are killing a baby that is fourth-fifths born, that is moving outside of its mother. How can we accept that when there are other options available? 
As I suggested before, here is living proof of other options available: a little girl who is here today on Capitol Hill, who will be right out here by the elevators during that vote. I ask Members to go over and to look into her eyes, to talk to her, because if her parents would have listened to all the expert doctors who knew what was best for their child, she wouldn't be here today. 
She would have had this brutality, this violence, this vile procedure done on this innocent little girl who now walks and talks and writes notes--`Donna' with a hand there, reaching out asking that this procedure not be made available, so little girls like her, little boys like her, be given a chance at life. 
The Senator from California said, these kids who are not well enough to make it. Who are we to decide whether they are well enough to make it? Who are we to say they should die because they are not perfect? 
Give them a chance. Give them the dignity of being born and brought into this world with love, not violence and brutality. Give them a chance. Give them a chance. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to announce that in the last few days I have been working with Representative Canady in the House, with Senator Frist here in the Senate, and with the American Medical Association in trying to work out some changes to H.R. 1122, the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, which would satisfy some of the concerns that the board at the American Medical Association had with the legislation. 
I am very pleased to report that we have been able to reach some technical changes with the legislation that has gained the support of the American Medical Association. I will read for the Record and insert into the Record a copy of a letter that was sent to me just a very short time ago from P. John Seward, M.D., executive vice president of the American Medical Association. 
Dear Senator Santorum: The American Medical Association (AMA) is writing to support HR 1122, `The Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1997,' as amended. Although our general policy is to oppose legislation criminalizing medical practice or procedure, the AMA has supported such legislation where the procedure was narrowly defined and not medically indicated. HR 1122 now meets both those tests. 
Our support of this legislation is based on three specific principles. First, the bill would allow a legitimiate exception where the life of the mother was endangered, thereby preserving the physician's judgment to take any medically necessary steps to save the life of the mother. Second, the bill would clearly define the prohibited procedure so that it is clear on the face of the legislation what act is to be banned. Finally, the bill would give any accused physician the right to have his or her conduct reviewed by the State Medical Board before a criminal trial commenced. In this manner, the bill would provide a formal role for valuable medical peer determination in any enforcement proceeding. 
The AMA believes that with these changes, physicians will be on notice as to the exact nature of the prohibited conduct. 
Thank you for the opportunity to work with you towards restricting a procedure we all agree is not good medicine. 
Sincerely, P. John Seward, M.D.

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, before I go into the details of the amendment, let me also enter into the Record a statement by Senator Bill Frist. 
I cannot emphasize enough how important he has been as the only physician here in the U.S. Senate in helping us in the debate here on the Senate floor and providing that expertise that is so necessary in these kinds of medical issues, and also in helping us work with the AMA to come up with some language that could garner their support. 
I quote Senator Frist's statement. He would have been here to announce this. But I understand we are going to be closing up shortly, and he is still on an airplane. 
As the only physician in the Senate, I am proud of the American Medical Association's decision to support the ban on partial birth abortions. This is the strongest medical confirmation yet that this so-called medical procedure, is brutal, inhumane, and medically unnecessary. As I said on the floor of the United States Senate, any provider who performs a partial birth abortion has violated the Hippocratic principle, `First do no harm.' 
The President has already been standing on shaky ground in his efforts to explain his intent to veto once again a ban of this grisly and unnecessary procedure. With these technical changes and the endorsement of the AMA, it's time for the President to do the right thing--it's time for him to sign this bill. 
Mr. President, let me go through the changes that are in the bill that we are going to amend tomorrow morning. We hope to get unanimous consent to amend it. These are technical changes, and we believe that, irrespective of your position on the bill, these are changes that can be supported. 
The first thing this bill does, as has been referred to, is to tighten up the language on what we mean by partial-birth abortion. There was some concern principally about a situation where the doctor would be delivering a baby with a normal delivery, but the baby would be delivered breech. And that happens on occasion. The baby is delivered in a breech position. The concern is that some complication may occur in the course of this breech delivery, and the doctor would be required, in order to save the mother's life, to perform some sort of procedure that would result in the killing of the baby. 
Those are always very terrible situations. But the AMA was concerned that, because the definition was not specific enough from their reading, some zealous prosecutor could come out and accuse the doctor, who has not performed an abortion--does not intend to perform an abortion--but performed a normal delivery and, because of a complication, that somehow he or she could be covered under this act. 
We have tightened up the language with mens rea, to use the legal term. That directs the mental state--as to what the doctor was doing when he was delivering the baby for the purpose of a live birth and is not doing an abortion. 
So we tightened that language up substantially to satisfy that. That kind of situation would no longer be covered under the act. Frankly, I don't believe it is covered under the original act. But this makes it crystal clear that it is not covered under the act. 
I think to the extent that we have made that clear and that it is positive to the extent that we have put in the requisite mens rea for a criminal statute, which arguably was somewhat vague in the original bill, we have now done that. We have tightened it up. This is a good, solid criminal statute as a result of that. 
Second, as was discussed in the AMA letter, the State medical boards, we understand that if the doctor is going to be charged in doing one of those procedures, there is going to be medical evidence presented. The doctor and his team are going to present their medical experts, and the prosecutor will present their medical experts. 
This gives us some medical expertise, if you will, that is not in either camp but gives us a peer review determination as to what they saw happen and what they believe happened. It will most likely result in as many people who agree with the physician as not. It is not something that we believe is a stacked deck one way or the other. We believe it is a legitimate peer review mechanism. 
It is admissible in court but not determinative. It is simply medical evidence to be used should the prosecution continue with the case. We think that is important. It certainly is important for the professional standards that the AMA and other State medical associations would like to see in their profession. 
So we have no problem with that. We believe it is legitimate medical evidence that would be otherwise included. So that is, again, a positive contribution to the legislation. 
The other change is really the ultimate of technical changes that was surplus language in the life-of-the-mother exception where we said basically twice that it was the only procedure necessary. We said it twice. You don't need to say it twice. You just say necessary. It was the only procedure available that is necessary to save the life of mother. We don't say `necessary' twice. So we eliminated the surplus language. 
Those are the three changes. They certainly do not go to the substance of the legislation. They are technical in nature. They are defined and solidifying in nature as a criminal statute and, I believe, a positive contribution. 
I believe eventually, whether it is in the next few months as a result of this bill being passed and either signed by the President or having the President's veto overridden, that this bill will end up in court. Someone will challenge the constitutionality after this legislation. 
My feeling is that this legislation not only has to be solid on the basis of abortion law, but also it has to be solid based on criminal law and how a criminal statute is drafted. 
I think what we have done with these changes is improve the language as a criminal statute. I think that is very important, and I would hate to go through the entire legislative process and have the courts say, `Well, on abortion law you are fine, but on criminal law you are too vague, and we are throwing it out for that.' 
That would be a disconcerting result, one that I do not want to see and one that I believe is greatly reduced as a result of the changes that we hope to make tomorrow in this legislation, and which we will make tomorrow. 
I have to say, finally, how excited I am that the AMA has stepped forward and supported this legislation. 
This is the association that is the most preeminent association that oversees medicine in this country. As Dr. Seward said, partial-birth abortion is not good medicine. As Dr. C. Everett Koop said, it is not medically necessary for the life and health of the mother to do this procedure. This is a procedure that is a rogue procedure. It should be an outlawed procedure. We are attempting to outlaw this procedure because it just simply goes too far. 
I am hopeful, with the support of the preeminent medical authority in this country, the American Medical Association, Members of this Senate will look long and hard now in these last few hours before the vote, which we are hoping to have scheduled tomorrow afternoon, they will look long and hard at the changes, at the evidence that now has been presented, the facts that have now been presented as a result of some of the admissions by the abortion industry as to what a partial-birth abortion is, when it is used, who it is used on, all of this new information that we have been presented in the Senate since the last vote a year ago, almost a year ago, and hopefully it is enough evidence and enough change in the statute that is being proposed, the bill that is being proposed, that we will get the requisite 67 votes. 
I know there are a half a dozen or more Members who have still not publicly announced what their position is on this bill. That is more than enough votes for us to get it to the 67 we need to override the President's veto. I ask each and every Member who is not committed, and, frankly, I would ask those Members who are committed in light of the evidence that has been presented, in light of the changes that we have made in this legislation, in light of the AMA's strong endorsement and support for this legislation, to take another look. I know it is very difficult for Members on this issue to walk outside of their camp of support. If you are a pro-choice Member, it is very difficult to walk outside of that camp and venture away from those groups of abortion-rights supporters who have supported you in your election and who by and large agree. But it takes a lot of courage to look at your friends and tell them when they are wrong. The AMA supports legalized abortion, and they have been able to look at their friends and say in this case you are wrong; this is not an approved medical procedure and we should not have it legal in this country. 
That took a lot of courage. I commend them for their courage. I just suggest that if the AMA can stand up to others in the medical community who believe abortion anytime, anywhere, under any procedure should be legal, they are willing to stand up to those within their ranks who hold that very extreme position, then I hope Members of this body who are not supposed to come here to argue extremist, irrational positions but here to represent what is in the best interests of this country will be able to look into the faces of the organizations that I know they seek support from on election day and with whom I know they find themselves in agreement on most occasions, look at them and say, you have gone too far this time; we have to draw a line somewhere on this issue; it is not an absolute right for anyone at any point in time under any method to kill their children, that we have to have limits. Even Senator Daschle and, to some degree, although minor, Senators Feinstein and Boxer have admitted there is some limit here as to what we can do, on what we should allow in the area of abortion. 
The AMA and other professionals in the field have stood up and said this is the line to draw. I hope Members have the courage to stand up and say this is where we draw the line. I commend Members who have done that already. I commend them for their understanding that, frankly, this is less about abortion and more about infanticide; this is more about when we take a baby that is out of the womb, being born, outside of the mother and, frankly, gratuitously kill that baby. We have gone too far. There is no medical reason that a baby four-fifths delivered, everything outside of the mother with the exception of the head, there is no reason to perform a procedure on that baby that kills it at that point. There is no medical reason to protect the life or health of the mother ever to kill the baby at that point. In fact, it is more dangerous for the mother to insert instruments, to puncture bone by stabbing the baby at the base of the skull. That is dangerous to the health and life of the mother. It is obviously very dangerous to the baby. 
That is not a safe procedure. You cannot argue that the baby sitting there in that position, that it is for the health of the mother to insert an instrument into the baby's skull. It is not. It can never be. So what we are saying is, whether it is partial-birth abortion or all length, give the baby a chance. Give the baby a chance. 
There may be cases, and we understand that--folks who have gotten up and argued to ban this procedure have always recognized that there are situations in which the health and life of the mother are in danger and that separation of the child from the mother is necessary to protect the mother's health and life. But it is never necessary, certainly not by doing this barbaric procedure, to kill the baby in the process. You have a baby four-fifths born with a tiny head that is inches away from that first breath. Let the baby be born. Give it at 
least a chance to see if that baby can survive. Why do violence to that little baby? There is no medical reason. Why protect a procedure that does violence unnecessarily to little babies who otherwise would be born alive? They may not survive long. They may only survive minutes or hours. But give them the dignity of being born and brought into our human community. Give them the dignity of not having violence be the only thing they know of this Earth. Give them the dignity of life and memory as a part of our human family. 
I am very hopeful that as a result of the endorsement of the AMA and other evidence that has come out, we can muster up the moral courage to say no to this procedure. I hope you can. 
I hope that anyone who is in the sound of my voice will call, write, fax, E-mail, pray, send any kind of communication they possibly can to Members of the Senate who are going to be voting here tomorrow on this legislation asking that they now look at the evidence presented, look at the changes in the legislation, look at the evidence that has been presented and make the right decision for these children, make the right decision for our culture. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, we have heard a lot of talk over the past several days about the issue of partial-birth abortion, about late-term abortion, about the need to have an option available should a pregnancy go awry, and in describing when a pregnancy goes awry they have described the need to have a health exception in cases where there is a fetal abnormality, where a baby is developing in the womb that is not perfect. 
Now we have heard all of the horrible accounts of Dr. McMahon performing partial-birth abortions on children because they had cleft palates or other very minor--Down's syndrome, and other minor, or not life-threatening maladies. That, in my mind, is an indefensible defense for a health exception. 
I found it absolutely astonishing that Members would have gotten up yesterday and talked about the need to have partial-birth abortion as an option to dispose of children who were developing in the womb with a defect. They did so at the same time, the same day, we passed IDEA, Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, the same day that people passionately got up on the floor and argued for the rights of the disabled to be educated, to maximize their human potential, and some 30 Senators who voted for that voted today to wipe out the ban on partial-birth abortion. 
Now, I find that absolutely incongruous. How can you fight for the rights of the disabled to be educated? How can you fight for the rights of the disabled under the Americans With Disabilities Act, which all of those Members, to my knowledge, those that were here, supported, back in 1990, I believe it was. How can you support that stand and say you care about the disabled, that you want to maximize their potential, that you want to treat them with dignity and give them civil rights, when you will not give them the most basic of civil rights, the right to live in the first place? 
If you survive the womb, if you survive Roe versus Wade, which allows you to be destroyed because you are not perfect--yes, Roe versus Wade, Doe versus Bolton, allow you to be destroyed because you are not perfect. I know that may click some sort of memory of people who remember what happened across the Atlantic some 50 and 60 years ago, that just because you were not perfect, you were not deserving to live. 
We have Members, standing here, arguing that we need to be able to have the option of killing a little baby because it is not perfect. They say, oh, that history that happened 50, 60 years ago, could never repeat itself. It cannot happen. Oh, how history tends to repeat itself, even here on the Senate floor. 
I find it absolutely amazing that people are not shocked by their own words, that they do not understand, as the Bible says, that a house divided against itself, that you cannot stand up on one side and argue for rights of the disabled at the same time saying they do not even have the right to be born in the first place, they are not going to be protected by our Constitution, they are not going to be protected by our laws. 
I will share with you tonight some stories, stories of people with disabilities, diagnosed in the womb. I will share with you some happy stories, and I will share with you some sad stories. But even in the sad stories you will find a silver lining, a lining that would not be there if it were not for someone who cared enough to treat their child with dignity and respect, cared enough to love them as fully as they loved any one of their other children. 
You heard me talk earlier today, yesterday, about Donna Joy Watts. One of the cases cited over and over again by people who want to create a health exception in the partial-birth abortion bill is that there are times when a baby's head has excess fluid, cerebral spinal fluid, and it is called hydroencephaly, water on the brain. Donna Joy Watts was one of the babies that was diagnosed with hydroencephaly, and another malady where the brain was actually growing outside of the skull. 
The doctors diagnosed her condition as fatal and told her mother and father they would have to abort her, and her mother and father said, `At 7 1/2 months we are not going to abort our child. Why not give her a chance to live?' They said, `no, no, we will not give her a chance to live because she will not live. It is best for you. Trust me, you will feel a lot less pain. You need to just get on with it.' These were obstetricians, genetics counselors. She had to go four places--four places--to get someone who would deliver her baby. Any of the four would have aborted her baby, but only one of the four would have delivered her baby. 
We are reaching the point in this country where it is almost easier to find an abortion than it is to find a doctor to deliver a child that will have complications. The fear of lawsuit, the fear of complications, and the stress associated with it are just creating the impetus to do abortions. 
Nobody can sue you for doing abortions. You sign a consent form. You give up your rights. You say, `I won't sue. As long as you kill my child, I will not sue.' So they don't get sued. No liability there. But if you work with the mother to deliver the child, then if mom believes you didn't tell her everything you should have, you get hit with a wrongful birth suit. In other words, `My child is better off dead than alive' kind of suit. 
What kind of society allows that? What kind of society would say we put in legal doctrine a suit that says my child is better off dead than alive? What a misunderstanding of life. Every child is perfect in the eyes of God; I hope in the eyes of the mother, but we have some to go that way. We have lots of people in the medical profession who certainly do not see it that way, and counsel for abortion. In fact, at every single turn, Donny and Lori Watts were hit with `abort, abort, abort. Save yourself the trouble.' She said no and he said no. 
They finally delivered her. This is what she looked like. It is a little Donna Joy, named after her daddy, Donna Joy. Oh, her little head is not perfect, and she had problems, serious problems. But she was born alive. 
For 3 days Lori Watts told me the medical professional at the hospital referred to her little baby, who weighed about 7 pounds, as a `fetus.' For 3 days after her birth, a `fetus.' For 3 days they wouldn't feed this baby because it was going to die. For 3 days they wouldn't drain the water from her head and put a shunt in it because she was going to die. And Donna Joy just wouldn't die. 
So Lori and Donny decided that they were going to threaten. Lori said in the paper that she would threaten the doctors if they didn't do something. So finally they did. 
And through a struggle, which I detailed yesterday, which I will not today, but through an incredible struggle of heroism her mom and her dad fed her. She had 30 percent of her brain. 
You often hear so much about you only use a small percentage of your brain. And if there is one place in the body we don't understand, we don't understand the brain very well. We don't understand how it really works and how it compensates for problems, whether it be by stroke or things like this. But Donna Joy had 30 percent of her brain. She had a deformed medulla oblongata which connects the brain to the spinal cord. She had no medulla oblongata. Her left and right side of the brain were not connected. They didn't talk to each other. She fought and she fought and she fought through incredible difficulties. 
Today, this is little Donna Joy Watts, who yesterday and today was in my office playing, talking to reporters, writing me notes, playing with my children, coloring books, acting like a little girl, walks with a little bit of a limp. She is a little bit behind for her age. But after eight brain operations and with 30 percent of her brain, she is an amazing story. 
Her parents were told to have a partial-birth abortion because her head was so large. They wanted to put those scissors in the base of this little girl's skull and kill her. And Lori and Donny said no. They could have taken the easy way out. 
I can tell you. When Lori told me of the times when she was a little baby of having to feed her, which took an hour and a half because she didn't have the muscles to hold the food in--it would just come right back up, she had no muscular control as a baby. So the food would come right back up. They thought she would die of malnutrition until Lori thought it out. She would put this paste, which was real heavy that would stay in her stomach, but it was drop by drop in the back of her mouth. It took an hour and a half to feed her. She would take an hour-and-a-half break, and another hour and a half to feed her, 24 hours a day, setting the alarm in the middle of the night, getting up to feed her child so the child would not die of malnutrition. 
It is hard. But little Donna Joy Watts is one of the great stories that ennobles all of us. Had Lori and Donny decided to kill, to let little Donna Joy die by aborting her, our society would be diminished. The inspiration that this little girl and her family has provided ennobles us all, calls us to a greater sense of commitment and love for our children and those who are not so fortunate to be perfect. 
Another story: This is a story I just got the other day. It is a letter written to me by Sandra and Joseph Mallon from Upper Darby, PA. I will read the story as she writes it to me.  
Dear Senator Santorum: My name is Sandra Mallon. I live in Upper Darby, PA with my husband, Joe, and our 5 month old daughter, Kathleen. Both Joe and I work outside the home--but Kathleen is the most important thing in our lives. I am writing in reference to the H.R. 872 and S. 5 bill currently being considered. This issue is very near to my heart; and I feel this is a crisis issue that I must discuss. 
My daughter was diagnosed with hydrocephalus, an abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid around the brain, at 23 weeks gestation. 
You may have heard the debate earlier about viability. At 22 weeks' gestation, a baby can survive. About 24 or 25 percent of babies survive outside the womb. 
At that time we were not given a positive outlook for our little girl. We were told first to abort--but that was out of the question. Then we were told the best case would be to expect a shunt operation and retardation; worse case would be death before or shortly after delivery. We decided to give our child every chance we could. We went to many doctors for the next four months--the news got a little better as the pregnancy went on. 
Kathleen was born on December 6, 1996--and she is our miracle baby. Though she has hydrocephalus, she is showing no symptoms. One month ago she underwent an operation to place a shunt, a tube which helps the fluid to pass through the brain in a safe and effective way. This is the most widely used treatment for hydrocephalus, and even so, most patients have to have their shunt revised (replaced) several times in their lifetimes. The alternative in most cases is death. 
Joe and I have many hopes and dreams for Kathleen--but mostly we want her to be a healthy, happy child. We want her to be given every chance in life to experience her world. Right now I want her to be able to play, jump, swim and maybe even ride horses. Unlike most families these every day activities could cause Kathleen to need a shunt revision. This scares me to death!! Right now there is technology and materials to help Kathleen should there be a reason. But if these bills do not pass my child could be in for pain and suffering which would slowly and painfully kill her. Don't let this happen to my Kathleen Marie. Silicone is the only material available which the body does not see or reject to make these lifesaving shunts. 
I can't stress how important this issue is to me and my family. Besides our immediate need to know Kathleen can continue to grow up as any other child. But the silicone is also used in many other biomedical devices (i.e. ear tubes, and pacemakers). So the S5 in the Senate and HR872 in the House would seek to control my access to raw material for shunts. I understand there are other issues wrapped up in the bill, and I believe personally that Product Liability and Tort Reform are important measures. If S5 and HR872 are not passed, it is a certain death sentence for Kathleen and every other person affected by hydrocephalus. 
I ask you to look at the picture of Kathleen. Tell me that you will help her. Don't wait too long Senator, people will die. I am looking forward to your response to this issue of life and death importance to me and my family. 
These are two wonderful stories of children who would not be termed `viable,' could be aborted late-term because it was a medical complication, and these children were deformed. 
This is the kind of health exception that many want to allow so we can kill children just like this. But we know there is another way, a way suggested by even people who perform abortions like the doctor at the Medical College of Pennsylvania who says that after 23 weeks, the second or third trimester, it is not necessary to kill a baby. It may be necessary to separate the mother from the child. But it is never necessary to kill a baby, even one that has an abnormality. 
In fact, doctors have told me they are not aware of any abnormality in and of itself that is a threat to the woman's health or life that cannot be remedied by a separation--not an abortion, not the deliberate killing of the baby, but by separation. In fact, most abnormalities don't require separation. You can deliver later in term, at term. 
Not all stories end as happily. I want to share some stories with you of people that went through very tough decisions, and some that, frankly, didn't have very tough decisions but went through heartaches when it came to a child who had a problem in the womb. 
Let me first share the story of Jeannie French. Jeannie has been very outspoken. I shared her story last year, but it bears repeating. 
My name is Jeannie Wallace French. I am a 34 year old healthcare professional who holds a masters degree in public health. I am a diplomat of the American College of Healthcare Executives, and a member of the Chicago Health Executives Forum. 
In the spring of 1993, my husband Paul and I were delighted to learn that we would be parents of twins. The pregnancy was the answer to many prayers and we excitedly prepared for our babies. 
In June, five months into the pregnancy, doctors confirmed that one of the twins, our daughter Mary, was suffering from occipital encephalocele--a condition in which the majority of the brain develops outside of the skull. As she grew, sonograms revealed the progression of tissue maturing in the sack protruding from Mary's head. 
We were devastated. Mary's prognosis for life was slim, and her chance for normal development non-existent. Additionally, if Mary died in utero, it would threaten the life of her brother, Will. 
Doctors recommended aborting Mary. But my husband and I felt that our baby girl was a member of our family, regardless of how `imperfect' she might be. We felt she was entitled to her God-given right to live her life, however short or difficult it might be, and if she was to leave this life, to leave peacefully. 
When we learned our daughter could not survive normal labor, we decided to go through with a cesarean delivery. Mary and her healthy brother Will were born a minute apart on December 13, 1993. Little Will let out a hearty cry and was moved to the nursery. Our quiet little Mary remained with us, cradled in my Paul's arms. Six hours later, wrapped in her delivery blanket, Mary Bernadette French slipped peacefully away. 
Blessedly, our story does not end there. Three days after Mary died, on the day of her interment at the cemetery, Paul and I were notified that Mary's heart valves were a match for two Chicago infants in critical condition. We have learned that even anacephalic and meningomyelocele children like our Mary can give life, sight or strength to others. Her ability to save the lives of two other children proved to others that her life had value--far beyond what any of us could every have imagined. 
Mary's life lasted a total of 37 weeks 3 days and 6 hours. In effect, like a small percentage of children conceived in our country every year, Mary was born dying. What can partial birth abortion possibly do for children like Mary? This procedure is intended to hasten a dying baby's death. We do not need to help a dying child die. Not one moment of grief is circumvented by this procedure. 
In Mary's memory, as a voice for severely disabled children now growing in the comfort of their mother's wombs, and for the parents whose dying children are relying on the donation of organs from other babies, I make this plea: Some children by their nature cannot live. If we are to call ourselves a civilized culture, we must allow that their deaths be natural, peaceful, and painless. And if other preborn children face a life of disability, let us welcome them into this society, with arms open in love. Who could possible need us more? 
I will now share a more personal story. A comment was made in this Chamber on several occasions in the last debate and unfortunately again in this debate that Members who speak on this issue have no right to speak on this issue because they cannot experience what the women who stood with President Clinton when he vetoed this bill experienced. 
Well, that is not true. I will read from an article I wrote about what happened to me and my wife and our family.  
On September 26, 1996, the Senate voted to sustain President Clinton's veto of the Partial Birth Abortion Ban. I led the fight to override the veto on the floor of the Senate. 
Central to the debate was the assertion by opponents of the ban that this procedure was necessary later in pregnancy in cases when a severe fetal defect was discovered. I was told that I could not understand what these women, who experienced this procedure, had gone through. `It had never touched your life,' one Senator said. 
This is a story of how just one week after that vote, it did. 
We had been through the joyous routine before--the technician would turn out the lights, spread gel on Karen's growing mid-section, and then right there on the screen in front of our eyes we would get the first glimpse of our baby--a fuzzy, black and white picture that told us all was well. 
This time, however, was different. Sitting in the darkened room, listening to the background buzz of the machine, we saw a large, dark circle on the screen, and we saw the technician's demeanor change. Everything seemed fine--arms, legs, head, spine--but the woman with the instrument was strangely quiet, examining and re-examining the dark circle. 
We had brought along our three children, ages 5, 3, and 1--Elizabeth, Johnny, and Daniel--to this appointment because we wanted them to be able to have a glimpse into the still, perfect world of their unborn baby brother. We now feared that they might get a glimpse into something else. 
The technician left, giving way to a doctor who repeated the earlier routine, mumbling something about a `bladder.' Finally, we were coldly given the verdict: `Your child has a fatal defect and is going to die.' 
It's not that the world stopped, nor that it moved in slow motion, it was just that the world had changed. Suddenly, our child whom we loved, prayed for, dreamed about, and longed to meet was diagnosed with a life threatening condition. Through our tears erupted the most basic of all parental instincts and emotions--we were going to save our child. 
After the initial shock, I took the kids out into the hallway to the phone and called Dr. Scott Adzick. Six months earlier, I had gone to Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and seen a world I never knew existed--a world of Dr. Adzick's creation--a world of surgery and care for children still in their mother's womb. I remembered his amazing skill and how I sensed an aura of peace and a certainty of purpose surrounding his mission. 
I frantically described what had transpired and asked if he could help. Before he peppered me with questions, he calmly reassured me that all was not lost. He had seen cases like this before and knew immediately that it had to be post-urethral valve syndrome. 
Scott's principal concern had to do with the absence of fluid in the amniotic sac. What he told us failed to lift our hopes. The absence of fluid meant that the baby likely had a complete obstruction of the urinary tract--in short, a very rare, severe, and extremely problematic condition. 
Not typically understood is that the element comprising the amniotic fluid encompassing the baby during development is the baby's urine. The fluid not only provides a barrier of protection from outside trauma, but it is necessary in the development of the baby's lungs. Without it its lungs would not develop enough for him to survive outside the womb. 
In addition, the baby's enlarged bladder would so compress the internal organs--particularly the kidneys--that they would cease to function. Kidney failure would mean near-certain death shortly after birth. 
Dr. Adzick arranged for tests to be done the next day in Philadelphia at Pennsylvania Hospital. The initial results did not look good. Seated in front of our second sonogram machine in as many days, Dr. Adzick and Dr. Alan Donnefeld described our son's kidneys as not positive. Dr. Adzick told us that though he, too, was discouraged, there were one or two occasions where he had seen bad kidneys have sufficient levels of function, enabling a baby to survive until a transplant soon after birth. 
We adjourned to a supply room next to the treatment area. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss options. Dr. Donnenfeld took the lead, saying that things were grave, and presenting us with three options. `Your first option is to terminate the pregnancy.' As the word pregnancy left his lips the room instantly went dark. The doctor quickly reached up and turned on the light that was on a timer. Through nervous and awkward laughter I said, `I guess that answers your question.' 
We knew that abortion was a legal option, it just wasn't a sane one. It was inconceivable to us as parents to kill our baby because he wasn't perfect or because he might not live a long life. While we couldn't look into his eyes or hold him in our arms, he was no less our child than our other three children. And we loved him every bit as much. He was our gift from God from the moment we found out Karen was pregnant. In our mind, from that time on our job as parents of this tiny life was to do everything we could to nurture him through life. Karen and I have this saying, `life is about being there,' and this was our chance to be there for our baby. 
The second option was to do nothing. In this case our son would live only as long as he was in the womb. While in the womb our baby's lungs and kidneys were not necessary for him to survive--Karen was performing those functions for him. There was no increased threat to Karen as a result of his defect. 
The third option would entail several tests and testaments that could put Karen at risk. Karen's immediate response was to do whatever it took to save our son, no matter what the risk to her. 
Our son went through two days of tests to determine kidney function. If there was very poor or no kidney function there would be no point in proceeding further--he would not develop enough in the womb to survive outside. The first day the results were so bad that we discussed whether it was worth going through a second painful day of tests for Karen. Dr. Adzick said we needed a miracle to get those kidneys to work better. 
We prayed more than I can remember for our son, who we named that day Gabriel Michael, after the great archangels. The next day our prayers were answered with a miraculous improvement; the chances for success were not just okay, but kidney function very good. We could now do the surgery that would save his life. 
For both of us, this crisis was not so much a `faith check' as it was a time of reassurance. No matter what happened, we knew that God held us--and held Gabriel Michael--in his hands. What that knowledge there is a peace beyond human understanding. 
The bladder shunt procedure, to drain the urine into the amniotic sac in an effort to create the proper fluid environment for Gabriel, was scheduled for Tuesday with Dr. Bud Wiener at Pennsylvania Hospital. Dr. Wiener had done more of these procedures than anyone else on the east coast and had pioneered the plastic tube that would be used to drain the urine. 
Next came the surgery. The idea that surgery on a child in only its 20th week of life inside the womb could work boggles the mind. And watching Dr. Weiner at work was something to behold. He guided the shunt into place, though more slowly than he would have liked, but it was a success. As we left the hospital, we worried about whether the shunt had worked, and whether the longer than usual procedure might have put Karen more at risk. 
Two days later, Karen began feeling both chills and cramping--the cramping was the beginning of labor and the chills were a sign of an infection in her womb. Our worst fears had become a reality. 
Hoping desperately that it was food poisoning or the flu, Karen fought desperately to hold it all together. A call to the doctor was met with an order to rush to the hospital. We were in Pittsburgh at home. There another doctor performed another sonogram. What we saw was perhaps the single worst and single best things of our lives. The fuzzy picture on the screen showed an active baby--arms and legs moving freely in a sac of amniotic fluid. But the infection persisted. 
Karen was seized with horrible chills. Huddled under nearly a dozen blankets her body temperature soared to 105. By this point there was little that could be done. Intra-uterine infections are untreatable as long as the source of the infection--the amniotic sac--is in place. Unless the sac and thereby the baby were delivered, Karen would eventually die, and Gabriel Michael with her. Here again the doctors told us that abortion was a legal option, but we knew there was another way. This way gave our son the love and respect he deserved and to Karen and me the gift of a precious few hours with our son. 
Karen was given an antibiotic which reduced the fever and made her comfortable. She clung to the baby with all her might, but nature was relentless. Soon the labor intensified--the body had identified the source of the infection. She did everything she could to delay the inevitable. I tried calling everyone I knew to see if there was something else that could be done. There was no answer to be found. I thanked God for the presence of Karen's father, Dr. Ken Garver, a physician whose specialty is in genetics counseling, prenatal diagnosis of birth defects, and Monsignor Bill Kerr who helped guide us through this time. 
We knew the end was near so we tried to pack a lifetime of love into those few hours. I put my hands on Karen's abdomen--we prayed and we cried. We also talked to Gabriel to let him know how much we loved him--how much we will miss him, how much we will miss mothering and fathering him and how his brothers and sister will miss his presence. 
Within hours of 12:45, our son was born. He was a beautiful creation--a small, pink, package of joy and sorrow, hope and questions. We bundled him up, put a little hat on his head, we held him, sang to him, cried for him. He was too small to make a sound but he spoke so powerfully to our hearts. His eyes never opened to see his mommy and daddy, but he allowed us to see, in him, the face of God. Two hours later, he died in my arms. 
We tried to make Gabriel's short life, short time on Earth, filled with love, only love. And we told him that soon he would be experiencing something that we are striving for. God would be bringing him to be with Him in heaven. Finally, we pledged to him that we would rededicate ourselves to joining him someday. 
The next days were no less of a blur than the ones that led up to them. We buried our son later that day, next to other members of our family, and we prayed to God to give us understanding. 
This is our story, the irony finding ourselves confronted with a baby with a fetal defect when only the few days before, the absence of such had disqualified me from the debate on partial-birth abortion. It was in the eyes of many truly overwhelming. On two occasions we, too, could have chosen the option to abort. We knew that Gabriel's life would probably be measured in minutes and hours, not in years and decades. We chose to let Gabriel live and die in the fullness of time--being held and loved and nurtured by two parents who loved him dearly. 
We wouldn't have traded those 2 hours with our son for anything in the world. And we know he wouldn't have either. 
In the midst of the debate that fall, disgusted by and worried about the gruesome descriptions of abortion, one of the Senators said that a medical procedure was bloody and that it was just the nature of the event. The Washington Post described what happened next:  
Republican Senator Rick Santorum turned to face the opposition and, in a high, pleading voice, cried out, `Where do we draw the line? Some people have likened this procedure to an appendectomy. That's not an appendix,' he shouted, pointing to a drawing of a fetus. `This is not a blob of tissue. It's a baby. It's a baby.' 
And then, impossibly, in an already hushed gallery, in one of those moments when the floor of the Senate looks like a stage set, with its small wooden desks somehow too small for the matters at hand, the cry of a baby pierced the room, echoing across the chamber from an outside hallway. 
No one mentioned the cry. But for a few seconds no one spoke at all. 
Maybe it was a freak occurrence. It was a baby, a visitor's baby that was crying in the hallway as the door to the floor opened and a few seconds later closed. A freak occurrence, perhaps, or maybe a cry from a son whose voice we never heard but whose life has changed ours forever. 
Mr. President, I am using the words of my wife: 
Accepting partial-birth abortion as our only alternative to a difficult birth or a potentially disabled infant is to thwart two of our strongest human impulses: the impulse of love and the impulse of memory. All of us are united by our need to love and by our need to remember and be remembered. Giving life to and caring for a sick infant--for however brief a period--allows us to express these uniquely human impulses. Rick and I were blessed with the time to offer the fullness of our love to our baby, and we have the peace of knowing that he felt that love. Gabriel Michael joined our family forever. He has not been obliterated. Gabriel was known and will always be remembered. His memory will live with us forever. I believe that every human being should be remembered by somebody. Memory helps to anchor us to each other; it locates us not only within a certain time and place, but within a family and within a community. It is one of the measures of the value we place on each other. And the tragedy of infants who are destroyed and forgotten should haunt us all. 
There is another way. You heard me quoting doctors all day about the other way, that there is no need to kill a baby. You may need to separate the mother from the baby, but there is no need to kill the baby. I do know that. I have experienced that. And I, as I said, would not trade one moment, one second. 
What we are debating here is infanticide, not abortion. We should have the moral courage to stop infanticide in the U.S. Senate. We should be able to muster up enough support out around America to send a message, loud and clear, to every Member in this Senate, that we will not stand for it any longer. 
The children who are victims of partial-birth abortion are not here to speak for themselves. So we must do that. And so I ask you on their behalf that you don't subject anyone else in America to this procedure. I plead with you on their behalf to stop the murder. I ask the President to look into his heart and see if he can't understand and feel the disruption that this procedure is causing to our culture and to our civilization. I ask every Member of the Senate to do the same. I think, if you 
do, the decision will be easy. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may use. 
Mr. President, there are so many things I would like to say, but let me just start with one at a time, and that is the pictures the Senator from California put up here of women who have been in situations where they were faced with a fetal abnormality and were convinced, unfortunately, by some genetics counselors and others to have an abortion as their option. 
Let me show you a picture of someone who wasn't convinced by genetics counselors that that was her only option. That is Donna Joy Watts. I talked about her yesterday. She had the same condition as two of the women that Senator Boxer just described--same condition. Her mother had to go to four hospitals to find someone who would not do what the people that Senator Boxer just talked about did, which is terminate the pregnancy, abort the child. She said no. She says, I'm going to let my child live in the fullness of what God has planned for her. I am not going to end her life. I am not going to make the decision to end her life, like any other mother or father would not, if they were faced with a sick child, kill them. Why would you kill your child? Because your child is sick? Because your child might not live long? Why kill your child? 
Lori Watts and Donny Watts said, no, we are not going to kill our child. We are going to do what we can. We are going to treat her with dignity and respect like any other member of our family. We are going to love her and do everything we can to support her. 
So they delivered Donna Joy Watts. The doctors would not treat her. They said she was going to die. They would not even feed her for 3 days. You want to talk about all these doctors who are so concerned about saving lives. Then why are we debating physician-assisted suicide if all these doctors are so concerned about saving lives? People who perform abortions are not principally concerned about saving lives. They are worried about malpractice concerns, particularly if you have a difficult pregnancy. They are worried about a whole lot of other things. But I would suggest, unfortunately, there are too many--if there is one, there is too many--doctors out there who--after she was born, doctors were referring to Donna Joy as a fetus laying there alive, breathing--a fetus. 
So do not tell me, do not tell me that all these caring, compassionate doctors would, of course, do everything to save a child's life. It is not true. God, I wish it were true. And, unfortunately, bad advice is given out by people who either do not know, have not taken the time to understand what options are available, what technology has been developed, or do not care or just are afraid to deal with the problem. 
Mr. and Mrs. Watts had to go to four hospitals just to find a place to have her delivered. They would not deliver her. They would abort her. They would do a partial-birth abortion. In fact, they offered a partial-birth abortion, but they would not deliver her. 
So do not bring your pictures up here and claim that is the only choice. This is not a choice. These are little babies. And they are asking us to help them now. This is not Senator Rick Santorum, nonphysician, speaking. Over 400 obstetricians and gynecologists--and by the way, the person who designed this barbaric procedure that we are debating was not an obstetrician. You hear so much about all these experts. He was not an expert. He is a family practitioner who does abortions, and you can only question as to why he spends all his time doing abortions instead of taking care of families. But that is what he does. He does abortions. 
This is not taught in any medical school. It is not in any peer review literature. It is not done anywhere but abortion places. It is not done in hospitals that deal with high-risk pregnancies. Ask the question. I will ask it. Can you find a place that deals with high-risk pregnancies that has perinatologists at their unit that does partial-birth abortions? 
The answer is no, zero. No hospitals do this procedure. If this is a procedure that was so important to be kept alive and so important to be an option, then why don't the experts, the people who study high-risk pregnancies, perform this? If this was the best choice--and the Senator from California suggested that in fact would be the only choice in certain cases. Yesterday, she listed five conditions in which this would be the only choice. Now, if you are a perinatologist, someone who deals in late-term pregnancies, and you are not performing this--you are basically telling the perinatologists that they are doing malpractice because they are not doing this procedure. 
Let me talk to you about one perinatologist who wrote to me. This is Dr. Steve Calvin, assistant professor, Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Minnesota in Minneapolis: 
As a specialist in Maternal-Fetal Medicine, I practice with the busiest group of perinatologists-- 
That is obstetricians who work on high-risk pregnancies and 
deal with these fetal problems-- in the upper midwest. 
The busiest group of perinatologists in the upper Midwest. 
I also teach obstetrics to medical students and residents. I know of no instances when the killing of a partially born baby was necessary to accomplish delivery in any of the five medical situations listed by Senator Feinstein. 
Senator Feinstein claims that partial-birth abortion is necessary to end a pregnancy in the following five situations: Fetal hydrocephaly, fetal arthrogryposis, maternal cardiac problems (including congestive heart failure), maternal kidney disease and severe maternal hypertension. 
The first two conditions are significant fetal problems. Hydrocephalus-- 
And that is exactly, by the way, what Donna Joy Watts had-- is an increased amount of cerebrospinal fluid that can cause enlargement of the head and arthrogryposis includes deformities of the fetal limbs and spine. Significant as these abnormalities may be, they do not require the killing of a partially born fetus. Delivery can be accomplished by other means that are safer for the mother-- 
I repeat, `safer for the mother'-- and give the fetus at least a chance of survival. 
And, I might add, apart from this, some dignity, some dignity to one of our children, one of our humankind, in the case of the family, one of their family. 
The other three conditions are maternal illnesses that may indeed require ending the pregnancy. But, as with the fetal problems, there is no reason that the treatment must include suctioning out the brain of a partially born baby. 
One of my biggest concerns is that the opponents of this ban are claiming that this destructive procedure is the only method of ending a pregnancy. Abortion supporters have previously acknowledged that surgical mid-trimester and late- term abortions are more dangerous to a woman's health than induction of labor. 
Let me read this again.  
Abortion supporters have previously acknowledged that surgical mid-trimester and late-term abortions are more dangerous to a woman's health than induction of labor. Their concern for women's health and safety apparently ends when there is any threat to unrestricted abortion. 
Signed Steve Calvin, MD. 
And I will put up this quote from 400 doctors, over 400 doctors, including the former Surgeon General, C. Everett Koop. I suggest these over 400 doctors, many of them members of ACOG, which is American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, also are concerned about maternal health. Many of these are perinatologists, people who specialize in high-risk pregnancies. I would think they would be concerned about maternal health. Many of these doctors are pro-choice and they said the following clearly. 
While it may become necessary, in the second or third trimester, to end a pregnancy in order to protect the mother's life or health, abortion is never required. 
Now, they did not say it should be an option. They said never. These are experts. Senator Boxer says, well, Rick Santorum should not be in the operating room. I would not want to be in the operating room. I would pass out if I was in the operating room. The fact of the matter is I am not going to be in the operating room. These folks are. This is what they say. `Never,' not sometimes, `never required.' 
It is never medically necessary, in order to preserve a woman's life, health or future fertility, to deliberately kill an unborn child in the second or third trimester, and certainly-- 
Underline certainly-- not by mostly delivering the child before putting him or her to death. 
This last line is very important. 
What is required in the circumstances specified by Senator Daschle [Senator Boxer, Senator Feinstein] is separation of the child from the mother, not the death of the child. 
In other words, there may be cases where you must separate the child from the mother, you must deliver the baby, either by induction and delivery, vaginally or by cesarean section, but in no case, according to a doctor--and I ask if you can produce one perinatologist who would say that it is necessary, absolutely necessary, to kill the child in order to protect the life and the health of the mother, because I have hundreds who say it is not, hundreds from the finest universities and the finest medical schools all over this country who say absolutely, definitively--and the former Surgeon General of the United States, C. Everett Koop--never necessary, never necessary. 
Now, we also have to talk about all these cases that we are concerned about the mother's health. We make the assumption that abortion is an option to preserve the mother's health or life. I heard that over and over again. 
It has to be out there in late trimesters, after 20 weeks. Let me share a couple of statistics that shed some light on this. 
This was referred to by Dr. Calvin. I want to back it up by the statistics. This is from the Alan Guttmacher Institute. Who are they? They signed letters with NARAL and Planned Parenthood and all these other abortion groups, in support of this procedure, in support of every liberalization you can possibly imagine. They are a pro-choice, some would even suggest pro-abortion group. Here is what they say. 
The risk of death associated with abortion increases with the length of pregnancy, from 1 death in every 600,000 abortions at 8 or fewer weeks to 1 per 17,000 at 16-20 weeks, and [after 20 weeks, when partial-birth abortions are performed, they are considered late-term abortions after 20 weeks] 1 per 6,000 at 21 or more weeks. 
It is 100 times more likely that a mother will die than if the abortion were performed in the first 8 weeks. It is 100 times more likely. 
This is what these people are advocating, performing abortions. Let me throw one statistic on top of that. I will show it. I will read it. `It should be noted that at 21 weeks and after, abortion is twice as risky for women as childbirth: The risk of maternal death is 1 in 6,000 for abortion and 1 in 13,000 for childbirth.' 
So, aborting a child through partial-birth abortion, late in term, is statistically more dangerous to the life of the woman than inducing labor. In other words, not only is it preferential for our society not to kill children who should be given a chance at birth, late, when there may be a chance of viability or just when they should have at least some dignity attached to their life, but it is more dangerous to abort than it is to induce labor or to have a cesarean section. It is more dangerous. 
The folks who say they are protecting a woman's health and life are arguing for procedures that do the exact opposite. Facts: I know we do not like to talk about facts when it comes to abortion. We like to put up pictures of nice families and warm little babies, that somehow or another, this family is better off because of an abortion. The fact is by having an abortion she was twice as likely to die and not be in that picture. That is the fact. We do not want to talk about that. We want to make sure the right of abortion is paramount among all rights. Because that is what this amendment does--nothing. It lets there be abortion on demand, anytime, anywhere, on anybody. That is what this amendment does. It has no restrictions. It is an exception that is not an exception. 
It is an exception that says that, while we cannot have postviability abortions except for the health of the mother-- let me tell you what Dr. Warren Hern, who wrote the definitive textbook on abortion, called `Abortion Practice,' said. Here it is: `Abortion Practice,' Warren M. Hern, from Colorado. My understanding is this is sort of the definitive textbook on teaching abortions. He does second- and third-trimester abortions and is very outspoken on this subject. He does not use partial-birth abortion, I might add; does not see it as a recognized procedure. But this is what an abortionist who does late-term abortions--in fact, has people come from all over the world to have abortions done by him--this is what he said about, not the Boxer-Feinstein amendment but the Daschle amendment, which we are going to debate next: 
I will certify that any pregnancy is a threat to a woman's life and could cause grievous injury to her physical health. 
In other words, abortion on demand, anytime during pregnancy. And he believes this. Some would say you are relying on the doctor's bad faith--no. He believes this. And he has a right to believe it. If you look at the statistics, I mean, you know, unfortunately some women do die as a result of pregnancy and, therefore, he could say legitimately there is a risk. Any pregnancy is a risk. It may be a small risk, but it is a risk. And all these bills require, that we are going to hear today, is just a risk. Not a big risk, a risk. 
So what we have are limitations without limits. What we have is a farce, to try to fool all of you, to try to fool the press. It has done a very good job fooling the press. We have wonderful headlines about how we are trying to step forward and do something dramatic on limiting late-term abortions. Phooey, we have a step forward into the realm of political chicanery, of sham, of obfuscation, illusion, that does nothing but protect the politician at the risk of the baby. That is what is going on here. That is what is going on all day. You are going to hear a lot of it. You are going to hear, `Oh, we need to do this, we need to protect this.' Here are the facts as pointed out by their side. I am using their facts. The Alan Guttmacher Institute--their numbers. 
Even when we debate with their information they cannot refute it. The fact of the matter is, there is no reason to do a partial-birth abortion and there is every reason in the world to stop it. It is a dehumanizing procedure. You wonder why we have a society that just is becoming adrift, that does not know right from wrong, that does not have any sense of justice, that 
does not have--we do not have any compassion for each other? I will give you a good example why that happens. Because on the floor of the U.S. Senate we are debating a procedure where we can kill a little innocent baby that is completely delivered from the mother except for the head. It is moving outside of the mother, a little baby who has done nothing wrong to anybody, and we are saying, `You don't deserve to live.' 
Give people like Donna Joy Watts a fighting chance. It will ennoble us all. We can look to Donna Joy and her family and say there are parents who showed the best, who showed the best in our hearts, who showed the willingness to fight for life, for things that are at the core of who we are as humanity. Let that spirit come back into American culture. Stop this culture of death and self-centeredness and focus in on life and dignity. What about poking scissors in the base of a little baby's skull and suctioning its brains out is dignifying the human being? You would not do that to a dog or an old cat that you wanted to put to sleep. You would not do it to a criminal who has killed 30 or 40 people. And you do it to a little baby who has done nothing wrong and just wants a chance, for however long it may be--and it may not be long--but, for however long, the dignity of life. 
The Senator from California talks about the long-lasting pain to the family that we would be imposing on them. What is so painful about looking at yourself in the mirror and saying: `I have done everything I can to help my little girl or my little boy have a chance at life. I gave them every chance. I loved them as much as I possibly could in the time that God gave us.' What is so painful about that? 
I will tell you pain. Facing, every day, that you killed your son or daughter for no reason, that is a pain I would not want to live with.

Mr. SANTORUM. There are great pains out there when you are dealing with a child that is not going to live. It hurts. And it is troubling. But you will find, not only from my experience but from the experience of doctors who deal with this all the time, that treating your son or daughter with dignity, loving them as much as you can for as long as you can--does not make the pain go away. It never goes away. When you lose a child it never, ever goes away. But it helps you live with it. 
What we are doing today is, hopefully, banning a procedure and explaining to all of those unfortunate people who may be dealing today, right now, with this situation, that there is a better way for everyone. Let us do the better way. Let us do the right thing. Let us do the just thing for everyone. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

That is, during the process of partial-birth abortions, if the baby that is being brought out in this fashion would for some reason have its head slip out because all that is left inside of the mother is a very small head, if that head would slip out, would it still be up to the doctor and the mother to kill the child?

Mr. SANTORUM. I want to clarify a point. Dr. Haskell, who developed this procedure, testified that the drawings were accurate, and I am quoting him, `from a technical point of view.' So these drawings are not cartoons. They are accurate drawings of a procedure that Dr. Haskell has invented. 
The point I am trying to make, and I think she answered the question, and I think she answered it correctly, and that is if the child was delivered, completely delivered, you would not be able to 
kill the child. 
The point I am trying to make, look how close we are drawing this line, a matter of a few inches of a baby's skull. Those 3 inches determine whether you can live or die. Is that really what we want in our society? Is that really the standard that we want to develop as to when life is worth living, or life should or should not be protected?

I suggest to the Senator from Illinois that the question I ask--I asked a question. I asked a question. I did not make a statement. I asked whether a child, to be delivered, would it be up to the doctor and mother to kill the child? The difference is a matter of 3 inches, and you have affirmed that 3 inches makes the difference as to whether that child is protected or not protected, and I think that is a very, very close line that you are drawing, one that is, I think, very destructive of our culture.

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Michigan for his excellent statement and for his tremendous defense of the unborn, particularly on this particular issue. He has been a partner in providing information to Senators on the facts, the real facts of what has gone on here on the issue of partial-birth abortion. I want to address a couple of things the Senators from California talked about in closing my remarks. 
The Senator from California said that conditions could differ; that there is always a chance that something could happen. 
I will just refer again to the quote from over about 500 physicians, including many people who deal in the area of maternal fetal medicine, perinatology, people who deal with high-risk pregnancies. The experts--we hear so much about we are not the experts. I am not the expert. I am talking about the people who are the experts. This is what the experts say. They don't equivocate. Senator Frist read from the head of obstetrics at Vanderbilt University, one of the most prestigious universities in our country. He agrees with this comment: 
While it may become necessary, in the second or third trimester, to end a pregnancy in order to protect the mother's life or health, abortion is never required--i.e., it is never medically necessary, in order to preserve a woman's life, health or future fertility, to deliberately kill an unborn child in the second or third trimester, and certainly not by mostly delivering the child before putting him or her to death. What is required in the circumstances specified by Senator Daschle-- 
Boxer-Feinstein-- is separation of the child from the mother, not the death of the child. 
It is never necessary. According to doctors, not Rick Santorum, according to doctors who practice in this speciality, hundreds of them, it is not necessary, you don't have to kill the child. 
Let's use your own common sense. Use our own common sense. Here is this procedure. You have dilated the cervix over 2 days, you brought the baby into position feet first, you have taken it out of the womb, you have taken it out of the uterus, out of the birth canal, the baby is completely out of the mother's uterus, birth canal, except the head. Tell me what health reason of the mother requires you to kill this baby? These babies are very small. You can see the hands of the physician compared to the size of this baby. This baby can fit in the palm of your hand. Why do you have to kill this baby? 
There is no reason, as these doctors just said, that you cannot at least give this baby some chance, some chance of living. Why? In fact, the argument is made by several doctors who have written me that by puncturing the base of the skull like that in a blind procedure--you cannot see the area where you are inserting these scissors--that you risk, obviously, missing, causing damage, you risk--and this is graphic, but it, again, was written to me by several physicians--the splintering of the skull can cause problems. I know this is graphic stuff, but this is reality. This is what they want to keep legal, and they believe that this protects the woman's health. I guarantee you this does not protect the woman's health. 
There is no reason at this point to kill this baby, but they insist upon having that choice. This is the choice right here. It is not a choice. It doesn't have to be a choice. It is not me saying it doesn't have to be a choice, it is doctor after doctor, specialist after specialist saying it doesn't have to be a choice. 
Their legislation pretends to bar third-trimester abortions, postviability abortions with a narrow health exception, they suggest. What they say is that it comports with Roe versus Wade. We know what Roe versus Wade and Doe versus Bolton say that health is anything--mental health, depression, the mother is young. Those are all reasons approved by the courts to allow an abortion any time--any time--for any reason. Those are all legitimate health reasons. They continue to be health reasons. 
They say we don't want elective abortions. Let me tell you what Dr. Warren Hern said--again, Dr. Warren M. Hern, author of `Abortion Practice,' what I am told is the definitive textbook on abortions who does second- and third-trimester abortions, said it yesterday in the Bergen County Record, and I will repeat it:  
I will certify that any pregnancy is a threat to a woman's life and could cause grievous injury to her physical health. 
The Boxer-Feinstein amendment does not say anything about physical health. This is the Daschle amendment he is referring to, which also does not do anything. But there is never a case, according to Dr. Hern, where he cannot do an abortion and claim physical health. 
He says it again, just in case he was misquoted, in today's USA Today: 
I say every pregnancy carries a risk of death. 
What this amendment does is nothing. If you want to stop partial-birth abortions, vote against the Boxer-Feinstein amendment.

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I see a lot of Members here and I will keep my remarks brief in order to give them an opportunity to speak. But I, too, just want to get in a couple of points in response, and a comment. First the comment. 
That is, I very much appreciate what the Senator from South Dakota has stated. I respect his opinion. I respect the fact that he is trying to make an effort to deal with a very serious issue, and that is abortion in this country, moving toward making it much more rare. Certainly, I do not doubt his intentions at all. I know this is an issue that not only he is struggling with, on the issue of partial-birth abortion, but other Members who I have talked to and who I have heard from directly and indirectly. This has been an issue that has been a very difficult issue for people to deal with. We are looking for answers and looking for different ways. I respect the effort of the Senator from South Dakota to do what he believes is right. 
I hope, and I would just offer this--while I do not agree in the assessment of the Senator from South Dakota as to what his bill does, we have an honest disagreement on that. And I think it is one. I think it is simply a disagreement on what he believes his bill does. He believes it does some things. I will argue as to why I don't think it does what he says it does. Two people can reasonably disagree on that. And we will have that debate here today at length. 
I will say that I certainly am open to working with the Senator from South Dakota, and anybody else in this Chamber, after this day is done and this issue is behind us, and hopefully it will 
be behind us soon, to look at other ways that we can get at these very, very prickly issues. We can do it in a way that can be bipartisan. The people who are generally concerned about unborn children--I know the Senator from South Dakota is. So I just want to start, having said that, and just address the two points which I see are the flaws in his legislation, as well-intentioned as I believe it is. 
The Senator from South Dakota referred over and over again to how these different procedures that are not banned by the partial-birth abortion ban, H.R. 1122--he kept saying this is no ban, this is no ban. I suggest, as carefully as the Senator tried to construct this amendment, that in fact his bill is no ban either. It allows for two determinations to be made, two issues to be left to the discretion of the doctor, which creates the loophole by which not one single abortion will be banned under this procedure. 
I do not say that lightly. I say that with the very strong conviction that what will happen as a result, if this bill were to become law and signed by the President, there would not be one less abortion done in this country. There would not be one abortion banned in this country. 
The reason I say that--and I will talk about two particular areas. I will be brief. I will get into this in more detail later, because I know there are people who want to speak. I am going to be here. They have things to do. 
I will talk first about the health exception. I showed the quote today from Dr. Warren Hern. Again, Dr. Hern is an authority on abortion procedures and techniques. He has written `Abortion Practice,' Warren M. Hern. This is the definitive textbook on teaching abortion. He does second- and third-trimester abortions. 
He does them from all over the world. He instructs doctors through his book and directly on abortion practice. This is what Dr. Hern said yesterday to the Bergen County Record: 
I will certify that any pregnancy is a threat to a woman's life and could cause grievous injury to her physical health. 
Dr. Hern, who does second- and third-trimester abortions, was commenting on the Daschle amendment. This is one of the leading people in this field. I just suggest that Dr. Hern, while I could not disagree more with what Dr. Hern says, the fact of the matter is that he can stand there and, in good conscience, say that to not only the Bergen County Record, but to USA Today--he repeated the statement in case there is no validity to the original statement, a different quote, similar in nature--that any pregnancy could be a threat and could cause grievous injury--I know this is the language the press keeps honing in on, `grievous injury' to physical health. Here it is. 
I have a lot of other things I am going to say about health and why the health exception, as drafted in this amendment, is a very broad loophole and will not restrict abortions. The fact that the doctor is the one to certify, what does that mean? That is pretty much current law. The doctor certifies when there is a health reason to do an abortion, and we say we are going to ban these, but the doctors determine when there is an exception. 
I use the example of recently in the Congress, we banned assault weapons. We said we were going to make assault weapons illegal, but we are going to give the person selling the gun the ability to determine what an assault weapon is. That is what we have done with the Daschle amendment. It has given the person performing the abortion certification dispositive, conclusive authority to determine what is a health reason. 
I agree that is what Roe versus Wade says, but the fact that the Daschle amendment parrots that shows that there will be no change in the way doctors view this issue. There will be no change. 
The second issue is the issue of viability, and I think Senator Daschle points up very accurately the progress we have made since Roe versus Wade in the area of viability, but, again, the only way you can for sure determine whether a child is viable is to try to save the child. There is no way that a doctor can look into the womb of a mother and say this child will survive and this one will not. You cannot do it. They might have guesses, but we have cases of children surviving at 22 weeks, 21 weeks, not many, very few, maybe only singular cases. But how do we know unless we deliver the baby alive, and births after 20 weeks are almost certainly alive if you deliver the baby without doing anything to it. The heart is beating. Unfortunately, they gasp for breath. They will be alive, but you never know whether they are going to survive until you try. 
So to suggest that the doctor can then define viability by knowing in advance whether this baby is going to survive, you cannot do that. What you end up doing is, again, leaving the doctor absolute discretion, even at times--I think we are now up to the point at 26 weeks you are into roughly 80 percent survival, but you can still say, `Twenty percent don't survive, and I make a determination this is one of the 20 percent.' It is a reasonable judgment call. There is no way you can second-guess it, because there is no way to know for sure. 
You have, literally, up until 26, 27--you can go on, there is not 100-percent certainty survival of viability until well into pregnancy, until maybe even in the 35th week where you have 100-percent chance. So the doctors can always say, `This was one and I certify it, it is conclusive, it is dispositive,' as it is under Roe versus Wade. 
I am not saying he is changing current law, but by applying current law, codifying current law, he accepts the exception to the overall ban which nullifies the ban, and so what we have is a ban 
that does not do anything. 
Again, I say to the Senator from South Dakota, I appreciate the effort he put behind trying to address this issue, but it does not accomplish what was intended. I feel bad about it. I wish I could stand up here and say this is something that is going to make a positive impact. Look, if I felt that this was going to do something to stop children from being aborted, I would sign up right now, but I don't believe that it will. 
I am willing to work in the future if we can come up with something that will save children's lives, count me in. I will say that I was not approached on this compromise. I was not asked for my input as the sponsor of the bill that is on the floor. That is the prerogative of the people who drafted the amendment. That is certainly within the realm of Hoyle around here. But if we truly want to reach out and try to work on something across the chasm, which unfortunately is a chasm that has been breached somewhat on the issue of partial-birth abortion, I am happy to say that maybe as a result of partial-birth abortion, we are beginning to see that there are real problems out there, even those who support abortion rights. 
So I hope, while I have to stand and speak against this amendment and urge my colleagues to vote against this, because not only does the Daschle amendment create a ban that has no limits to it, there is no ban, the Daschle amendment wipes out the partial-birth abortion ban. So it wipes out the underlying legislation. In a sense, whoever votes for Daschle votes against banning partial-birth abortions because under the Daschle amendment, not one partial-birth abortion will stop. Not one. So if you vote for this amendment, you vote against the underlying bill and replace it with something that, as well-intentioned as it may be, does nothing to limit late-term abortions, the fifth, sixth month and beyond. 
I had to rise in opposition. I respect the Senator from South Dakota. I look forward to engaging further in this debate. I yield the floor.  
Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, a couple of comments before I yield to the Senator from Arkansas. 
I want to repeat what was stated by George Will in a column talking about the Daschle amendment. He said, `The Daschle amendment is a law that is impossible to violate.' 
All these things sound really wonderful. We have these real tough definitions; real tough except for the fact that you can't violate the law because you are giving all of the authority to the doctor to determine whether he breaks the law, or she breaks the law. 
Wouldn't you love to have a law where you are the self-enforcer of the law? You have to call it yourself because, once you sign that certification, it is a conclusion. You cannot be second-guessed. What doctor is going to say, `Oh. I aborted this baby, and it would have been viable'? 
First of all, no second-trimester baby is ever going to be viable by any doctor doing an abortion. They just won't because there is still a percentage that aren't, and they will just say, `It is not viable.' They will sign a certification saying it is not viable. Next, they will sign it saying there is a health problem. Like Dr. Hern said, you can't get away from the fact that the people who are doing these abortions--most of the folks who do them--do them for a living. They are not going to call it on themselves--that there really wasn't a health exception. They are not going to say, `That is the reason I did this. I did this abortion wrong.' 
What we have here instead of a judge, jury, and executioner is executioner, judge, and jury. 
As far as I am concerned, George Will is absolutely right. This is a law that cannot be violated. As tough as all of this sounds, as persuasive as some of his arguments that they really 
care about limiting abortions, it will not stop one abortion. 
At least what the underlying bill does is outlaw a procedure that is so far outside of what our country should permit, and at least take the step in the right direction of providing some sense of humanity to those little children. 
I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Arkansas.

<TEXT>
Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I want to make a couple comments. The Senator from Illinois made his comments, as did the Senator from Maine. 
They keep focusing on the reason we need a health exception, that the Daschle amendment will do some things, `We provide for a mother's health as well as provide for taking care of these viable babies.' I don't know how many times I have to repeat it from how many different sources, but it needs to be repeated again and again and again, and it is being repeated, frankly, without contradiction. These people who I am quoting are people who are involved in maternal fetal medicine. These are people who deal with high-risk pregnancies, pregnancies that are talked about as so important to keep this health option open, that those of us who want to ban partial-birth abortion without a health option, which everyone knows is an open door to do abortion on demand--the courts have said it is, it is an open door--there is no need for a health option in second- and third-trimester abortions. That is not Rick Santorum saying it. I don't know how many times I have said this. I am not saying this. 
I will give you another physician who is a specialist in maternal fetal medicine, a perinatologist at the Medical College of Pennsylvania who testified under oath--under oath--in U.S. Federal District Court in the Southern District of Ohio. This is Dr. Harlan Giles, who specializes in high-risk obstetrics and perinatology and also performs abortions. This is not someone who is pro-life. Under oath, a specialist in the field who performs abortions, and here is what he says: 
After 23 weeks-- 
This is a 23-week case-- 
After 23 weeks, I do not think there are any maternal conditions that I'm aware of-- 
This is 23 weeks, which is what Senator Daschle termed as `viability'-- 
. . . I do not think there are any maternal conditions that I'm aware of that mandate ending the pregnancy that also require that the fetus be dead or that the fetal life be terminated. 
In other words, you do not have to kill the baby, even in viable babies: 
In my experience for 20 years, one can deliver these fetuses either vaginally, or by cesarean section for that matter, depending on the choice of the parents with informed consent. . . But there's no reason these fetuses cannot be delivered intact vaginally after a miniature labor, if you will, and be at least assessed at birth and given the benefit of the doubt. 
The Senator from Illinois said, `You don't care about the health of the woman, you want to take these decisions away.' It is a decision, unfortunately, of too many doctors in this country and we know this--one thing I learned in being involved, unfortunately, as I have with health care problems personally with my family is that doctors don't know everything. Not every doctor is up on all the literature, not every doctor knows what is out there. So, unfortunately, a lot of people get a lot of bad advice. 
Yes, they get a lot of bad advice as to when to abort a baby, far, far, far too often. Maybe it is bad advice because they just don't know or they haven't taken the time to figure it out, or maybe it is because they just don't want to deal with that high-risk pregnancy because that is not their speciality and they would rather just take the easy way out. You don't get sued for performing an abortion, you get that little consent. In fact, most of the consents on abortions waive the right to be sued. So you get that consent and no one is sued for doing abortions wrongfully. But doctors are sued for wrongful birth. Can you believe that? We don't sue people for doing abortions; we sue them for having babies with deformities or abnormalities. Interesting country we live in. 
But the fact of the matter is that no health exception is necessary under the Daschle proposal, because after viability, if you will, there is no reason to kill the baby to protect the health of the mother. No reason; never, never. I have 400 physicians who sent a letter saying never. I have a doctor who is a perinatologist who performs abortions--never. I don't know what else we need. 
We talk so much. I know the Senator from California often said, `You're not doctors, and we shouldn't be making decisions here because we're not doctors.' I think the Senator from Michigan was right. We are not nuclear scientists, but we make decisions on nuclear energy, and we are not generals, but we make decisions on defense. That is our job. It may not be that we are the best qualified in all cases to make decisions, but that is what we are here to do, and we do it. 
I can tell you the Senator from California is not shy about telling other people how to live their lives in a whole lot of other areas. So I just suggest that what we are talking about are the experts telling us to stop the tragedy, and what we have done with the partial-birth abortion ban is to stop the tragedy. 
What the Daschle bill does is continue the status quo. It 
does nothing to stop. You have seen this picture. Donna Joy Watts. Every doctor who looked at Donna Joy Watts in utero said she was not viable. The Daschle amendment would not have stopped doctors, and there were many of them who wanted to abort Donna Joy Watts. 
This is a little girl who was born to Joe and Sandra Mallon who live in Upper Darby, PA. This is Kathleen. Kathleen had the same condition, hydrocephalus. She would not be viable, she would not be protected from abortion under the Daschle amendment. The list goes on and on and on. 
The fact of the matter is, there is a loophole in this amendment that nullifies the whole good intent that everyone is going around talking about. This does nothing. What it does is provide political cover for those who do not want to vote for a partial-birth abortion ban. 
Even if you believe the Daschle amendment does what he says it does, even if you believe that it bans `postviability abortions,' most partial-birth abortions are done at 20 to 24 weeks, which is just at the edge of viability. So most partial-birth abortions would, undoubtedly, continue to be legal under the Daschle amendment. 
I suggest that we stick to what we know are the facts. We know the fact is that the partial-birth abortion procedure is a brutal, barbaric procedure that should not be legal in our country. We should abolish it. We have the opportunity to do that. If the Senator from South Dakota, and the other Members who are part of his team, want to work on further restricting abortions, count me in, but this amendment does not do that.

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, several comments have been made about what the minority leader's legislation attempts to do, 
postviability abortions, and that ours doesn't do that. That is correct. That was never the intention of the bill. What our bill does is stop the infanticide. 
We have had a change in the debate here. We have had a debate about the late-term abortion. But what we have been debating--maybe the other side didn't realize it--here is stopping the killing of children, `infanticide.' That is not my word. The Senator from New York, Senator Moynihan, says this looks like infanticide. This baby is outside of the mother, a fully formed little baby. 
That is what this debate is about. We have gotten off track here a little bit and tried to talk about late-term abortions and trying to define it. 
I think you heard the Senator from Tennessee define how this doesn't do anything. But that is one. The Senator from South Dakota said you have the same procedures, as far as doctors determining life of the mother in partial-birth abortions. 
The difference is there is no certification procedure in the partial-birth abortion--none. By giving a certification procedure in your bill, you raise that as a standard that is dispositive. We do not do that in this bill. We leave that up to a judge and a jury. 
In the case of the Daschle bill, as I said before, the executioner is the judge and the jury. In our bill, that is not the case. 
So there is a substantive difference in how we deal with this. 
I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Tennessee. 
I hope that we have opposition to the Daschle amendment.

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, as I spoke last night, we are now moving to consideration of the partial-birth abortion ban that has passed the House of Representatives with a constitutional majority, more than two-thirds I should say, more than two-thirds majority in the House, which means, if there is a Presidential veto, we would be able to override it in the House. It now comes to the Senate where we have an assured majority of the votes to be able to pass this legislation. The question really is whether we are going to have 67 votes necessary to do it. So we commence the debate today. I am hopeful, now that this bill has 42 cosponsors, we will have a spirited debate with many people participating, adding their thoughts on this subject. 
I have a unanimous-consent request first. I ask unanimous consent that Donna Joy Watts be allowed access to the Senate gallery. This is an exception to the Senate regulations governing access to the gallery because Ms. Watts is not yet 6 years of age.

We have coarsened the comity of this place to the point where someone sitting in the gallery, who is literally months away from the age that has been set by the Senate rules, who has a particular interest in this piece of legislation would not be accorded the decency of being able to at least observe. But I respect the Senator's right to do what she wants to do, and she certainly is within her rights to do it. I think it is unfortunate that a young girl who has had as close to a personal encounter with this issue as possible and still be here to talk about it is not able to listen to a procedure to protect others from what she was threatened with. 
And that is certainly within the discretion of the Senator from California.

<TEXT>
Mr. SANTORUM. If I can, I find myself almost incredulous, to believe that you are--in arguing, as I know you have in the past, and other Members have, that we have no right here in the U.S. Senate to dictate what other parents should be able to do with their children with respect to whether they should be able to abort them or not. But when a mother seeks to share with her daughter, mother and father, share with her daughter some information that is important to her in a very profound way and that you are going to stand up, as a Member of the U.S. Senate, and suggest that you know what is better for her daughter than she does, I think is rather troubling. But again, it is your right as a Senator to object to these things. I respect that right. I just don't happen to agree with the characterization that allowing their daughter the opportunity to witness something that is very important to all of their lives is in any way exploiting her. But that is--your objection is so noted. 
Mr. President, I think it is important as we start this debate that we understand what we are debating, that is partial-birth abortion. So I am going to explain what a partial-birth abortion is, when it is used, who it is used on, and why it is used. 
There has been a lot of talk about this procedure and the facts around the procedure. We have seen in recent months how some of the facts in fact did not turn out to be facts, particularly things that were used and said by Members here on this Senate floor as to what partial-birth abortion was all about, when it was used, who it was used on, why it was used. So this debate unfortunately a year ago was shrouded in a cloak of inaccuracies. In this debate, as much as many of us tried to articulate what we knew to be the facts, we were countered with arguments that in fact have turned out not to be true. So I am hopeful that with this new information having been brought to light, that the facts as we now know them--and I cannot attest, because some of the facts have been provided by the abortion industry themselves, who are opposed to this bill, so I cannot verify the information we have been given is in fact accurate. All I can verify is that they have admitted to at least this. But what we do know is that those set of facts that they now admit to are different than what they were saying before, and different in a material enough way that Members who relied on that information last time, if they rely on the different set of facts this time, can come to a different conclusion. 
That happened in the House of Representatives. Several Members who voted against the partial-birth abortion ban based on a set of facts as they knew them provided by the abortion industry, when those facts were shown to be inaccurate, changed their position in light of those, that new information, and supported the legislation and supported it to such a degree that it passed with over 290 votes, which is the necessary vote to override the Presidential veto. 
So, let us look at what partial-birth abortion is. By the way, the drawings that I am going to use are drawings that were copied--derived from drawings that Dr. Haskell, who was the inventor of this procedure, had. Dr. Haskell, by the way, is not an obstetrician and gynecologist--people whose business it is to deliver babies. Dr. Haskell is a family practitioner who does abortions, and he invented this procedure. This procedure is not in any medical textbook. This procedure is not taught in any medical school. This procedure has not been peer reviewed. In other words, no other doctors have looked at this to see whether this is safe and healthy and a proper procedure. It has not been recognized as a legitimate procedure. But he has invented this thing, this monstrosity, and he wrote a paper on it. From the description and from the pictures in that paper we reproduced this, these drawings. 
Dr. Haskell, when asked about these particular drawings, the ones you are going to see, said they were accurate, from a technical point of view. So any comments that these drawings are somewhat of a fabrication or whatever does not hold water. 
I also suggest when you see the drawings of the baby in these pictures, the drawing of the baby in these pictures is a drawing of a 20-24 week gestation baby. It is not a big baby or 
has not been blown up to look like it is more life size than it is. It is the exact size. If you look at the size of the baby relative to the size of the doctors' hands, which is the way you can judge size, you can see a baby at that gestation which is when most of the partial-birth abortions are performed. In fact, it is at the low end of when they are performed because they are performed in the fifth and sixth month, and this is fifth month. So, it is the small end of when these abortions are performed. 
This is a 3-day procedure. You are going to hear about life of the mother, health of the mother, we need to do some things to protect the life and health of the mother. This is a 3-day procedure. The mother is given drugs the first 2 days to dilate her cervix, to open her womb so the doctor can then reach in as you see here to grab the baby. I would just ask this question, and you don't have to be a doctor to answer it. If a woman presents herself to a physician in a life-threatening situation, would anyone do a 3-day procedure? Second, if the woman presented herself in a health-threatening situation, would any doctor do a procedure that says: Take these pills, come back tomorrow; take these pills that are going to dilate your cervix, open your womb up to infection, which is in fact a risk, and call back? 
So, when you hear these, `we have to keep this legal because there may be some circumstance,' let me assure you--and I will have a quote that I will share with you--there is never a case, there is never a case where this procedure has to be performed to protect the life or health of the mother. Period. Having said that, the bill still provides for a life-of-the-mother exception. So I would just want Members to understand that this procedure is a 3-day procedure. It is done on an outpatient basis. When the mother presents herself in the third day--and this was the reason Dr. Haskell developed this, was so he could bring her in, the dilation of the cervix would be done, and simply he would perform the procedure. He wouldn't have to wait and have her in the clinic and do these other procedures which are done in 1 day. So this is done for the convenience of the doctor, the abortionist, not for the health of the mother, not for the safety of the baby or anybody else, because you are going to kill the baby. Now you understand why it is done. 
Guided by an ultrasound, the abortionist grabs the baby with forceps by the feet or leg. Babies at this time, generally they move around, but they are generally in a head-down position. So the doctor has to reach around, grab the baby by the foot, turn the baby around inside the womb, inside the amniotic sack. 
Second, they then grab the baby's leg and pull it breach. For those of you who are not physicians--I think there is only one physician in the Senate, the Senator from Tennessee--a breach birth, as any mother or parents know, is a very dangerous occurrence, when a child is delivered breach. To deliberately turn a baby and deliver the baby breach is a risk unto itself. But they deliberately turn this baby and then they pull the baby by the leg out of the uterus, out through the cervix to where the baby is delivered, the entire body except for the head. So you have a baby, now, that is outside the uterus with the exception of the head and, as nurse Brenda Shafer said when she witnessed this procedure, the baby's arms and legs were moving. 
You might ask, why are they doing this? Why are they delivering this baby in this fashion? Why do they not just take the baby that is head down and just deliver the baby head first and then do what I am going to describe next to the baby? Why don't they do that? 
The reason they don't deliver the baby out and kill the baby is because once the head exits the mother, it is considered a live birth and has protection. So, if you delivered it in a normal fashion and the baby's head were out and the rest of the body were in, you couldn't kill the baby. The only reason you do this is so it is easier to kill the baby and it is then legal to kill the baby--at least it is if we do not pass this law. 
So just understand the difference here is a matter of which end comes out first. If the head came out first you can't touch that baby. It is a live birth, protected under the Constitution. Unfortunately, its feet are not protected by the Constitution nor its leg nor its trunk--just its head. At least that is what the courts have said. 
So now we have this little baby that is outside the mother and a doctor takes some scissors and jams it right here, right in the back of the base of the skull, that soft baby's skull. You know, those of you who have children, how soft that skill is. And they thrust the scissors into the base of the skull. 
Nurse Brenda Shafer described what the baby did in the partial-birth abortion that she saw. She said the baby's arms and legs flew out, like when you are holding a baby and you drop it and it goes like this. It just doesn't know what to do, it just sort of shoots its legs out, that nervous--nerve reaction. She said it shot its legs out, its arms and leg--for those who believe that the baby doesn't feel anything. And then they went limp. 
To finish the procedure the doctor takes a suction tube, a high-pressure suction catheter, inserts it in the baby's skull, and suctions the brains out of the baby. 
That causes the head to collapse, and then the baby is delivered. 
This is what we are trying to ban. Nothing else; nothing else. This is what we are trying to ban. I cannot help but think, as I look around and see the statues of the Vice Presidents of the United States that ring the Senate Chamber, that if we had been on the Senate floor 30 years ago, 50 years ago, 100 years ago and talked about this as something that was legal in America, we would have had 100 percent of the U.S. Senate saying, `Why is this bill even here? This is obviously something that is so barbaric that we cannot allow to have happen.' 
But, unfortunately, we have reached the point in our country where this is defensible. This is defensible, treating a little baby like this, a fully formed little baby, not a blob of protoplasm, not a tissue that many would like to believe, this is a baby fully formed, and in many cases viable, that we treat like this, that we murder like this. Let's call it what it is. And we are saying in this country, it's OK. 
Now, if we did this procedure, if you would take these graphics out and leave some of the definitions out there, if we did this procedure of jamming scissors in the base of the skull and suctioning out the brains on someone who had raped and murdered 30 people, the Supreme Court and every Member of this Senate would say, `You can't do that, you can't do that, that's cruel and inhumane punishment.' Oh, but if you are a little baby, if you haven't hurt anybody, if you are nestled up in your mother's womb, warm and safe--supposedly safe--we can do that to you. In fact, it is our right, it is my right that I can do that. 
The thing about this debate that is probably the most important thing--and you will hear rights, you will hear rights, my right to do this, my right to do that, it's my body, I can do whatever I want, I can kill this baby, it's my baby. Rights. Well, in this case, we are having an abortion debate on the floor of the U.S. Senate where you cannot miss the other side of this debate. You cannot miss the baby in a partial-birth abortion. It is not hidden from view anymore. It is not the dirty little secret we tell ourselves to survive, to live with ourselves that we allow this kind of murder to occur in this country. 
We cannot hide anymore from the truth of what is happening out there. We cannot lie to ourselves that this is not what we are doing. In fact, Ron Fitzsimmons said, the person who blew the whistle on the abortion industry, we have to face up to the fact that abortion is killing a living being. Let's face up to it. If you want to defend it, defend it, but defend it on what it is: It is killing a little baby who hasn't hurt anybody, who just wants a chance like all of us to live. 
One of the great ironies that struck me as I walked on the floor today--I walked on the floor and I passed the Senator from Vermont, the Senator from Tennessee, and the Senator from Iowa, who had been so instrumental in the bill that we just passed on the Senate floor. Do you know what bill we just passed on the Senate floor? The Individuals With Disabilities Education Act. Individuals with disabilities. 
The principal reason that the people who oppose this ban use for defending this procedure is, You know, a lot of these children have deformities. They might have Down's syndrome or they might not have any arms or legs or they might not even live long, they might have hydrocephaly, they might have all these maladies. And that, of course, is a good reason to kill them. That is the argument. That was the argument that was made over and over and over again, that fetal abnormality is a good reason --in fact, the courts, unfortunately, have legitimized this reason saying it is a legitimate reason to do a third-trimester abortion. 
I just found it absolutely chilling that a Member could stand up here and rightfully, passionately argue that children are all God's children and perfect in his eyes, and while they may not be perfect, they deserve the dignity of being given the opportunity to maximize their human potential. That is what IDEA is all about, the ability to protect their civil rights to maximize their human potential--except to be born in the first place. Because some of the most passionate defenders of IDEA, some of the most passionate defenders of ADA, the Americans with Disabilities Act, say it is OK to kill a baby because it is not perfect, any time in a pregnancy--any time in a pregnancy--by using this, the most barbaric of measures. 
We are going to educate you if you make it, if you survive this. If you survive, if you are lucky enough that your mother loves you enough to give you a chance at life, then we will protect you, but you are on your own until then; you are on your own; we're not going to protect you. You don't deserve protection. 
Abraham Lincoln, quoting Scripture, said that a house divided against itself cannot stand. I just ask every Member who proudly stands and supports the disabled among us how you can then stand and allow this to happen to those very same children and say that you care? The ultimate compassion here is 
at least giving them a chance to live. I guarantee you that if you gave a lot of disabled people the choice of whether they would rather be educated or live, it is a pretty easy call. But somehow or another, that is lost here. Well, it is not lost on me, and I don't think it is lost on the American public. You cannot legitimately argue both ways. So this is the debate. 
You will hear a lot about health exceptions--and I want to address that issue right up front--that we need this procedure to be legal because there might be instances in which the life and health of a mother are in danger and this procedure would have to be done. I am going to put a quote up from a group of close to 500 physicians, almost all of whom are obstetricians, people in the field:  
While it may become necessary-- 
This is a quote from a letter-- 
While it may become necessary, in the second or third trimester, to end a pregnancy in order to protect the mother's life or health, abortion is never required. 
I want to repeat that: 
. . . abortion is never required--i.e., it is never medically necessary, in order to preserve a woman's life, health or future fertility, to deliberately kill an unborn child in the second or third trimester, and certainly not by mostly delivering the child before putting him or her to death. What is required-- 
And this is important-- 
What is required in the circumstances specified by Senator Daschle is separation of the child from the mother, not the death of the child. 
What do they mean by that? Sometimes you might have to induce and deliver the baby. Sometimes you may have to do a cesarean section to deliver the baby. But you never have to kill the baby in order to protect the mother's life. You can at least give the baby a chance. Give him or her a chance. If it is not viable, then he will not live or she will not live very long, but you have at least dignified one of our human beings, one of us, your son, your daughter. 
I just suggest to any mother or father that if you found out that your child was going to die, had a particular virulent form of cancer and the child was 5 years old and the child, according to the doctors, would almost certainly not live more than a few weeks, would you, would any parent in America say, `Well, my child's going to die, I might as well kill them now'? Would any parent deliberately kill their child because they may not live long? Or, worse yet, would they kill their child because they were in a car accident and lost a leg? Or were in a car accident and are going to be in a wheelchair the rest of their lives and maybe has brain damage and does not have a whole lot of mental capacity, but some, or even none, would you deliberately kill your child? And in doing so, would you do the procedure that I suggested? Would you puncture their skull and suck their brains out? Would you do that? 
Well, if you would not do that for a 5-year-old son or daughter, why would you do it to a 5-month-old son or daughter? Why? You don't have to. 
If there is any message, whether this bill passes or not--I say passes, becomes law--that is so important, but it is so important for people to understand that you don't have to kill the baby. You don't have to do that. I know. There is always a more dignified way to treat another human being than to deliberately kill them. 
So the debate will rage on this afternoon, but just remember these facts--facts: Partial-birth abortion is never necessary to protect the life or health of the mother. Fact: It is never medically indicated. It is not an accepted procedure. 
It is rare, according to the abortion industry. It is only 3,000 to 5,000 a year, as if that's OK, only killing 3,000 to 5,000 children a year and that is not very many. I guess against 1.4 million or so, it is not many, but can you imagine what we would do in the U.S. Senate if we knew 3,000 children were going to die this year and we could stop it? What lengths would we go? What lengths would we go for 1,000? What lengths would we go for one? I don't know anymore. I wonder whether we can muster up the moral courage to stand up to the powerful lobbies out there and do the right thing. 
This procedure does not have to be there for any reason--no reason other than for the convenience of the doctor doing the abortion. This procedure is not done at major medical facilities. This procedure is done at abortion clinics, period, and, in most cases, not even by--at least the people who developed it were not even obstetricians. 
So I hope that we can have a debate on the facts. Because on the facts, if you look at the facts, there is no reason for this procedure to be legal--none. And if you look at the heart, what kind of message are we sending out to the young people all over the country? 
You know, we have debates here on the floor, and we have committee meetings even to talk about juvenile crime, talk about generation X and how they have no respect for our institutions or even each other, that they think everybody is in it for themselves. The cynicism is so rampant. 
If you want to know why that occurs, tune in to this debate. Children are not oblivious to what is going on in this country when it comes to the issue of abortion. Ask why a child should be any more concerned about shooting their neighbor if Members of the U.S. Senate and the President of the United States says we can kill a little baby. What is the difference? There is no difference. We are going to have all sorts of problems with this future generation. I hear all the time, `Oh, they have no values. They don't have any direction. They don't have any purpose. They are so self-centered.' Gee, I wonder why. 
What is more self-centered than what I have just described? We are sending a message. A message is being received. And 1.5 million abortions is a very loud message to everybody in our country, particularly the young, the impressionable. And we wonder why, we wonder what the problem is. 
We can begin to send a positive message today. We can begin to say, you know, there are rights and wrongs--not just rights--rights and wrongs. And this is wrong. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Madam President. I will just say in response to the Senators from California, I just need to reiterate what we stated earlier, and Senator DeWine read earlier, that there is no health reason where this is the only option. AMA said that today. They came out with a report saying that today. The American College of Gynecologists and Obstetricians have said so. 
This is not going to limit anybody's access to abortion if that is what they choose to do. It eliminates a procedure, a procedure, as I said before, that is not medically recognized, it is not in the literature, it is not peer reviewed, it is not taught anywhere in any medical school. It eliminates a procedure which many of us believe, and I believe the vast majority of the American public believes, goes too far, is too brutal, is outside the realm of what we should allow in a civilized society. 
So I keep hearing the concerns that, `Well, maybe there's 
something out there, maybe there's a case out there that this is necessary.' I know that the Senator from California started with the case of Viki Wilson and talked about one of those instances being the case of hydrocephaly. I am going to talk about a case of hydrocephaly. I am going to talk about a case where a mother involved with a little baby in her womb, diagnosed with hydrocephaly, was confronted with the very same problems that Viki Wilson was confronted with, the very same challenges Viki Wilson was confronted with, the very same challenges that not just Viki Wilson or Laurie Watts were confronted with, but, unfortunately, lots of mothers and fathers are confronted with. 
I suggest that there is a different way, that there are other options, options that are much more fulfilling, more decent, more human, more humane than the option of a partial-birth abortion. 
We hear so much talk about the people who came to the White House and stood with the President. The Senator from California, Senator Boxer, is very fond of putting up charts of individual families that have gone through this very difficult time. I have often talked about the millions of children who die because of abortion, and the thousands of abortions of partial-birth abortion. But somehow or another, that does not seem to lock on, at least with the media or, in some respects, even with the American public. It reminds me of what Joseph Stalin once said. He said:  
A single death is a tragedy--a million deaths is a statistic. 
I think for far too often, we have been arguing statistics here, about the numbers of millions of children, and maybe, oddly, we can learn something from Joseph Stalin. 
So today I am going to talk about what could have been a single tragedy, what could very well have been a Viki Wilson, what could have been a whole host of other mothers and fathers who are confronted with this terrible dilemma of having a child who just might not survive. 
Let me tell you the story about Donna Joy Watts and Lori and Donny Watts. The Watts live in Green Castle, PA. They did not always live there. They lived, until just a month or so ago, in western Maryland. 
Seven months into her third pregnancy, Lori Watts learned that her child would not be normal, that there was a problem. A sonogram showed that her child had a condition known as hydrocephalus, the same condition that the Senator from California has just described with one of the cases the President points to as the reason for keeping this procedure legal. Hydrocephaly is an excessive amount of cerebral fluid in the skull, also known as water on the brain. 
Lori's obstetrician said, after the sonogram was done, that he was going to refer her to a genetics counselor. I could talk for a long time about genetics counselors. But I think this story sums up, unfortunately, what far too many genetics counselors do. 
Lori Watts phoned the clinic to ask directions and what they planned to do. The staff member told her that most hydrocephalic fetuses do not carry to term so that she should terminate her pregnancy. When she asked, how could you do an abortion so late in pregnancy at 7 months, she was told that the doctor could use a skull-collapsing technique that we refer to as partial-birth abortion. 
Donny Watts demanded to know why they had been referred to a facility that counsels for abortion when talking to his obstetrician, whom he called. And the obstetrician said, `Well, you know, there are doctors there who didn't encourage abortion. I thought you would talk to them, and you talked to the wrong person.' 
It is amazing--but not amazing--that you can call a clinic, and depending on who you talk to is what kind of advice you are going to get as to whether to terminate your pregnancy or not. But I am, frankly, pleased that at least there are some counselors who will suggest other alternatives. Far too many do not in cases as severe as was confronting the Watts family. 
In that conversation with their obstetrician, he advised the Watts to see a specialist in high-risk obstetrics. I can say that in conversations with the Watts, they were amazed at the attitude of the people they confronted. 
The obstetrician, the original obstetrician, said that he could not take care of the baby anymore; it was too complicated. So they went and asked doctors at Johns Hopkins. They said they--well, they would not even see them. All they wanted to do was an abortion. They would not deliver the baby. 
Then she went to Union Memorial Hospital, same thing. You hear so much talk about, well, we cannot get availability for abortions. How about availability for delivery? 
She finally went to the University of Maryland Hospital in Baltimore. They were very quick to dismiss her also. They said the baby's chances for survival were nil, that she would be `a burden, a heartache, and a sorrow.' 
Where have we come in this country where we have so little respect for the little children among us who just may not be perfect, that they can be disposed of, that you can look into the eyes of a mother who desperately wants her child and tell her, `It would just be a burden to you'? 
I do not know of any child that is not at times a burden. Children are joys and struggles. I mean, that is just part of life. If you are not ready to have some burdens with your children, then you better not get pregnant in the first place and try to have children. 
Where have we arrived? 
She went through four separate occasions. They were discouraging her even from delivering her child, as desperately as she wanted to do so, not unlike what Viki Wilson ran into. 
Lori Watts did not give up. Lori Watts finally found somebody who would do it, someone who was not going to say that it was a burden, a heartache, or a sorrow, or as the other doctors said, `If you didn't abort, you would be jeopardizing your own fertility, your own health.' 
So after all that treatment, they finally found someone who would do it. 
In the process of the care, prior to the delivery, they found out that the fetus had occipital meningo-encephalocele, which is exactly again what Viki Wilson had. Part of the brain was developing outside of the skull. 
There was an article from today's Washington Times, on page 2, about the Watts family. In that article, Mrs. Watts is quoted saying at this time in her life that `everyone on the other side talks about choice, but they didn't want to give us a choice. They said they would not deliver her.' 
Imagine, people wonder how far we have gone. People wonder how we can be debating partial-birth abortion on the floor of the U.S. Senate and have people get up and argue that it should 
be legal. 
Listen to this. They would not even deliver her at four places--four places. They did finally find someone who would deliver the baby at the University of Maryland Hospital. They delivered through a cesarean section. The Watts' third daughter, Donna Joy--Donna, named after her dad, Donny; Joy, for obvious reasons--was born on November 26, 1991. 
Yes, she was born with a lot of problems, a lot of serious problems. But let me describe to you what they had to confront now after they fought and did not give up to give their daughter a chance. Donna Joy was born with hydrocephaly. 
That is a picture of her shortly after her birth. 
For 3 days--for 3 days--they refused to drain the water off her brain. They said she was going to die, and so they refused to put a shunt in and drain the water. For 3 days they hydrated her, gave her fluids, but they did not feed her because they said she was going to die. 
Mrs. Watts said in this article, `The doctors wouldn't operate on her to save her life. I just about had to threaten one of the doctors physically. And I was seconds from throwing him against the wall. She was already born and they were still calling her a fetus.' 
But Lori and Donny Watts did not give up. They did not cave in to what our culture around sick babies is any more, and they fought on. They had the surgery performed. They began the feeding. Initially, she fed the baby with breast milk in a sterilized eyedropper. Then, at 2 weeks of age, the shunt that was put in failed, and Donna Joy was readmitted to the hospital. 
A tray of food was delivered by mistake to her room. It had some cereal and bananas and some baby formula on it. And so Lori decided that she would mix this together to form a paste, put it in an eyedropper, and place a drop in the back of Donna's tongue. 
You see, Donna Joy was born with about 30 percent of her brain. Donna Joy was born without a functioning medulla oblongata, with a deformed brain stem. She had no control over her sphincter muscle, so things that were given to her would come straight back up. There was nothing to hold the food in her stomach. So Mrs. Watts came up with the idea of getting something that was heavy, pasty, and putting it way back. And it worked. 
You want to talk about a burden and a joy? For the next several months, they had to feed Donna Joy that way. It took an hour and a half to feed their daughter; an hour-and-a-half break and then an hour-and-a-half feeding, 24 hours a day. She had to fight. She had to fight. 
Four months later, a CT scan revealed she also suffered from lobar-haloprosencephaly, a condition that results in the incomplete cleavage of the brain. 
She also suffered from epilepsy, a sleep disorder, and continuing digestive complications. The neurologist suggested that `We may have to consider a gastronomy tube [a gastronomic tube] in order to maintain her nutrition and physical growth.' 
She was suffering from apnea, a condition which spontaneously stops breathing. 
At 18 months, Donna Joy had another brush with death. She contracted encephalitis, which is the inflammation of the brain. So a little girl, with 30 percent of her brain, who has to take medicine so she does not have seizures, hit with another problem of encephalitis. 
As a result of high temperature--she had a 106 temperature--it was a big setback. Up until that time, she was developing along, using sign language. She was not talking, but she was communicating. 
That temperature wiped out, that encephalitis wiped out her memory. She could not walk or talk. She was laying in bed having all sorts of difficulty, could not focus on anybody, and had deteriorated substantially. 
Then a miracle. Lori would tape shows late at night and put them on to give some diversion for Donna Joy to direct her attention. Nothing seemed to work, until one day a television show came on, a tape of a television show called Quantum Leap. The star of the show, Scott Bakula sings a song `Somewhere in the Night.' 
Upon hearing that song, she reacted as follows, according to the newspaper: `The child stopped crying. Mrs. Watts rewound the piece and played it again. This time Donna sat up and tried crawling toward the television. The more she watched Quantum Leap the more Donna improved. She would only eat and drink when the TV character was on the screen. Just before she turned 2, she took her first steps toward Scott Bakula on the TV set.' 
At 2 years, Donna Joy had already undergone eight brain operations, most of which occurred at the University of Maryland hospital. Finally, they received news about Donna Joy's prospects. The neurologist who examined her after her seizure in 1996 noted that at 4 1/2 years of age Donna Joy could speak, walk, and handle objects fairly well. He also thanked a colleague for `the kind approval for the follow-up in allowing me to reassess this beautiful young child who is, remarkably, doing very well in spite of significant malformation of the brain.' 
Today, the story of Donna Joy Watts has inspired many, many people. She can do a lot in spite of her disabilities. She has cerebral palsy, epilepsy, tunnel vision, and Arnold-Chiari Type II malformation, which prevented development of her medulla oblongota. She walks, runs, plays. In fact, she was in my office most of the afternoon playing with my children. I know she has very good dexterity because we have Hershey kisses and Three Musketeer bars in the front of the office, and she can unwrap them as fast as any 5-year-old I have seen. 
Prior to Donna Joy moving to Pennsylvania, the Governor of Maryland, Parris Glendenning, honored her with a Certificate of Courage commemorating her fifth birthday. The mayor of Hagerstown, MD, Steve Sager, proclaimed her birthday Donna Joy Watts Day. Members of the Scott Bakula fan club sent donations and Christmas presents for the Watts children. People from all over the world who learned about Donna Joy on the Internet have been moved to write and send gifts. Perhaps the most important is that the Watts' determination has inspired a Denver couple to fight for their little boy who was born with similar circumstances. 
I asked the Watts if there are other children whom they know who have survived and done this well. Mrs. Watts looked back at me and said, `Other children with this condition are aborted. We don't know. We don't know.' We don't know the power of the human brain. I hear the story all the time about how you do not use all your brain. Well, I guess you do not need it all to be a functioning human being in our world. She is very functional. 
There is a lot of talk that we need to have the abortions, particularly in the case of hydroencephaly to prevent future infertility. In June 1995, Lori and Donny Watts welcomed another child, Shaylah, into the family. Mrs. Watts looked at me very proudly and said, `On the first try.' 
I had the opportunity to walk over here with Donna Joy, hold her hand, ride the subway with her, go up the escalator, which was a big treat, and come up and be in the Senate gallery for only a brief time. She is now back in my office. I encourage anybody who would like to meet her, any one of my colleagues, I encourage all of them to go and talk to the Watts family and to look into the eyes of this little girl, this little girl who could have died through a partial-birth abortion. You want a face on partial-birth abortions? All of the faces are not here to be seen. They die. Brutal. This is the little girl who was saved from partial-birth abortion at 5 1/2 years of age. 
I will read the end of Tony Snow's article about this situation of the Watts. Lori and her husband, both children of steelworkers, had to overcome the contempt of snobbish doctors and social workers as they painstakingly built their own miracle. They never got any help from feminists, liberal Democrats or the President. These days, Don works the 4 p.m.-to-midnight shift in the local corrections facilities so he can spend time with his four kids. Lori educates them in the evening while he is gone. Unfortunately, they went bankrupt a couple years ago and have moved to Pennsylvania, Greencastle, a beautiful community in Franklin County, where they live in a 2-bedroom bungalow on a friend's farm. 
As for choice, here is what Lori has to say: `Choice they didn't give me. I had to beg for a choice. Why did I have to go out of my way when they wanted to kill my baby, when they didn't want to operate or feed her? I didn't get to choose anything.' 
As I mentioned earlier today, I rose and asked unanimous consent to have little Donna Joy Watts sit up there with her mom and dad and watch this proceeding and watch Members debate whether we are going to allow a procedure that could have been used to kill her still be legal in this country. When I asked for that unanimous consent, the Senator from California, Senator Boxer, objected. Donna Joy Watts is only 5 1/2 years of age, although I suggest she has lived a lot in those 5 1/2 years. But you have to be 6 years of age to sit in the Senate gallery unless you can get unanimous consent in the Senate to do otherwise, and Senator Boxer rose and objected. She said, and I quote, `I think I am acting in the best interests of that child.' Oh, how many times has Lori Watts heard that? How many people have said to her, `I am doing this for the best interests of your child.' But she did not listen to them. If she had listened to them she would not be here today, sitting here in Washington, and Donna Joy would not be on this Earth. Thank God Lori did not listen to all of the voices, thank God Donny didn't listen to all of the voices that said, `I think I'm acting in the best interests of your child.' 
There is no reason--there is no reason--for the conditions that the Senator from California outlined as medically necessary reasons to do partial-birth abortions. There is no reason. Those are not good reasons. Here is an example of why it is not a good reason. You do not have to kill the baby. You can deliver the baby. You can do a cesarean section. You may at times--in this case, it was not the case--you may at times have to separate the mother from the child, but you never have to kill the child in the process. You do not have to do it. 
So for all the arguments out there, for all the people who wanted to have a face, that is a beautiful face. It is a beautiful addition, a beautiful contribution to the human spirit. Does it not make you just feel good to know that people love their children so much, love life and respect it so much, that they will get up every 3 hours for an hour and a half every day to feed their children painstakingly one drop at a time? It ennobles us all. It lifts us all up. 
What is the alternative? Death, destruction of a little baby. I do not see how that elevates any of us. How does that add to the human condition? How does that improve the quality of life in America? How are we ennobling our culture by this? How are we standing as a civilization on righteousness with this? There are beautiful tales to be told. Just give these children a chance. 
That is what this bill does. It outlaws a barbaric procedure that is never, never, never, never, never necessary. Hold that thought. Believe that truth, then ask yourself why, why do we have people on the floor of the U.S. Senate, the greatest deliberative body on the face of the Earth, defending such cruelty, such barbarism, to some of the most vulnerable among us? 
I yield the floor.

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, first let me congratulate the Senator from Wyoming for that very touching story about his daughter. I congratulate him for his courage in standing up for her and fighting for her and his willingness to share that with us and his support of this legislation. 
I also would like to thank the junior Senator from Colorado, Senator Allard, for his excellent statement in support of this measure. 
I want to cite specifically the senior Senator from Colorado, Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell. Last year I very vividly remember receiving a call from Senator Coats about Ben sitting in a hospital room in Colorado, watching the debate and talking to doctors and seeing so many people do so much to save life, and his incredibly insightful comments about how he could watch through his door efforts to save life and then look up on the television screen and see C-SPAN and see people who wanted to extinguish life. That conflicted him and disturbed him. 
It is a very hard thing, it is a very hard thing in politics for someone on the abortion issue to walk out of a camp. This issue is a very polarized issue. You are in one camp or the other. You are pro-life or you are pro-choice and you don't waffle. You 
don't walk down the middle of this one or you get run over. It takes a lot of courage to walk out of that camp because you know they are wrong. 
A lot of folks are struggling with this issue today. They are fighting themselves in looking at this issue. They don't feel comfortable being in this camp against this bill. But it takes courage to step out and do the right thing for you, do the right thing according to your conscience, the right thing according to what you believe is best for America. It has political risks, tremendous political risks. You alienate your friends, you open yourself up to attack. 
But I think it just shows a tremendous amount of courage and commitment to your principles, to stand up to your friends. It is easy to stand up to your opponents. We do that all the time. But when you stand up and face the people that you have supported on issue after issue and say, `This time you are wrong,' do you know how hard that is? You know in your own lives, anybody listening here knows how difficult it is to talk to a friend and say, `You know, I have been with you,' and just say, on something they care about, they deeply care about, `You are wrong and I cannot be with you.' It is great courage, the courage of convictions. I applaud him for doing that in a very dramatic and sensitive way. 
Finally, I thank the Senator from Tennessee, Senator Frist, the only physician in the Senate who articulated, not just from a medical point of view but from a moral point of view, why this ban is absolutely necessary and why this procedure is absolutely unnecessary for any reason to be performed on anyone. 
So, we have just begun this debate. Unfortunately, as soon as some other Senators come down here to start the next--I see the Senator from North Carolina is here. I will move on. We will have to break off the debate for a short period of time. I hope we will have more time to debate later this evening, and then, pursuant to this unanimous consent that I will read, we will move tomorrow at 11 o'clock to reconsideration of this bill, bringing this bill back up for consideration, and debate the Boxer amendment. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. on Thursday be equally divided for debate regarding the Feinstein amendment to H.R. 1122, that no amendment be in order to the Feinstein amendment, and, further, at the hour of 2 p.m., the Senate proceed to a vote on or in relation to the Feinstein amendment.

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to begin the debate on the issue of partial-birth abortion. This is an issue that, obviously, has garnered a lot of attention over the past couple of years, both in the House and Senate and across the country. While the bill is not formally before us tonight, the bill will come up tomorrow. I have been informed that it will come up approximately at noon tomorrow, when we can actually begin debate on the bill itself. 
So the debate on partial-birth abortion will begin tomorrow in the U.S. Senate. For those who have been following this issue, the questions that I have been asked, and Members are being asked on both sides of this issue, is not whether this bill will pass. I believe this bill will pass. The question is whether we are going to have sufficient votes to override what appears to be an almost certain Presidential veto. 
In the House a few weeks ago, the House passed the legislation with 295 votes, more than the 290 needed to override the President's veto. We only need 67 votes in the U.S. Senate to be able to override the President's veto. 
At this point, I think by all accounts, we are not there yet. We are still several votes short of the 67 votes committed publicly to supporting this legislation on final passage and supporting it in the face of a Presidential veto. 
I will say we are at least four or five votes short at this time, and we are narrowing down the time here in which decisions have to be made. 
So while I am not particularly optimistic of our opportunities at this point to get the votes necessary to override the President's veto, I think this is an issue that is going to continue to percolate, not only from the time that we debate in the Senate over the next few days, but also after the vote is taken, during the time that the President is considering it, and when the bill comes back here. So there will be plenty of opportunities for further debate, further evaluation as to whether the votes cast by all the Members are the votes that, in fact, will be the votes on the override vote itself. 
What I would like to do in starting the debate is to fill in for those Members who may not have been involved in the partial-birth abortion debate--and we have a lot of new Members this year--to fill in the who, what, when, where, why, how and how many. All of the questions that normally would be asked about anything, let's ask them about the issue of partial-birth abortion. 
This has been an interesting topic of discussion only because of the fabrications that have been built around what this procedure is about, when it is used, how often it is used, who it is used on, where it is used, how many there are. Those have been the subject of a lot of publications and debate about how the people who oppose this legislation have constructed a fantasy, if you will, as to what this procedure is all about. 
So today, as I tried to in the previous debate, I am going to attempt to lay out the truth as we know it. I say as we know it, because a lot of the truth is based upon what the opponents of this legislation tell us is the truth. An example of that is how many of these abortions are performed. The Centers for Disease Control do not track how many partial-birth abortions are done. They only track the abortions and when they are done. They do not track the procedure that is used to perform the abortion. The only people who track that, at least we are told the only people who track that, are the abortion clinics themselves who oppose this legislation vehemently. They are the ones that those of us who have to argue for its passage have to rely upon for the number of partial-birth abortions that are done. That is hardly a comforting position when you have to rely on your opponent for the information that you are to use in challenging the procedure. 
But let me, if I can, walk through first what is a partial-birth abortion. I caution those who may be listening, this is a graphic description of this procedure. I just want to alert anyone who might be watching who might feel uncomfortable with that. 
A partial-birth abortion is, first, an abortion that is used in the second and third trimester, principally in the second trimester. It is used at 20 weeks gestation and beyond by most practitioners of partial-birth abortion. So, by definition, it is later term, you are into the fifth and sixth month of pregnancy. 
The procedure is done over 3 days. You will hear comments by Members who come to the floor of the Senate and suggest this procedure needs to remain legal to protect the life and the health of the mother. First, there is a life-of-the-mother exception in the bill. Very clear. It satisfies any definition of what life-of-the-mother exception needs to be. 
Second, health of the mother. I just question anyone, just on its face, not as a medical practitioner, which I am not, but on the face of it, if the health of the mother is in danger, particularly if there are serious health consequences, why would you do a procedure that takes 3 days? That is what this procedure takes. It is a 3-day procedure. You have a mother who is at 20 weeks, or more, gestation, who has to have her cervix dilated. In other words, they have to create the opening through which the baby can come in the womb, in the uterus. And so it takes 2 days of drugs given to the mother. She does not stay at the hospital. It is not an inpatient procedure. She takes the drugs and goes home. If there are complications they happen at home, not anywhere else. 
The cervix is dilated. When you dilate the cervix, that opens the womb up to infection, but for a 2-day period, the cervix is dilated. On the third day, after a third day of dilation, the mother comes into the abortion clinic. The procedure then proceeds as follows. 
The doctor is guided by an ultrasound, and the abortionist reaches up with forceps and grabs the baby, which is normally in a position head down, grabs the baby by its foot, turns the baby around in the uterus, in the womb, and then pulls the baby out feet first in what is called a breech position. You may have heard of breech birth and the danger of birthing in a breech position. 
Here we have a doctor who deliberately turns the baby around and delivers it in a breech position. 
You may want to ask the question, why do they go through the trouble of pulling the baby out feet first? Why do they not simply deliver the baby head first and do what I will describe later? The reason they pull the baby out feet first and deliver the baby, as the next chart will show, all but the head--they deliver the baby out of the mother, with the exception of the head. 
Why do they leave the head? Why do they not take the head out first, which would be a normal delivery, a safer delivery? The reason they do not deliver the head first is because once the head exits the mother, it has constitutional protection and it cannot be killed, because once the head exits the mother, it is considered a live birth and you cannot kill the baby. So they take the baby out feet first so they can then take a pair of scissors, puncture the back of the baby's skull to create a hole, open the scissors up to create a hole large enough for a suctioning tube to be put in the baby's head, and the brains suctioned out, thereby completing the murder of this baby and then having the baby delivered. 
I just remind you the reason they do not do it head first is because if they did it head first, which would be safer than reaching in with forceps and grabbing the baby out from a breach position, if they did it head first, they could not do this, because once the baby is outside the mother they could not kill the baby. 
Who is this procedure used on? It is used on fully formed babies from 20 weeks on. Now, we will discuss what has been said in the past about who this has been used on. The abortion industry has made claims that this procedure was a rare procedure that was just used--and I will read some quotes--quoting from the Feminist Majority Foundation, `A procedure used less than 600 times a year, and in every case, to protect the life or health of the woman.' `The procedure is used only,' according to the Feminist News, `600 time a year to save the life, health, or future fertility of the woman and in cases of severe fetal abnormality.' Here is another feminist news article, `used less that 500 times a year when necessary to protect the health of the woman facing severe problems due to the pregnancy.' This is the National Abortion Federation factsheet on February 26, 1997: `This particular procedure is used in about 500 cases per year, generally after 20 weeks of pregnancy, and most often when there is severe fetal anomaly or a maternal health problem detected late in pregnancy.' 
The Alan Guttmacher Institute, as well as Planned Parenthood, the National Organization for Women [NOW] Zero Population Growth Fund, Population Action International, and the National Abortion Federation sent a letter October 2, 1995, to the Congress that said, `This surgical procedure is used only in rare cases, fewer than 500 per year. It is most often performed in the cases of wanted pregnancy gone tragically wrong, when a family learns late in pregnancy of severe fetal anomalies or a medical condition that threatens the pregnant woman's life or health.' 
Kate Michelman, President of NARAL, on June 2, 1996: `These are rare terminations. They occur very rarely. They occur under the most difficult of circumstances. As I said, these are pregnancies that have gone awry.' 
Let me tell you what Members of the Congress said. From Pat Schroeder, `There are very, very, very few of these procedures. These procedures are heart-break procedures.' Senator Kennedy, the Senator from Massachusetts, said, `The procedure involved in this case is extremely rare. It involved tragic and traumatic circumstances late in pregnancy, in cases where the mother's life or health is in danger.' Senator Feingold, `In fact, these abortions take place only when the life or health of the mother is at risk.' Senator Daschle, `This is an emergency medical procedure reserved for cases where the life and health of the mother could be endangered or where severe fetal abnormalities are a major factor in the decision made by a woman and her physician.' Senator Carol 
Moseley-Braun, `Partial-birth abortion is a rare medical procedure used to terminate pregnancies late in the term of when the life and health of the mother is at risk or when the fetus has severe abnormalities.' 
That is what we were told over and over. That is what the media bought. That is exactly how they covered this issue. They covered this issue as a very tragic, rare procedure used only in cases of life, health, and fetal abnormality--in only a few hundred cases. 
Now, we knew different. I argued it. Check the record from the last debate, that this was not as rare as they suggested. In fact, I entered into the Record an article written last fall by the Bergen County Sunday Record in New Jersey, where a reporter who took the time to do something reporters usually do not do on debate, particularly when it has to do with checking people in the abortion industry on their facts. She actually checked the facts. This reporter checked at an abortion clinic in northern New Jersey how many of the procedures were performed, and the reporter talked to two doctors, two abortionists, who said that they performed 1,500 partial-birth abortions every year, and not on fatally defective babies or not on unhealthy mothers or unhealthy babies, but usually in the fifth and sixth month for no health reasons at all--healthy moms, healthy babies, healthy pregnancies. 
We had that article already printed. That did not deter the President from saying what he said. We have quotes from the President here. `I came to understand that this is a rarely used procedure, justifiable as a last resort when doctors judge it is necessary to save a woman's life or to avert serious health consequences to her.' 
Now, the President knew better when he said that. That information was available to the President. It is available to him now. But what happened between now and then that has caused such a stir? Well, I can tell you, unfortunately, the media has not done a very good job of exposing this. I do not know of any other reporters who made calls to their abortion clinics. They will not tell me or National Right-to-Life when they call, but they might. Sometimes they do not. I know of a reporter at the Baltimore Sun who tried to contact abortion clinics in Baltimore, and at least what she related to me was they would not talk to her, they would not tell her. I do not know of any reporters who have taken the time to actually check the facts. 
What are the facts as we know them now? Well, thanks to Ron Fitzsimmons, who heads up an organization of abortion clinics--let me repeat this, a man who runs an association here in the Washington area--that represents some 200 abortion clinics all over the country, came out just a couple of months ago and said that he had lied through his teeth and he could not live with it anymore. He had lied through his teeth about what had been said by the abortion industry about the issue of partial-birth abortions. He said that this was not, in fact, a rare procedure, used only in the late term for unhealthy pregnancies and for maternal health reasons or because of a severe fetal abnormality, but this was a procedure used principally in the fifth and sixth month on healthy babies and healthy mothers. In fact, I think the figure 90 percent was used. Then he said, `We estimate the number of these procedures that are done at between 3,000 and 5,000, not 500.' He said, `We have known this all along.' He said as soon as the bill was introduced he called some of his providers, and he knew this from day one of this debate, of, now, I think, 2 or 3 years ago. Yet the industry, knowing this, up until literally the day before, and in fact on the Web page of some of the abortion rights groups, you still find claims that this is a rare procedure used only in the cases of fetal abnormality. So they continue to try to perpetrate the lie, and they certainly did until Ron Fitzsimmons blew the whistle. 
So what do we know now? I am not too sure we know too much. We know from the Abortion Provider Organization that they are willing to admit to 3,000 to 5,000. There is no check on what that 
number is. It could be 3,000 to 5,000, 5,000 to 10,000, 10,000 to 20,000, 20,000 to 30,000. There is no independent verification of that number, and we have to rely on the organization that is here fighting this bill to give us the information which we want to fight over. So we know of at least 3,000 to 5,000, but we also know that in one abortion clinic alone 1,500 were performed last year, and the doctors who were interviewed for that story in the Bergen County Sunday Record said they had trained other abortion doctors in the New York area who also performed the procedure. The other people who were known to perform the procedure and teach it do not reside in the New York area. And we also have reports from a doctor in Nebraska who said that he has performed 1,000 of these abortions. 
So I just caution, as we begin the debate here, that we are debating on some very soft ground when it comes to how many of these abortions are performed, when we make this claim that it is only a few thousand. Maybe I am making too much of the fact that it is a few thousand as opposed to a few hundred. I guess I make the point because it points out the inaccuracy of the opposition's information. Frankly, if it was one, it is as much of a crime, in my mind, and I hope in most Americans' minds. If we subject one baby unnecessarily to this barbarism, is that not enough? Do we need 500? Do we need 1,000? Do we need 3,000 to 5,000? Is that the threshold where Americans will look up and say maybe we should do something about it? One is not enough. It does not stir up moral outrage if it is only 1, 2, 200, or 500. 
Why is this procedure used? As I said before, they suggested that this procedure was used to protect the life and health of the mother. That was the argument being used. As I said before, 90 percent of the abortions, according to the people who oppose this bill, 90 percent of the abortions, are performed electively, for no reason other than the mother decides late in pregnancy that she does not want to carry the baby. 
The question is, is it ever medically necessary to use this? Because that is the argument, that we need to keep this procedure legal because it is medically necessary to protect, as the amendment from the Senator from California, Senator Boxer, which we anticipate being offered, it is necessary to keep this procedure legal to protect the life and health of the mother. 
But we have the life-of-the-mother exception in the bill. So we have taken care of the first issue. Although, as I said before, I cannot imagine--and I have asked on the floor this question, and I ask it again--any circumstance where a mother presents herself in a life-threatening situation where you would then conduct a procedure that takes 3 days in which to abort the child. Again, I am a lay person here, not a physician. I have talked to physicians, and they say there is no such situation. But as a lay person, you don't have to be a doctor to figure this one out. You are rushed and presented to a doctor with a life-threatening situation and they say, let me give you medicine and come back, and then give you medicine again and come back, and they give you more medicine and send you home. That isn't going to happen. But to take care of those who have an objection, we put a life-of-the-mother exception in there. 
Now they want a health-of-the-mother exception. Let's first look at whether this would be used to protect the health of the mother. I have talked to a lot of physicians, obstetricians who have stated very clearly to me that a partial-birth abortion is never necessary to protect the life or health of a mother. That is a group of more than 400 obstetricians, principally obstetricians and gynecologists, and some other physicians, including C. Everett Koop, former Surgeon General of the United States, who, prior to his fame as Surgeon General, was a well-respected and well-known pediatric surgeon who dealt with children shortly after birth, trying to fix some of the problems that they were born with. So we have clear medical judgment that this procedure is never necessary to protect the health of the mother. In fact, they make the argument that it is contraindicated, that it, in fact, threatens the health of the mother for a variety of different reasons. So we have doctors who say that this is not necessary to protect the health of the mother. 
Now, I will ask--and I have asked Members on the other side of this issue--when would this procedure be used to protect the health of the mother? Remember, it is a 3-day procedure. I have talked to physicians who say there are times when the life of the mother is in danger or the health of the mother is in danger and they need to separate the child from the mother. But in none of those cases is it necessary to deliberately kill the baby. They can induce labor, deliver the child vaginally and give it a chance to live. They can do a Cesarean section and deliver the child that way and give the child a chance to live. At no time is an abortion necessary that kills the baby in order to protect the health of the mother. And so why is it performed? 
The answer is very simple. It was given by the person who designed the procedure, who is not an obstetrician. He is a family practitioner who does abortions. He designed this procedure, very candidly, because this was a procedure that he could do on an outpatient basis. The woman would present herself after 3 days of having her cervix dilated, and he would be able to quickly do this procedure, so that he could do more in one day. It is done for the convenience of the abortionist. That is why. It is not done to protect anybody's life or health. It is done to make it easier on the abortionist. And it is used, again, on healthy moms, healthy babies in the fifth and sixth month of pregnancy, in almost all cases.

<TEXT>
Mr. SANTORUM. Where is this procedure done? Will you find this procedure done in the finest hospitals in this country? Will you find it even described in a medical book? Will you find it taught at any school in this country? The answer to all of those questions is `no.' This is not taught anywhere. This has not been peer-reviewed anywhere. This is not used in any major medical center. It is used in abortion clinics exclusively. No hospital will get near this procedure. It is not a peer-reviewed procedure. It is not an accepted medical procedure. It is not in any textbooks or in any kind of educational literature. It is a fringe procedure by someone who wanted to make it easy on themselves to do 
more late-term abortions and do more of them in 1 day. 
So that sort of sums up the who, what, when, why, where, and how many of this procedure. Now, why do we think it is important to outlaw this procedure? Well, there are lots of reasons why I think we should outlaw this procedure. No. 1, because it is a barbaric procedure. I hope that it would shock the consciousness of every Member of the Senate that we would allow innocent human life to be treated in such a deplorable fashion, to be manhandled and destroyed, as we would not even allow a dog to be destroyed. So, on the surface of it, the obvious reason is that this goes beyond the pale of what should be acceptable in our society. I can't imagine a Senator from the United States of America standing on the floor of the U.S. Senate 30 years ago with these charts and having to argue--argue--that this should be illegal in our country. Absolutely incomprehensible. Yet, 30 years later, as a result of Roe versus Wade, we have become so desensitized to the humanity of a baby inside the mother that we will allow this to occur--and defend it, defend it, vehemently defend it as a right. 
The abortion debate in this country since Roe versus Wade has focused on the issue of rights, of choice. The reason I think the abortion industry and abortion rights advocates are so upset about this debate is because, in a partial-birth abortion, you can't miss what is at stake here. This is not about a right. It is about a baby. You can't miss the baby here. It is right here before your eyes. It is right there where you can see it. It is outside of the mother and you can't avoid it. That is why they just cringe when this bill comes to the floor, because now we are talking about the dirty little secret we have had in this country for a long, long time, that abortion--and I will use the words of Ron Fitzsimmons--`One of the facts of abortion is that women enter abortion clinics to kill their fetuses. It is a form of killing. You're ending a life.' Bravo for Mr. Fitzsimmons for stating the obvious. But that is something that the abortion industry has steadfastly avoided. He is talking about what abortion really is. It is about ending a life. And in this case, you can't miss the life. It is right here, right before your eyes, fully formed. The argument about just a blob of tissue or some protoplasm doesn't hold up at this late stage of a pregnancy. This is a baby. It is a fully-formed little baby. In many cases, it's a viable little baby. 
I mentioned Roe versus Wade. There are some people who will argue that this goes over the line, that this violates the provisions of Roe versus Wade. Let me address that issue very briefly and I will refer not only to the committee report in the House, the House Judiciary Committee report, but also the remarks made by my colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, on this issue. It was one of the reasons he supports the ban. When the baby is here in the mother's uterus, Roe versus Wade applies. Roe versus Wade says that, basically, for the first two trimesters, the woman has the right to do whatever she wants to do with that child in her womb. That is what Roe versus Wade says. They said, in the third trimester--it is definitely implied if not stated--because of the fetus', the baby's, potential viability, the rights of the baby come into play and there are limitations on abortion. 
Well, see, we have an interesting case here because this procedure takes the baby outside. The baby is not only outside of the uterus, except for the head, but outside of the mother almost completely, and is in the process of being born. In fact, the baby is almost completely born, hence the procedure's name, `partial birth.' So the baby is no longer completely within the domain of the uterus and then ruled by Roe versus Wade. By leaving the uterus, the baby gains rights that it didn't have inside. 
As an aside, don't you find it an interesting irony that inside the mother's womb this little baby, surrounded by fluid and warmth, is the most vulnerable to be killed and has no protection against someone who wants to kill it. Once it leaves what would be seen by the baby as a safe environment, then it could be protected. But in the place where you would think that the baby would be most secure is the one place where it is the most vulnerable to being killed, and only because this procedure involves partial birth, only because the baby leaves the mother does Roe versus Wade not apply. And so those who argue that we banned second-trimester abortions by banning this procedure--and we would because most do take place in the second trimester--that we violate Roe versus Wade, they don't understand Roe versus Wade. That child is no longer in the uterus and that child, now that it is born and still alive, still feeling, able to feel pain, cannot be killed; or at least we can ban it under Roe versus Wade because it has rights. The baby has rights. 
So we very strongly believe that these spurious arguments that somehow or another Roe versus Wade is being violated--by the way, there is nothing more I would rather see than Roe versus Wade being violated, but it doesn't do it here. This procedure does not do it. This procedure falls well within the constitutional boundaries of Roe versus Wade and Doe versus Bolton. 
Another issue that is being charged against this procedure--or it comes out in favor of this procedure--is the issue of a fetal abnormality. I am going to have a lot to say about the issue of fetal abnormality. But let me just say this for now. We have had Members of the U.S. Senate stand here in some of the finest hours of the U.S. Senate, and argue forcefully, gallantly, to protect the rights, the health, the safety, the security of disabled children. We passed the Americans With Disabilities Act. We are debating ironically--the irony is not lost--IDEA, which has the rights of disabled children in our discussion today. That bill is actually the bill before us as I speak. You will hear such passion. You should listen to some of the debate--those of you who did not--the passion of the Senators defending the right for children with disabilities to have access to educational opportunities so they can maximize their human potential. Yet, unfortunately some of the most passionate speakers on that issue--turn around and passionately argue that because of their disability we should be able to kill them before they are born. 
Abraham Lincoln used a Biblical verse. `A house divided against itself cannot stand.' How can you with any kind of reflective conscience argue that the right to be so that children with disabilities have the ability to maximize their human potential and the Government should be there to ensure that their rights are not trampled upon and then not be willing to give them the most precious of all rights, the right to live in the first instance? How can you be a champion of the disabled when you will use fetal abnormality as an excuse to kill them in the first place? 
It is a shocking realism in this country that goes back to what I suggested before, which is we have become so desensitized to human life to kill a little baby, that unseen, unborn child, that because it is unseen you can just put it out of your mind, it is not really seen. That desensitization has consequences. We are seeing the consequence right now. We are debating this procedure. It is incredible to me that we even have to debate this. But it is here because people just have forgotten what life is all about, and what life means. 
We have across the street, at the Supreme Court, the issue of doctor-assisted suicide. We have had lower courts say that doctor-assisted suicides are OK. We have massive organizations --I do not know how massive--at least organized organizations that advocate for allowing people to kill themselves and to have doctors help them. Again, I look back at 20 or 30 years ago and wonder whether that debate could have occurred at this time. But do not be surprised, particularly if this bill is unsuccessful, if we send the message out to the country that says human life isn't really that valuable, that we can in fact brutalize the most innocent children who have done nothing wrong to anybody. 
It is amazing. You can describe this procedure. I saw a television commercial put out by one of the groups who showed a prisoner shackled, both arms and legs, walking down death row and being put in a chair. While he was walking and he was led to the chair, what if a voice describes the procedure, describes taking the scissors and puncturing the base of the skull and sticking a vacuum tube in the base of the skull and suctioning the brain out? The courts would clearly find that cruel and unusual punishment and violative of the Constitution. But you can do that to a little baby who hasn't killed anybody. It hasn't robbed, raped, stolen, nor harmed a soul. And then we wonder what is happening to our culture. We wonder, as we sit at home and we listen to the news, and we listen and we read the papers, and we see the young people out there, and we wonder. Why have they gone astray? What is happened to the fabric of our culture? Why don't they have respect for our country, for people's goods, for other people's lives? Why, indeed? You need to look only this far: 1.5 million abortions a year, as public, and as customary, and as usual, and, as a matter of fact, as any number you will hear on the U.S. floor--1.5 million abortions. 
OK, what is next? You will hear it discussed in the news: 
Abortion. It is a matter of choice. It is someone else's decision. I do not want to get involved. It has nothing to do with me. Look around you. Things are coming to roost in this country. When you have such disdain for human life that we are seeing exemplified, magnified, by allowing this procedure to go forward, by allowing this innocent little baby to be mutilated, butchered in such a way. People who vote for this to remain legal have answered their own question as to why our culture is the way it is, because the great, great leaders of our country, the role models--that is what we are, whether we like it or not. Every Senator who goes into a school--and I go into a lot of them--particularly young kids. I am sure the Presiding Officer now sees this as a new Member of the Senate. Oh, they would love to have your autograph. They want to have your picture taken with them because you are someone to look up to. You are someone who has achieved a level of excellence that we admire in this country. You are in a position of authority. What you say and think matters. And they look up to us. 
Is this what you want them to see? Is this what you want to teach the next generation, that this kind of brutality is OK, and then you wonder why you see random acts of violence and you wonder why you see no respect for human life? The consequences are real. They are here. We don't have to speculate as to what the consequences of this are. They are here, and we are living with it. 
All we want to do here is to take one little step in creating some decency again, one meek little message for the people in this country that life should be respected, that children should not be brutalized unnecessarily. That is what this procedure does. 
You will hear arguments that this will not stop abortions. It may be true. I wish I could say this would stop hundreds and thousands of abortions. But I am not too sure that it will. 
What I am sure of is that this brutality will stop and we will send a very clear, positive message to Americans and to the world that this kind of barbarism has no place in American culture, certainly no place in the laws of our country. 
So I hope that as Members come tomorrow and we begin the formal debate on this bill that they will come with open minds and open hearts, that they will seek the truth. This debate has been surrounded by lies from those defending the procedure. Hopefully those admissions of lies will give people the opportunity to look anew at what the facts are, not just the facts of when this is used, but how it is used. I went through all of those things--but what the ramifications are for this country and for our society. 
The abortionists are probably right. We are not going to stop a lot of abortions. There are other methods of abortion available if we outlaw this. Abortions unfortunately on babies this age will continue. But we send a signal, as small as it is. 
That is why I guess I am so shocked at the vehemence of the opposition, the opposition that says this will not stop abortions, the opposition that admits that this is rare and that this is a fringe procedure. They admit it is not a commonly used procedure, that it is not in the medical literature. They know all of that. Yet, they stand here, backs to the wall, fighting for every last inch of not defendable territory. Folks, this is not defendable territory. 
We may not win this time. I don't know what God has planned for this debate. But we may not win this time. That is OK. We will be back. 
This is wrong. So when people in the U.S. Senate who believe something is wrong don't stand up and fight to overturn that wrong, we will be in for very serious, even more serious, consequences for this country. 
So I hope that my colleagues, enough of my colleagues, would share my concern, would look at the new evidence. There are new facts that are accurate to the degree they can be accurate relying on the other side. There are more accurate facts available now on this debate. There is ample reason to reconsider this vote. 
I hope that they would be led by both their hearts and their minds because on both scores we win. There is no medical reason for this procedure to occur. You will not find any physician anywhere describing any condition where this procedure is necessary and is the only one available to be used for whatever situation. In fact, as I said before and I will say over and over again, this is a 3-day procedure. Why would it ever be used in a life-threatening situation when there is imminent health damage? It would not be used. We have hundreds of physicians who have testified via letters that this procedure is never medically indicated. 
So on the facts, on the medical facts, using their brain only, this is not only unnecessary, unwarranted, but unhealthy. 
I will share one other statistic from the Alan Guttmacher Institute, one of the signatories of the letter I referred to earlier with NOW and NARAL. This is an organization which is very much proabortion. This is a very, very radical group. And here is what their numbers say. After 20 weeks gestation, after roughly 4 and a half months, abortion is twice as dangerous to maternal health as delivering a baby. So to even suggest that abortion is necessary in cases of whatever, fetal abnormality or just because you do not want to have the child, that that is safer for the mother than delivering the baby either via Cesarean section or by vaginal delivery, the pro-choice institute, Alan Guttmacher Institute, says that it is twice as dangerous to the life of the mother to have an abortion after 20 weeks as it is to deliver the baby. 
So if you are really wrapped up on this issue of health, abortions are more dangerous than delivering the baby. There is no health reason to do this procedure. In fact, because it is a blind procedure--the abortionist cannot see the base of the skull, and so they have to feel--as you see, they have to feel with their hands and then take a blunt instrument and puncture the base of the skull, which can cause bone fragments. This is a very blood-rich area, a lot of veins exposed. There can be damage done by doing this blind procedure. This is not a procedure that protects the health of the mother. 
So using your brain, looking at the facts, this is a no. We should not allow this. This is dangerous. This is wrong. And I would think--I cannot speak to the heart, but I would think that your heart and that your conscience and the reason that so many Members have struggled so hard with this--and I know they have, people who I know believe deeply in this right of privacy and the right to abortion as enumerated in Roe versus Wade, that they have made their moral judgment that this is OK, but even to those Members this stirs a disquiet. This stirs some uncomfortableness in them. Follow your heart. Your brain is there. If you look at the facts, the brain is going to be there. The only thing stopping you is your heart. Open your heart to these babies. Do not let this kind of barbarism continue. Stop the murder, stop the infanticide, and you will not be violating Roe versus Wade, not one word of it. 
So as we start this debate tomorrow, I intend to debate the facts. I intend to stand up and go through all of the arguments not only on this procedure but on Senator Daschle's amendment, Senator Boxer's amendment, and talk about why those two amendments, particularly the Daschle amendment, I might add, not only is a sham in the sense it is just political cover, which is exactly what it is, it does not accomplish anything. The Daschle amendment which we will debate, I am sure, tomorrow will not stop one partial birth abortion, not one. The Daschle amendment will not stop any abortion. In fact, I will argue tomorrow, and I think I can point out clearly from the language of the text, the Daschle amendment expands Roe versus Wade. Yes, this amendment which is supposed to be a compromise--interesting we use the term `compromise' when the Democratic leader never talked to anybody on our side of the issue. You would think when you are trying to compromise with someone you would talk to the other side in reaching a compromise. 
That did not happen. I did not receive one phone call or even the hint of a phone call. No one else that I know of who supports 
the bill--of the 42 cosponsors of the bill, it is my understanding none of them received a phone call. And so this compromise, which was drafted by people who oppose this bill to give political cover by saying things like, well, we are going to ban all postviability abortion, then leaves it to the abortionist to decide what is viable and what is a health exception because they have a health exception--we will ban all postviability abortions except for life and health. Who determines health? The person performing the abortion. 
Wait a minute. Let me get this straight. You have someone performing an abortion. They are doing it. They are performing an abortion on a client. They are killing a baby. After they finish killing the baby, then they have to certify whether this baby was either viable or there was an exception for the life or health of the mother. 
Put yourself in the position of the abortionist. Are you going to say the baby was viable and I killed it? There was no health exception and I went ahead and killed the baby. Raise your hands. How many people think that the abortionist is going to claim that they violated the law? Because they are the only ones who certify to it. No one else can. Many times I have seen in the paper this debate has been analogized to the debate on the second amendment, the right to bear arms. 
Let me give you this analogy. It is like passing a piece of legislation on assault weapons. That was a very popular topic. It is like passing a piece of legislation on assault weapons and saying that the gun dealer will define what an assault weapon is for purposes of whether they break the law. 
That is exactly what this bill does. It allows the doctor to define what the law is, in other words, what the exceptions to the law are, and no mentally competent abortionist who has just aborted a baby is going to claim they broke the law, just like no mentally competent arms dealer is going to sell a howitzer and say it is an assault weapon. They are not going to say it is an assault weapon. I broke the law. You let me certify it. A howitzer is not an assault weapon. And under the Daschle bill, if we could apply it to guns, the arms dealer is OK. Wait a minute. We have the certification here. No problem. He certified it is not a howitzer. He said it is not an assault weapon. He said it is something else. 
Again, just remember the people offering this amendment have a 100 percent voting record against pro-life issues. They have vehemently opposed this bill from day one. You can always tell the validity of this kind of legislation by who supports and who opposes. 
Now, you would think that an industry--and that is what abortion, unfortunately, has turned into with 1.5 million a year. It is an industry. You would think that an industry that has gone to tremendous lengths and expense to oppose a ban on a procedure which they admit is infrequent, that does not happen very often, that is only an alternative and others could be done in place of it, that they argue is not going to stop one abortion, that they would fight vehemently against this that will not, in their own words, stop one abortion, they argue against this, yet they support Senator Daschle's proposed amendment. 
Now, wait a minute. If Senator Daschle's proposal actually stopped abortion, do you think they would support it? I think you can answer that for yourself. The people who oppose it are people like myself who understand what it is. It is a sham. The proposal does nothing except one potentially very dangerous thing. By giving the abortionist the right to determine what health and viability is, you expand Roe versus Wade because under Roe versus Wade at least third-trimester babies are somewhat protected. Under the Daschle proposal, there is no protection, none. It is whatever the abortionist wants to do and the mother agrees to do at any time. Oh, you can probably string the viability issue along to 35 or 36 weeks and you probably have to admit that after 35 weeks that baby is viable. But the health, there is all sorts of health things 
that can go on even at that late time. 
So I would just caution my colleagues who are considering this legislation that this is a real change in the law. This will have an impact on stopping a procedure that has no place in American society. The Daschle proposal not only does not change the face as far as the existing rights of abortionists and abortion, I have argued and will continue to argue that it expands the right to abortion. Anyone voting for the amendment of the Senator from South Dakota will vote to strike this procedure--in other words, vote against this procedure because his amendment which will be offered tomorrow strikes this procedure from the bill. In other words, cuts it, amends it out and replaces it, substitutes it with his phony ban which not only does not ban anything but expands the right to an abortion. 
So I would just caution Members when they vote on Senator Daschle's amendment that they are doing two things, one of which they will admit they are doing. They are getting rid of this legislation. That is No. 1. So they will be voting against this procedure being banned. And No. 2, they will be expanding the rights of abortionists and abortion beyond what Roe versus Wade currently does by allowing the abortionist to have complete authority over what is a health exception, what is viability. 
So, this is really a very clear debate, and we will commence tomorrow in formality between those who want to at least take a procedure and say this goes too far, that the right to an abortion is not so absolute as to allow this kind of barbarism to occur, and others who believe that Roe versus Wade did not go far enough. In spite of all the rhetoric we will hear tomorrow, the bottom line, with the amendment of the Senator from South Dakota, is that he will be arguing in fact--not by his words, because I am sure he will not agree with that--but in fact--read the language, his amendment will loudly say that Roe versus Wade is not broad enough, that we need more access to abortion than we have today. 
I think, of anything that I have learned in dealing with this issue, particularly when it comes to children who are in utero, with disabilities, that the issue is not the ability to get an abortion in this country. If you have a child with a disability, and it is diagnosed in utero, I guarantee not only will the abortion option be made available to you, because they are legally required to do that, but if they see a badly deformed baby, they will do everything, most of the physicians, most genetic counselors, will do everything to encourage you to have an abortion. 
I will talk about one such instance tomorrow. For those Members I spoke about earlier who can come to terms with this debate on the intellectual level and have trouble crossing the threshold of the heart, I will put a face on partial-birth abortion. It will put a face on what is going on out in our country, with doctors who are so afraid of malpractice, so afraid of difficult and complicated deliveries that they choose the easy way out. `Let's get her to abort the baby now so we don't have to deal with this.' 
Many of you are thinking, `Oh, I can't believe that.' Believe it. Believe it. It happens every day. You do not see any wrongful death suits, do you, against abortionists for terminating a pregnancy? I am not aware of any. But you will see wrongful birth suits for children born, and their parents, incredibly, believe that their child was better off dead than born. 
So, for doctors, as normal human beings, risk averse, it is easier to abort. You can't get sued when you abort. They sign all these waivers and consents. We will be fine. But they can sue us if we do not do everything we can to get them to abort beforehand and we have a complicated delivery and things happen, or the baby is deformed and we did not explain maybe well enough how deformed the baby was. 
I would argue it is easier to get an abortion in this country when you are carrying a child with a fetal abnormality than it is to find a doctor who will deliver it. I will tell you a story tomorrow of exactly that case. I am sure there are other cases out there. In fact, I know there are other cases out there. 
It goes back to the point I was making. Not only do we as a society, but unfortunately the people who are most responsible for delivering our children become so callous, many of them--not all of them. Certainly not all of them. I hope most would understand the significance of a human life and protect it and honor it and dignify it. But, sadly, that is not the case in far too many instances with the professionals in the field of genetics counseling. 
My father-in-law, Dr. Kenneth Garver, went into genetic counseling when he was a pediatrician in Penn Hills, PA. He decided to go into genetic counseling and medical genetics. I know one of the reasons that drove him to do so was not only the fascinating developments in medical genetics, which were certainly a lure to someone as bright as he and as interested as he was in the subject, but a fear, that has been borne out to be a legitimate fear, that the people who have been drawn to that field are people who do not believe that that baby has a right to life, who very much believe in abortion and counsel for it and, in far too many cases, encourage it. It is a field that he got into because he wanted at least someone--someone--where men and women who are 
going through a difficult pregnancy could come and not be browbeaten into having an abortion. 
You say, `Oh, Senator, you are being extreme here.' I will tell you the story of little Donna Joy Watts and you tell me how extreme I am. And I will tell the stories of people who have written to me and talked to me and called me and e-mailed me about situation after situation where those same set of facts have come forward. What have we come to when we encourage people who desperately want to hold onto their children that this is the only way? 
Some will say it is by ignorance. I suggest in many cases it is ignorance, but in many cases it is ignorance of convenience that a lot of these physicians would just rather not have to deal with the situation. So the first knee-jerk reaction is, `Well, the baby is not going to live long. Abort it.' Or, `The baby is going to have all sorts of complications. Abort it.' 
All we are trying to do here is to say stop the infanticide. That is the term used by the Senator from New York, Senator Moynihan, and I believe the Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter--both of whom are generally on the opposite side of the issue on the issue of abortion. But they recognize that when a baby is outside the mother's womb and, as nurse Brenda Shafer said, moving its arms and legs, in the case that she described, the partial-birth abortion she described, the baby had the face of an angel. It was a perfectly healthy, normal baby. 
It thought--and yes, thought, because babies have brains; they are human beings--thought as it was leaving this environment that was so warm and protected, little did it know that it would meet with this kind of brutality. Folks, it's not just once, or twice, or 10, or 20, or 100, or 500--thousands. Untold thousands. 
I am hopeful that, as a result of all the things that were discussed for the past several months as a result of the statements by Ron Fitzsimmons, Members of this Senate will look again, look at this procedure, look at the consequences, real consequences of what the U.S. Senate and the Government of the United States will convey to the young people of our country, to any person in our country, that we will allow these innocent babies to be murdered like this. 
If we send that kind of message, I guarantee I will be down here when one of the Senators who did not support this stands up and beats his breast, complaining about why the crime rate is so high, why there is no respect for property, why there is no respect for life, why there is no respect for--you name it. 
Kids aren't dumb. They pay attention. I have a 6-year-old and a 4-year-old and a 1-year-old. It frightens me how much they pay attention to everything you do, whether you know it or not. They pick up so much. 
You see yourself. You know. You see yourself in your kids so much you just don't even realize all the little things that you do that they see. They will see this. They will understand what this means. They will understand that life is not important, that, unless you are big, strong, healthy, able to protect yourself, there is no protection. It is survival of the fittest. We wonder why we have a cynical generation X; everyone believes they are out for themselves, that everyone does things in their own self-interest. What could be more in self-interest than this? What can be more selfish than this? What kind of message are we conveying? This is ultimate selfishness. It was not convenient. I was not ready. I--I--I--I. 
This is a baby. It is not `I,' it is `we.' But we have told the message to the young people, only `I' matters. Then we wonder why they feel the way they do. We wonder why they act the way they do. We wonder what has happened to our culture, what has happened to our society. You need only look this far. You need only look at the selfishness, the individual self-centeredness of this procedure. A procedure we would not do on Jeffrey Dahmer, a procedure we would not do on the worst criminal in America, we will do on a healthy little baby. 
I hope the Senate says no. I hope the Senate can just muster the moral courage to say no and live up to the dignity of this place. It is an impressive place. Great men and great women have stood in this hall and fought for noble causes. I cannot think of any more noble a cause than protecting a helpless, beautiful--whether deformed or not, in the eyes of God, beautiful baby. 
I ask everyone within the sound of my voice to pray that that happens, that the Senate says no more, this is where we begin to draw the line. I ask you not only to contact your Senators by e-mail or write or call or drop by their offices, I ask you to pray that somehow their eyes will open to what the consequences of our actions are, what it means to us as a society, as a culture. What the reporters are writing today is this bill will fall short of the 67 votes needed to override the President's veto. If you do, those things I have asked, who knows? 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas for his leadership on this issue and his continuing leadership on this issue. 
To paraphrase a colloquial that is used often, `Been there, done that.' We have been here and we have done this many, many times before. A disaster bill comes, a supplemental comes to the Senate floor--to the House floor when I was in the House--with these pictures. I guess these are on the Senators' desks. These are very compelling pictures of horrible 
disasters. And I understand the pictures. 
Let me give you some credibility here before I go on about what is going on in the Dakotas and in the upper Midwest. I was here last year on another emergency supplemental bill for Pennsylvania disaster funding, $1.2 billion. Most of that money was going to Pennsylvania. I stood here with Senator Gramm, supporting his amendment to do the same thing when the money was directed at my State. Because it is not right to use--I hate to put it in these strong terms but this is what is going on--to use the calamity of others to run up the deficit. That is exactly what is going on. 
I know that sounds harsh. We have a FEMA. Even the committee report says that FEMA acknowledges that the escalation in costs is due not only to the increase in large-scale disasters, but also because the scope of Federal disaster assistance is expanded, the Federal role in response is expanded considerably, and State and local governments are increasingly turning to Federal Government for assistance. Not only are we not budgeting enough money to FEMA in the annual budget--Why? Let us ask that question first. Why are we not budgeting enough money to FEMA? We know these disasters come. They come every year. This is not a surprise. Why don't we do it? Because we want to spend it somewhere else and we know we can bring these pictures to the Senate and get borrowed money to do it later. So we do not have to live within our budget. We can underfund FEMA, knowing that no one is going to deny these people who are facing this horrible disaster. And, if you do, you left your heart at the door and how dare you come in and say you are compassionate? 
I mean, that is just a shell game. I want to state for the record, as I did last year, I am for disaster relief. But I am for doing what we should do with every aspect of our budget, which is set priorities. If the priority of this Senate, if the priority of this Congress, the priority of the President is to make sure that these people get the disaster relief they deserve--fine. Count me in. But when the refrigerator breaks you cancel the vacation. And that means that you have to come up with some other area of the budget and fund it. 
Some will say, if this is a disaster in the family, if the refrigerator breaks, I may have to borrow money. That is true. But if your refrigerator keeps breaking, then at some point you have to realize you are not budgeting right here. There is something wrong and you have to fix the problem. What we have is a broken refrigerator in FEMA and the way we fund FEMA, and a broken refrigerator in the way they are more and more taking a bigger and bigger share of disaster relief costs. That is a very serious problem and it is blowing big-time holes in the deficit of this country. 
So, I know it is not popular to stand up here--and Senator Gramm and I maybe make somewhat of a career on taking unpopular stances. But this is not right. It is not right to, on the backs of those suffering, really pursue your other agenda. Because we all know that money is going to North Dakota and South Dakota. We all are for that. It is not that money that is really being debated here. It is the other money that is stuck in there that should have been going to FEMA in the first place. That is the money they are really protecting here. That is the money they are hiding. That is what they do not want to cut. 
What Senator Gramm has put forward is a very reasonable proposal. It says cut 1.9 percent across the board. We would like to do it in a targeted way, but you cannot do that kind of thing. We have rules against that. So he has to do it across-the-board. And it says in the future, as we spend money for this disaster, it just has to stay under the caps. In other words, it cannot increase the deficit. 
It is a reasonable proposal that says live within your means. Responsibly budget for disasters. Do not use these very gut-wrenching, heart-wrenching, heartfelt, compassionate stories to fund your little projects off here to the side and to fund all those other things that could not stand the light of day if, in fact, they were compared to funding these or those.

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, the supplemental appropriation before us today contains funding for floods which devastated the Northwestern and Midwestern States. I can appreciate the necessity of providing FEMA funding for those States. The last time that this body considered a measure to provide funding for disaster assistance, it was a proposal for $1.2 billion in assistance, mainly to my State of Pennsylvania. That funding was an acknowledgment of the devastation that occurred as a result of the harsh winter, extensive snowfall, and severe flooding throughout Pennsylvania. 
Again, Mr. President, the situation is no less severe and the need no less dire in the Northwest and Midwest. I sympathize with those Senators from affected States that have taken to the floor during this debate to talk about the devastation to homes, businesses, and communities that they have seen firsthand. The FEMA funding in this bill will be very helpful to States and localities in providing swift assistance in a timely manner. 
During our last debate, Mr. President, I offered an amendment addressing the need for a structural change in the manner in which the Federal Government provides disaster funding. Specifically, the Senate passed several amendments I offered to the fiscal year 1996 omnibus appropriations bill which provided a mechanism to pay for $1.2 billion in disaster funding, called for a long-term funding solution, and ensured that disaster assistance funds were deficit neutral in the final conference committee bill. 
The bill before us today and, specifically, the committee report build upon several of those amendments debated and passed last year. The committee report addresses concerns with the long-term structure of FEMA. The FEMA funding contained in this bill is offset by corresponding spending reductions within the same subcommittee jurisdiction. The work done by Senator Bond, chairman of the VA/HUD Appropriations Subcommittee, and Senator Mikulski, the ranking member, admirably balances the need for FEMA funding with the necessity of finding reductions within the jurisdiction of their subcommittee. 
Specifically, I would like to cite page 26 of the committee report which mentions that: 
The Committee notes its continuing concern with the escalating costs of FEMA disaster relief. . . . FEMA acknowledges that the escalation of costs is due not only to the increase in large-scale disasters, but also because the scope of Federal disaster assistance has expanded, the Federal role in response has expanded considerably, and State and local governments are increasingly turning to the Federal government for assistance. . . . 
The report also states that, `The FEMA Director is committed to submitting a comprehensive proposal, including proposed legislation, by July 4, 1997.' 
Mr. President, I would like Senator Bond to know of my continuing interest in working with him and the subcommittee on structural reform of FEMA, and of my anticipation of the report and recommendations from FEMA due in a few months. I will be sending him a letter offering my assistance, resources, and energies in restructuring the manner in which we have budgeted and provided relief for natural disasters. Senator Bond's statement in the committee report references several proposals worth considering. Among those reforms are the development of objective disaster declaration criteria and comprehensive Federal policies to control the Federal costs of disaster assistance, review of the appeals process, elimination of funding for tree and shrubs replacement, elimination of assistance for cultural and decorative objects, elimination of funding for certain revenue-producing facilities such as 
golf courses and stadiums, and creation of incentives for States and local governments to carry insurance to cover the repair and rebuilding of their infrastructure after a disaster. 
There are several other proposals and recommendations that I have previously reviewed and that I hope we would also consider. Those proposals would require stringent, written justification by the President and Congress to designate emergency appropriations; enact a requirement for a three-fifths majority budget point of order for emergency supplemental appropriations; identify multi-year spending cuts to pay for emergency appropriations and remain within the budget; base annual disaster funding on historic funding levels, permitting occasional surpluses; and protect the contingency fund from being raided as a funding source for nondisaster projects. 
Our action today is not without concerns, and I wanted to touch on a few areas of the supplemental appropriation, aside from the issue of disaster assistance. The supplemental appropriation is unfortunately riddled with additional spending in a variety of accounts and programs. The majority of these programs are not associated with the Northwest and Midwest floods. Rather, this process seems to serve as a vehicle to bolster Federal funding for programs that have otherwise operated this fiscal year under a very fair and widely supported allocation. The supplemental funding that is not associated with either Federal disaster assistance or support for our troops in Bosnia reverses the work done in both the fiscal year 1996 and fiscal year 1997 omnibus appropriations bills. More troubling is the fact that the total amount of funds provided in this bill today is not completely offset with spending reductions and this overall supplemental appropriations package is not deficit neutral. For the remainder of this fiscal year, the bill creates excess spending of $467 million in budget authority and roughly $1 billion in outlays. The budget projection for years 1998 through the year 2002 create an even more troubling scenario. 
I have been working with Senator Gramm on two amendments to pay for both the 1997 funding shortfall and the imbalance for the remaining fiscal years. Those two amendments would make the fiscal year 1997 appropriations deficit neutral. The remaining spending obligations under the bill would count against the new budgetary caps established under the recent balanced budget agreement. Both amendments will rectify shortfalls in the bill and are in the spirit of how this body should continue to conduct our business--spending must remain deficit neutral. Again, Mr. President, the FEMA disaster assistance in this bill is offset. The issue with this bill is about additional discretionary spending versus shortfalls in spending reductions, and the need for this bill to be deficit neutral. I hope that this body will support the amendments.

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate the Presiding Officer, who just spoke, for his stick-to-itiveness in continuing to force this issue here in the U.S. Senate and, finally, accomplishing what we had hoped to accomplish and probably should have accomplished a couple of days ago, which is at least to move to this bill and begin the debate on whether we can, here in the U.S. Senate, do some positive things to the volunteer spirit of America, to see if we can remove some of the barriers that are in place right now that limit the amount of volunteer participation in our society. 
I think the present Presiding Officer's remarks about the Philadelphia summit, the spirit created there, the momentum that was created there can only be enhanced. The big concern in Philadelphia, as I talked to so many people, was, `Isn't this wonderful? Don't you feel this great spirit? Don't you feel like we are focused on the right thing and we are pulling the country together, Republican and Democrat alike, liberal or conservative, focusing on a value that we all share?' It is an understanding that is sort of core as an American to understand the significance of participating as a volunteer in your community and the benefit that it gives not only the people you volunteer for but the benefit it gives you. But the big concern I heard over and over again, even from the most enthusiastic supporters of the summit, was, `Can we keep this going? Can this momentum continue? Will much happen after this week? How can we keep this spirit alive and keep this momentum that we have built, the commitments that were made? How can we continue to keep this ball rolling?" 
I point right here to the U.S. Senate. This is the best way that I know of to keep the ball rolling, to keep the momentum going. If we follow up this week and maybe early next week with the passage of this legislation, with a strong message to the American public and to the prospective volunteers in America that not only do we think it is a good thing--and everybody says nice things about voluntarism and we talk about the benefits of it and about all of the wonderful things that it accomplishes for your community and for you as an individual--but we can lay down something solid, something tangible for them to say that things are different. It is not just that people are talking about it now, or not that it is an in-vogue thing, but there is a different set of ground rules now to participate and, to me, they are much more favorable. I don't have to look over my shoulder as a Little League coach as to whether I gave the catcher the right mask. I know that was one of the examples that was used over in the House. 
But I am doing this because I love my community, I love my neighbors, and I want to do something positive to contribute to their lives. I want to do so in a way that I feel that I can really express myself without having to be concerned about the whole troop of lawyers hanging in the wings for somebody who may have some accident in the process of volunteering. 
So I think what we are doing here is taking that first step after the summit. This is the first step. People who have given all the great speeches about how important voluntarism is--if they don't follow through with doing something to move this agenda forward then I think we have every right to question the sincerity of the remarks. We have every right to question whether this was in fact a political stunt, and nothing more; that this was an attempt to revive individuals involved in their own public reception and nothing more than that; that it wasn't really real. 
This is an opportunity to make the summit in Philadelphia more real in the eyes of the American public, to do something tangibly good for the volunteer in America, and thereby for the needy among us who have such a need and such a desire to deal with their fellow men and neighbors in solving the problems that confront them and their communities. 
So I again congratulate the Senator from Georgia for his tremendous drive and enthusiasm and stick-to-itiveness to stand up here--for 3 days now--and fight this battle and refuse to relent. 
I know some have said we are holding things hostage. I would suggest that this bill releases hostages all over America who are hostage to litigation fears--who now can go out and participate in their communities, and do the kind of things that will liberate so many other people who are in the need of volunteers, and the organizations with whom they work. 
So I again congratulate the Senator from Georgia. I commend him for this. 
It sounds like we have accomplished something tremendous. We have. All we have accomplished is that we can now talk about the bill, and we can now debate the bill. We are going to have, I am sure, amendments that will dramatically weaken this and that will take the teeth out of this legislation. Unfortunately, those will be offered on the floor. We have a tough battle ahead of us to be able to stand up to those kinds of weakening amendments, stay the course, and follow through with this responsibly. 
I believe it is a very valid piece of legislation that preserves the right of those who are injured and at the same time liberates the volunteer in America to go out and pursue what they know in their hearts is the right thing to do which is to serve their fellow man to a greater good. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Chair. I thank the distinguished Senator from Georgia for his kind words and congratulate him on many counts. No. 1, for this piece of legislation. And while this piece of legislation has been around in various forms for quite some time, one thing it never had on its side was Paul Coverdell in a leadership role. 
One thing I found out about this place is things happen when people have the energy, the enthusiasm, a good plan, a good game plan and a willingness to work hard to bring the issue to the fore, and Paul Coverdell does that with every issue I have ever seen him engage in. He has taken this issue and plucked it out of obscurity and driven it to the front here at a very appropriate time. 
And so the Senator's sense of timing is magnificent in bringing it up here at a time when many of us, who just yesterday were in Philadelphia at the volunteer summit, were very moved by what was going on there, excited about the opportunity. I had a tremendous opportunity personally to have a good, long talk with Harris Wofford, who, as you know, I succeeded in the Senate. We had a really delightful conversation about how this is a project that, while we may be apart on very many things, we can find common ground on and work together on. In fact, we worked together a lot on the summit, to make sure that a lot of the small organizations, small charitable organizations and nonprofits were included. We understood the significant role that they play in the nonprofit community of America, the volunteer community of America. 
So we saw a lot of coming together--right, left, Republican, Democrat--in Philadelphia. It was a wonderful experience. Bringing this bill to the floor was a hope, I guess, on the Senator's part, and certainly on mine, that we would see that spirit continue in the new Capitol of the United States, not where it all started in Philadelphia. 
It is unfortunate that we had a failure with this cloture motion today just to move to the bill. I think it is in some ways disturbing. We have in a sense solidarity going on on a subject that is at the core of who we are as America. I think we had a coming together, an understanding of the need for all of us to go beyond ourselves and look to each other and look at our brothers and our sisters and our neighbors, at their needs and the needs of our communities in fulfilling the promise of America. That was so clear in Philadelphia and yet becomes somewhat murky and cloudy here on the Senate floor, of all places, where it should be critically clear that is in fact the prerequisite to success in America. 
It is disturbing, but I am confident, as I am sure the Senator from Georgia is, with continued effort we will bring to the American public, as we try to do this afternoon and hopefully will do in the next several days, the importance of this particular piece of legislation in making what is going on in Philadelphia a reality. 
I heard the Senator from Georgia, the Senator from Indiana, the Senator from Kentucky, and others talk here about the importance of this legislation to so many nonprofit organizations all across this country. I could speak for 
Pennsylvania because that is where I have done the majority of visiting nonprofit organizations that serve the needs of communities, the team mission in the city of Chester in Delaware County, where I was just a few weeks ago, and I asked about the issue of the costs associated with liability insurance. 
The director there told me that his costs have skyrocketed in the last few years and now he is paying tens of thousands of dollars for liability coverage for his board, just a nonprofit board of well-meaning people in the city of Chester who want to serve in a capacity of helping, promote, organize, run, operate a mission in the city of Chester which has gone under some very tough times over the last several years. They are expending thousands and thousands of dollars on liability coverage to protect themselves and their board members, and they have trouble getting board members and, frankly, have trouble sometimes, as I have heard from many other shelters and many other places, getting people to make a commitment, whether it is a volunteer commitment, whether it is a commitment of resources of some sort, whether it is equipment or loaning people a car or other things. They are scared to death of getting sued; we have become so litigious as a society. 
The Senator from Georgia has come forward with a great idea of saying let us at least focus on something that is noncontroversial, the human capital involved in serving our fellow citizens, the volunteer, whether it is the volunteer board member or the volunteer out there, big brother or sister or someone else. I would think of all the proposals that we have put forward--in fact, just last year we put forward a proposal in the same kind of genre. We had a bill which was called the Emerson Good Samaritan Food Bank, named after Bill Emerson, a late Congressman from Missouri, who was a tremendous champion for hunger in America, for feeding of the children of America. Shortly before he died last year, the bill passed in the House, and I was privileged enough to carry that bill here to the Senate and finally pass it on the last day, but I will tell you it took weeks, maybe even months--my memory is a little faded right now, but maybe even months--to get that bill which passed unanimously in the House even to be voted on here on the Senate floor. One Senator or another kept putting holds on this bill. 
This bill was very simple. It said if you give food to a food bank, we are going to raise the standard from negligence to gross negligence. A lot of States have done similar kinds of measures, some have not. This was a voluntary thing. We had a statute on the book--it was not a statute, but it was a suggestion to States with language to do this. It was not a law that required them to raise the standard from negligence to gross negligence. The special interests lobby that has been debated here often on the Senate floor today found one Senator after another to block it, to try to amend it, to gut it, to do everything they could. And finally several of us got together and said certain things aren't going to happen around here that did not happen before we left, that if it did not get through, we were going to get up on the floor and start exposing Members of the Senate who were putting holds on this bill and tell them, you want to feed the hungry but you do not want to allow those who process food and who sell food, whether it is in restaurants or grocery stores, to give it, because surveys showed 90 percent of the people, companies, organizations that refused to give food to food banks refused because they were afraid of legal 
liability, yet not one person had ever been sued, not one person had ever been sued or taken $1 out of any lawyer's mouth. And yet they still held the bill up. 
Well, now we are talking about areas that people actually do get sued, and so we have the special interests out in force to stop this piece of legislation. And they were successful in convincing enough Members on the other side of the aisle to do just that. I think that is unfortunate. 
This issue goes beyond the issue of just voluntarism in its broadest sense. I think you have to understand--and again this has been highlighted in Philadelphia but I think needs to be highlighted here--the importance of voluntarism and community organizations, what Dan Coats refers to as the mediating institutions in our society, those that are the buffer between the individual and the Government, those just in free association to help each other out in our own communities to solve our problems and to be that sort of close-knit group that really makes things happen on a local level. Those mediating institutions, those nonprofit groups, those civic associations are so important for our survival as a country. 
We are a great country for a lot of reasons, but I can tell you that most people do not think we are a great country because we are the greatest superpower, we are the greatest economic power, we have the greatest, most powerful Government. Most people come to this country because they want to get out of a country that has a powerful government that dictates to them. They come to this country because they want to freely associate and raise their family and have the freedom to work where they want and solve their own problems in a community setting. Voluntarism is key to making that happen. 
It is so important for us as a society to recognize, to lift up the volunteer as really the unique thing about America, the unique thing. The unique instrument by which we govern ourselves is that small organization that solves most of the problems in our community. Not the big Government, but those small, local organizations with the volunteer participating that solves the problem but does even something more. It brings out the best in the individual, the volunteer. 
Most of the people here volunteer for one thing or another in their lives. How many people, when they volunteered, left that assignment, that mission, that duty, and as they are walking out say, `You know, I helped somebody. But, you know, I got more out of it, I am sure, than that person that I helped got out of it.' 
See, voluntarism is not just about helping somebody else. It is about understanding more about yourself, it is about broadening your own horizons. It is about a real fundamental understanding of what your purpose is as an individual in our society. So, to the extent that we put barriers up to people experiencing that growth, their own personal growth, as well as a barrier to meeting real human needs, we are all--those who need the help and those who are not participating in helping--both lose. And what we have seen, and you have heard all the numbers and all the statistics--you have seen how this problem, this barrier, is a real barrier. This is not something that we cooked up and said, `Gee, let us just throw something out here to really honk off the other side.' This is a real barrier. 
We heard Lynn Swann talk about it from Big Brothers and Sisters. We heard Terry Orr, former Washington Redskin, talk about it from Little League. And Senator Coverdell has read letter after letter at hearings, and others--we know the volunteer organizations tell us, plead with us to give them some breaks here. They need this relief if they are going to serve their duty, their mission, as well as ennoble the people who volunteer, get us to connect with each other. 
One of the great things, and reasons I am so excited about the Project for American Renewal and the Civil Society Project that Senator Coats and Senator Coverdell and Senator Ashcroft and Senator Abraham have been working on here in the Senate, and Congressmen Watts and Talent--I want to mention Senator Hutchison, who has been very involved--and Congressman Pitts--I could go on. But the most exciting thing, in focusing in on trying to empower the local communities, the nonprofit organizations, to do more, is--yes, they do it better. No question. They are more caring, more compassionate. They do it better, they do it cheaper, much more efficiently. They are volunteers. They have people who do this because of real motivation, inner motivation--in many cases spiritual--but true, true inner compassion, not because it is a paycheck. Not to say those who do it because it is a paycheck do not have compassion. But that volunteer spirit just comes through and people understand it. That is important. 
But the most important thing that it does in my opinion is it reconnects us. One of the things I really fear about our society is we are becoming less and less connected to each other. You know, you can sit in front of a computer terminal right now and basically live your entire life without having to move. You don't have to go outside. You don't have to know who your neighbors are, or the people down the street, or go to church. You can do it all through television or through your computer. 
So we end up, as a society, that people--I am all for individualism. I think individualism is great. But, you know, we hear so much about individual rights and individual freedoms and all that stuff, we forget about the responsibility that we have to each other and our neighbors. This is a way to begin. 
All these things are in Senator Coverdell's legislation. I have introduced several pieces of legislation along the same lines that I hope someday we can bring up. I have not brought them up on this bill because I think this is so important that we move this 
forward, but we have other pieces of legislation I have introduced to encourage people to participate, to connect again, to get outside of that door. There are people who need you and, whether you know it or not, you need them. 
To the extent we, here, in the U.S. Senate can remove a barrier, can say: Look, don't be afraid of helping. Don't be afraid of asserting yourself. Don't be afraid that someone, Big Brother or big lawyer is over your shoulder, looking down at you, analyzing everything you say and do. Go out there and follow your heart, do what you know is right for your community and for the kids. The summit focuses so much on kids. A lot of the folks we are going to be helping are kids or the elderly--people in need. 
So, what Senator Coverdell is doing, what we are trying to do with the Renewal Alliance, is to empower those local groups to bring down the barriers that stop them from serving more people, to bring down the barriers that are almost in front of people's doors so they do not go out and minister to the needs of their neighbors much less--I should not even say that. In some cases they do not even bother to know who their neighbors are. They just do not want to get involved. `There are all sorts of things that can happen to me if I get involved.' 
We have to be a country that stops thinking like that. Look, I am not suggesting people do not have legal rights, that if they are harmed they should not have rights and recourses. And we preserve that in this legislation. We are saying, if you are grossly negligent or you are reckless in your conduct, you can be sued. And the organization, no matter whether the conduct was negligent or grossly negligent, could still be sued. It is just the individual volunteer, if they happen to do something maybe they should not have, or said--I said something I should not have. I did not mean any harm. It was not reckless, but I just threw a baseball at somebody and the kid didn't look. 
Hopefully, I will not get sued. I did not mean to hit the kid. But, believe it or not, people get sued for that. It is those kinds of actions, those kinds of lawsuits that have such a chilling effect on the human nature that is so typically American, to give, to go out and meet the needs of the people. 
So, I congratulate, again, the Senator from Georgia for his tremendous leadership. I cannot say enough, that this bill is where it is today and we are moving forward with this, because of his energy, his enthusiasm, his vision in moving this forward. I stand ready to help him every step of the way to make this happen. I think this is important in bringing down those barriers. It is important in building a better, more civil, more responsible, more compassionate, more connected society. To the extent we can make some little contribution here in the U.S. Senate, we should do so and we should do so immediately. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. SANTORUM. In the past year, I might add, we passed it by unanimous consent; without an opposing voice, in the end, to getting this legislation passed. It had national application. The reason is it was clearly understood that these products travel, just like volunteers do, over State lines. There are companies that are multinational, not only multistate but multinational 
companies that produce goods, food products. If there was a chilling effect on one side, they would probably have a uniform policy against it. So we understood the nature of the goods involved and, obviously, Members on the other side of the aisle understood it also and went along on a unanimous vote and it was signed by the President. 
So, it is now law. I can tell you from the experience that I have had, talking to those at the soup kitchens and food banks, contributions are up. And I am somewhat surprised, because most of the places I go to, oddly enough, do not even know we passed the law. Most of those at the soup kitchens and food banks do not even know they can now tell the grocery store or restaurant or pizza parlor, that maybe has some extra pizza there at the end of the day or whatever, that they can ship it over here and you do not have to worry about a serious legal liability. 
It has gone up. It is just by some of the folks who happened to pick it up. I just suggest, for, hopefully, those listening here, and for those Senators in particular listening, we did something in Pennsylvania as a result of that just recently, where we sent a letter out to all the different food banks and soup kitchens in my State to inform them of the legislation, to encourage them. And, in fact, I even offered to write the different grocery stores, food processors, and the like in my State, to encourage them. 
We have a duty here, as leaders in our community, to try to effectuate that change. But, it was a long answer to the Senator's question, but I do so because I want to emphasize, not only did this pass bipartisanly, signed by the President, but it has already had a positive impact even in the first 2 months, the proportions of which I don't think we know yet because I don't think the information has been disseminated to all the parties who could benefit from this knowledge.

 Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Lt. Col. Stephen G. Gress, Jr., who recently retired from the U.S. Air Force. A native of Pittsburgh, PA, Lieutenant Colonel Gress has served his country with valor and distinction for more than 22 years as an instructor pilot, a combat pilot, and as a member of the Air Force legislative liaison. 
One needs only to look at Steve's academic credentials to see that he is a man of exceptional achievement. In addition to graduating from the Air Force Academy, Lieutenant Colonel Gress earned a masters degree in operation research from the Air Force Institute of Technology at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. Likewise, Steve became a distinguished graduate of the Air Command and Staff College at Maxwell Air Force Base in 1987. 
Mr. President, Lieutenant Colonel Gress was one of the military's premier pilots. He served as an instructor pilot for the T-38 at Webb Air Force Base, and later, for the T-41 at his alma mater, the U.S. Air Force Academy. In 1979, the Air Force chose Steve from a very select few to become an F-15 fighter pilot. Steve also distinguished himself in the Air Force Special Programs Office, where he managed the development of future fighter weapons systems. During his tenure at Bitburgh Air Force Base, Steve's extensive knowledge of fighter combat operations led to an appointment as the chief of wing inspections, a position that is critical to the combat effectiveness of all Air Force organizations. 
I would also note that Lieutenant Colonel Gress is a war hero. As an F-15 flight leader, he flew 19 combat missions in Operation Desert Storm. 
Later in 1991, Steve returned to the Pentagon. Once again, the Air Force came to rely upon his keen understanding of fighter combat. As the branch chief for both air to air weapons and fighter development, he worked to ensure that the next generation of fighter systems would secure American air dominance. 
Steve moved to the Office of the Air Force Legislative Liaison in 1993. He worked his way up from the branch chief for fighter and fighter weapons to the division chief of the weapons systems division. As always, Steve took tremendous pride in his work. He strove to ensure that critical military issues were presented to Congress in a clear and nonparochial manner. Over the years, many congressional staff members have come to know Steve both as a serious professional and as a man of integrity. 
As Lt. Col. Stephen G. Gress, Jr. retires to private life, I ask my colleagues will join me in commending the outstanding service he has given this country. On behalf of the Senate, I would like to wish Lieutenant Colonel Gress and his family the very best.

 Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, the Police Athletic League of Philadelphia (PAL) is celebrating fifty years of serving the youth of Philadelphia. I rise today to congratulate the dedicated men and women who have made this great success possible. 
For five decades, PAL has offered an attractive alternative to street life by cultivating friendships between police officers and children. PAL currently sponsors constructive activities such as sports, substance abuse education, and tutoring programs for more than 24,000 boys and girls of Philadelphia. By providing friends, mentors, and role models for these young people, PAL has helped improve the quality of life for countless children. PAL teaches children to learn, to aspire, and to achieve. The positive impact of this program extends beyond those who are directly involved; this program benefits the entire Philadelphia community. 
As we salute this program, we must also celebrate the dedication of those who have worked tirelessly to make it effective. I would also like to take this opportunity to commend the seven outstanding recipients of the 50th Anniversary PAL Award. Congratulations to Sally Berlin, John K. Binswanger, Steven Head, Lewis Klein, Ronald A. Krancer, James F. McCabe, and James E. Schleif. The efforts of these individuals to promote the safety of our children deserve the highest honor. Their service to those in need is truly inspirational. 
Mr. President, I congratulate these men and women who have worked to make a difference in the lives of so many children, and I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing them. On behalf of the Senate, I offer the recipients of the 50th Anniversary PAL Award best wishes for continued success. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

 Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes of Senate business to discuss Music in Our Schools Month. 
Throughout the month of March, which was designated Music in Our Schools Month, the Pennsylvania Music Educators Association [PMEA] promoted public awareness of arts education. On March 11, the Pennsylvania Alliance for Arts Education sponsored the Second Annual Arts in Education Day in Harrisburg, PA. Representatives from PMEA also attended the `SingAmerica' campaign here in Washington, DC, on March 13. In addition to renewing an interest in music, `SingAmerica' sought to restore a sense of pride in our communities. 
For years, public schools in Pennsylvania have provided opportunities for children to grow and learn through the arts. Several teachers have observed that studying music has helped children learn to work in groups, to think creatively, and to communicate more effectively. Moreover, music education has helped introduce students to history and cultural studies. 
Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the teachers who have dedicated their lives to preparing children for the future. I hope my colleagues will join me in thanking them for their commitment to improving education.

 Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments of Senate business to honor Maj. Margaret Joseph, a Pennsylvanian who dedicated her life to defending freedom and serving her country. 
Margaret distinguished herself as a member of the Army Nurse Corps. During World War II, she served in the European theater. Many soldiers fighting in France and England owe their lives to dedicated professionals such as Margaret Joseph, who nursed them back to health. For others, her compassionate care was among the last acts of kindness they would experience on this Earth. In recognition of Margaret's skill and dedication, she was promoted to the rank of major by an act of Congress. 
Unfortunately, Major Joseph is no longer with us. She passed away on November 19, 1996, in Philadelphia, PA. On December 3, 1996, she was laid to rest at Arlington National Cemetery with full military honors. 
Mr. President, Major Joseph was rightfully proud of her service to this Nation. I hope my colleagues will join me both in recognizing her accomplishments and in honoring her as a patriot, as a distinguished soldier, and as a courageous human being.

 Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I introduce four related pieces of legislation all aimed at increasing donations of goods and services to charities. Collectively called the charity empowerment project, I urge my colleagues to consider cosponsoring these bills. 
Over the past 30 years, courts have consistently expanded what constitutes tortious conduct. Regrettably, fault is often not a factor when deciding who should compensate an individual for damages incurred. This has had an impact on charitable giving. Today, individuals and businesses are wary of giving goods, services, and time to charities for fear of frivolous lawsuits. 
The charity empowerment project is designed to free up resources for charities by providing legal protections for donors. Generally, these bills raise the tort liability standard for donors, whereby they are liable only in cases of gross negligence, hence eliminating strict liability and returning to a fault based legal standard. By allowing businesses to once again become good Samaritans, I look forward to seeing a massive increase in the donation of goods and services to charities. 
Specifically, I am introducing four bills each of which accomplishes one of the following four objectives: First, to limit the civil liability of business entities that donate equipment to nonprofit organizations; second, to limit the civil liability of business entities that provide use of their facilities to nonprofit organizations; third, to limit the civil liability of business entities that provide facility tours; and fourth, to limit the civil liability of business entities that make available to nonprofit organizations the use of motor vehicles or aircraft. 
Clearly, where an organization is grossly negligent when providing goods or the use of its facilities to charity, that organization should be fully liable for injuries caused. These bills merely require this to be the standard in cases arising from certain donations to charities. 
Last autumn, the Good Samaritan Food Donation Act was passed into law. This law now protects donors of foodstuffs to charities from liability except in cases where the donor was grossly negligent in making the donation. I was proud to join Senator Bond in his successful efforts to pass this act. The bills I introduce today draw from my successful work with Senator Bond last year. Each of these bills is modeled on the legal framework of the Good Samaritan Food Donation Act. I hope my distinguished colleagues who supported the Food Donation Act will help further these efforts by supporting the charity empowerment project. 
Mr. President, I wish to note additional efforts by my colleagues to enhance charitable giving. Senator Coverdell and Senator Ashcroft have recently introduced legislation which protects volunteers from frivolous and damaging litigation. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of Senator Coverdell's Volunteer Protection Act of 1997, and I anticipate supporting Senator Ashcroft's bill with equal vigor. Collectively, I look forward to our legislation freeing up massive resources for charities through increased volunteerism and increased giving. 
At the end of this month, the Summit for America's Future will assemble in Philadelphia. The Senate now has the opportunity to consider the Santorum, Coverdell, and Ashcroft bills prior to the convening of this century's greatest gathering on voluntarism. There may never be a more appropriate time to consider legislation which so dramatically empowers charities with enhanced ability to carry out their noble causes.

 Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, the Pennsylvania Institute of Certified Public Accountants [PICPA] celebrated its 100th anniversary on March 23, 1997. I rise today to congratulate PICPA for a century of service to the people and businesses of Pennsylvania. This distinguished organization, which boasts more than 18,000 members, is the second oldest society of certified public accountants [CPAs] in the United States. In fact, several of the big six accounting firms were actually founded by PICPA alumni. 
Mr. President, PICPA is comprised of dedicated professionals who provide essential financial advice to individuals, corporations, nonprofits, and government entities. Every day, they ensure that corporate financial dealings are properly reported to stockholders, help organizations comply with our tax laws, and provide detailed financial reports for managers. 
In a dynamic business climate, it is essential to stay apprised of changing professional standards, government regulations, and accounting practices. PICPA associates have risen to this challenge. They have demonstrated a commitment to the accounting profession by adhering to a continuing education requirement. Likewise, they subject themselves to periodic peer reviews to improve the quality of their financial statements. 
I am also pleased to note that PICPA encourages community service. Members have proudly helped improve the quality of life for less fortunate Pennsylvanians by donating thousands of hours to charitable organizations. 
Mr. President, members of PICPA are currently serving the public as auditors, tax advisors, computer consultants, personal financial planners, educators, legislators, small business advisors, managers, and estate planners. I salute CPA's in all walks of life, and I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the accountants and employees of PICPA, both past and present, for 100 years of exemplary service.

 Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Zvi Muscal, an exemplary businessman from Philadelphia and an outstanding community leader. Last December, the American-Jewish Community presented the 1996 Civic Achievement Award to Zvi Muscal, and I had the distinct honor of delivering the keynote address at his presentation dinner. 
In 1979, Zvi left his beloved Israeli homeland to start a branch of Bank Hapoalim in Philadelphia. Like many who came to this country before him, Zvi came to America with a dream and a strong work ethic. 
As the bank grew under his leadership, Zvi dedicated himself to many organizations which had a major impact on the Philadelphia community. Serving on the International City Steering Committee, the World Affairs Council, and the Philadelphia-Israel Economic Development Corp., which later became the Philadelphia-Israel Chamber of Commerce, Zvi has been a tireless advocate for business development in Philadelphia. Additionally, he has worked zealously to promote the city's cultural affairs and to support many important nonprofit organizations. In fact, the city of Philadelphia recognized Zvi's outstanding achievements and contributions by proclaiming May 19, 1985, Zvi Muscal Day. 
Since then, Zvi has undertaken several business ventures. For instance, he started PhilTrade, Inc., an international trading company. Later, he and other business leaders founded the First Executive Bank. Zvi served as the bank's chief executive officer until June, 1996, when it merged with the First Republic Bank. Today, Zvi is the chairman of this institution. 
As Zvi climbed the ladder of success, he strengthened his commitment to the community and his ardent devotion to Philadelphia. He currently serves on the board of the University of Pennsylvania School of Dental Medicine, the Philadelphia International Airport Advisory Council, the Community Bank Advisory Council of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, the Operation Smile-Philadelphia Chapter, the Police Athletic League, the Philadelphia-Israel Chamber of Commerce, Elwyn Jerusalem, the Solomon Schecter Day School, and the Gesu School of Philadelphia. 
Mr. President, I salute Mr. Muscal for his achievements in business and in the community at large. I ask that my colleagues join me in wishing Zvi Muscal and his family all the best.

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise to talk about an issue that was talked about at great length today in the House of Representatives and voted on. That is the issue of partial-birth abortions, or as the Congressman who led the debate on the floor of the House, Congressman Henry Hyde, refers to it as partial-birth infanticide where, in fact, you have a baby that is at or near viability in the fifth and sixth month of pregnancy when most of these abortions are performed, delivered completely out of the mother, and all that is left in the mother is the head--what we are talking about here is not an abortion. What we are talking about is killing a child. 
I think, incredibly, frankly, given the results of the last election where the Republicans lost seats in the House, and getting a sufficient number of House votes to override a--hopefully not, but probably--Presidential veto of this bill--we needed 290 votes. We thought going in we would be assured of that number. In fact, we thought we would be well assured of that number, given the results of the election and what we thought was the intention of the Members. 
It turned out that the House passed the partial-birth abortion ban by a vote of 295 to, I believe, 136. That is five votes more than the required constitutional majority of 67 percent of the House. So they do have enough votes in the House of Representatives to override a Presidential veto. 
The action now shifts here to the U.S. Senate. We are going into recess and will be for the next couple of weeks, but I have had conversations with the majority leader, and we anticipate bringing that bill up sometime shortly after we reconvene here in the Senate in April and hope for a full debate on this issue. 
As to what happened in the House, when we saw the number of votes change, resulting in a sufficient number to override the President's veto, I hope that same kind of dynamic occurs here in the Senate. Those votes changed because of new information that has been brought to light about what actually is going on out in America on this issue of partial-birth abortions. We were originally told by the advocates of the procedure, the industry and those who support the procedure, the abortion rights groups, that this was `a rare procedure.' That phrase was used over and over again, `A rare procedure.' The President of the United States used `a rare procedure, done only in the third trimester, in cases where the mother's life or health was in danger or where there was a severe fetal deformity.' 
That was the argument and the reason the President vetoed it, and that is why many Members of the Senate stood here and said they could not find themselves in a position where if someone was in this kind of dire consequence that they would limit a person's option. 
We had plenty of medical testimony at the time, and even more has come in since, that says that this is never an indicated procedure to protect the life or health of the mother, never an indicated procedure. It is not in any textbook on obstetrics. You will not find it in any of the medical literature. I am quoting lots of obstetricians who have testified before Congress, including an obstetrician in the House of Representatives, Dr. Tom Coburn, a Member of the House, and C. Everett Koop, the former Surgeon General, who worked with small premature babies. So we have overwhelming medical authority that this procedure is never indicated to protect the life and health of the mother. 
But we also found out new information, that in fact this is not a rare procedure. This is a procedure that is done thousands upon thousands of times. The estimate given by the abortion providers is 3,000 to 5,000 times a year. The only independent evidence we have been able to gather is by a press reporter in Bergen County, NJ, who surveyed a clinic in her community, and in that one clinic in northern New Jersey there were 1,500 partial-birth abortions performed every year. Now, if there are 1,500 in one clinic, and we have another doctor who has testified in Nebraska, Bellevue, NE--no offense to my colleagues from Nebraska, but hardly a large metropolitan area--where this doctor said in the last 2 years he has done 1,000 partial-birth abortions, if you just take those two isolated instances and the fact, as the reporter from Bergen County said, that this procedure, according to the doctors there, is done in other places in the New York metropolitan area, but if you just take those two sites alone, it is very hard to say we only have 3,000 to 5,000 of these being performed nationwide. 
There is no way to check because the people who provide the statistics are the advocates for the procedure. So, of course, they are not going to give us the real numbers. They know that their Achilles heel in this debate, in the debate not just on partial-birth abortions but, frankly, on all abortions, is late-term abortion. This is not something the American public feels comfortable with, but in fact, something the American public overwhelmingly rejects. They think that goes too far. So there is really no reason for them to give us accurate information. When I say there is no reason for them to give us accurate information, it is because there is no way to check whether that information is accurate. The Government keeps no statistics on the number of partial-birth abortions. So there is no way for anybody to independently verify this. 
Now, I have asked many reporters who have covered this issue, `How about doing a little reporting? How about verifying your story instead of taking what the Alan Guttmacher Institute,' which is an arm of the abortion advocacy group and is always cited in literature and in the press as this `independent source.' That is just ludicrous. They are an advocate, a zealous advocate of the absolute right to choose. So using their information is as bad as using the providers themselves who are advocates of the procedure. 
Now, some reporters have actually gone through the process of calling their clinics. We have gotten a variety of different feedback. I talked to a reporter from the Baltimore Sun who said she called some of the hospitals and clinics in Baltimore that do abortions, and they hung up the phone on her. They didn't want to talk to the press. It is none of their business. Others have said they have called and had nice conversations and were told, `We don't do that here.' They very well may not do it, but we have no way of checking. The press has no way of checking because they are not going to make their records available. It is confidentiality, and I understand that. But there is no way for us to know how many abortions are done, partial-birth or late-term abortions. You will have advocates get up for this procedure on the Senate floor and talk about this as being `very rare,' or `only a few thousand.' Just imagine, put yourself in the context of children--children are used a lot on this floor as a defense for a lot of Government programs. 
Imagine if you were talking about 3,000 to 5,000 children who we would let starve to death in this country; what would we do about it here? Would we say it is only 3,000 or 5,000 who we are going to let die because we don't want to take any action? I am not too sure that we would do that. But, in fact, that is what we are doing. We are accepting their numbers, which I don't accept. I don't think, frankly, the press should accept them. I think throwing this number out of 3,000 to 5,000, quoting an advocate of the procedure as the authority for the statistical information as a basis for the debate--I mean, I will throw a number out--let's say 50,000, which is probably as credible as the number you are going to get from the other side. It is probably as credible, and probably even more credible because I am just pulling it out of a hat; they are deliberately throwing a number out that they know is well below what the actual number is. 
So I hope that when we have this debate, we realize, number one, that it is not a rare procedure. And, frankly, we don't know how rare it is. What we do know is that the numbers given out in the past were lies. Let's call it what they were--lies, a deliberate attempt by the abortion industry and advocates to mislead the Congress. They sent people up here and they testified to that lie. So now we are going to believe them and give them a second chance to lie to us. 
I am sorry. Fool me twice, shame on me. They are not going to fool me twice. I am not going to accept their number, and I don't think anybody should. They have no credibility because they have lied once and, number two, there is no independent verification of that number, because they will not open up their books. They won't even let reporters talk to them. So I encourage the press covering this debate now, and who covered it in the past, not to use a phony number. As horrible as that number is, my goodness we are talking of an 
admission of at least 3,000 to 5,000--3,000 to 5,000 innocent children, at least 90 percent of which--according to their industry--are healthy babies and healthy mothers. 
Frankly, even if it were 300 to 500, or just 30 to 50, it should outrage every Member of the Senate that we allow that to happen in such a barbaric way. But 3,000 to 5,000--maybe it's 30,000 to 50,000; who knows? But it is not a rare procedure, and it is not done just on mothers who have severe health complications or life-threatening ailments. We know that. One reason is obvious that we know it. We know it by understanding what the procedure is. The other reason we know is because we have all the medical experts testifying that this procedure is never indicated to protect the health or the life of the mother. But the other reason we know that this procedure would not be used is just by knowing what the procedure is. Take a case. We have a mother whose life is in danger. Now, I will add that we have a provision in this bill to protect the life of the mother. If this procedure is ever needed to protect the life of the mother, it can be used. But let me suggest that that would never happen. We have it in there, frankly, for cosmetic reasons. It would never happen, because if a mother's life is in imminent danger, would any physician use a procedure that takes 3 days to perform? If the woman presents herself to the hospital in a life-threatening condition, would you say, `We have this great procedure that takes 3 days to do; we will give you medication, come back in 2 days'? You would if you want to kill the mother, or if you want malpractice, but not if you want to provide competent medical services to a woman in need. So it would not be used in that situation. 
Let's talk about the health condition. Again, if somebody presents herself with a severe health consequence, they could use their fertility or--to be honest with you, I don't know why someone would suggest that we want to protect ourselves from losing our fertility by killing a healthy baby. I don't understand that. If you want to protect your fertility to have children, why would you kill a healthy baby to do that? This is something that strikes me as an argument that I have not heard a sufficient answer to on the other side. Why would you kill one child so you could have more children? As far as I know, there is no guarantee of being able to get pregnant again. Unfortunately, there are tens of thousands, probably hundreds of thousands of couples who are trying to have children and can't. If you have been blessed with a healthy baby and a healthy pregnancy, I don't know why you would do this procedure. But the point is, you would not go through this 3-day procedure if there was an imminent health risk to the mother. It is just not logical. 
This procedure was not designed by a physician who was looking out for the health and life of the mother. This was designed by a physician, in his own words, as a more efficient way to do abortions for the abortionist, not for the mother. It is efficient in that the mother can come in and do it on an outpatient basis. Late-term abortions are much more complicated. It is much more involved. This basically prepares the woman for a shorter visit to the clinic and a more convenient way for this abortionist to perform the abortion and to be able to do more of them in one day. That is the reason this procedure was developed. 
You will hear testimony of people who have written textbooks on abortion, who said they would never use this, and they do late-term abortions. So I just ask my colleagues to listen to all of the facts. We had, I think, last year--and it was unfortunate, and I will not point blame at anybody. I am not too sure there is blame. We had a situation where the vote came up in an election year, in an election climate. Members are people, too. They feel a comfort zone on issues. It is very hard for them to sort of break out of this comfort zone into unknown territories, particularly around a very politically charged environment, even though the facts were there; many of the facts were available for the override vote. Certainly, a lot of them were not given credibility in the mainstream media. Now they have been. 
So I ask many of my colleagues who have already cast a vote more than once on this issue to have an open mind, to step back and look at the reality of partial-birth infanticide and recognize your obligation to those children, recognize your obligation to your constituents in trying to ascertain the truth, and make a decision that is in the best interest for America and for your State, 
not for the interest group that supports you in your election, not for the advocates who you may have good relationships with. We are in our comfort zone with people who agree with us. It is very easy for us to sort of hang around those people and sort of feed off each other. I understand that. But sometimes you have to step back from all of that. You have to step out in the cold and look at the cold, hard facts and make a decision using your mind and using your heart on what is right--not what is right politically for me, not what is right for my friend, but what is right for our culture and what is right for our whole existence as a country. 
I think when we do that, I think when Members take time to do that, we will see something very special happen here, which is what happened in the House today. Members will have stepped out of that comfort zone, which I know is very hard to do, will take an honest look at the facts and make a decision that is right for America. That is my hope. 
I am going to be working very diligently, and I know other Members are, in making sure that this information is disseminated. 
I again encourage the press to do your job, fact-check your stories before you write them, and ascertain the truth. Do not just report what people say. I know some people think that is their job. If that is the job of a reporter, then reporting has sunk to a new low in this country if all we do is run around and report what people say. That is not journalism, in my book. At least make an attempt to find out the truth. At least check. This is serious stuff. We are not talking about how the Senate buys paper here. It is important. It takes taxpayer dollars. We have a system. We are talking about very weighty issues. We are talking about the issues of life and death, about a barbaric procedure that just goes beyond any vision that I can imagine that people in this country have of what our civilization and what humanity is. 
So take that responsibility seriously on your side. We take it seriously here. I think, if you do your job and if Members of the Senate do their job, which is to honestly face the facts, allow those facts to rebound off your sense of judgment, your sense of right and wrong, then I think what will bounce back is a vote to end this barbarism in this country by an overwhelming vote.

<TEXT>
Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, this morning, I attended a press conference with Representative Charles Canady from Florida, as well as Senator Hatch and Congressman Hyde, the chairmen of the respective bodies' Judiciary Committees, to introduce the House bill, which is companion to the bill I introduced last month, on the issue of partial-birth abortions. 
At that press conference, Senator Hatch and Chairman Hyde announced a joint House-Senate Judiciary Committee, calling witnesses before the joint committee hearing to talk about previous testimony given by those organizations to Congress in light of the disclosure of Ron Fitzsimmons, who heads an organization of abortion clinics, that he `lied through his teeth,' and others, likewise, I will add--this is me speaking, not him--lied through their teeth in telling Congress and the American public the situations in which the partial-birth abortion procedure was used and the number of times that procedure was used. 
I said at that press conference, and I will say to my colleagues in the Senate today, as I did last year when we debated this bill, I am hopeful that as a result of the new information having been brought to light, not just with Mr. Fitzsimmons but, frankly, over the past year or so, with this new information that has been brought to light not just by him, but by newspaper reports, magazine reports from the mainstream media, that we will have Members of the Senate on both sides--I ask everyone to relook at this issue and base your decisions on the facts as we now know them, not the misinformation or disinformation given out by organizations like the National Abortion Rights Action League or Planned Parenthood or others who deliberately lied to the American public, misled the American public on a variety of issues. 
First, they came to the Congress and said--in fact, look at Members of Congress on the House side, going to the well, saying this was true because these organizations said it was true, that the procedure was done under anesthesia and the anesthesia killed the baby. 
We had an anesthesiologist come forward and say, `Wait a minute, we have women now who won't get anesthesia to deliver children,' which is normal in this country, of course, `because they are afraid they are going to kill their baby,' 
and so they had to back off. `Well, we didn't really mean that.' Well, of course they meant it. They testified to it. 
Then the next great lie was that this was a procedure done, you know, with only a few hundred a year, only with women whose health was in danger or whose children were fatally deformed, and, as a result of that, we need to have this option available. `There's only a few hundred a year.' 
In fact, you know, tap into NARAL's home page. You will find the information still there. At least it was a couple days ago until some people found it. Now they may have pulled it. But they still say there are only a couple hundred being performed and only in the third trimester. That was their argument all along. It is a lie. That is what Mr. Fitzsimmons says--he lied through his teeth. 
How would he know? He is the president of an organization of abortion clinics. He called up the doctors of the clinics, and the doctors said, `No. We perform this fairly routinely,' not just on third trimester babies--and some are--but the vast majority--95 percent is my guess, or even more--are on healthy mothers with healthy babies in the fifth and sixth months of pregnancy. Those are the facts. 
If Members of this body will look at those facts and vote based on the facts as we know them--this procedure, which involves taking a baby, late term, fifth, sixth, in rare cases seventh, eighth, maybe even ninth month, but in rare cases in that situation, taking this baby, delivering the baby feet first, delivering the entire baby except for the head, then taking a pair of scissors and puncturing the base of the skull, sticking a suction tube in there and suctioning the brains out, killing the baby and then delivering this now dead baby. 
If the Members of the U.S. Senate know, as we do know now, that that happens, not a few hundred times--in my opinion, a few hundred times is pretty horrible--now several thousand times, at least according to Mr. Fitzsimmons, 3,000 to 5,000--given the industry track record on what they report, probably multiples of that, but at least that many--whether we are going to condone healthy moms, healthy babies, some of them viable, being allowed to have this abortion done in this just most gruesome manner. 
So I ask the Members of the Senate to not just fall into your camp that you are comfortable with, you know, if you are pro-choice, `I've got to be pro-choice.' This is not pro-life, not pro-choice, certainly not Democrat or Republican. There were Democrats at the press conference. Democrats have been some of the most vocal supporters of this bill. This is an issue of who we are as a country and who this body is as a Senate. 
We have a life-of-the-mother exception. I know Members continue to get up and say, `Well, we need to do this to protect the life of the mother.' There is a life-of-the-mother exception. It is clear. It is solid. No one who reads it would say it is anything but a life-of-the-mother exception. 
So, if this procedure needs to be done to save the life of the mother, which I have not found anybody who says it is necessary, but if it is, you can do it. But after that, this procedure must be made illegal, given the facts as we now know them. 
So I am asking Members, new Members who have not voted on this issue, and Members who have voted the other way in particular, to take a look at this information. 
Let me challenge folks here in the other gallery, in the news media, to start doing your homework. This information was readily available. All you had to do was report it. All you had to do was look. All you had to do is ask. I know you folks love to believe people who agree with you, and you take that as gospel. Well, do your work. Investigate. Find out the truth. 
The American public just does not want to hear what your friends in these organizations say is the truth. They want to know the real truth. It is your job to tell them. We tried to tell them. We were here giving you the facts. You just decided not to report them. Tell the truth. Let the American public know what is really going on out there. When they continue, as they will, to lie on television, these organizations, to try to hide their dirty secrets, call them on it. Quit pandering to the other side. You owe it to the country. We are talking about lives of innocent babies here. You owe it to your profession. We owe it to the country. I yield the floor.

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise to make a couple of comments about the action that just took place here on the Senate floor with respect to the balanced budget amendment and to express, obviously, my disappointment as someone who supported the balanced budget amendment, my disappointment that we did not succeed in passing what I believe is a vitally important measure for this country's future. We will have another day where we will be back here and try again, whether it is this year or next year or in the next session of Congress, to fight that fight again. In a sense, the battle is not lost; it only continues. 
I am a little more concerned about another battle which I fear has at least as lasting consequences as not passing this constitutional amendment, and that is something that is important to all of us here and to all Americans. As important as our Constitution is the public's faith in our institutions, our governmental institutions and the people who serve in them. 
One of the real concerns I have--in fact, I have been traveling around my State of Pennsylvania talking at a lot of high schools and expressing there my concerns that a lot of young people choose not to vote. In fact, in the last election, of 18 to 24-year-olds, I believe only a third even bothered to turn out to vote. That is a low since 18-year-olds were given a right to vote. Not only that, but the last election was the low point in turnout for the general electorate. I think it was under 50 percent in the last Presidential election. 
A lot of people have postulated as to what is going on with the American public, that we seem to become either disinterested or cynical about the electoral process and our Government in 
general. I think, unfortunately, what has happened in this debate over the last 2 weeks has added to that cynicism, has added to the mistrust that many Americans feel toward their institutions and toward the people who serve in those institutions. 
I speak, of course, about the people who campaigned promising the electors of their State that they would vote a certain way on what many people consider the most important issue we will vote on here in this Congress. It is a seminal issue. It sort of divides you between the politics of the old and the politics of the new, in my opinion. You had at least 12 Members in this most recent election who campaigned, and campaigned vigorously, stating that they were going to support the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution in the same form they had supported it in the House of Representatives. And yet not more than 3 or 4 months after their election, they have changed their minds. 
Yes, the Constitution is important. Yes, amending the Constitution, in my opinion, is important. But public confidence in us is as important, for if the public does not see us as legitimate, if the public does not see its institutions and the people who run them as trustworthy, then the Constitution is not nearly as strong a document--in fact, some would suggest it is even a worthless document--because democracy cannot exist without the public faith in what we are about and the legitimacy of our Government. 
So I think this debate is sad for, yes, the reason we did not pass the balanced budget amendment. That is very sad. But I think the greater long-term threat to our country is public cynicism over this institution and all of our democratic institutions. 
That was harmed and, in some places, it was devastated in the past few weeks. That is something we will have a hard time with when fighting the battle again. It makes the battle to come back much harder. It is not as if we can bring this up again as we can a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. It now is something young and old people will be looking at, what happened here, and saying, does politics really matter? Why bother to vote; they do not mean what they say anyway. 
I commend the Members; some of them had very tough votes in bucking their President and their leaders, for standing up and doing the right thing, doing what they said they would do. When it comes down to it, in this institution--and I suspect in every workplace in America--the bottom line comes down to you have nothing here except your word. You have nothing except your word. With respect to me and my relationship to my constituents in Pennsylvania, I find that to be a solemn vow. My word means something. And if my word is no good, then they have every right to question me and question the institution in which I serve. 
So I think we did have a defeat today. We had a defeat not for the constitutional amendment. Yes, we had that defeat. We had a defeat for our institution. We had a defeat for our democracy. We had a defeat for the process that legitimizes everything we do here. And that truly is a sad thing. It is a sad day for the Senate. It is even a sadder day for this country. 
I would just suggest as some anecdote to the people who feel disenfranchised as a result of what happened here that most of the people in this Senate did do what they said they were going to do, on both sides of the aisle. Most of the Members of this Senate stood up and told the public the truth when it, frankly, may have not been easy to tell the truth. And from that, I think, we should take some solace, that, in fact, most Members do stand up and say what they mean. And I hope that we can learn from this lesson, all of us learn from this lesson, the importance of having the public's faith in who we are, what we say and what we do. It matters. 
We have a lot of people in this town now who seem to be pushing the edge on a lot of activities. And you see the public just does not seem--I get this question all the time--to care about all these shenanigans that go on around here. I agree. I think there are so many shenanigans going on around here they discount them at the time. They think they are all bad, and why is he any different than anyone else. 
Wow, that is a dangerous sentiment in this country. That is a sentiment that gets you in trouble. We should be outraged when people do things that are illegal, when people do things that are unethical. We should be outraged when our public officials, whom we hold up to represent us, do not meet the standards that we ourselves meet, and we should think differently about them because they do not meet those standards. 
It is a sad day, but I hope that we again have learned the lesson that it is important for us to be men and women of our word. And that goes beyond any bill, any amendment, any issue that we deal with in this body. Once we understand that lesson, I think we will be a greater body and a greater country as a result. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

 Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a Pennsylvania constituent and a very dedicated public servant from Philadelphia, PA. 
On January 11, George Robinson was honored upon his retirement from the Philadelphia Fire Department. After graduating from the Philadelphia Public School System, Mr. Robinson joined the department on August 3, 1959. Since then, he has served the city of Philadelphia with distinction for 37 years. Mr. Robinson rose through the department to the position of battalion chief, and he also served as acting deputy chief. 
During his career, Mr. Robinson successfully completed `Career Development Three' at the National Fire Academy, as well as related courses at the Philadelphia Fire Academy. He has also received various certificates of training from the city of Philadelphia Training Center. 
As a battalion commander, Chief Robinson coordinated all aspects of fire alarm response. In addition to conducting preliminary investigations of fire causes, he inspected company personnel, fire stations, apparatus, equipment, records, reports, and safety hazards. 
In 1992, Chief Robinson became the department's executive officer. During this time, he also served as the integrity officer, chaired the critical incident debriefing team, and served on a steering committee to streamline the office of the inspector general. Moreover, Chief Robinson coordinated all transfer requests, assignments, and officer rotations. 
Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will join me in honoring George Robinson for his distinguished service to the city of Philadelphia Fire Department with the following proclamation: 
PROCLAMATION 
Whereas, George Robinson has served for thirty-seven years as a member of the Philadelphia Fire Department, gained promotions to the rank of Battalion Chief and served as Acting Deputy Chief, and; 
Whereas, George Robinson, has served as the Fire Department's Executive Officer, Integrity Officer and head of the Critical Incident Team; and 
Whereas, George Robinson was honored upon his retirement from the Philadelphia Fire Department at a testimonial dinner on January 11, 1997; 
Therefore, I, Senator Rick Santorum, offer my best wishes on his retirement and honor his loyalty to the City of Philadelphia and to the Philadelphia Fire Department; acknowledge the respect he has gained from every level and authority in the Department; and recognize the distinction he has brought through his achievements to his community and country.

 Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, the Philadelphia Martin Luther King, Jr. Association for Nonviolence held its 15th Annual King Day Luncheon on January 20. I wanted to take a few minutes of Senate business today and share this very moving experience with my colleagues. 
Mr. President, I had the honor and privilege of participating in the King Day celebration. The annual program in Philadelphia is a very moving tribute to Dr. King and is the largest national celebration of this great civil rights leader. Additionally, the program serves as the most ecumenical and multicultural annual gathering for the city of Philadelphia. 
In recent years, this program has featured such special guests as Gen. Colin Powell and Vice President Al Gore. The King Association has also honored such dignitaries as Rosa Parks, Bishop Desmond Tutu, Judge Leon Higginbotham, Attorney Bernard Segal, and one of our colleagues in the U.S. Senate, Senator Carol Moseley-Braun. 
Under the leadership of the Honorable C. DeLores Tucker, the King Association has the unique mission of promoting and implementing the principle of nonviolence throughout the Northeast. The fact that the association serves as the only affiliate of the King Center in Atlanta, commissioned by Coretta Scott King, reflects the importance of the King Association's mission and services. 
For allowing me to be a part of this year's King Day Luncheon, I would like to again express my very sincere and genuine gratitude to the King Association president, the Honorable C. DeLores Tucker, and the executive director, Dr. Teta V. Banks. As we honor and recognize Dr. King, there is no greater living tribute than the thousands upon thousands of national community leaders of all ethnic backgrounds who continue working to make Dr. King's dream a reality. 
Mr. President, the work done by the King Association in Philadelphia and the Annual King Day Luncheon certainly embody the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, the agenda for the 105th Congress reflects a continuance of the very significant debate that occurred in the 104th Congress on the issue of partial birth abortion. 
Four months ago, we debated and considered a presidential veto override on a bill to ban the partial birth abortion procedure. On a final vote, we came very close to banning this very gruesome procedure, and the number of colleagues who supported the override set the stage for consideration again this year. 
A wide spectrum of individuals have coalesced around the effort to ban partial birth abortions. These varied individuals and groups have raised their voices in support of a ban both because of the brutality of partial birth abortions and because they recognize that this debate is not about Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion. It is not about when a fetus becomes a baby. And it is certainly not about women's health. It is about infanticide, it is about killing a child as he or she is being born, an issue that neither Roe vs. Wade nor the subsequent Doe vs. Bolton decision addressed. 
During the Senate debate last year, various traditionally pro-choice legislators voted in support of legislation to ban this particular procedure. Among them was a colleague who stated on the floor of the Senate, `In my legal judgement, the issue is not over a woman's right to choose within the constitutional context of Roe versus Wade. * * * The line of the law is drawn, in my legal judgement, when the child is partially out of the womb of the mother. It is no longer abortion; it is infanticide.' He was joined in these sentiments by other like minded Senators. 
This perspective is significant in that it suggests the scope of the tragedy that this procedure represents. And for those who may still be unclear what a partial birth abortion procedure is, it is this: a fully formed baby--in most cases a viable fetus of 23-26 weeks--is pulled from its mother until all but the head is delivered. Then, scissors are plunged into the base of the skull, a tube is inserted and the child's brains are suctioned out so that the head of the now-dead infant collapses and is delivered. 
Partial birth abortion is tragic for the infant who loses his or her life in this brutal procedure. It is also a personal tragedy for the families who choose the procedure, as it is for those who perform it--even if they aren't aware of it. But partial birth abortion is also a profound social tragedy. It rips through the moral cohesion of our public life. It cuts into our most deeply held beliefs about the importance of protecting and cherishing vulnerable human life. It fractures our sense that the laws of our country should reflect long-held, commonly accepted moral norms. 
Yet this kind of tragedy--even as it calls forth and exposes our outrage--can be an unexpected catalyst for consensus, for new coalitions and configurations in our public life. The partial birth abortion debate moves us beyond the traditional lines of confrontation to hollow out a place in the public square where disparate individuals and groups can come together and draw a line that they know should not be crossed. 
The stark tragedy of partial birth abortion can be the beginning of a significant public discussion where we define--or re-define--our first principles. Why is such a discussion important? Precisely because it throws into relief the fundamental truths around which a moral consensus is formed in this country. And, as John Courtney Murray reminds us in `We Hold These Truths, Catholic Reflections on the American Proposition', a public consensus which finds its expression in the law should be `an ensemble of substantive truths, a structure of basic knowledge, an order of elementary affirmations* * *'. 
If we do not have fundamental agreement about first principles, we simply cannot engage one another in civil debate. All we have is the confusion of different factions locked in their own moral universe. If we could agree publicly on just this one point--that partial birth abortion is not something our laws should sanction, and if we could then reveal the consensus--a consensus that I know exists--against killing an almost-born infant, we would have significantly advanced the discussion about what moral status and dignity we give to life in all its stages. Public agreement, codified by law, on this one prohibition gives us a common point of departure. It give us a common language even, because we agree, albeit in a narrow sense, on the meaning of fundamental terms such as life and death. And it is with this common point of departure and discourse--however narrow--that we gain a degree of coherence and unity in our public life and dialogue. 
I truly believe that out of the horror and tragedy of partial birth abortions, we can find points of agreement across ideological, political and religious lines which enable us to work toward a life-sustaining culture. So, as hundreds of thousands of faithful and steadfast citizens come together to participate in this year's March for Life, let us remember that such a culture, the culture for which we hope and pray daily, might very well be achieved one argument at a time. 
Mr. President, I am proud to have the opportunity to sponsor this legislation and to continue the very significant achievements of my colleague, Senator Bob Smith. I look forward to continuing that effort in cooperation with Representative Charles Canady, and I thank my colleagues for making this initiative a priority in our legislative agenda.
