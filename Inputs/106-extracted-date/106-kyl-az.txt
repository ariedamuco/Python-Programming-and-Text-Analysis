   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, congratulations to the majority leader, and happy birthday to our President pro tem, STROM THURMOND. 
   I remember on the 90th birthday of Senator THURMOND, a reporter asked him if he could expect to see STROM on his 100th birthday. Senator THURMOND looked him up and down and said: Well, you look fit enough to me. If you eat right and drink right, you ought to be around to see me then. 
   All of us are looking forward to the centennial birthday of Senator THURMOND.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise this morning to express how much I am going to miss our colleague, CONNIE MACK, who retires at the end of this Congress, after three terms in the House of Representatives and two terms in the Senate. 
   My colleague, the first Republican in the history of the State of Florida ever to be reelected to the U.S. Senate, is a valued part of our party's leadership team. He has managed simultaneously to accomplish great things for the conservative cause while also increasing the level of civility in this body. 
   One is tempted to call CONNIE MACK Reaganesque in the way that he combines an agreeable disposition with rock-solid principles. As chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, and as a member of the Banking and Finance Committees, he led the successful effort in 1995 to cut congressional spending by 9 percent--the largest cut in 40 years. Connie is one of the people who has led Congress in forcing the Federal Government to put its financial house in order. 
   He has also left his mark in the areas of medical research and protecting the pristine environment in his home State of Florida. And he has been a warm, amiable gentleman in all seasons and all situations. 
   I served with CONNIE MACK in the House of Representatives to which he was elected in 1982. That was a pivotal time in our politics, as he has pointed out. America had made a clean break at that time from decades of ever-increasing governmental interference in the economy. He entered Congress as a small businessman, a banker, who understood that the engine of America's greatness is its private sector. Then-Congressman MACK took Ronald Reagan's political banner as his own. As CONNIE has written, ``It can be summed up in one word: freedom.'' President Reagan inspired him into public service, and he has eloquently defended conservatism's most deeply held principles: limited government, standing up for democratic allies around the world, lowering the tax burden that Americans bear, taming the bureaucracy and the special interests, and returning to citizens control over their own lives. 
   We agreed on public policy questions, Senator MACK and I. But having said that, I also know that my colleagues who opposed him on issues admire and like him every bit as much as I do. CONNIE MACK is that kind of person. 
   Senator MACK said on the floor of the Senate recently--it was on an important foreign policy matter--that ``we must speak the truth and stand on principle.'' That is what he has done daily. That is the virtuous example he has set. It is what has made him such a good public servant for Florida and America. 
   Mr. President, I know we will all miss our colleague, CONNIE MACK.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I want to say a few words about the wonderful work that my colleague, JOHN ASHCROFT, has done in the Senate during the last 6 years. Our colleague from Missouri has racked up an enviable list of accomplishments in his time in the Senate. 
   As you know, he was responsible for the ``charitable choice'' provision in the landmark 1996 welfare reform law, a provision that allows faith-based organizations to compete for Government resources to help poor families. These organizations had previously been shut out of the process. The Ashcroft provision gained such strong, bipartisan support that he has expanded it so that faith-based groups can now participate in Federal substance abuse treatment programs. Senator ASHCROFT has truly helped America find better ways to attack the problems we face in our communities. 
   He also led the way on another major public policy improvement in the area of Social Security. Social Security, as we know, has had surpluses routinely raided to finance deficit spending of the Federal Government. JOHN was a key Member of Congress who drew attention to, and halted, this practice so that these moneys are now used to pay benefits and only to pay benefits. He introduced the first lockbox proposal in the Senate. And, at his urging, budget procedures were changed so that the objectionable practice of diverting Social Security funds to pay for other Government operations could literally be ruled out of order. 
   I want to conclude by saying what an honor it has been to serve with a man of such intellect, compassion, and notable integrity as JOHN ASHCROFT. He has distinguished himself as a Missouri Senator, its Governor, its auditor, and its attorney general. One thing is certain: we have not seen the last of JOHN ASHCROFT. I trust that what lies ahead for someone of his caliber is further and even greater service to his State and to his country. 
   Thank you, Mr. President.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I think it is somewhat unseemly to use the Senate floor for campaign purposes with respect to attacking the qualifications of one of the two candidates for President of the United States. I would like to do some business here and suggest that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who use their time to engage in campaign tactics really ought to be helping us take care of a bit of business that I think ought to move to the top of the agenda, such as fighting terrorism in the aftermath of the attack on the U.S.S. Cole.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, we now have more reports of specific credible evidence of planned attacks against the United States--terrorism that must be prevented. We have not done everything we can do to prevent terrorism. According to a Commission that has reported to the Congress, there is more to be done. I have incorporated that Commission's recommendations into a bill. We are trying to get the bill passed. It runs into objections from the other side. Today, I am going to lay it out because there isn't much time left. 
   Earlier this month, I introduced the Counterterrorism Act of 2000, cosponsored by my friend and colleague, Senator DIANNE FEINSTEIN. This should have bipartisan support. As the chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Technology, Terrorism, and Government Information, I have held hearings, along with Senator FEINSTEIN, on steps that would better prepare this country to thwart and defend against and prevent and respond to terrorist attacks. Our legislation will do that by capturing many of the recommendations of the National Commission on Terrorism. 
   The Commission was mandated by the Congress, and it released its report earlier this year. It is bipartisan, led by Ambassador Paul Bremer and Maurice Sonnenberg. They have a long record--both of them--of experience and expertise in this matter. The Commission, with 10 members in all, came to unanimous conclusions on the gaps in America's counterterrorism efforts and made extensive recommendations in their report. 
   In addition to Ambassador Bremer, who formerly served as Ambassador-at-Large for Counterterrorism and Mr. Sonnenberg, who serves on the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, the Commission included eight other outstanding experts in the field: former CIA Director, James Woolsey; former Assistant Director-in-Charge of the FBI's National Security Division, John Lewis; former Congresswoman Jane Harman, who served on the House Armed Services and Intelligence Committees; former Under Secretary of Defense, Fred Ikle; former Commander-in-Chief of U.S. Special Operations Command, Gen. Wayne Downing; Director of National Security Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, Richard Betts; former foreign policy adviser to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Gardner Peckham; Harvard professor Juliette Kayyem, who formerly served as legal advisor to the U.S. Attorney General. 
   In June, the members of this Commission testified before the Intelligence Committee, of which I am a member, with their findings and recommendations. A week later, the Commission's report was the subject of a Foreign Relations Committee hearing. At the end of June, Senator FEINSTEIN and I invited the Commissioners to testify at a hearing of the Judiciary subcommittee which I chair. The purpose of our hearing was to explore the findings of the Commission and clarify some recommendations that have been mischaracterized. So the Senate thought that this Commission report was important enough to hold three specific hearings on its findings and recommendations. 
   Senator FEINSTEIN and I then decided to take action on the recommendations by drafting the Counterterrorism Act of 2000. We believe this is an important first step in addressing shortfalls in America's fight against the growing threat of terrorism. 
   In summary, this is what the bill would do: 
   First, it expresses the sense of Congress that the United States Government should take immediate actions to  investigate 
   the unprovoked attack on the U.S.S. Cole, should ensure that the perpetrators of this cowardly act are brought to justice. 
   It directs the President to establish a joint task force to develop a broad approach toward discouraging the fundraising of international terrorists. 
   It directs the Director of the CIA to report to Congress with a response to the Commission's findings regarding guidelines for recruitment of terrorist informants and whether those guidelines inhibit the recruitment of such informants. 
   In effect, what the Commission said is if you are going to try to infiltrate terrorist organizations, you are probably dealing with nefarious characters. They are not Boy Scouts. And you can't demand of them the same clean standards that we would in trying to recruit informants against other governments. When you are dealing with terrorist organizations, you are dealing with terrorists. 
   The bill also directs the Attorney General to conduct a review of the legal authority of various agencies, including the Defense Department, to respond to catastrophic terrorist attacks, and it requires that a report be provided to the Congress. 
   It directs the President to establish a long-term research and development program relating to technology to prevent, preempt, interdict, and respond to catastrophic terrorist attack. 
   It directs the FBI Director to report to Congress on the feasibility of creating an intelligence reporting function within the Bureau to assist in disseminating information collected by the Bureau on international terrorism and other national security matters. 
   It directs the President to report to Congress on legal authorities that govern the sharing of criminal wiretap information between law enforcement agencies and the intelligence community. The Commission noted there is currently a great deal of confusion in this area. We have to get that squared away so the agencies know how they can share information with each other. 
   The bill would direct the Attorney General to report to Congress the recommendations on how to improve controls on biological pathogens and the equipment necessary to produce biological weapons. It directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to report to Congress with recommendations for improving security and physical protection of biological pathogens at research laboratories and other facilities. 
   It authorizes the full reimbursement for professional liability insurance for law enforcement or intelligence officers performing counterterrorism duties. 
   And finally, the bill expresses the sense of Congress that Syria should remain on the list of states that sponsor terrorism, as should Iran, until they meet certain conditions. 
   I recently received a letter from Ambassador Bremer and Mr. Sonnenberg, expressing very strong support for the Kyl-Feinstein legislation. I also received letters from the American Israeli Public Affairs Committee, the Zionist Organization of America, and the Anti-Defamation League applauding the bill. In addition, the American Jewish Congress released a statement in support of the legislation.

   Mr. KYL. The text of the Counterterrorism Act 2000 should be familiar to Members because we tried to move it as an amendment to the intelligence authorization bill. We were open to comments by Senators and we made several modifications to the language in order to suit Senators and the Department of Justice. We agreed in the end to withdraw the bill at that point so the intelligence bill could move forward but indicated our desire then to move the bill as a separate bill, which is now what we are doing. 
   Among the Senators who have talked to us is Senator LEAHY. We have tried to address his concerns with respect to the bill. Originally his staff advised that if the Justice Department didn't object to the bill, Senator LEAHY would consent to its passage. The Justice Department has cleared the bill. After that, Senator LEAHY's office advised us they desired to have 10 other changes considered and sent another list of 4 other changes. Senator FEINSTEIN and I agreed to make changes to the bill to accommodate 12 of those 14 requests of Senator LEAHY. Yet he still remains in opposition. Under the rules of the Senate prevailing at this time, any Senator can object to the consideration of the legislation and thus block it, which Senator LEAHY, I understand, has done. 
   This morning my office received some additional concerns purportedly coming from Senator LEAHY. I find them, frankly, not to rise to the level that should take the Senate's time. For example, he objects to a provision, or his staff objects to a provision, that requires the President to report to Congress on the Commission's recommendations about sharing law enforcement information with intelligence agencies on the grounds that this would help set ``a dangerous precedent for 
   blurring the line between law enforcement and intelligence activities.'' A report to Congress on legal authorities on the state of the law sets no dangerous precedent. There are similar types of concerns expressed. 
   We have to get serious about this. At the very moment that our forces are on a heightened state of alert, at the very moment our embassies are telling people not to travel to certain countries because of terrorist threats against Americans, the Congress has before it a bill embodying the recommendations of the Terrorism Commission, and we are not acting on it because, as far as I know, one Member of this body is not willing to allow it to move forward. 
   I plead with him, I plead with other Members, if there are concerns, let's talk about them. But the time is short. Perfection cannot be the enemy of the good considering the nature of the challenge that we face with terrorists around the world and the need to do more about it. This isn't simply something that has been pulled out of thin air to try to deal with this problem. We have embodied most of the recommendations of the Terrorism Commission specifically mandated by Congress to give us recommendations about what else we need to be doing in this legislation. 
   I say to Senator LEAHY and any others, time is short. We need to visit. We need to talk about these things. We need to clear them away so we can pass this legislation. After the Senate acts, the House will need to act. They are expected to act with alacrity. For example, Representative GILMAN, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, and Representative GOSS, chairman of the Intelligence Committee, and I understand the leadership is prepared, if we can pass this bill, to take it up very quickly. However, I don't know how many days or hours are left in this session. 
   I think it would be a travesty, given the events of the past month, given the threats that currently have been made against the United States, for the Congress to ignore the recommendations of the very Commission that we asked to give us advice, to ignore the recommendations of that Commission and conclude this Congress without acting to pass those recommendations to take additional steps to deal with the terrorist threat. 
   Let's leave politics aside. This is a bipartisan effort of Senator FEINSTEIN and myself. It has broad support on both sides of the aisle. I encourage my colleagues to please come forth if they have additional concerns so we can get this done.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator MCCAIN and myself I am introducing legislation today that would codify the largest water claims settlement in the history of Arizona. The affected parties have been negotiating for several years, and they are getting very close to finalizing these settlement agreements. They still have much work to do; but I am confident that a comprehensive settlement of these issues will be achieved. Therefore, we are introducing this bill today so that all interested Arizonans and others can have time to analyze the proposed language and make suggestions for changes that will enable us to submit a consensus bill early in the next session of Congress. 
   There are a few major issues that have not been resolved. To the extent that the parties are close to agreement on certain issues, we have included language in the bill that attempts to capture the essence of where the negotiations stand at the moment. For example, although differences remain, the parties are relatively close to agreement on the process to be followed in negotiating intergovernmental agreements. The legislation will have to be changed, therefore, before it is reintroduced in the next Congress, to precisely reflect the agreement reached between the parties. In addition, the timing of the waivers to be issued by the Gila River Indian Community is tied to, among other things, a transfer of a minimum amount of federal funds from the Lower Colorado River Basin Development Fund into the Gila River Indian Community Settlement Development Trust Fund. The relevant parties recognize that the settlement agreement needs more definition of uses of the funds and the precise timing of the transfers, and that the ultimate legislative language will reflect that consensus. 
   There are other issues that have not been resolved. For example, Section 213 of the bill has been left open for the resolution of the ``Upper Gila Valley'' (including the City of Safford) issues. Those negotiations are continuing, but have not progressed enough to produce language that can be included in this version of the bill. In addition, Title IV of the bill has been left open for a possible settlement of the claims of the San Carlos Apache Tribe. We will work with the parties over the next few months to ensure that, prior to its reintroduction next year, the bill is modified to reflect the ultimate resolution of these issues. Of course, if those parties choose to litigate their differences, rather than settle them by negotiation, we will not include titles for them in the final bill.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, with respect to this bill, it is a very frustrating exercise, as Senator MCCAIN said. One of the problems is we have a practice around here of combining bills in such a way that while you want to vote for part of it, you want to oppose the other part. It makes it very difficult to make your decision about whether you will vote yes or no. 
   I wrote to the Appropriations Committee chairman when I first came to the Senate and asked to ``de-attach'' some of the bills. The bill before the Senate is the VA-HUD bill. Everybody wants to vote for the veterans programs, and because of the way those programs are structured this year, I support those programs. I want to be able to vote for those programs. 
   As usual, when it is combined with the runaway spending in the HUD part of the bill, it makes it impossible to do so. It is exacerbated this year as a result of the tactics of the minority. We have not been able to bring bills to the floor, and we have not been able to send them to the President. The result is we have had to combine a bunch of bills at the end of the session, and we find we have to combine the energy and water appropriations bill with the VA-HUD appropriations bill. 
   The problem, as bad as it is in the first instance, is exacerbated. I voted for the energy and water appropriations bill. While there are programs in that bill that I don't support overall, it was an important and good bill. I supported what Senator DOMENICI was trying to do in that legislation, by and large, so I voted for it.  
   The question is what to do now in a bill, the VA-HUD bill, which is increasing at a huge rate, and which now has the energy and water bill attached to it. I can't pick and choose. I can't take the veterans part out and say I support that, but I 
   don't support the rest of it. I can't take the energy and water part out and say, I support it but I don't support the rest of it. It is not a good way to legislate, as Senator MCCAIN said. 
   I point out, there are good things in the bill. Veterans health care is increased by 6.5 percent, from $19 billion to $20.3 billion. The account for prosthetic and medical research, a relatively small account but very important, will receive a modest increase. There are some important projects in the NASA account that will receive necessary funding. I support that part of the bill. 
   How can I support a bill which has exploded funding in the HUD part of it? The VA part of this bill increases spending by 7 percent. Now, that is an important and significant increase. But the social programs under the HUD part of this bill have increased by 18 percent. 
   I have heard it said when we add up all the spending bills this year, it will be more than any other year in modern history, including the Great Society. We are increasing these social programs in the HUD part of the bill by 18 percent. The earmarking has exploded. We have not seen the final list, but we know it is up to at least $292 million, up from $123 million in the committee-passed bill, and $240 million from last year. That is too much. We have funding in here for everything from renovating theaters to restoring carousels. This is not something the Federal Government needs to be doing. 
   Finally, there is language in the Senate report that suggests that some of my colleagues are wavering from a commitment that has been made by the Senate and the House to ensure that the allocation of veterans health care funds reflects the reality of where veterans live. 
   Four years ago, under the leadership of Senator MCCAIN, Congress implemented the Veterans Equitable Resource Allocation System. This was done at the request of the Veterans' Administration. Up until then, the formula that VA used did not take into account shifts in population that are relevant in assessing where resources are needed. In particular, we found in Arizona a lot of so-called snow birds, those great folks who live in the cold States and come down to visit Arizona in the wintertime because it is warmer in Arizona. We didn't have the facilities to take care of all of those people because the dollars associated with their care were allocated to the Northeast primarily, or to the North. 
   The Senate, therefore, voted overwhelmingly to implement this new system that let the dollars follow the patients, so to speak. That vote was 79-18. Yet some who benefited from the earlier faulty formula complained, and as a result we find language in here that will require a study. The money for this study is going to have to come from the health care that otherwise would be provided to veterans. 
   I don't believe the way the language in the report is written the investigators are going to have a fair approach to this because of the one-sided list of items they are to explore. 
   I want to be able to support the veterans part of this bill. I want to support the energy and water component of this legislation, but it will be very difficult considering the explosive growth in the HUD part of the bill. 
   I commend the chairman of the committee, Senator BOND, and Senator MIKULSKI. They have an impossible task. Everybody comes to them with requests. The bottom line is we have to draw the line at some point. It seems to me this is the point at which the American taxpayers deserve to be represented.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, first, let me concur with the remarks of my colleague, Senator MCCAIN. I join him in expressing concern for those families who have lost Americans in connection with the terrorist attack on the U.S.S. Cole.  
   I call upon my colleagues who are holding up my antiterrorism legislation to stop holding up this important piece of legislation and allow us to get it passed this year and sent to the President for his signature. The National Terrorism Commission made some very important recommendations about how we should deal with terrorists attacks, and the only response has been the legislation that Senator FEINSTEIN and I have proposed. I hope those who are holding this legislation as a result of this attack will recognize we can't wait for the next terrorism attack. We need to act now.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the final version of the fiscal year 2001 Energy and Water Development appropriations provides $1 million for the Bureau of Reclamation to initiate a comprehensive Hopi/Western Navajo water development study. This funding was added to the bill at my request, and I would like to take this opportunity to detail the reason why I consider this to be a very important undertaking. 
   Efforts have been ongoing for several years to settle the various water rights claims of the Navajo and Hopi Indian tribes and other water users in the Little Colorado River watershed of Northern Arizona. Numerous proposals have been advanced in an effort to settle these water-rights claims, including identifying alternative sources of water, means of delivery and points of usage to help provide a reliable source of good-quality water to satisfy the present and future demands of Indian communities on those reservations. Cost estimates for the various existing proposals run into the hundreds of millions of dollars, the majority of which would likely be borne by the federal government. This study is needed to identify the most cost-effective projects that will serve to meet these objectives. 
   I have asked the Bureau to hire an outside contractor to complete this study to ensure that a fresh and objective analysis of existing studies and data is conducted. In addition, using a private contractor will enable the Bureau to complete the study in a timely manner without requiring the Bureau to divert personnel needed to accomplish other vital priorities. The study should be complete and submitted to the Senate Appropriations Committee as soon as possible, but no later than April 1, 2002. 
   I also want to assure the parties that this study is intended to be used to facilitate this settlement, and cannot be used for any other purpose in any administrative or judicial proceeding.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would like to briefly describe one item I was very pleased to see included in this legislation. The item to which I refer is a proposal of mine, the Campus Sex Crimes Prevention Act. I would like to thank Chairman HATCH and Senator BIDEN for their cooperation in getting this proposal included in the Violence Against Women Act, which has now been incorporated into the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. 
   The purpose of this provision is to guarantee that, when a convicted sex offender enrolls or begins employment at a college or university, members of the campus community will have the information they need to protect themselves. Put another way, my legislation ensures the availability to students and parents of the information they would already receive--under Megan's Law and related statutes--if a registered sex offender were to move into their own neighborhood. 
   Current law requires that those convicted of crimes against minors or sexually violent offenses to register with law enforcement agencies upon their release from prison and that communities receive notification when a sex offender takes up residence. The Campus Sex Crimes Prevention Act provides that offenders must register the name of any higher education institution where they enroll as a student or commence employment. It also requires that this information be promptly made available to law enforcement agencies in the jurisdictions where the institutions of higher education are located. 
   Here is how this should work. Once information about an offender's enrollment at, or employment by, an institution of higher education has been provided to a state's sex offender registration program, that information should be shared with that school's law enforcement unit as soon as possible. 
   The reason for this is simple. An institution's law enforcement unit will have the most direct responsibility for protecting that school's community and daily contact with those that should be informed about the presence of the convicted offender. 
   If an institution does not have a campus police department, or other form of state recognized law enforcement agency, the sex offender information could then be shared with a local law enforcement agency having primary jurisdiction for the campus. 
   In order to ensure that the information is readily accessible to the campus community, the Campus Sex Crimes Prevention Act requires colleges and universities to provide the campus community with clear guidance as to where this information can be found, and clarifies that federal laws governing the privacy of education records do not prevent campus security agencies or other administrators from disclosing such information. 
   The need for such a clarification was illustrated by an incident that occurred last year at Arizona State University when a convicted child molester secured a work furlough to pursue research on campus. University officials believed that the federal privacy law barred any disclosure of that fact. 
   Without a clear statement that schools are free to make this information available, questions will remain about the legality of releasing sex offender information. The security unit at Arizona State and its counterparts at a number of other colleges asked for this authority, and we should give it to them. 
   The House of Representatives passed a similar provision--authored by Congressman MATT SALMON--earlier this year. Since then, I--along with Congressman SALMON--have worked to address the concerns that some in the higher education community had about possible unintended consequences of this legislation. I am pleased to report that, in the course of those negotiations, we were able to reach agreement on language that achieved our vital objectives without exposing colleges to excessive legal risks. 
   For the helpful role they played in those discussions, I must thank not only Senator HATCH, Senator BIDEN, and Congressman SALMON, but Senators JEFFORDS and KENNEDY, the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. 
   I appreciate the opportunity briefly to describe what I have tried to accomplish with this amendment.

   Mr. KYL. I thank Senators MACK and LAUTENBERG for their leadership on this issue. I would like to add that from the beginning of my involvement on this issue in 1998, I have sought to help Senator MACK provide a mechanism which would not only help current victims, but also set in place a procedure to ensure future victims will be able to attain justice, provided blocked assets are held in the U.S. I would therefore first like to associate myself with the interpretation of the waiver as expressed by Senators LAUTENBERG and MACK. I do not appreciate seeing laws in effect vetoed through a waiver authority interpreted overly broadly. Indeed, the waiver used in this language should be exercised on a case-by-case basis only. 
   Second, I would also like to point out the precedent being set and the reaffirmation of authority. The administration assures us via a private letter that the judgment creditors already holding final judgment will be paid their compensatory awards within 60 days of the enactment of this act. The administration will do so using executive authority to vest and pay from blocked assets. In addition, the Congress statutorily reaffirms the President's authority to vest and pay from blocked assets in the future to help future victims of terrorism. Let me state very clearly that there is no way, based upon the procedure now in place, that future victims will be forced to suffer the prolonged battle with their government that these first victims were forced to bear. I am pleased with the justice being delivered today; but I am especially pleased by the process in place to help any future victims. Hopefully, with this process, the deterrent capability of this law will become more powerful.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from North Dakota that I very much agree with him that we should be taking up the Patients' Bill of Rights legislation. I hope he will join those of us on this side of the aisle when we bring a conference report to this body which will report a very important Patients' Bill of Rights piece of legislation. We would then hope to pass it in the Senate, send it over to the House of Representatives, and have the President sign it. 
   I am very much hopeful that we can get such a conference report to the Senate and that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will help us to pass it.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would like to talk about something this afternoon that I think is of great importance to this country and one of the biggest challenges we are going to face in the coming years; that is, the challenge of how the United States manages our relationships with countries that potentially present threats to our national security. 
   While few would like to admit it, I think China cannot be omitted from this scrutiny, and I, therefore, would like to discuss that question with respect to China today. 
   As my colleagues know, it was not long ago that the bill to grant permanent normal trade status to China passed through the Senate without amendment. I voted for this bill because I recognize the economic benefits it will have for many American workers, businesses, and consumers. That said, it is of utmost importance that we not lose sight of the fact that trade alone does not define our relationship with China. The actions and the heated rhetoric of China's communist leaders should be of great concern. So now, in the aftermath of our recent decision to grant PNTR to China, we are obligated to face the other challenges presented by the communist Chinese government. 
   Time and time again, Chinese officials and state-sponsored media have made bellicose and threatening statements aimed at the United States and our long-standing, democratic ally, Taiwan. They have even gone so far as to issue implied threats to use nuclear weapons against the United States. The question is, will we take them at their word on these defense matters as we did when they made trade commitments. 
   For example, in 1995, General Xiong Guangkai warned a visiting U.S. official that China could use military force to prevent Taiwan's gaining independence without fear of U.S. intervention because American leaders ``care more about Los Angeles than they do about Taiwan.'' An editorial in a military-owned newspaper this March was more blunt, warning that, ``The United States will not sacrifice 200 million Americans for 20 million Taiwanese.'' 
   In February of this year, a state-owned paper again warned the United States against becoming involved in a conflict with China over Taiwan. The People's Liberation Army Daily carried an article which stated, ``On the Taiwan issue, it is very likely that the United States will walk to the point where it injures others while ruining itself.'' The article went on to issue a veiled threat to attack the U.S. with long-range missiles, stating, ``China is neither Iraq or Yugoslavia *.*.* it is a country that has certain abilities of launching a strategic counterattack and the capacity of launching a long-distance strike. Probably it is not a wise move to be at war with a country such as China, a point which U.S. policymakers know fairly well also.'' 
   Not only has China warned against U.S. military intervention in the event that Taiwan declares its independence, Chinese officials have also issued threats against U.S. sale of theater missile defenses (TMD) to Taiwan. In February 1999, China's top arms control official, Sha Zukang, was interviewed by a reporter for the publication Defense News. When asked if U.S. assistance on theater missile defense for Japan, South Korea and possibly Taiwan could cause damage to U.S.-China relations, he replied, ``If the U.S. is bent on its own way on this issue, it will not, to put it lightly, be conducive to the development of legitimate self-defense needs of relevant countries.'' When further questioned about theater missile defense for Taiwan, he stated, ``In the case of Taiwan, my God, that's really the limit. It constitutes a serious infringement of China's sovereignty and territorial integrity. It also represents a deliberate move on the part of the United States to provoke the entire Chinese people. Such a move will bring severe consequences.'' (Emphasis added) According to the Washington Post in July, that same Chinese official warned that the sale of U.S. technology to Taiwan for a smaller scope theater missile defense system would ``lead to serious confrontation'' because it would be tantamount to restoring a military alliance between Taipei and Washington. He stated, ``This is of supreme national interest. It will be defended at any cost.'' (Emphasis added)

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the rhetoric from Beijing has also been accompanied by troubling actions. China has long-range nuclear-tipped missiles targeted at American cities, and is already increasing its arsenal of such weapons. It is greatly increasing the number of short-range missiles aimed at Taiwan, and has taken steps to improve its ability to invade or blockade the island. 
   China has also been the world's worst proliferator of missiles and weapons of mass destruction. It has sold ballistic missile technology to Iran, North Korea, 
   Syria, Libya, and Pakistan, despite promising to adhere to the Missile Technology Control Regime. It has sold nuclear technology to Iran and Pakistan. It has aided Iran's chemical  weapons program and sold that nation advanced cruise missiles. Because of China's assistance to rogue nations and its military advances, the American people, and our forces and friends abroad, face a much greater threat. 
   Mr. President, as we craft effective national security policies for the United States, it's important that we look for warning signs of problems. As Winston Churchill said, in his ``Iron Curtain'' speech in 1946, less than one year after the end of World War II, ``Last time, I saw it all coming and I cried aloud to my own fellow-countrymen and to the world, but no one paid any attention. Up till the year 1933 or even 1935, Germany might have been saved from the awful fate which has overtaken her *.*.* There never was a war in all history easier to prevent by timely action than the one which has just desolated such great areas of the globe *.*.* but no one would listen *.*.* We surely must not let that happen again.'' 
   Now, more than 50 years later, we live in a very different world. The collapse of the Soviet empire, the spread of democracy and civil society in Eastern Europe and the Baltics, and the emergence of the United States as the sole-surviving superpower could lead some to mistakenly assume that the world is no longer a dangerous place. 
   To the contrary, the threats we face today are even more complex and harder to predict than those we faced during and before the Cold War. We must now be more clear than ever in our own minds about our strategic intentions, and just as clear in signaling these to our potential aggressors. 
   Obviously, China is not Nazi Germany, and it presents different challenges, yet the message delivered by Churchill about the need to heed warning signs is timeless. Many are quick to dismiss the rhetoric from Beijing as empty threats. This could be true, but I believe we must be prepared for another possibility--what if China's leaders mean what they say? 
   China's proliferation of the technology for ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction has increased the threat faced by the United States and our allies. China is increasing the size and capabilities of its strategic nuclear force targeted on the United States. And furthermore, China has tried to use the threat of missile attack to coerce the United States into staying out of any future conflict in the Taiwan Strait. 
   These are but three of the many compelling reasons why we need a national missile defense system to protect the United States and to guarantee our freedom of action. I disagree with those who claim China's objection to our proposed national missile defense, NMD, system will lead to an arms race with that country. As Secretary of Defense William Cohen testified to the Senate in July of this year, ``I think it's fair to say that China, irrespective of what we do on NMD, will in fact, modernize and increase its ICBM capability.'' Of course, that is precisely what China has done. Left with this reality, we have no option but to deploy a national missile defense system that will protect the United States. 
   Frankly, I am disappointed that for the last eight years, the Clinton-Gore Administration has failed to pursue the most promising forms of missile defense and has underfunded the limited programs it has authorized due to loyalty to the ABM Treaty. For example, one of the Administration's first decisions in early 1993 was to return unopened proposals the Defense Department had requested from three teams of companies that had bid to develop a ground-based national missile defense interceptor. In 1993, the Clinton Administration also cut the budget for missile defense for fiscal year 1994 by $2.5 billion over the amount requested in President Bush's final budget, and has continued to underfund missile defense programs every year. 
   I believe that the ABM Treaty is obsolete. It was made with an entity that no longer exists. In the words of former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, this treaty ``constrains the nation's missile defense programs to an intolerable degree in the day and age when ballistic missiles are so attractive to so many countries.'' Dr. Kissinger has also stated that, ``Deliberate vulnerability when the technologies are available to avoid it cannot be a strategic objective, cannot be a political objective, and cannot be a moral objective of any American President.'' We must not allow loyalty to an outdated piece of paper called the ABM Treaty to stand in the way of a sound defense given the threats we face. 
   In addition to the deployment of a national missile defense system, it is important for the United States to use the full range of economic and diplomatic tools to halt China's proliferation of the technology for missiles and weapons of mass destruction. I believe the Senate missed an opportunity when we failed to pass an amendment offered by Senator THOMPSON to combat this problem. I hope this legislation will be considered and passed next year. In addition, we need to ensure that strong export controls on U.S.-made products are in place so we don't inadvertently help China modernize its military. 
   It remains to be seen whether the rhetoric from Beijing will become reality, but in light of China's troubling actions, prudence demands that we take steps to address China's behavior. We ignored warnings in the past and paid a high price. We surely must not let it happen again.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I suggest to my colleague that we complete the time on the three pending nominees. I could yield back the time that remains on them. Then I will be happy to allow Senator LEAHY to conclude his remarks on the time he has under the Teilborg nomination, and then I can comment with respect to that nomination. 
   I yield back all time remaining on the three judicial nominations.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I appreciate those remarks of the distinguished ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. It is probably a good segue for me to try to explain what has been going on here because colleagues who may be watching or people who are not in the Senate may be wondering what all of the discussion has been about when there are four specific nominees who President Clinton has nominated for Federal district judgeships and they are ostensibly being considered by the Senate and I have heard no discussion about the four. So I am going to discuss the four very briefly. 
   The problem, as you have heard, is that many on the other side of the aisle are unhappy with the fact that other nominees have not been considered this year. You have heard all the discussion about that. You have heard Senator HATCH on our side explain why that is so. But there has been great displeasure on the other side because, in their view, not all the nominees they would have liked to have considered were considered. 
   The four nominees who are before us today are the only four the Senate can consider. They are the only nominees who have gone all the way through the process from nomination, ABA clearance, FBI clearance, hearing before the Judiciary Committee, and then the Judiciary Committee having acted upon them to send them to the floor of the Senate. These are the only four on whom the Senate can act. I am pleased that, today, we will have the opportunity to do that. 
   All four of these nominees were pending in July. The majority leader made a request of the minority to consider the four nominees. That request was denied, however. So these four nominees had to be held over the August recess. Obviously, on 
   our side we would have much preferred that the four confirmations could have occurred because of the need to fill these vacancies for the District in Arizona--which I will refer to in just a moment--but to which Senator LEAHY referred. He acknowledges we have a significant need in Arizona to fill these positions. But there was objection on his side to their consideration. 
   So when we came back in September, the majority leader again asked the minority leader for concurrence to bring these four nominees to the floor for a vote. Again, that was denied by the Democratic side. 
   People might ask: Why would Democrats be objecting to President Clinton's nominees? The reason has nothing to do with their merits. As Senator LEAHY pointed out, undoubtedly all four of these nominees will be confirmed because they are all four very well qualified. The reason has to do with the politics of this Chamber. Because some Democrats were concerned that not all of their people had been yet considered, they were going to hold up nominees they perceived to be important to me and to Senator FITZGERALD from Illinois, the home State of the four nominees here before us. 
   But the fact is, these people are needed to serve the people of the United States of America. They were nominees of President Clinton. So the bottom line is that it is now time for the nominations to be considered by the full Senate. We need to get over the politics. We need to get on with doing the people's business and confirm these four well-qualified individuals. I am pleased that both the majority and minority have now made that possible and that in a few minutes we will be able to vote for all of these candidates. 
   The first three candidates should have been discussed this morning. I know they were not. Instead, we had the discussion that you have heard. But those four nominees, as Senator HATCH mentioned, are Michael Reagan from Illinois, about whom you will hear a little more in a moment from Senator FITZGERALD; Mary Murguia, a very well qualified assistant U.S. attorney from Arizona who, by the way, if confirmed, will be the first Latina to serve as a Federal district court judge from Arizona; and the Honorable Susan Bolton, a very distinguished Superior Court judge in Arizona. All three of those candidates I deem to be well qualified. I chaired the hearing. I can certainly attest to the fact that the two from Arizona have the highest qualifications. 
   That leaves the fourth who is being considered separately here for reasons I will discuss in just a moment, but he is James Teilborg. Since I think it is appropriate when we are going to vote on somebody to actually have a little discussion about the individual, I am pleased to present a couple of minutes on his background here. 
   He was born and raised on a farm in southern Colorado and was State President of the Colorado Future Farmers of America. He married his wife, Connie, 37 years ago. They have two sons, Andy and Jay, and three granddaughters. 
   He and I attended the University of Arizona College of Law beginning in 1964. That is where I first met Jim Teilborg. I have known him ever since, and we have been close friends. So I can attest not only to his qualifications as a fine lawyer but also as a fine individual. He served in active duty U.S. Air Force to attend Navigator School. He is a retired colonel in the United States Air Force Reserve after 31 years in the 
   National Guard and Reserve service. He was a member of the National Guard for 7 years, a navigator on the C-97 and KC-97 aircraft and, by the way, has been 23 years admissions counselor for the U.S. Air Force Academy. I would also note for the entire time I have been with the U.S. Congress, Jim Teilborg has chaired my service academy committee, a huge job of interviewing all the individuals who would like to attend one of our military service academies: interviewing them, making recommendations to me, and then for me to the academies. As a result of his exemplary service, I must say we have a much higher than average rate of acceptance by the service academies--because of Jim Teilborg's fine service. 
   He was a founder of the law firm of Teilborg, Sanders & Parks, the 12th largest law firm in Arizona. His practice focused on the areas of aviation, professional negligence, product liability, and complex tort litigation. 
   The Presiding Officer will appreciate, as a pilot himself, that, of course, Jim  Teilborg is an accomplished pilot as well. 
   He is a 33-year veteran trial lawyer. He was President of the Maricopa County Bar Association, and was a member of the board of directors. He was the lawyer representative to the Ninth Circuit Judicial Conference, a distinguished position for a member of the bar, and has served as chairman of the Maricopa County Bar Association Medical/Legal Liaison Committee, and also served as chairman of the Special State Bar Disciplinary Administrative Defense Counsel. 
   He is a Member of the International Association of Defense Counsel board of directors and was its president in 1981; and, a very prestigious honor, a fellow of the American College of Trial Lawyers. This is the pinnacle for anybody who really wants to call himself a trial lawyer. In the latest edition of ``The Best Lawyers of America,'' of course, he is included. 
   Jim Teilborg is one of those rare individuals who has practiced law for all of this time, made no enemies that I know of, but a lot of friends in the practice of law as a very competent litigator, a fine individual, and one who, as we found when we interviewed people in Arizona about his potential nomination, had unanimous support among judges and lawyers for service on the Federal district court. 
   I cannot think of anyone who would be more suited for the position because of his background, because of his judicial temperament, and because of his philosophy of always treating people fairly and his love for the law. It is personally a great honor for me and a pleasure to recommend James Teilborg to my colleagues. 
   That is probably the last you will hear about Jim Teilborg. Nobody is going to argue against him as an individual, I am sure. Of course, none has so far. I am hopeful that the political disagreement we have had over other nominees will not spill over into a negative vote on Jim Teilborg. 
   There is only one reason he has been set apart from the other nominees, and that is that he happens to be a Republican. Of course, I have supported nearly 97 percent of President Clinton's nominees during the time I have been in the Senate, and I daresay virtually all of them have been Democrats. One cannot base a vote on partisan reasons in this body. 
   I was very pleased to hear Senator LEAHY say he would urge the support for Jim Teilborg, as well as committing that support himself. While we on both sides of the aisle have voted against candidates for reasons having to do with the merits of that individual candidate, I do not know of any time I have seen a colleague vote against a nominee in protest of something someone else had done. That would be wrong. A protest vote having nothing to do with the individual would be wrong. 
   If the Senator from Vermont will still stay on the floor one more moment, I will quote him because I want him to know how much I agree with this important statement of his. 
   He said:  
   We should be the conscience of the Nation. On some occasions, we have been, but we tarnish the conscience of this great Nation if we establish the precedents of partisanship and rancor that go against all precedents and set the Senate on a course of meanness and smallness.  
   The Senator from Vermont was, I think, very accurate not only in what he predicted would be the consequence of the precedent we would set if we acted in that degree of smallness, but also I think expressed the view all of us share that our decisions should be based upon the merits, however we see them--maybe differently--but never voting on an individual because of the actions of someone else, to make a protest about some other point. 
   I appreciate his comments, and I commend to all of his colleagues the statement he has made here with respect to Jim Teilborg.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. I will conclude. Some of the best things we have done have been in a bipartisan way--some of the things Senator LEAHY and Senator HATCH have worked on in particular, things that Senator FEINSTEIN and I have worked on in particular. I certainly look forward to getting together with Senator LEAHY after the election to see how we begin next year, assuming I am returned to this body. 
   I conclude with a quick comment about the need to fill this position in Arizona. 
   In 1999, Congress created nine new Federal district court judgeships--four for Florida, two for Nevada, and three for Arizona. The Nevada positions and three of four in Florida have been confirmed, but none has been confirmed yet for Arizona. That is why this is such an important matter as we conclude our business this year. 
   These nominees are needed to handle the ever-increasing caseload in Arizona, and here is an illustration of that caseload. 
   Our criminal felony caseload has increased 60 percent in the last 3 years. The district of Arizona ranks second in total weighted filings for a judge among the Nation's 94 districts, by the way, twice the national average--901 compared to the national average of 472. We are fourth in weighted felony filings per judgeship. Felony filings per judgeship weighted are 236 percent above the national average. 
   So you can see, Mr. President, why this burgeoning amount of work in Arizona requires that we fill these positions. We have 19 Indian reservations and 21 tribes which produces a steady stream of U.S. jurisdiction cases which are not found in most other States. Because we are on the border, we have a lot of illegal immigration and drug smuggling cases. And Arizona is one of the fastest growing States in terms of population. It is pretty easy to see how a State such as Arizona can get into a position where it has to fill these positions. 
   I am very pleased that at this point, just before the Senate concludes its business for the year, we are able to fill these three positions in Arizona, as well as the Illinois position. I am delighted my colleague from Vermont will be urging his colleagues on the Democratic side to support all four nominations. I have certainly done the same on our side of the aisle. I think it will send a very good signal of that very kind of bipartisanship Senator LEAHY was talking about if all of these nominees receive our unanimous support. 
   I reserve the remainder of whatever time is remaining on my side. Mr. President, it is my understanding that any quorum call time will be attributed to both sides equally; is that correct?

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to thank all of those responsible for helping in the steering of the confirmation of these four nominees--Senator HATCH and Senator LEAHY. 
   I also would like to make a quick comment about my colleague, Senator GRASSLEY, who observed earlier that even though I rank fifth on the Judiciary Committee and Senator GRASSLEY ranks second, I was able to secure these nominees; whereas, the nominee very important to Senator GRASSLEY and Senator HARKIN has not been considered. 
   I want to make it clear that seniority had nothing to do with it. Senator GRASSLEY has worked long and hard on behalf of the nominee that Senator HARKIN has spoken about, Bonnie Campbell, former attorney general of Iowa. 
   I worked very hard on behalf of these nominees. But to make it clear, the nominees from Arizona were President Clinton's nominees. I worked with my colleague in the House, ED PASTOR, a Democrat, in helping to ensure that these nominees could be considered in  this session of the Congress; that we could have the Senate Judiciary Committee approve the nominations, and send them to the floor for consideration. It was still laid over over the August recess. Notwithstanding all of that, we were able to get it done. 
   But in the case of Bonnie Campbell, she is a circuit court nominee. I know Senator GRASSLEY and Senator HARKIN have an agreement that they will support each other's nominees when the other party is in power. In this case, the Democratic President makes a nominee, and Senator HARKIN is supportive and Senator GRASSLEY is also supportive. He certainly has been supportive. 
   I want the Record to be clear--I am sure Senator HARKIN would concur in this--that Senator GRASSLEY has been a very strong advocate for Bonnie Campbell. 
   I think the circumstances that permitted us to confirm these other four nominees--one from Illinois and three from Arizona --didn't have anything to do with the seniority on the committee or it wouldn't have been possible for the Arizona judges to have been confirmed by the Senate. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the conference report to H.R. 4733 provides $1 million for the Bureau of Reclamation to initiate a comprehensive Hopi-Western Navajo water development study. This funding was added to the bill at my request, and I would like to take this opportunity to detail the reason why I consider this to be a very important undertaking. 
   Efforts have been ongoing for several years to settle the various water rights claims of the Navajo and Hopi Indian tribes and other water users in the Little Colorado River watershed of Northern Arizona. Numerous proposals have been advanced in an effort to settle these water-rights claims, including identifying alternative sources of water, means of delivery and points of usage to help provide a reliable source of good-quality water to satisfy the present and future demands of Indian communities on these reservations. Cost estimates for the various existing proposals run into the hundreds of millions of dollars, the majority of which would likely be borne by the Federal Government. This study is needed to identify the most cost-effective projects that will serve to meet these objectives. 
   I have asked the Bureau to hire an outside contractor to complete this study to ensure that a fresh and objective analysis of existing studies and data is conducted. In addition, using a private contractor will enable the Bureau to complete the study in a timely manner without requiring the Bureau to divert personnel needed to accomplish other vital priorities. The study should be complete and submitted to the Senate Appropriations Committee as soon as possible but no later than April 1, 2002. 
   I also want to assure the parties that this study is intended to be used to facilitate this settlement, and cannot be used for any other purpose in any administrative or judicial proceeding.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the reason I wanted to exchange places with you for a moment was to commend you on the statement you just made from the floor regarding our Nation's energy policy. Related to that, of course, is the work of the Department of Energy on other matters, including our nuclear facilities, on which you reported with respect to the Baker-Hamilton report. I appreciate that report as well. 
   Back to the energy policy, I have not heard as good a statement of the overall problem in this country as the Presiding Officer just presented: The fact that in each of the different components of the national energy potential, we have developed policies or, in some cases, failed to develop policies, all of which combine to result in a lack of capacity to provide the fuels to create the energy which our society is going to continue to demand more and more. 
   When we put it all together, as the Presiding Officer did, it becomes very clear that there is no integration of policy; that the Departments of Government that, in effect, have a veto over the development of these resources prevail, so that there is no capacity to literally have an energy policy that produces the fuel with which we can produce the energy. 
   An administration that had a policy would coordinate the activities of each of these Departments of Government--the EPA, the Interior Department, the Energy Department, and all of the others mentioned. But that has not been done. Instead, each has been allowed, as the Presiding Officer pointed out, to develop their own policy for their own reasons. The net result is to diminish the capacity of the United States to produce the fuel to produce the energy we need. 
   I think his explanation that we are likely to see an even higher price because of the concentration now into one area--natural gas--is also something that is bound to come true. But I doubt people are thinking that far ahead at this moment. 
   The last thing I would like to say is about the comments in relation to ANWR. I would like to expand on that a little bit because I get so many letters and calls from constituents of mine in Arizona who are very concerned about the protection of our environment, as am I. They have heard: If we were to allow exploration of oil in this area, it would destroy the environment. I write back to them and say: Look, I have been there. Now, granted not very many of our constituents can afford to go up north of the Arctic Circle a couple hundred miles. You have to work to get there. You have to have some people who know what they are doing to get you there and show you around. 
   But when you have been there, you realize that the exploration that we have been talking about is in no way degrading of the environment. When you go there, the first thing you see is that in the other place where we have developed the oil potential--it is an area not much larger than this Senate Chamber--they have been able to put all of the wells--I think there are 10 of them; two rows of 5, or that is roughly the correct number--those wells go down about 10,000 feet, and then they go out about 10,000 or 15,000 feet in all directions, so that, unlike the typical view that Americans have of oil wells scattered over the environment, they are all concentrated in one little place, in an artificially built area out into the water. 
   So it does not degrade the coastal areas at all. It is all focused in one place. It is totally environmentally contained. There is absolutely no pollution. There is no degradation of the environment. There is no impact on animals. There is no environmental damage from this. The pipeline is already there. It is undercapacity. So it is a perfect way to use our Nation's resource for the benefit of the American people. 
   When this wildlife refuge was created, an area was carved out for oil exploration. This was not supposed to be part of the wilderness. We flew over that area. As far as the eye can see for an hour, there is nothing but snow and ice--nothing. There are no trees. There are no animals. There are no mountains. There is nothing but snow and ice. 
   You finally get to the little place where they would allow the exploration. There is a little Eskimo village there where you can land. You go to the village, and the people say: When are you going to bring the oil exploration for our village? Because they are the ones who would benefit from it. It is not part of the wildlife refuge. When you say: What is the environmental impact of this? They say there is none. 
   For almost all of the year, what you see is this snow and ice. For a little bit of the year--a few weeks in the summer--there is a little bit of moss and grass there where some caribou will come to graze and calve. The reason the caribou herds have about quadrupled in size in the area where the oil exploration has occurred is because there is some habitation in that area. And, of course, the caribou are a lot like cows; They like people just fine. They are willing to come right up to the area of habitation and have their little calves. But the wolves do not like people, so the wolves do not prey on them as much, and they don't eat as many of the calves. Therefore the herd is able to grow. 
   So the only environmental impact anyone has figured out is we have helped the caribou herds expand. This is an area where we can explore for oil without doing any environmental damage. We need the resources, as the Presiding Officer pointed out. 
   I commend the Presiding Officer for his expertise in this area, for his ability to put it all together in a very understandable way, and for urging this administration to get on with the development of a true energy policy.

   Mr. KYL. I would like to take a few minutes to describe the importance of the National Drug-Free Workplace Alliance. The goal of the Alliance is to promote and assist the establishment of drug-free workplace programs and provide comprehensive drug-free workplace services to American businesses. As you know, drug abuse is prevalent in the American workplace. One in 12 employees uses illegal drugs. Equally troubling is that drug and alcohol abusers file about 5 times as many workers compensation claims as non-abusers, and 47 percent of all industrial accidents in the United States are related to drugs and/or alcohol. The Alliance will not only serve as a valuable resource to businesses, but also to the many organizations across the country  devoted to drug free workplaces. Two such organizations in my state, Arizonans for a Drug-Free Workplace and Drugs Don't Work, would greatly benefit from working with the Alliance.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, first of all, I appreciate the Presiding Officer's statement with respect to PNTR. We will have a vote on that tomorrow. I share many of the Senator's sentiments with respect to the concerns of the American people about PNTR. My constituents, frankly, from the correspondence I have received, are overwhelmingly opposed to it. 
   I also share the concerns he expressed about some of the remaining problems we will continue to face with respect to China, not only continuing trade problems but also problems that relate to our national security. I would like to discuss some of these remaining concerns and how I have attempted to resolve those concerns which is why, at the end of the day, I am going to vote to support PNTR notwithstanding those concerns. 
   But I will continue to urge my colleagues that we be able to address both the continuing trade disputes that will not be resolved by China's accession into the WTO and also the national security concerns that will certainly continue to exist after China's accession into the WTO. 
   Mr. President, as the Senate's debate about whether to grant China permanent normal trade status comes to a close this week, and a lopsided vote in favor of granting such status is anticipated, it is imperative for the United States to continue to address numerous important issues in our country's relationship with China. 
   As I outlined last week, the concerns posed by China's aggressive military modernization, threats by its leaders to attack the United States or our ally Taiwan, and its irresponsible proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles to rogue nations, must command attention and should  not be forgotten after passage of this trade bill. I believe the Senate missed an opportunity to address some of these important concerns last week, when an amendment offered by Senator FRED THOMPSON to impose sanctions on organizations in China that engage in the proliferation of ballistic missiles and nuclear, biological, chemical weapons failed. It is also important to take steps to counter China's military moves that threaten the U.S., such as its targeting of nuclear-tipped missiles on American cities. Here too we missed an opportunity earlier this year, when President Clinton decided to delay deployment of a national missile defense system. 
   With regard to Taiwan, I believe it is important that the United States support our long-standing, democratic ally. The communist regime in Beijing uses every available opportunity to undermine international support for Taiwan, and this extends to trade issues as well. Despite earlier promises to the United States that it would not block Taiwan's admission to the World Trade Organization, in recent weeks, China has nonetheless sought to do just that. I had originally intended to offer an amendment to the PNTR legislation that would have conditioned the extension of normal trade relations to China on Taiwan entry into the WTO, but agreed to withdraw the amendment after receiving assurances from President Clinton and U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky that the U.S. would insist on this result. 
   I will have more to say about these national security concerns, but I would first point out that China's record on trade compliance must be closely monitored, and the United States must insist on action when China fails to comply with the very set of international trade rules it has agreed to adhere to through the WTO. The United States must also be diligent about efforts to pressure China into drastically changing its record on human rights, religious freedom, forced abortions and the harvesting of baby and adult human organs. It is unfortunate that the Senate did not pass a number of other amendments offered or debated last week that sought to deal with these issues. 
   Despite unacceptable behavior by the Chinese government on a range of issues, I intend to vote for PNTR for China, because of other benefits this step will bring. Trade with China has become an increasingly important issue for the United States, due to the expansive growth of its economy, and the desire of American firms to compete in the Chinese market. The United States and China has been negotiating a bilateral trade agreement for twelve years. With the passage of PNTR, and China's subsequent admittance to the WTO, this bilateral trade agreement will take effect. 
   China is the world's fifth largest trading market, and the United States could gain substantially from a lowering of Chinese tariffs on U.S. goods and services. Under the negotiated trade agreement, overall Chinese tariffs on American industrial goods will fall from 24.6 percent today to 9.4 percent by 2005--May 2000 report, ``The U.S. Economy and China's Admission to the WTO, Joint Economic Committee. Arizona, in particular, should benefit. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, Arizona exported $243 million in goods and services to China in 1998, up from $67 million in 1993. Of those exports, 58 percent were in electronics and electric equipment; under the trade agreement tariffs on this type of equipment will be reduced from 13 percent to 0 percent at the time of China's accession to the WTO. Over the next five years, tariffs will be significantly reduced on beef, cotton, fruits, and vegetables, all which represent potential export opportunities for Arizona. As tariffs are reduced in China and demand for U.S. goods and services increases there, significant numbers of jobs should be created in the United States, particularly in Arizona. 
   It is also possible, though perhaps not yet probable, that increased trade with the United States could also have a liberalizing effect on China itself, exposing its people to free ideas and making the regime improve its dismal human rights record. PNTR for China, and the subsequent U.S.-China trade agreement, may also increase chances for economic improvements in China. Dismantling state-operated enterprises in favor of private sector investment may produce better, higher-paying jobs for its Chinese citizens. 
   If the United States does not grant PNTR to China and make effective the U.S.-China trade agreement that will benefit U.S. workers and businesses, I am certain other countries will step in and take opportunities away from our U.S. manufacturing and service sectors. 
   As I outlined briefly in the opening of my statement, however, a number of issues will continue to plague the United States' relationship with China. Trade alone does not define our relationship with China, and as I have stated repeatedly, national security and human rights issues must continue to command the attention of the Administration and the elected representatives of the American people in Congress. 
   China poses a special challenge for America, not merely because of its growing economy and increasingly capable military, but because the path of its evolution remains unknown. We need to be realistic in our dealings with China and take steps to defend our security when warranted. 
   Although China has embraced some elements of a free-market economic system, the country is still led by a repressive communist regime that still tries to maintain tight control over its people and their exposure to Western ideas. The Chinese government has also been hostile to the United States in several areas, despite the efforts of the Clinton Administration to ``engage'' its leaders. 
   For example, China has targeted some of its long-range nuclear-tipped missiles on American cities and has threatened to use them if the U.S. came to the aid of Taiwan. As a commentary in the state-owned People's Liberation Army Daily stated in February, ``China is neither Iraq or Yugoslavia, but a very special country ..... it is a country that has certain abilities of launching a strategic counterattack and the capacity of launching a long-distance strike. Probably it is not a wise move to be at war with a country such as China, a point which U.S. policymakers know fairly well also.'' Another editorial published in March of this year in a different state-owned paper was even more blunt, warning that, ``The United States will not sacrifice 200 million Americans for 20 million Taiwanese.'' 
   It is important that the United States takes steps to protect ourselves through the deployment of a national missile defense system. We need to deploy such a system as soon as the technology to do so is ready, and we should pursue sea- and space-based defenses that offer tremendous advantages when combined with the ground-based system currently under development. 
   We also need to send clear signals to China about our intentions behind the deployment of a national missile defense system and our commitment to our long-standing ally Taiwan. For example, I'm disappointed that the Senate did not pass the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act earlier this year. This bill would have increased training for Taiwan's military officers at U.S. military schools, permitted U.S.-flag officers to visit Taiwan, and established a secure communications link between the U.S. and Taiwan militaries. It was a modest piece of legislation that should have been passed to demonstrate our support for Taiwan. 
   Another area where the U.S. needs to stand by Taiwan is in supporting its admission to the WTO. I though it was particularly important to address this specific issue during the Senate's consideration of the China PNTR bill in light of recent moves by China to block Taiwan's admission to the trade group. 
   Taiwan has been negotiating to become a member of the WTO since 1990 and has met the substantive criteria for membership. Furthermore, based on its importance to the world economy, Taiwan should be admitted to the WTO. It has the 19th largest economy and is the 14th largest trading nation in the world. Taiwan's economy is also closely linked to the U.S. It is America's 8th largest trading partner and purchases more American goods than many of our other major trading partners, like mainland China, Australia, and Italy. 
   On several occasions, Chinese officials had assured the United States that China would not block Taiwan's  entry to the WTO as a separate entity. According to the Wall Street Journal, earlier this month, however, Chinese President Jiang Zemin told President Clinton and a business group in New York that Taiwan could only be admitted to the WTO as a province of China. This statement by President Jiang was particularly concerning since it came on the heels of other troubling moves by China. On September 7, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Sun Yuxi said that China wanted its claim to sovereignty over Taiwan written into the terms of the WTO's rules, stating, ``The Chinese side has a consistent and clear position: Taiwan can join WTO as a separate customs territory of China.'' 
   Furthermore, the Wall Street Journal reported in July that:  
   ..... as WTO staff members draw up the so-called protocol agreements--the reams of paper that define exactly what concessions China will make in order to gain entry into the organization--China is insisting that its claim over Taiwan be recognized in the legal language ..... chief Chinese negotiator Long Yongtu said ..... such a stand ``is a matter of principle for us'' ..... That would upset a consensus within the WTO that Taiwan should be allowed to enter the club as a separate economic area--that is, not an independent country, but also not as an explicit part of China. Some WTO members have argued that Taiwan has long since fulfilled its requirements to join the club and its application has been held up only to satisfy China's demand that Taiwan shouldn't win entry to the organization first.  
   In order to help ensure that China lived up to its promises to the United States, and that Taiwan's entry to the WTO was not unnecessarily impeded, I filed an amendment to H.R. 4444, the bill we are currently debating. The text of H.R. 4444 stated that the extension of permanent normal trade relations to China ``shall become effective no earlier than the effective date of the accession of the People's Republic of China to the World Trade Organization.'' My amendment would have added one additional condition, stating that permanent normal trade relations with China ``shall become effective no earlier than the effective date of the accession of the People's Republic of China and Taiwan as separate customs territories to the World Trade Organization.'' 
   Late last week, I agreed not to offer this amendment because of the strong assurances I received from President Clinton and U.S. Trade Representative Barshefsky that the United States would insist on Taiwan's entry to the WTO as a separate entity. As the President said in a letter dated September 12:  
   There should be no question that my Administration is firmly committed to Taiwan's accession to the WTO, a point I reiterated in my September 8 meeting with [Chinese] President Jiang Zemin ..... Taiwan will join the WTO under the language agreed to in 1992, namely as the Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu (referred to as ``Chinese Taipei''). The United States will not accept any other outcome.  
   Based on this strong, written assurance from the President of the United States and others provided privately by Ambassador Barshefsky, I decided not to formally offer my amendment for a vote. It is important that Congress and the Administration stand together in insisting that China live up to its promises and in showing support for Taiwan. In this instance, I am pleased we could work together toward that end. 
   Finally, I want to discuss an area where I believe the Senate missed an opportunity to address serious concerns about China's proliferation of ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction--our failure to adopt the Thompson amendment. 
   Over the past decade, China has been the world's worst proliferator of the technology used to develop and produce nuclear and chemical weapons and ballistic missiles, narrowly edging Russia and North Korea for this dubious distinction. Beijing has sold ballistic missile technology to Iran, North Korea, Syria, Libya, and Pakistan. It has sold nuclear technology to Iran and Pakistan. And it has aided Iran's chemical weapons program and sold that nation advanced cruise missiles. 
   Chinese assistance has been vital to the missile and weapons of mass destruction programs in these countries. And because of this assistance, the American people and our forces and friends abroad face a much greater threat. 
   Sadly, the efforts of the Clinton Administration to end Beijing's proliferation have not succeeded. Since taking office in 1993, the Administration has engaged in numerous discussions with senior Chinese officials concerning their failure to live up to international nonproliferation norms. But it has failed to impose sanctions on Chinese organizations and government entities, as required by several U.S. laws. Time and time again, the Clinton Administration has either refused to follow laws requiring sanctions or has done so in a way deliberately calculated to undermine the intent of the sanctions. 
   For example, the Administration has not imposed the required sanctions on China for the sale of M-11 missiles to Pakistan. Despite the unanimous judgment of our intelligence agencies that this sale has taken and incriminating evidence such as photographs of M-11 missile canisters in Pakistan and training exercises by Pakistani troops with the missile, the Administration has said the evidence was not strong enough for it to impose sanctions, since it can not be sure the missile transfer actually took place. 
   Another example of the Administration's failure to act concerns the transfer of anti-ship cruise missiles from China to Iran. I would remind my colleagues of one example of this danger; in 1987, a similar Exocet cruise missile killed 37 sailors on the U.S.S. Stark. 
   Iran's possession of this missile was first disclosed in January 1996 by Vice Admiral Scott Redd, then-commander of the U.S. Fifth Fleet. Admiral Redd said the C-802 gave the Iranian military increased firepower and represented a new dimension to the threat faced by the U.S. Navy, stating, ``It used to be we just had to worry about land-based cruise missiles. Now they have the potential to have that throughout the Gulf mounted on ships.'' 
   According to the Washington Times, in 1995, Defense Department officials recommended declaring that China had violated the Gore-McCain Iran-Iraq Arms Nonproliferation Act of 1992, which requires sanctions for the transfer to either country of ``..... destabilizing numbers and types and advanced conventional weapons .....'' Yet State Department officials opposed involving sanctions to avoid damaging relations with China. 
   In his Senate testimony in 1997, Assistant Secretary of State Einhorn acknowledged the transaction, stating, ``..... the question of whether china transferred the C-802 anti-ship cruise missiles to Iran is not in doubt.'' He noted that, ``Such missiles increase China's maritime advantage over other Gulf states, they put commercial shipping at risk, and they pose a new threat to U.S. forces operating in the region.'' But Mr. Einhorn maintained that the transfer was not ``destabilizing'' and thus did not meet the legal requirement for sanctions to be imposed. 
   In September 1997, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Stanley Roth further explained the Administration's position, claiming the C-802 sale ``..... does not have to be destabilizing if you define it as overturning the ability of the United States to operate in the Persian Gulf. It hasn't done that.'' Mr. Roth added, ``..... the U.S. Navy tells us that despite the increased threat from the sale of cruise missiles, it can continue to operate and carry out its mission to the Persian Gulf. And so even though [the Navy] is exceedingly unhappy with this new development, it is not, on the face of it, destabilizing at the point.'' 
   Such thinking illustrates how the Clinton Administration has refused to implement nonproliferation laws. If the arrival of weapons which directly threaten the U.S. Navy is not ``destabilizing,'' it is hard to imagine what the Administration might find sufficiently destabilizing for sanctions under the Gore-McCain Iran-Iraq Arms Nonproliferation Act. 
   The Senate has specifically addressed the issue of Chinese cruise missile sales. In June 1997, we passed an amendment offered by Senator BENNETT by a vote of 96 to 0, stating: ``The delivery of cruise missiles to Iran is a violation of the Iran-Iraq Arms Nonproliferation Act of 1992. It is the sense of the Senate to urge the Clinton Administration to enforce the provisions  of the [Act] with respect to the acquisition by Iran of C-802 model cruise missiles.'' Despite this unanimous expression by the Senate of the need to enforce the law, the Administration has refused to take action in this case. 
   There are many more examples of Chinese proliferation and the Administration's failure to enforce current laws in this area that provide the rationale for the Thompson amendment. In the interest of time, I will not describe them all, but will simply make the point that the Thompson amendment would have helped to combat this deadly trade by making it clear to China that it would have faced economic penalties from the U.S. if it continued to proliferate. 
   Mr. President, I would just say in conclusion that trade with China is important, and I intend to vote for the PNTR bill. But I believe it is imperative that we not forget these important national security issues once the debate on PNTR is completed. The challenge before us is to deal with China in a way that protects America's national security, promotes free trade, demonstrates our support for our democratic ally Taiwan, and improves human rights in China. This is a tough job, but one that I am sure all Senators agree is too important to ignore.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to discuss an important matter. As I begin, I am reminded of a statement my mother used to make. Actually, I recall my grandmother making this statement. 
   The statement is to ``cut off your nose to spite your face.'' I have found out that actually that phrase can be traced back to the late 1700s, when our Constitution was created. It essentially means doing something senseless, frequently out of spite, and which frequently ends up hurting the actor. The idea is that you are not happy with your face so you are going to cut off your nose. We all understand that that doesn't exactly solve the problem and, in the end, creates a bigger problem than the one with which you started. 
   That phrase is applicable to something our friends of the minority are doing with respect to Federal judges. We have heard and have been subjected to a weekly dose of expressions of disappointment by members of the minority that the Senate has not confirmed more of President Clinton's judicial nominees. The chairman of the Judiciary Committee recently had to respond to that criticism because it had escalated to such a point that it demanded a response. 
   In fact, not only were members of the Judiciary Committee being critical of the Republican chairman and the Republican Senate for not confirming more judges, but the President and Members of the House of Representatives chimed in with very, as Senator HATCH called it, ``reckless and unfounded'' accusations. 
   For example, one Democratic House Member was quoted as saying that the Senate:  
   ..... has made the judiciary an exclusive club that closes the door to women and minorities. ..... Its determinations have been made on the basis of racism and sexism, plain and simple.  
   Other Democrats have argued that there is a judicial vacancy crisis and that ``scores of vacancies continue to plague 
   our Federal courts.'' That is a statement of a prominent member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. 
   In the face of comments such as this, Senator HATCH had to respond, and respond he did. He pointed out that the claims are false, both the claims of the inordinate number of judges being held, allegedly, and also the charge of racism. 
   The Senate considers judicial nominees on the basis of merit, regardless of race or gender. As Chairman HATCH pointed out, minority and female nominees are confirmed in nearly identical proportion to their white male counterparts. The Republican Senate is confirming nominees at a reasonable rate, about the same rate as has occurred in the past. 
   From statistics I have from the Judiciary Committee, there are currently 64 vacancies out of the 852-member Federal judiciary, which yields a vacancy rates of about 7.5 percent. A good comparison is the year 1994--by the way, at the end of a Democratically-controlled, the 103rd Congress--when there were 63 judicial vacancies, 1 less, yielding a vacancy rate of 7.4 percent. By comparison, at the end of the Bush administration, when Democrats controlled the Senate, the vacancy rate stood at 12 percent. 
   It is possible to find statistics to prove about anything, but the fact is, as the chairman of the committee pointed out, this Congress is confirming judges of the Clinton administration at about the same rate as past Congresses, and certainly the vacancy rate is not as bad as it had been at previous times. 
   The important point is that Democrats, members of the minority, who are critical of Republicans for not confirming the nominees, need to be careful of this charge because it is they who are now refusing to confirm President Clinton's nominees to the Federal district court. There are currently four nominees who are ready to be brought to the full Senate floor for confirmation. Indeed, all four of these nominees were presented to the minority for their approval. There is no objection on the Republican side. 
   The minority leader, speaking for Members of the Senate minority, objected to the Senate's consideration of confirmation of these four Clinton nominees to the Federal district court, the only four candidates on whom the Senate can vote. None of the other nominees has gone through the committee and is therefore ready for us to act. 
   These are the four nominees currently on the Executive Calendar: Judge Susan Ritchie Bolton, Mary Murguia, James Teilborg, and Michael Reagan. The first three are nominees from Arizona. They were all nominated on July 21, 2000, by President Clinton. Michael Reagan of Illinois is the other nominee. He was nominated on May 12, 2000. 
   I chaired the hearing for these four nominees on July 25, 2000. They are all qualified nominees. I recommended them all to my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee for confirmation. Indeed, they were approved by the Judiciary Committee on July 27, 2000, and sent to the floor for consideration. They were supposed to be confirmed before the August recess. When an unrelated negotiation between Leader LOTT and Minority Leader DASCHLE broke down and reached an impasse, floor action on these nominees was postponed until this month, when we returned from the August recess. That is when the minority leader rejected the majority leader's request that these four be considered by the full Senate. 
   It doesn't matter to me whether they are confirmed by 
   unanimous consent or by a vote, but in any event, these are the four on whom we can act. They ought to be acted on, and I believe all should be approved. 
   With respect to the three in Arizona in particular, I note that last year Congress created nine new Federal district court judgeships--four for Florida, three for Arizona, and two for Nevada. There was a very specific reason for this action. There is a huge caseload in these three States. The judges are falling further and further behind, primarily in the State of Arizona; I believe also in Florida. This is due to the number of criminal prosecutions for illegal drugs, alien smuggling, and related cases. All of the new judgeships for Nevada have been confirmed, and three of the four judgeships for Florida have been confirmed. None of the judgeships for Arizona has been confirmed. 
   It is important that these nominees of President Clinton be confirmed by the Senate. They are critical to handling the caseload in the State of Arizona. 
   Here is where the old phrase of my mother and grandmother comes into play: cutting off your nose to spite your face. Because some of the members of the minority party wish we could confirm even more judges, they are holding up the confirmation of these judges. There is nothing against the qualifications of any of the four. It is just that if they can't have everything their way, then, by golly, nobody is going to get anything. 
   It is President Clinton who has nominated these four candidates. It is not somebody from Arizona, though Democratic Congressman ED PASTOR and Senator MCCAIN and I strongly support these three nominees. 
   One, Mary Murguia, is a career Federal prosecutor. She is currently at the  U.S. Department of Justice as the executive director of the Attorneys General Association. She would be, incidentally, the first Latino ever to be confirmed for the U.S. district court from the State of Arizona. 
   Jim Teilborg is a lifelong trial attorney with enormous experience in courts and would--I think everyone recognizes--make a tremendous Federal judge. 
   Judge Susan Bolton is one of the most respected members of the Arizona Superior Court, the trial court at the State court level, one of the most respected judges in the entire State. In fact, I have received comments from many lawyers who have said: We think your three nominees from Arizona are fantastic. We just wish Judge Bolton didn't have to leave because she is so important to the judiciary at the State level. 
   Judge Michael Regan from Illinois, likewise, has very high qualifications. The point is this: These are Clinton administration nominees. They are needed to fill important vacancies in the Federal district court. Members of the minority have complained incessantly all year long that we need more judges and that the Senate needs to confirm the President's nominees, and they complain when the Senate has taken more time than they thought was warranted to confirm these judges. So the Senate Judiciary Committee acts to put these judges before the full Senate, and what happens? Members of the minority object. They won't let the Senate even vote on these four nominees. That is what I call cutting off your nose to spite your face. 
   It is obstruction tactics; it is dealmaking at its worst. This is what people object to when they look at the Federal Government. It doesn't treat these individuals as human beings whose lives and careers are on hold. Incidentally, it has happened before. This is not the first time members of the minority have held up the nomination of a Democratic nominee by the Democratic President. In 1997, Democrats blocked the nomination of Barry Silverman to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. He had to wait until the following year to be confirmed. Again, there was a dustup over a nominee from Illinois, as I recall, and the point was: If we can't get everything we want, you are not going to get anything you want. 
   It is not only me and not only the people of Arizona; it is also the will of the President of the United States that is being thwarted. It is not as if partisan politics were involved with respect to the people being nominated because they are Republicans, Democrats, or Independents. In fact, obviously, the majority are Democrats. So you have a Democratic President nominating mostly Democratic candidates for the court, and the Democratic minority is holding them up. 
   One of our distinguished colleagues on the Judiciary Committee, the distinguished ranking member, Senator LEAHY, recently said on the floor, ``We cannot afford to stop or slow down judicial nominations.'' I agree with Senator LEAHY on this point. I hope that he and Senator DASCHLE and the other Senators who have an interest in this important subject will continue to support the confirmations of judges as long as we can and at least support the confirmations of those who the Senate can act on because they are the only ones who have been cleared to this point and, in any event, will recognize the irony in their criticism on the Senate floor for not confirming judges, when it is their action and their action alone that is preventing the confirmations of these four nominations to the Federal district bench. It is time for action. I hope my colleagues will quickly clear these four nominees for confirmation.

   Mr. KYL. Madam President, 1 year ago, 11 terrorists dedicated to the violent pursuit of Puerto Rican independence walked out of prison thanks to a clemency grant by President Clinton. Two more of these terrorists will be released in coming years. They were all members of the Armed Forces of National Liberation (FALN), which has claimed responsibility for 130 bombings in the United States, killing 6 Americans and wounding 84 others. 
   It is incomprehensible to me that those responsible for such deadly violence are living in freedom today, while their victims and their families are still suffering. As we reflect on the decision of the President 1 year ago to ignore this suffering for his personal gain, I believe it's important to put a human face on the deplorable acts these terrorists committed. 
   I'd like to quote from the testimony of a few victims who lived through some of the 130 bombings these FALN terrorists committed:  
   Bill Newhall, FALN victim: On January 24th [1975], I was having lunch with two colleagues, Charlie Murray and Frank Connor and three clients, Jim Gezork, Alex Berger and Dave Urskind. We were seated at a table overlooking Broad Street, about to return to work when a bomb, placed in a doorway next to our table, detonated, destroying our corner with shrapnel and debris. Jim, Alex, and Frank died terrible deaths, barely recognizable to their families. Another man, Harold Sherburne, who was upstairs at the time of the blast, was also killed. Charlie, David and I suffered multiple wounds, many of them from shrapnel. More than fifty other people sustained injuries as well. . . . It is impossible to adequately describe the effects of this savagery on the injured and dead as well as their families.  
   This bombing, a terrorist act against unarmed and unsuspecting civilians and its lethal results were followed by many more .....

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of the Senator from California. To return the debate to the Thompson amendment, the question before us immediately is not whether PNTR should be granted but whether the Thompson amendment dealing with national security issues should be supported. PNTR is going to pass this body early next week. The question is whether at about 1:45 p.m. or so this body will table the Thompson amendment. 
   The Thompson amendment would set up a regime that would help stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction by China. In the past, each year we have been able to review the Chinese trade, national security, and even human rights issues, and because we had an annual review, we were able to deal with those issues in this body, as well as from a diplomatic point of view the administration's dealings with China. 
   PNTR will remove that annual review, the requirement that we affirmatively act each year. It will allow China then to join the WTO, and that is fine as a matter of trade. But we have to have some parallel way of ensuring  from a national security standpoint that China stops the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. 
   The Thompson amendment sets up a process whereby the Chinese actions are reviewed and the President can impose sanctions, if it is appropriate, but if he does not impose sanctions in those circumstances--he does have a waiver authority--he is required to report to Congress why not. There is nothing unreasonable about this particular proposition. 
   Yesterday I talked at length about the reasons for it. I will mention two: The proliferation of M-11 missiles by China to Pakistan, for example, which has not resulted in appropriate sanctions by the United States and, more recently, the transfer of sea-based cruise missiles to Iran. 
   We remember what happened to the Stark, the U.S. destroyer in the Persian Gulf, when several Americans lost their lives as a result of a sea-based cruise missile. The question here is particularly interesting because the Senate voted 96-0 that the Chinese actions in supplying these cruise missiles to Iran was a violation of the Gore-McCain Iran-Iraq Nonproliferation Act. In other words, China is not supposed to send this kind of weapon to countries such as Iran. The Senate has been on record unanimously that it was a violation of the act. The administration has done nothing to impose sanctions or otherwise act to stop China from that kind of proliferation. That is why the Thompson amendment is necessary. 
   Trade, in other words, cannot be the only thing that defines the relationship between the United States and China. The Senate has to balance other things than trade, including our national security obligations. 
   It has been said that we cannot support the Thompson amendment, not because it is not a good idea but because if there is any change to this bill in the Senate, if it goes back to the House of Representatives, they will not pass it. One of two things is true: Either there is support for PNTR and the House of Representatives will quickly act on the Thompson amendment, and, in fact, if the two are joined and sent to the House, as I was advised yesterday, support would fall off in the House to the point where there are 40 people over there who no longer support PNTR and would not vote for the bill. 
   Obviously, it would be an anti-democratic action for us to proceed with something that no longer enjoys a majority support in the House of Representatives. I cannot believe that many people would switch their vote on PNTR. They still, of course, can vote against the Thompson amendment if we send it over to them. 
   The fact is, we have 5 weeks to go. The House of Representatives has plenty of time to deal with this issue. They are committed to PNTR, as I know the leadership of the Senate is. I cannot believe amending the bill with the Thompson amendment would destroy PNTR. Remember, too, that it is the opponents of the Thompson amendment who forced Senator THOMPSON into using this vehicle of amending PNTR as the only way to achieve his goal of establishing a nonproliferation regime with respect to China. He offered to do it in freestanding legislation. He was rebuffed. He offered to do it after the debate. He was rebuffed. In effect, they knew they had the best chance of defeating him if they could force him to offer an amendment to PNTR because then they could argue they were all for it in substance, but they did not dare let it pass as a procedural matter because the House then would have to deal again with PNTR. 
   I think this is the most cynical of strategies. I wish the issue had not come up in this way. I urge my colleagues at the appropriate time, in about 45 minutes, not to table the Thompson amendment. Give Senator THOMPSON an up-or-down vote on his amendment. It is the fair thing to do. It is the right thing to do and, from the standpoint of the responsibilities of all of us in this Chamber as Senators who have responsibility both for trade and for national security, the Thompson amendment is the right thing to support. 
   Thank you, Mr. President.

   Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   Mr. President, the point is that we are going to be considering PNTR for China, which will enable China to join the World Trade Organization within the week, and presumably that will be done in accordance with the bill passed by the House of Representatives. 
   It is important that we ensure the other party to this equation is taken care of because there don't appear to be any more roadblocks to the Senate's consideration of PNTR and China's entry into the body from a legislative perspective. But there could have been. 
   It is also important that Taiwan enter into the WTO. I believe virtually every Senator and every Member of the other body is committed to that. I know the administration is committed to that. But there could have been a roadblock to China's PNTR and WTO accession had we not clarified something with respect to Taiwan. 
   It has been agreed since 1993 that Taiwan would enter the WTO. It has been virtually ready to do so. But out of deference to China and to ensure China could enter first and then Taiwan second, Taiwan's entry has been delayed. But we believe neither China nor anyone else in the world would object to Taiwan's entry into the WTO, and indeed the working group that deals with the specifics of Taiwan's entry I think is in very good shape. 
   There has been a commitment by the administration to ensure that when the Senate and the House have approved PNTR for China, the United States can therefore move forward with China's accession and that we do so with respect to Taiwan as well. Unfortunately, however, since the House acted, there has been an unfortunate string of comments made by high Chinese officials that have cast some doubt on whether or not China would make good on its commitment to support Taiwan's accession into the WTO. 
   While the leaders of China had said they would support Taiwan's entry, they said it must be under terms provided by China. Specifically, that meant it had to be Taiwan entering the WTO as a province of China. That, of course, is contrary to the agreement that heretofore had been worked out, contrary to all the wishes of the members of the working study group and the United States, and of course Taiwan. 
   The administration has taken a firm position that they will not support that kind of language; that Taiwan must come in as a separate customs territory or separate trading territory and not as a province of China.  
   This has been enough of a matter of concern--these statements made by Chinese leaders--that we sought assurances from the administration and had meetings with administration officials to clarify. Specifically, a group of Senators met with Charlene Barshefsky to inquire about the status of the matter, particularly since Jiang Zemin is quoted as having made statements in New York a few days ago that China would only agree to Taiwan's entry under this term expressing Taiwan as a province of China.

   Mr. KYL. In conclusion, as I said in the beginning, I think this is good news for the Senate, for the House, for the administration, and for all friends of Taiwan and for those who believe both in permanent normal trade relations with China, as well as the entry into WTO of both China and Taiwan; certainly Taiwan entering in terms that are appropriate as a trading partner of the United States, as a separate customs territory and not as a province of China. 
   This is good news. I hope it portends an early conclusion to the discussions that will form the basis for accession by both China and Taiwan into WTO. I appreciate the cooperation, as I said, of my colleagues here as well as the representatives of the President and the President himself.

   Mr. KYL. I thank the Chair. 
   Madam President, I will be supporting the Thompson amendment and will explain why in a moment. But before the Senator from Montana leaves the floor, let me say that I am astonished that the Senator from Montana and others in his position have so little confidence in the underlying provision here that their view is that any amendment--the words of the Senator from Montana, ``any amendment''--would have to be opposed because it would jeopardize the passage of PNTR for China. I find that to be astounding. 
   This passed the House of Representatives by an overwhelming vote, by over 40 votes. It is supported very strongly by the Clinton-Gore administration. It is supported by the leadership, the minority and majority in both Houses. I am certain it will pass the Senate when it comes to a vote. 
   Given that, it seems to me quite strange, indeed, that any amendment that the Senate puts on this legislation will doom it to failure. Even amendments that arise from circumstances which occur after the House acted, I ask? For example, the representatives of the People's Republic of China, in their twice weekly briefings, have recently begun to insist on a condition to China's support for Taiwan's entry into the WTO. Taiwan, they say, must be admitted as a province of China rather than a separate customs territory, which is the way it has been negotiated among all of the countries involved. The wording is to the effect ``separate customs territory, China, Taipai'' I believe is the way it reads. Then there is the separate customs territory, Matsu, and I think two others. 
   Why is this important? It is a fact that has arisen after the House of Representatives acted. I am certain that everybody who voted for PNTR for China in the House of Representatives and everyone who supports it in the Senate, and I know the Clinton-Gore administration, all support the entry of Taiwan into the WTO as a separate customs territory. We do not support--President Clinton has sent me a letter confirming that he does not support--China's effort to redefine the circumstances under which Taiwan will enter into the WTO as the definition that China wants to make the political point that it believes Taiwan is strictly a province of China. 
   So this is a new fact. Now, are we to ignore this? Here China is asking us to grant them entry into WTO, and we are willing to do that. And China is saying: By the way, you are only going to get Taiwan's entry into WTO as we will define it, not as you all have already negotiated it. 
   The President of the United States and his Trade Representative, Ms. Barshefsky, have said no to the representatives of China, that is not correct. We will not go along with Taiwan's entry in that way. The Chinese continue to insist upon it. 
   Are we, the Senate, to ignore that development? Are we nothing but ciphers here to simply rubber stamp whatever the House of Representatives does? I don't think so. We have a constitutional responsibility, and to absolutely ignore it--in fact, to reject that responsibility, as Members of this body are apparently willing to do all in the name of getting this passed exactly as the House of Representatives did it, is to abdicate our responsibility. I think that is wrong. 
   As my colleagues know, the bill we are debating would grant permanent trade status to China. It is eventually going to pass and become law. Trade with China is an important issue, primarily due to the expansive nature of that country's economy and the desire of U.S. firms to participate in that economy. Trade alone doesn't define our relationship with China, as the present Presiding Officer made clear earlier, and as Senator THOMPSON made crystal clear in presenting his amendment. There are other troubling aspects to this, such as China's transfer of technology used to make ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction that I don't think can be ignored. 
   I am very pleased, therefore, that Senator THOMPSON has brought this amendment to the floor and that we are now debating it. I, too, would have preferred that it come up in a different context so that we could not have the argument raised against it--not on the merits, but for political reasons you don't dare support the Thompson amendment; otherwise, the bill will have to go back to the House of Representatives, and who knows what will happen. It might not pass. We would not be subjected to that argument if he could have raised the amendment as a freestanding bill. The supporters of PNTR would not permit him to bring it up as a freestanding bill. They knew they would have a better chance to defeat this if he had to propose it as an amendment to PNTR. But then they complain he is presenting it as an amendment to PNTR. 
   That is not an appropriate substantive position, it seems to me. It is clever from a parliamentary point of view, but I don't think it allows Senator THOMPSON to present the issue in the most dispassionate, objective, and appropriate way. We are now being relegated to the position that if this amendment passes, then PNTR is in jeopardy. Nobody wants that argument to be raised against them. 
   Let me make arguments which I think are on the merits. The Thompson amendment is meant to combat China's irresponsible trade in the sensitive technologies that I mentioned. In response to concerns expressed by the administration, the amendment has been revised to also cover the proliferation behavior of other countries, such as Russia, North Korea, and any other country that engages in this irresponsible behavior. 
   As a cosponsor, as I said, even though my comments will focus on cases of Chinese proliferation, as Senator THOMPSON has done, I also note that the administration's track record in 
   responding to Russia and North Korea and their proliferation is, frankly, similar to the response with respect to China. I will comment about the proliferation. Senator THOMPSON made this point earlier, and I will raise a couple of new points. 
   It is very clear that over the past decade China has been the world's worst proliferator of the technology used to develop and produce nuclear, chemical, and ballistic missiles, narrowly edging Russia and North Korea for this dubious distinction. Beijing has sold ballistic missile technology to Iran, North Korea, Syria, Libya, and Pakistan, at least. It has sold nuclear technology to Iran and Pakistan. It has aided Iran's chemical weapons program and sold that nation advanced cruise missiles. China's assistance has been vital to the weapons of mass destruction program in these countries. It is not a trivial matter. Because of that assistance, the American people, our forces, and our friends abroad face a much greater threat. 
   That is what this boils down to. We want trade with China, but we also want to ensure that China doesn't endanger the American people and our allies and forces deployed abroad by their proliferation of these weapons of mass destruction. Sadly, the efforts of the Clinton administration to end Beijing's proliferation have not succeeded. Since taking office in 1993, the administration has engaged in numerous discussions with Chinese officials concerning their failure to live up to international nonproliferation norms. But it has failed to impose sanctions on Chinese organizations and Government entities, as required by several U.S. laws. Time and time again, the Clinton administration has either refused to follow the laws requiring sanctions, or has done so in a way deliberately calculated to undermine the intent of the sanctions. 
   To understand the need for the Thompson amendment, it is instructive to examine a few of the cases of Chinese proliferation and the administration's response. 
   First, the transfer of the M-11 missiles to Pakistan. Since taking office, the Clinton administration has been faced with the issue of China's transfer of M-11 missiles and production technology to Pakistan. The M-11 is a modern, solid-fuel surface-to-surface missile that is more accurate, mobile, and easier to fire than the Scuds that were used in Iraq during the gulf war. For the past 7 years, the administration has ignored mounting evidence in this case and has either failed to impose sanctions altogether or has taken steps to limit their effect. One month prior to President Clinton's inauguration, the Los Angeles Times reported that China had delivered about two dozen M-11s to Pakistan, breaking its pledge to the United States to abide by the  Missile Technology Control Regime, the MTCR. 
   The MTCR is a voluntary arrangement under which the 32 member nations agree to restrict exports of ballistic missiles capable of carrying a payload of at least 500 kilograms to a range of 300 kilometers, as well as key missile components and technology to nonmembers of the regime. While the MTCR does not have an enforcement provision, U.S. law requires sanctions to be imposed on nations that transfer technology regulated by this agreement. There are two categories. Category I of the MTCR covers transfers of complete missile systems, such as missile stages and some production equipment. Category II regulates transfers of specific missile components and dual-use goods used 
   to produce missiles. 
   In August of 1993, the Clinton administration imposed sanctions on Pakistan's Ministry of Defense and 11 Chinese defense and aerospace entities for violations of category II of the MTCR. Shortly after the imposition of the sanctions, the Washington Times quoted State Department and intelligence sources as saying that despite ``......overwhelming intelligence evidence that China in November of 1992 shipped Pakistan key components of its M-11 missile''--an MTCR category I violation--Secretary of State Warren Christopher decided China had only committed a category II violation and imposed the mildest form of sanctions possible. Under Secretary of State Lynn Davis defended the decision, saying the U.S. did not have conclusive evidence Pakistan had received complete M-11s. 
   In October 1994, the Clinton administration waived these sanctions in return for another Chinese promise not to export ``ground-to-ground missiles'' covered by the MTCR, and for China's reaffirmation to the ``guidelines and parameters'' of the MTCR. 
   Since the waiver, despite a steady stream of press reports, congressional testimony, and unclassified reports by the intelligence community that have described China's continued missile assistance to Pakistan, the Clinton administration has not imposed sanctions as required by law. 
   For example, in 1995, the Washington Post reported that satellite reconnaissance photos, intercepted communications, and human intelligence reports indicated Pakistan had indeed acquired M-11s. The M-11s were reportedly stored at Pakistan's Sargodha Air Force Base where the Pakistani military has constructed storage facilities for the missiles and mobile launchers, as well as related maintenance facilities and housing for the launch crews. Soldiers have reportedly been sighted practicing launches with advice from visiting Chinese experts. 
   The Washington Post also reported in June of 1996 that all U.S. intelligence agencies believe with ``high confidence'' that Pakistan has obtained M-11 missiles and that Islamabad had probably finished developing nuclear warheads for them. An August 1996 article in that newspaper further disclosed that a national intelligence estimate, which represents the consensus judgments of U.S. intelligence agencies, concluded Pakistan was capable of an M-11 launch within 48 hours. It also confirmed Pakistan was constructing a factory to produce M-11s from Chinese-supplied blueprints and equipment. 
   In addition, an unclassified National Intelligence Estimate titled Foreign Missile Developments and the Ballistic Missile Threat to the United States Through 2015 published in September 1999, states, ``Pakistan has Chinese-supplied M-11 short-range ballistic missiles.'' And lest anyone believe Chinese missile assistance to Pakistan has ceased, on July 2nd of this year, the New York Times reported that ``China [has] stepped up the shipment of specialty steels, guidance systems and technical expertise to Pakistan *.*.* Chinese experts have also been sighted around Pakistan's newest missile factory, which appears to be partly based on a Chinese design, and shipments to Pakistan have been continued over the past 8 to 18 months. *.*.*'' 
   According to the Washington Times, evidence of the M-11 sale also includes photographs of missile canisters in Pakistan and electronic intercepts regarding payments by Pakistan to China for the missiles. Yet despite this evidence, the administration has not imposed the sanctions required under U.S. law. 
   As Assistant Secretary of State for Nonproliferation Robert Einhorn said in Senate testimony in 1997, sanctions have not been invoked on China for the sale of M-11's to Pakistan ``*.*.* because our level of confidence is not sufficient to take a decision that has very far-reaching consequences.'' But the administration appears to have purposely set a standard of evidence so high that it is unattainable. As Gary Milhollin, Director of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control, testified to the Senate in 1997, ``I think the State Department just continues to raise the level over which you have to jump higher and higher as the evidence comes in so that sanctions will never have to be applied and the engagement policy can simply be continued. The effect is to really nullify the act of Congress that imposes sanctions, because unless the State Department is willing to go forward in good faith and complete the administrative process, then the law cannot take any effect.'' 
   Another area where the administration has not lived up to its legal obligations concerns the sale of advanced Chinese C-802 anti-ship cruise missiles to Iran. These missiles pose a grave threat to U.S. forces operating in the crowded Persian Gulf. I would remind my colleagues of one example of this danger; in 1987, a similar Exocet cruise missile killed 37 sailors on the U.S.S. Stark. 
   Of course, parenthetically, when these events occur, everyone in the Congress and all of the pundits and a lot of American people say: Who are the people in charge? What are they doing? When did they know? What did they know? Why aren't they doing something to protect our soldiers and sailors and our folks deployed abroad? Why aren't they doing something? 
   The next time Americans are killed by a missile, the technology for which came from China, I am going to answer that question. I am going to say I stood on the floor of the Senate when we were debating PNTR and begged all of you to support an amendment which would at least allow us to impose sanctions on China when it engages in proliferation, and you wouldn't. No, no. PNTR with China is far more important than protecting American sailors or American soldiers or American citizens abroad. God forbid that time should come. I will be here again reminding my colleagues of what they are failing to do today to protect against the threat which probably will have an adverse impact on America in the future. 
   Continuing on about the Iranian issue, it is very interesting. 
   Iran's possession of this missile was first disclosed in January 1996 by Vice Admiral Scott Redd, then-commander of the U.S. Fifth Fleet. Admiral Redd said the C-802 gave the Iranian military increased firepower and represented a new dimension to the threat faced by the U.S. Navy, stating, ``It used to be we just had to worry about land-based cruise missiles. Now they have the potential to have that throughout the Gulf mounted on ships.'' In addition, Secretary of Defense Cohen has said that Iran has tested an air-launched version of the anti-ship cruise missile. 
   According to the Washington Times, in 1995, Defense Department officials recommended declaring that China had violated the Gore-McCain Iran-Iraq Arms Nonproliferation Act of 1992, which requires sanctions for the transfer to either country of ``..... destabilizing numbers and types of advanced conventional weapons. .....'' Yet State Department officials opposed invoking sanctions to avoid damaging relations with China. 
   In his Senate testimony in 1997, Assistant Secretary of State Einhorn acknowledged the transaction, stating, ``......the question of whether China transferred the C-802 anti-ship cruise missiles to Iran is not in doubt.'' He noted that ``Such missiles increase China's maritime advantage over other Gulf states, they put commercial shipping at risk, and they pose a new threat to U.S. forces operating in the region.'' But Mr. Einhorn maintained that the transfer was not ``destabilizing'' and thus did not meet the legal requirement for sanctions to be imposed. 
   Such thinking illustrates how the Clinton administration has refused to  implement nonproliferation laws. If the arrival of weapons which directly threaten the U.S. Navy is not ``destabilizing,'' it is hard to imagine what the administration might find sufficiently destabilizing for sanctions under the Gore-McCain Iran-Iraq Arms Nonproliferation Act. 
   The Senate has specifically addressed the issue of Chinese cruise missile sales. In June 1997, we passed an amendment offered by Senator BENNETT by a vote of 96 to 0, stating: ``The delivery of cruise missiles to Iran is a violation of the Iran-Iraq Arms Nonproliferation Act of 1992. It is the sense of the Senate to urge the Clinton administration to enforce the provisions of the [Act] with respect to the acquisition by Iran of C-802 model cruise missiles.'' Despite this unanimous expression by the Senate of the need to enforce the law, the administration has refused to take action in this case. 
   I note, parenthetically, that is the reason Senator THOMPSON is forced to come to the floor and offer this amendment. Time after time after time, we have said to the administration: Enforce the law that exists--the act I just spoke of, and others--and it won't be necessary to take action such as this. But when, time after time, existing laws are ignored or are enforced in ways that undercut their intent, eventually, if you are serious about the defense of the United States, you have to take action. 
   That is what has forced Senator THOMPSON to bring this issue to a head now at the moment when we are considering PNTR for China. 
   There have been several instances of Chinese proliferation where the administration has not invoked sanctions as required by law. 
   According to press reports, China has sold Iran ballistic missile guidance components, test equipment, computerized machine tools used to manufacture missiles, and telemetry equipment which sends and collects missile guidance data during flight tests. 
   Earlier this year, the Washington Times disclosed that China is assisting Libya's missile program. According to the Times, China's premier training center for missile scientists and technicians is training Libyan missile specialists; the director of Libya's Al-Fatah missile program was planning to visit China; and Beijing is building a hypersonic wind tunnel in Libya used to design rockets and simulate missile flight. 
   China has reportedly supplied missile guidance components and specialty steel to North Korea. This January, the CIA's semi-annual report to Congress on the proliferation of ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction indicated that China has aided Syria's liquid-fuel ballistic missile program. 
   And yet despite this evidence, the Clinton administration has not completed the necessary findings and imposed sanctions as required by law in any of these cases. 
   On rare occasions, the Clinton administration has obeyed sanctions requirements in laws, but only symbolically, thereby undermining the effectiveness of the action. For example, in May 1997, it sanctioned two Chinese companies, five Chinese executives, and a Hong Kong firm for knowingly assisting Iran's chemical weapons program. The companies and executives were banned from trading with the United States for one year, pursuant to the Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act of 1991. 
   Because the sanctions were not applied to the Chinese government, but only to a handful of Chinese individuals and companies, while they met the bare requirements of the law their impact was minimal. As the Washington Post reported ``The sanctions announced yesterday will have minimal economic effect on China, officials said, because they are aimed at individuals and companies that do little business with this country.'' 
   Secretary of State Albright defended the administration's decision not to sanction the Chinese government, stating that the United States had ``..... no evidence that the Chinese government was involved'' in the chemical sales to Iran. But other administration officials acknowledge that the U.S. has raised concerns about chemical weapons-related sales to Iran with Beijing on numerous occasions. China's government may or may not have approved the sales, but government officials in Beijing clearly knew of the transfers, if only because of the concerns expressed by U.S. officials. 
   We should not allow China's Government to take a ``see no evil, hear no evil'' approach to proliferation. 
   Finally, let me point out when the Clinton administration has levied modest sanctions, they have had some success in curbing Chinese proliferation. While the China's nuclear proliferation behavior seems to have improved in response to U.S. sanctions, it has not been trouble free. Some nuclear assistance to Pakistan may be continuing. 
   The CIA report from January 21 also states that our intelligence agencies cannot preclude ongoing contacts between Chinese and Pakistani nuclear organizations. In addition, in May of this year, the Washington Times disclosed that sales of U.S. nuclear reactors to China have been held up because China has refused to provide the necessary assurances that it will not re-export U.S. nuclear technology to other countries. The administration has correctly refused to approve 16 export licenses from American firms until China provides these assurances. My point in discussing China's response to even mild sanctions imposed by the U.S. in these particular cases is to illustrate that economic sanctions have altered China's proliferation behavior in the past. They can do so in the future, if we are serious. 
   I am not satisfied that even in this particular area the Clinton administration has lived up to the requirements of the law. The 1994 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act requires additional sanctions beyond the suspension of Export-Import Bank loans by the Clinton administration in the ring magnet case. I referred to Assistant Secretary of State for Nonproliferation Robert Einhorn, who explained in Senate testimony that the administration avoided this legal requirement by claiming that it lacked proof that China's senior most leaders had approved the ring magnet sale and that the transaction, therefore, did not constitute ``a willful aiding or abetting of Pakistan's unsafeguarded nuclear program by the Government of China.'' 
   This is a flawed argument, of course, because the Chinese company involved, the China Nuclear Energy Industry Corporation, is owned by the Chinese Government. Most companies owned by the Chinese Government can't act in China without the knowledge of the Government. In fact, most people in China can't act without the knowledge of the Chinese Government. 
   As Professor Gary Milhollin, Director of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control explained,  
   These [ring magnets] are specialized items. We are not talking about dual-use equipment. We are talking about magnets that are made specifically to go into centrifuges that make enriched uranium for bombs. Those were sold by an arm of the China National Nuclear Corporation, which is an arm of the Chinese government. This was a sale by a Chinese government organization directly to a secret nuclear weapon-making facility in Pakistan of items that were specifically designed to help make nuclear weapon material. In my opinion, it violated China's pledge under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which China signed in 1992. The treaty says if you export something like that, you have to export it with international inspection. China did not.  
   Under Secretary of State Lynn Davis made a similar assessment in testimony to the House International Relations Committee in 1996, saying China's ring magnet sale was ``......not consistent with their obligations as a party to the Nonproliferation Treaty.'' 
   It is clear that time and time again the Clinton administration has not lived up to its legal obligations under several U.S. laws requiring sanctions to combat the proliferation of ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction. In some very revealing remarks in 1998, President Clinton explained his administration's record in this area. In what it described as ``. . . unusually frank remarks during an appearance before a group of 60 evangelical Christian leaders at the White House,'' the New York Times reported on April 28, 1998 that ``President Clinton criticized laws today that automatically impose sanctions on countries for behavior that Americans find unacceptable. He said such legislation put pressure on the executive branch to `fudge,' or overlook, violations so that it would not have to carry out the sanctions.'' 
   What the President acknowledged is only what many, many people in the  know have been saying for a long time; namely, that the relationship with China has gotten to be so important to this administration that it is willing to ``fudge'' the requirements of U.S. law to impose sanctions because they would get in the way of this budding relationship between President Clinton and the People's Republic of China. 
   According to the New York Times, in response to criticism that his administration has ``ignor[ed] or excus[ed] obvious violations of United States sanction laws to justify continuing to do business with certain countries,'' President Clinton said, ``What happens if you have automatic sanctions legislation is it puts enormous pressure on whoever is in the executive branch to fudge an evaluation of the facts of what is going on.'' 
   It might put enormous pressure on the President of the United States to follow the law. When repeatedly he hasn't done so, a Senate that is worth its salt will stand up and finally do what Senator THOMPSON has done and say: Enough of this. The U.S. Government has got to see to it that our national security needs are protected, at least if we are going now to grant PNTR, permanent trading relations with China, and grant its admission to the World Trade Organization, thus precluding us from a whole series of unilateral actions that otherwise we could have taken. When you are in the WTO, you abide by its rules. You can't just willy-nilly be imposing sanctions on countries; otherwise, you will be held accountable under the WTO. 
   Fortunately, the way Senator THOMPSON has drafted his amendment, the President of the United States would be able, under limited circumstances, to impose sanctions based upon national security requirements, and he would also incidentally have the ability to waive those requirements in the national security interest. He is not bound to do anything that he shouldn't do. 
   One wonders, however, if a President is suggesting that he needs to ``fudge'' the requirements of the law in order to maintain this great relationship with China, what even the requirements of the Thompson amendment would do. Fortunately, he has accounted for that possibility by also requiring a report of the President to the Congress of why he didn't impose sanctions, if he didn't, and requiring some specificity so we will at least understand what is at stake and whether or not the President should have imposed sanctions so that we might at least take some other steps. 
   Senator LEVIN, incidentally, summarized the view of many when he said the examination of China's proliferation record at a 1997 Senate hearing had shed light on ``an area where I think we have not lived up fully to our own domestic requirements in terms of the imposition of sanctions where evidence is plenty clear, or clear enough for me, at least.'' 
   Senator STEVENS made a similar point during the same Senate hearing in 1997, stating, ``I am coming to the conclusion that maybe the administration is so narrowly interpreting our laws that we would have the situation that if a country moved a missile or a poison gas or bacterial warfare system piece by piece, grain by grain, you could not do anything about it until all the grains were there and then it would be a fait accompli.'' 
   The Thompson amendment would significantly improve the current situation. It would require an annual report to Congress on the people, organizations, and countries on which our government has credible information indicating they have been engaged in the proliferation of nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons or ballistic or cruise missiles. This requirement for full disclosure should eliminate the ability of the Clinton administration or those of future administration's to ``fudge'' the facts. They use the President's words. It should greatly improve the ability of the Congress to exercise effective oversight over this and future administrations. 
   Second, it will send a clear signal to organizations in China and other nations, such as Russia and North Korea, that if they engage in proliferation, sanctions will surely follow. As I mentioned earlier, sanctions have been one of the foreign policy tools that have moderated China's behavior. When our Government has been serious about effective change in China and has been willing to use sanctions, we have seen results. Perhaps had the administration been more willing to implement the laws in this area and used sanctions more frequently, we would have seen less proliferation of these extraordinarily lethal technologies to rogue nations. 
   Finally, I point out the amendment contains a waiver provision, as I said before, which allows the President to waive the requirement for sanctions under the legislation if it is important to the national security of the United States not to apply these provisions. 
   So there is no reason for anyone to suggest that this amendment is a poison pill; that it would somehow tie the President's hands; or that it should not be adopted because it would jeopardize the passage of PNTR or the future security of the United States. 
   Madam President, sanctions should not be the first or only tool used in the fight against proliferation. But this tool should not grow rusty from disuse either. As the Washington Post noted in an editorial as recently as July 14 of this year:  
   ......China's continuing assistance to Pakistan's weapons program in the face of so many U.S. efforts to talk Beijing out of it shows the limits of a nonconfrontational approach.  
   The United States must back our frequent expressions of concern with actions if our words are to be perceived by China and other proliferators as credible. We must enforce our own laws if we are to be successful in persuading other nations to live up to their international commitments in treaties and other international agreements. And we need to be realistic in our dealings with nations such as China, Russia, and North Korea. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the Thompson amendment. It is an amendment which will help to guarantee the national security interests of the United States. It will do nothing to impede trade or otherwise interfere with the operation of the WTO or the passage of the PNTR. 
   Therefore, Madam President, as I said, I urge my colleagues to support the Thompson amendment.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, in recent days, there have been some disturbing moves by China to block Taiwan's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO), despite China's previous assurances to the United States that it would not do so. As recently as Thursday, September 7, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi said that China wanted its claim to sovereignty over Taiwan written into the terms of the WTO's rules, stating ``The Chinese side has a consistent and clear position: Taiwan can join WTO as a separate customs territory of China.''
   This statement by China's Foreign Ministry spokesman comes on the heels of earlier efforts by China to block Taiwan's WTO entry. As the Wall Street Journal reported in July:
   ``..... as WTO staff members draw up the so-called protocol agreements--the reams of paper that define exactly what concessions China will make in order to gain entry into the organization--China is insisting that its claim over Taiwan be recognized in the legal language ..... chief Chinese negotiator Long Yongtu said ..... such a stand ``is a matter of principle for us'' ..... That would upset a consensus within the WTO that Taiwan should be allowed to enter the club as a separate economic area--that is, not an independent country, but also not as an explicit part of China. Some WTO members have argued that Taiwan has long since fulfilled its requirements to join the club and its application has been held up only to satisfy China's demand that Taiwan shouldn't win entry to the organization first.
   In order to help ensure that China lives up to its promises to the United States, and that Taiwan's entry to the WTO is not unnecessarily impeded, today I am filing an amendment to H.R. 4444, the bill to provide permanent normal trade status to China. The current text of H.R. 4444 states that the extension of permanent normal trade relations to China ``shall become effective no earlier than the effective date of the accession of the People's Republic of China to the World Trade Organization.'' My amendment would add one additional condition, stating that permanent normal trade relations with China ``shall become effective no earlier than the effective date of the accession of the People's Republic of China and Taiwan as separate customs territories to the World Trade Organization.''
   My amendment reinforces the message the Clinton administration has sent to China on previous occasions, and it is my hope that this amendment will remove any ambiguity about America's resolve to support Taiwan's WTO admission. Earlier this week, I received a letter from President Clinton that responded to a letter I sent him in July along with 30 other Senators, that sought assurances that his administration remained committed to Taiwan's entry to the WTO. In the letter the President stated that, ``My administration remains firmly committed to the goal of WTO General Council approval of the accession packages for China and Taiwan at the same session.'' The President's letter went on to say that ``China has made clear on many occasions, and at high levels, that it will not oppose Taiwan's accession to the WTO.
   As the President acknowledged in the letter, despite previous assurances by China and the administration that Taiwan will be admitted to the WTO without opposition, under the surface there is a problem. As it always does, China is using yet another diplomatic opportunity to assert its view that Taiwan is nothing more than a province of China.
   It is important for the Congress and the administration to work together to support Taiwan's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO). First because of the economic benefits that its entry would bring. Secondly, because of the need to meet our commitments to our close and longstanding ally. And third, due to our desire to defend and promote democratic governments, with free markets, that respect the rule of law and the human rights of their people.
   Based on its importance to the world economy, Taiwan should be admitted to the WTO. It has the 19th largest economy and is the 14th largest trading nation in the world. Taiwan's economy is also closely linked to the U.S. It is America's 8th largest trading partner and purchases more American goods than many of our other major trading partners, like mainland China, Australia, and Italy. U.S. trade with Taiwan should continue to grow. Over two years ago, we signed a bilateral WTO agreement with Taiwan that included significant reduction in tariffs and other barriers for exports of a variety of U.S. goods and services, including agriculture goods, automotive products, and pharmaceuticals. The admission of Taiwan to the WTO ensures that market barriers to U.S. products will remain low and American companies will have a means to solve disputes over intellectual property and other matters.
   Taiwan has been negotiating to become a member of the WTO since 1990 and has met the substantive conditions for membership. According to the Congressional Research Service, it has completed agreements with each of the 26 WTO members that requested bilateral negotiations, and has held 10 meetings with the WTO Working Party in Geneva, resolving all substantive issues surrounding its admission.
   China has insisted that Taiwan can get into the WTO only after it does,  and has lobbied other countries to support this position. In the past, Clinton administration officials have assured us that Taiwan's accession would closely follow China's. In February, U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky testified to the House of Representatives that ``..... the only issue with respect to Taiwan's accession ..... pertains to timing ..... there is a tacit understanding ..... among WTO members in general--but also, frankly, between China and Taiwan--that China would enter first and China would not block in any way Taiwan's accession thereafter, and that might be immediately thereafter or within days or hours or seconds or weeks. .....'' Later that same month, in response to a statement by Senator ROTH that ``..... there's a great deal of concern that Taiwan might be blocked [from entering the WTO] once China secures such membership,'' Ambassador Barshefsky testified that ``..... the United States would do everything in our power to ensure that that does not happen in any respect because Taiwan's entry is also critical.''
   The WTO plays an important role in promoting free and fair trade. Under the WTO, member countries agree on a set of rules and principles for trade, which in turn creates a stable and predictable trade environment. Secondly, the WTO provides a mechanism to enforce these rules, including a procedure for countries to resolve trade disputes. And finally, the WTO provides a forum for negotiations to reduce trade barriers worldwide.
   Since the founding of its predecessor GATT in 1984, membership in the organization has grown from 23 countries to 136 today. The general view among economist is that a more predictable trade environment, and a reduction of trade barriers, has contributed to the unprecedented economic prosperity that most countries currently enjoy. Statistics support this view: In 1998, world exports were 18 times larger than in 1950, and world GDP was 6 times greater in 1998 than 1950, according to the Congressional Research Service.
   As I mentioned earlier, the United States should support Taiwan's admission to the WTO, not merely for economic reasons, but also to honor our commitments to a close, long-standing ally, and to demonstrate our intention to support democracies that respect the rule of law.
   When our Nation switched diplomatic recognition to mainland China, we also enacted the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act to state our continued commitment to the security of Taiwan. This law states, ``......the United States decision to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China rests upon the expectation that the future of Taiwan will be determined by peaceful means.'' It goes on to say the U.S. would ``......consider any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means, including by boycotts or embargoes, a threat to the peace and security of the Western Pacific area and of grave concern to the United States.'' And finally, it says the U.S. will sell ``......defense articles and defense services in such quantity as many be necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defense capability.''
   China's leaders have steadfastly refused to renounce the use of force in retaking Taiwan, and have issued thinly veiled threats to use nuclear weapons should the U.S. intervene. For example, in March, the main newspaper of China's military said, ``China is neither Iraq nor Yugoslavia, but a very special country.......it is a country that has certain abilities of launching a strategic counterattack and the capacity of launching a long-distance strike. Probably it is not a wise move to be at war with a country like China, a point which U.S. policymakers know fairly well.'' Another article in a Chinese military-owned newspaper went further, saying, ``The United States will not sacrifice 200 million Americans for 20 million Taiwanese. They will finally acknowledge the difficulty and withdraw.''
   In outlining what became known as the ``Truman Doctrine,'' President Harry Truman said:
   At the present moment in world history nearly every nation must choose between alternative ways of life. The choice is too often not a free one. One way of life is based upon the will of the majority, and is distinguished by free institutions, representative government, free elections, guarantees of individual liberty, freedom of speech and religion, and freedom from political oppression. The second way of life is based upon the will of a minority forcibly imposed upon the majority. It relies upon terror and oppression, a controlled press and radio, fixed elections, and the suppression of personal freedoms. I believe that is must be the policy of the United States to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or outside pressures. I believe that we must assist free peoples to work out their own destinies in their own way.
   Harry Truman spoke these words in 1947, at a time when it was very difficult to stand up to communism on the march from the Soviet Union. The challenge we face today in dealing with China and Taiwan should not be as great as the courageous struggle for the cold war. The United States cannot support China's entry into the WTO without equally supporting Taiwan's entry into the WTO. This is but one of many signals we should be sending to the communist regime in Beijing, about America's determination to meet our commitments and our resolve to support Taiwan.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the National Ignition Facility (NIF) is a major part of the Stockpile Stewardship Program, which is a set of programs and facilities that are designed to allow the United States to maintain the safety and reliability of our nation's vital nuclear deterrent. 
   It is hoped that at some point in 10 to 20 years that the stockpile Stewardship Program can be a replacement for actual nuclear testing. The jury is still out on whether it can in fact eventually accomplish this goal. I support the Stockpile Stewardship Program because it will improve our knowledge about our nuclear weapons. The fact is that, despite our technical expertise, there is much we still do not understand about our own nuclear weapons. As C. Paul Robinson, Director of the Sandia National Laboratory has said, ``Some aspects of nuclear explosive design are still not understood at the level of physical principles.'' 
   America's nuclear weapons are the most sophisticated in the world. Each one typically has thousands of parts, and over time the nuclear materials and high explosive triggers in our weapons deteriorate and we lack experience predicting the effects of these changes. Some of the materials used in our weapons, like plutonium, enriched uranium, and tritium, are radioactive materials that decay, and as they decay they also change the properties of other materials within the weapon. We lack experience predicting the effects of such aging on the safety and reliability of our weapons. We did not design our weapons to last forever. The shelf life of our weapons was expected to be about 20 years. In the past, we did not encounter problems with aging weapons, because we were fielding new designs and older designs were retired. 
   As the Department of Energy said in its review of the Stockpile Stewardship Program completed on November 23, 1999, ``The NIF is one of the most vital facilities in the stockpile stewardship program.'' This facility at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California is roughly the same size as a stadium, and is designed to produce the intense pressures and temperatures needed to simulate in a laboratory the thermonuclear conditions achieved in nuclear explosions. The NIF will accomplish this goal by focusing 192 laser beams on a ``dime-sized'' piece of plutonium. When completed, the NIF will be the world's most powerful laser facility, about 60 times more powerful than the next largest DOE laser facility, the NOVA laser. 
   As a review conducted in 1994 by the so-called, JASON panel, a Defense Department panel of nuclear experts said ``The NIF is without question the most scientifically valuable of the programs proposed for the Science Based Stockpile Stewardship program, particularly in regard to research and `proof-of-principle' for ignition, but also more generally for fundamental science. As such, it will promote the goal of sustaining a high-quality group of scientists with expertise related to the nuclear weapons program.'' 
   There is a consensus among the three national laboratories and at the National Nuclear Security Administration that additional funding above the level in the current version of the Energy and Water Appropriations bill for the NIF program needs to be increased. In a joint statement dated September 6, 2000, Dr. Bruce Tarter, the Director of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Dr. John Browne, the Director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory, Dr. Paul Robinson, the Director of Sandia National Laboratory, and Madelyn Creedon, the Deputy Administrator for Defense Programs at the National Nuclear Security Administration stated.  
   NIF supports the SSP, and is a vital element of the SSP in three important ways: (1) the experimental study of issues of aging or refurbishment; (2) weapons science and code development; and (3) attracting and training the exceptional scientific and technical talent required to sustain the SSP over the long term. NIF is an integral part of the SSP providing unique experimental capabilities that complement other SSP facilities including hydrotests, pulsed power, and advanced radiography. NIF addresses aspects of the relevant science of materials that cannot be reached in other facilities. 
   We concur that the NIF offers a unique, critical capability within a ``balanced'' SSP. As with other elements of the SSP, its long-term role must be integrated within the overall requirements of the Program. Options should not be foreclosed or limited but should be maintained to allow for its further development. At this critical juncture, we agree that in order to maintain the NIF within a balanced program, an additional $95 million [above the President's original budget request] is necessary in FY 2001 for the NIF Project.  
   The NIF program has recently experienced delays and cost overruns. But new management for the program is in place. The facility has undergone and passed intensive scientific and programmatic reviews that were recently conducted. And the management problems and lack of oversight that led to the earlier delays and cost overruns are understood and should therefore be preventable. 
   We are well along toward completion of the NIF facility. Construction of the facility to house the laser beams, a $260 million project itself, is about 90% complete. 80% of the large components for the infrastructure for the laser beams has been procured and is either on site or on the way. The NIF program at Lawrence Livermore Lab has 800 scientists and technicians on the project. Delaying the program, which would result in a standing army of technicians, or canceling it, which would prevent the achievement of the goals of the Stockpile Stewardship Program simply makes no sense. 
   There is bipartisan support for this program and the Administration supports the program. Undersecretary of State John Holum said in a letter on June 12, 2000 that, ``I strongly support this essential national security program. We must avoid the complacency of not doing enough in stewardship. We need to make a long-term commitment to use our scientific prowess to maintain a safe and reliable stockpile of nuclear weapons. ..... The problems with NIF are not scientific. ..... I urge you to support the program.'' 
   The NIF is essential to our Stockpile Stewardship Program, which itself is an essential to maintain our nuclear weapons.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I appreciate Senator DOMENICI yielding some time to me. 
   I think, while we have accepted this amendment, it is important that the RECORD be corrected because Senator HARKIN said some things that I believe not to be correct. 
   I also think that we need to be careful about how we act around here. 
   The fact that some people made some estimates as to how much it was going to cost to construct the National Ignition Facility and in fact were greatly underestimating the cost of the facility should not be a reason for us to suggest that this facility is unnecessary. They suggest that it is a ``boondoggle,'' to use the word of the Senator from Iowa. They suggest that it is in the same category of some other discretionary projects which we end up not funding in Congress. In fact, the Senator from Iowa and others recognized its importance in their support for the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty when they argued that we didn't need testing any more because we were going to have this wonderful Stockpile Stewardship Program, a part of which is the ignition facility, and, therefore, they were willing to rely upon the Stockpile Stewardship Program and the National Ignition Facility in lieu of testing forevermore. We are going to give up testing forevermore, Senator HARKIN and others who supported the test ban treaty said. 
   Now they are saying: Well, actually we don't need the National Ignition Facility, in our opinion. We are willing to submit the question of whether it is needed to some extraneous body. 
   But I will tell you that I visited with the head of the Lawrence Livermore Lab yesterday, and I talked to any number of Department of Defense and Department of Energy officials, as well as lab people, and every one of them will confirm that the National Ignition Facility is a critical component of the Stockpile Stewardship Program. Without it, eventually the Stockpile Stewardship Program provides you nothing in terms of data. And, indeed, our National Laboratories would probably not be able to certificate the stockpile of the United States, which, of course, would require advertising--something I know the Senator from Iowa would not want. 
   The National Ignition Facility is a key component of the Stockpile Stewardship Program because it will actually allow an event to occur that simulates a nuclear explosion. Calculations can then occur based upon that event to either confirm or deny the theory that the scientists have developed that they plugged into the computers. 
   But there is a point at which you can run all the calculations you want. Unless you have something to compare them to, some real event, they are worthless or meaningless. 
   That is why the ignition facility is so important. Even though it is a little miniature thing--it is not like a big nuclear explosion--it can provide them with the data they need to then validate the theories of the Stockpile Stewardship Program which they have run on their computers. 
   The argument of the Senator from Iowa, it seems to me, is a little bit like this: He loans the family car out to his son for a date. He says: Be careful, son. Be in by midnight. The son comes back at midnight: Gee, dad. I am sorry, I wrecked the car. The dad says: It is such a horrible thing you did that we are not going to repair the car. You are cutting off 
   your nose to spite your face. 
   It is true that the cost of this program has gone up. I believe it has gone up because of mistakes that were made on the part of the laboratory in deciding how much this was going to cost. 
   It is easy for us to stand up and criticize it and say you all made a mistake. That is easy to do. I will join my colleague in that criticism. But what do you do about it? Do you decide you are not going to go ahead with the facility that all of the experts say is critical because it is going to cost more? That is true. But it is still critical. You  can't just say because it is going to cost more than we thought that we are just going to give up on the whole project. At least you can't advocate the Stockpile Stewardship Program, as I know my colleague from Iowa is. 
   I want to make this point, even though this amendment is going to be accepted. I am hopeful and I presume that it will not be a part of the final legislation that goes to the President for his signature. It would be wrong to cap the funding on this, and it would be wrong to assume that the National Ignition Facility is not a critical part of the Stockpile Stewardship Program. 
   I want to be able to correct the record so we don't leave any misimpression that somehow this is a discretionary program, that we may not need it, and because it is going to cost somewhat more than we thought, therefore we should be willing to jettison it. 
   It is a critical component to ensure the viability, the reliability, and the safety of our nuclear stockpile. I assume every one of us in this room is very firmly committed to the proposition that the nuclear stockpile of the United States must be safe and reliable, and if it takes this National Ignition Facility to ensure that, then we ought to be willing to support it even if it is going to cost a little bit more than we originally anticipated. 
   I appreciate the strong work of the Senator from New Mexico on this, and his willingness to yield me this time.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, as you know, President Clinton recently announced that he would further delay deployment of a national missile defense system to protect the United States. Regrettably, although the President's decision was disappointing, it was not surprising given the track record of the Clinton-Gore administration. In fact, when one looks back over the past 8 years it is clear that this latest decision is merely the capstone to a string of poor decisions by this administration that have left us defenseless against a growing threat to America's security. 
   Time after time, the administration has taken steps to delay development of a system to defend against a missile threat that the Rumsfeld Commission, our intelligence agencies, and the Defense Department have said is increasingly serious. The administration has failed to pursue development of promising missile defense technologies, such as sea- and space-based defenses, has underfunded the limited programs it has authorized, and has pursued misguided arms control policies. 
   This week, Senator THAD COCHRAN released a report entitled ``Stubborn Things'' that chronicles the record of neglect by this administration toward missile defense. The report contains ten chapters, corresponding to each year over the past decade. Each chapter includes a chronological recitation of events relevant to ballistic missile defense, including the progression of the missile threat facing the United States, developments in arms control negotiations, as well as data on the level of funding devoted to these vital programs. 
   Senator COCHRAN named the report after a quote from John Adams, who said in 1770:  
   Facts are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passions, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence.  
   True to the spirit of John Adams' admonition, Senator COCHRAN'S report simply lays out fact after fact about what has transpired in the area of missile defense over the past decade. It is an excellent compilation of the events and decisions that have led us to our current situation. 
   For example, after the President announced that he would not authorize deployment of a national missile defense system, administration officials said the President had reached this decision in part because development of a booster for the ground-based system has lagged. But as Senator COCHRAN'S report points out, this is a legacy of one of his administration's first decisions after taking office. In February 1993, the administration returned unopened proposals by three teams of companies that had bid, at the request of the Defense Department, to develop a ground-based national missile defense interceptor. 
   The track record of the Clinton-Gore administration on missile defense is clear: they were slow to recognize the threat, failed to pursue the most promising forms of defense, underfunded the limited programs they half-heartedly pursued, and have failed to exercise leadership in addressing the concerns of our allies and other nations like Russia. 
   Senator COCHRAN and his able staff, Mitch Kugler, Dennis Ward, Dennis McDowell, Michael Loesch, Eric Desautels, Brad Sweet, and Julie Sander, are to be commended for producing this excellent report. By presenting the facts without rhetoric or spin they have significantly advanced the national debate on this important issue. I highly commend the report to my colleagues and to members of the public interested in this subject.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Idaho for bringing the attention to this issue to the Senate floor, to our colleagues here, as well as to people around the country. To my colleague from New Mexico with whom I have been visiting about this matter for 5 or 6 years now, a real thanks for his efforts to bring a $240 million supplemental appropriation which will only begin to scratch the surface of the needs we have. Half of that money goes to the Department of Agriculture's U.S. Forest Service and the other half goes to the Department of the Interior for the BLM because in our public forests today we have them spread both in the National Forest System, as well as the Department of the Interior-administered lands of the BLM. Arizona and New Mexico have the largest pine forests in the world. 
   Senator CRAIG pointed out that we have done some pioneering here. For the last decade or so, Northern Arizona University's School of Forestry has been working on techniques to return the forest to the rather parklike, very natural condition that it was in at the turn of the century, 100 years ago, when you had very broad stretches of grassland with few trees per acre--maybe 100 trees per acre. Big beautiful trees, ponderosa pines, are a little bit reminiscent of a sequoia, for example--very large, yellow bark, a beautiful huge tree. When they are spaced out a fairly large distance from each other in a rather parklike condition, I don't think there is anything prettier. 
   More to the point, there is nothing more beneficial for the flora and fauna in the area. Lush grass feeds the deer and elk and other browsers. We have a healthy environment for birds and other species and, frankly, the entire ecological situation is the way that God created it to be.  
   Then along came man, and through a series of mistakes we mismanaged the forests to the point that today most of the forest is clogged and gnarled into what they call a ``dog hair trimmer,'' meaning that a dog can't run through it without leaving half of his hair behind on the underbrush that has been growing up. 
   What happens is that, first of all, all of this underbrush competes for the nutrients and the water in the soil so none of the trees grow to be the big, beautiful trees we all love, and none of the grass can grow so that the browsers--the deer, elk, and animals such as that--don't come into the area. And because every bit of nature depends on something else, most of the species simply vanish. Nothing can really survive there. 
   You create two other conditions: disease-prone because they are weak; secondly, fire-prone, where a spark of fire here is like setting off tinder with a larger box around it to burn. Because of the undergrowth and fuel on the ground, as soon as the fire starts, it quickly spreads to the lower branches and then the upper branches of the trees, and that is why you see this almost explosion of fire as it crowns out; it goes right up through the top of these huge, magnificent trees and explodes the trees in the process. What happens is that the soil is baked to a temperature that is unhealthy for regeneration. 
   Ordinarily, nature-caused fire will burn along the ground and burn a little bit of the underbrush that is there but never crown out. As a result, it is not the timber fire that you get here. This literally sterilizes the soil. For years, nothing can regenerate. Perhaps devastatingly, erosion results very quickly--destroying streams, rivers, and lakes. It takes the topsoil that has taken millions of years to be created so things can grow, and wipes that out. It drains all of it right down into the rivers and streams and clogs them up. 
   What is the environment for the flora and fauna? There is nothing. We talk about endangered species. Goodbye species. 
   We had a fire around Four Peaks in Arizona which destroyed about 75,000 acres. I learned that this was the heaviest concentration of black bear habitat in the country and perhaps the world. What happened to all of these black bears? Many of them did not survive. Many of the other animals did not survive. The trees are gone. We have a very large bird population in Arizona. Amazingly enough, many of those birds had nowhere else to go. 
   The point is that when you have this kind of catastrophe, you are not aiding nature; you are destroying it. All of the environment is destroyed in the process--not to mention the waste and the cost. We have now spent about $1 billion this year to fight these fires. That money could have gone a long way toward managing the forests and preventing the fires in the first place. You are not simply saving timber; you are not simply preserving a nice view for people. You are saving the environment for the flora and fauna--preventing erosion, preventing the sterilization of the soil, and all of the rest. 
   As I started to say, work has been done around the country, but most importantly in Northern Arizona University, pioneered by Dean Garrett, and most recently by Dr. Wally Covington at Northern Arizona University. Secretary Bruce Babbitt is a friend of Wally Covington and fully supports the work that he has been doing at Northern Arizona University. In some small projects in northern Arizona, we have been able to acquire funding to do this forest restoration and demonstrate the efficacy of the treatment. 
   The problem is the administration has not carried that on to a larger treatment area. I don't know why because science proves it out. Secretary Babbitt understands that it is the right thing to do. But I think, frankly, it is a fear that the radical environmentalists, which this administration relies upon for a great deal of its support, will object. Indeed, after putting together a wonderful program with the support of Secretary Babbitt, Dr. Covington, the Grand Canyon Trust, and other environmental groups, all of whom were working together to make the area around Flagstaff, AZ, safer, to improve the environment, and to restore the forests to a healthy condition, radical environmental groups sued to stop the process and delayed it for an entire year--to no effect because the project will go on. But it will be delayed a year. 
   The GAO reports that we have 39 million acres to treat in this country. Strike that. With 6 million acres having burned this year, we are now down to 33 million acres. We have to do this within a 20-year period if we are going to save these forests. That is going to require a commitment of the next administration. If the current administration can't do the job, maybe the next one can. 
   Finally, I am holding a document put out by the U.S. 
   Department of Agriculture Forest Service, Southwestern Region, called ``Arizona's Wild Land Urban Interface.'' To summarize what is in this document, you see areas that haven't been treated that are severely burned. Then you see what happens when they treat the areas. You find, for example, in the Coronado National Forest a before-and-after picture where you see this clogged-up condition of undergrowth. It is not pretty, it is not environmentally sound, and the number of trees per acre are reduced to about 300. Whereas they had about 1,500 before, they are trying to get it down to about 150 per acre. When you do that, you have a beautiful park-like condition that is healthy. 
   I can tell you, having visited the treatment areas around Flagstaff, that after about 3 years you see the pitch content of the trees significantly improved. That prevents the bark beetles from attacking the trees. The protein content of the grass is an order of magnitude higher. All of the elk, deer, and other animals are coming in to browse. Everything about the forest is healthier when you can go in and thin out this underbrush and hopefully follow up with a prescribed burn which simply burns along the ground and burns any of the residue. It doesn't crown out. After that, you can let nature take its course because then you have a healthy forest with larger diameter trees. If lightning strikes, not one of those trees catches fire. It starts with the grass on fire around it. It may burn the grass for several acres. That is all right. That will regenerate in just 1 year. That is acceptable. But it doesn't crown out and destroy the rest of the forest. That is what we have to commit to do in all of our Nation's forests. 
   I commend the small first step that Senator DOMENICI has taken here with appropriations. I commend the administration to create a budget that will begin to spend, frankly, billions of dollars that are necessary to treat the forests of our country, not just in the southwest but all over the western United States which so desperately needs this new forest management to save our Nation's forest. 
   I appreciate the fact that Senator CRAIG has offered me the opportunity to speak to this today, and I look forward to continuing to talk about this issue because, unfortunately, like some of the other things, it takes a catastrophe to finally bring out what has to be done. While all of us lament the catastrophe, at least perhaps it will jolt us into doing what is right to save our wonderful forests in the U.S.

    Mr. KYL. Mr. President, a number of Senators who opposed the Death Tax Elimination Act have spoken on the Senate floor in recent weeks, suggesting that only a few people care about the unfairness of the tax. 
   During the death-tax repeal debate back in July, one of the tax's proponents went so far as to question ``whose side are you on?'' if you favor repeal. I have no difficulty answering that at all. We are on the side of the American people.

   Mr. KYL. I thank the Senator for his time and compliment our distinguished Chairman for skillfully guiding this bill through the challenging process of mark-up and conference. As the Chairman is well aware, the Stinger air defense missile and the Apache Longbow are two programs of great interest to me and to the state of Arizona. Over 41,000 Stinger missiles have been delivered and over $4 billion has been invested in Stinger weapons and platforms, and over 1,200 Apaches have been delivered to the U.S. and our allied forces.

   Mr. KYL. And I thank the Chairman for the committee's report. Sales of Apache Longbow and Stinger, however, apparently are being jeopardized by what I believe is a misinterpretation of congressional language contained in the FY00 DoD conference report. Therefore, I am seeking his help in clarifying the intent of Congress with regard to that provision.  
   In the FY00 DoD Appropriations bill, section 8138 directs the Army to ``conduct a live fire, side-by-side operational test of the air-to-air Starstreak and air-to-air Stinger missiles from the AH-64D Longbow helicopter.'' The provision further states that the Army is ``to ensure that the development, procurement or integration of any missile for use on the AH-64 [Apache] or RAH-66 [Comanche] helicopters ..... is subject to a full and open competition which includes the conduct of a live-fire, side-by-side test as an element of the source selection criteria.'' My understanding is that the intent of this provision was to direct the Army to conduct a test of two systems in order to ensure that its helicopters are fielded with the best possible air-to-air missile. 
   The problem, is that the Army has interpreted this provision so broadly as to prevent the sale of Apaches equipped with a Stinger air-to-air capability to our allies. Apparently the Army view is that they cannot do so until the operational test is conducted. Is it the Chairman's understanding that this language was intended to in any way obstruct the potential sale of Stinger-equipped Apaches to any U.S. ally?

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to take a few moments to reflect on some things you said and also on what the majority leader said a little while ago. 
   After our colleague Paul Coverdell died, I made a very brief statement on the floor. I knew I should speak briefly because it would be difficult to talk very long about Paul without becoming too emotional. 
   I think at a time when politics generally and politicians specifically are the subject of a lot of humor--they are denigrated because of cynicism about the political process, and in fact in some cases the denigration of some politicians is probably warranted--it is important for the American people to be reassured that there are some extraordinarily fine public servants who toil very hard on their behalf and who are responsible for whatever good comes out of these institutions--the House and the Senate. 
   Paul Coverdell was such a man. All of us who have spoken about him have shared with our colleagues and with the American people the same general notion that it is amazing what you can do if you are willing to let others take the credit for it. That was Paul Coverdell--self-effacing, very hard working, totally trustworthy and honest. Everyone could rely upon him to do the things that had to be done without fear he would in any way attempt to take advantage of any situation. He was as solid as a rock and a very important part of this institution--someone who really helped to make it run, and run in a good way. 
   I am sure my constituents in Arizona for the most part are unaware of Senator Coverdell, but they and others all around this country need to know how sorely he will be missed--not only personally but professionally--and how important a contribution he made to this country. There are truly some wonderful public servants, and Paul Coverdell was one of the best.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, when I was in Arizona this weekend, there were three things that seemed to come up frequently. One, of course, was the Vice Presidential selection of Governor Bush for the Republican nomination this fall. The other two subjects were the issues of tax relief, and I will briefly discuss that, and missile defense, which I will add to the mix, to share some of my constituents' concerns. 
   On the matter of Vice President, obviously, that is a subject of which Governor Bush will speak today or tomorrow, perhaps. Those on the Republican side will be, I am sure, very supportive. If it is former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, I think we will be especially pleased. I can't think of anyone who could make a better contribution, not only to the ticket but also to a future Republican administration, than Dick Cheney. He is from the Presiding Officer's State of Wyoming. He represents the kind of values that both the Presiding Officer and others from that great State represent: Straightforwardness, plain-spokenness, honesty, directness, a good strong sense of values, a willingness to do the hard work without having to take a lot of the credit, traits we treasure in someone such as Senator Paul Coverdell, and which Dick Cheney would certainly bring to the job. His experience and the great 
   respect which people not only in this country but around the world have for Dick Cheney would serve the ticket well. I am not attempting to influence Governor Bush in any way, but if his choice is Dick Cheney, there couldn't be a better choice. 
   Now the other two subjects my constituents raised this past weekend. I was astounded that these were the two things they wanted to talk about: The tax relief that the Republican Congress continues to pass, and pass on to the President; and, secondly, the matter of missile defense, which I will get to in a moment. 
   I was amused to hear the Democratic candidate for President talk about a do-nothing Congress. This is rather strange, considering the fact that we have passed over and over and over legislation to help the American people, particularly to relieve them of some of the tax burden which imposes upon them an extra burden that they need not bear and that is inhibitive of future economic growth. 
   I am surprised that a Congress which has been so active--and, indeed, President Clinton has criticized us for being so active in this regard--would be accused then of being ``do-nothing.'' In truth, it is not the Congress that isn't willing to do these things; it is the Clinton-Gore administration that is unwilling to do these things. 
   Let me give some cases in point. We passed the estate tax relief about which the Presiding Officer talked. It passed overwhelmingly in both bodies, with bipartisan support. But the Clinton-Gore administration says it will veto this tax relief. We passed the marriage penalty, something that President Clinton said, in his State of the Union speech, was a top priority for him. He says he will veto that legislation. We can pass all of these things, but we can't get them into law unless the President signs them. We are doing our best in the Congress. It is now up to the President. 
   He did sign one thing that we passed this year. The Social Security earnings limitation was finally repealed. That was an important part of tax relief for an important part of my constituency, our senior citizens. There is more work to do there. 
   We want to also repeal the 1993 tax increase on Social Security which was imposed by the Clinton administration and the Democratic Congress when it controlled the House and the Senate, and Vice President GORE is always proud to remind everyone that he had to cast the deciding vote. This was the 1993 tax increase which, among other things, imposes a tax rate of up to 85 percent on the Social Security earnings of our senior citizens. This is  wrong and it ought to be repealed. If and when we do it, I will call upon the President to sign that. 
   We will probably send to him a repeal of the Spanish-American War era telephone tax. I think we can safely do this. The war has been over now for some time. We don't need to fund the Spanish-American War anymore. Like many other taxes and programs in Washington, once they are instituted, it is very difficult to ever get rid of them. 
   We are finally going to take the step to do that, as we did with the marriage penalty, as we did with the estate tax, as we did with the Social Security earnings limit. We are going to repeal this tax, as well, and call upon the President to sign this. 
   We have not been doing nothing. We have been doing something, something very worthwhile for the American people. I 
   ask the President to reconsider his threat to veto these important tax cuts. Now, his argument is, maybe we can't afford it; it is a lot of money--this after receiving news that our tax surplus is going to be in the trillions of dollars--not billions, not hundreds of billions, but trillions of dollars. This is not a budget surplus; this is a tax surplus. It is a tax surplus because the taxes we have imposed on the American people bring in far more money than we should or can spend. I say ``can'' because, of course, Congress has the capacity to spend an unlimited amount of money. 
   We have set some standards in the Republican-controlled Congress. We have said we are not going to touch a dime of the Social Security surplus. The Social Security surplus is much larger than the non-Social Security surplus. This is the money that comes in as a result of the payment of our FICA taxes. Those are far greater than the need to pay the benefits under the Social Security program right now. And we are applying every dime of the Social Security surplus to a reduction of our Federal debt. That is why our Federal debt is being reduced so dramatically now. 
   The question is, What should be done with the non-Social Security surplus? It does not seem too much to me to return a dime, a dime on a dollar of that surplus, in the form of the marriage penalty relief and the estate tax relief to the American people. Under the most liberal interpretation of how much that would cost--and it is not nearly as much as this figure would suggest--but under the most liberal interpretation, it would be 10 cents on the dollar of the surplus we have. 
   It seems to me, since we are collecting more in taxes than we need--even after huge increases in spending in virtually every program we have--it is not too much to return 10 percent of this tax surplus to the American people. That is the magnitude of the issue. When President Clinton says it costs too much, he is saying the Federal Government ought to spend that money, rather then allowing the American people to keep this 10 cents on the dollar. That is arrogance of the first magnitude. That was one of the concerns my constituents presented to me this week. 
   The other had to do with missile defense. My constituents understand the need to protect America. They understand that Secretary Cohen has said we have a threat from North Korea, from Iran. There will be a threat from Iran; certainly China has been rattling its sabers these days. They understand that there is no way we can prevent an attacking missile from landing on the United States today and that it will be at least 5 years before we can do that if we proceed as rapidly as we possibly can. They are anxious we get on with the job of getting a missile defense program in place to protect the American people and to prevent other countries from blackmailing the United States from being involved in issues around the world in which we know we need to be involved. 
   This last weekend, there was a successful test--it didn't get much publicity--of the Patriot missile against a cruise missile target. This is another important component of missile defense. The last national missile defense test was a failure. From that, many people have said they conclude that there can't possibly be a successful program and we ought to just pack up and go home, ignoring the fact that the threat exists; also, Mr. President, ignoring something else. There is a phrase that has found its way into our jargon these days: ``It is not rocket science.'' Mr. President, this is rocket science, and it ain't easy. Sometimes it takes some failures in order to get to the successful conclusion of a program. There are over 20 tests in this particular program scheduled, most of them yet to be conducted. It is rocket science. It is hard. But we can do it. The people involved in the program are confident of that. 
   The failure in this last test, incidentally, was not a failure of any of the high technology. It was one of those quirks that can occur when something you have done hundreds of times before just did not happen to work on this particular occasion. But it was not a failure of the high-tech end of this missile defense program which we need to test to make sure it can work. 
   To my colleagues who may have been concerned as a result of the failure of this last test, I suggest to them we stay the course and continue the program as outlined by the Department of Defense, which I believe will be successful and will enable us to deploy a missile defense to protect the American people. 
   Final point. There are many who have urged the President to defer a decision, that he not make a decision. We have already made that decision when we passed the Missile Defense Act and President Clinton signed it into law. That decision was to deploy a national missile defense as soon as technologically feasible, and we believe it will be feasible. Therefore, we need to move forward with the program. That is why the President should not defer a decision. He should make a decision to go forward, but he should, of course, defer the specifics as to exactly what that program is for the next President to decide. That can be done, but there should be no backing away from going forward, and that is the decision the President should make. 
   Ultimately, of course, I think Governor Bush is correct. There will need to be not just one element of a system but, rather, the flexibility to deploy a multilayered defense for the American people which involves both land-based assets as well as sea-based assets and space-based assets. You need satellites to detect and track the trajectory of a missile. You can also be benefited by other assets in space. Certainly a missile defense would be augmented very well with sea-based capability, which could, under certain circumstances, even have a boost-phase intercept capability because of its proximity to the launching of the offensive missile. 
   All of this is well understood. I believe the Congress should stay the course and urge the administration to go forward with its decision. Of course, the details will be left to the next administration, but we should not signal we are not willing to protect the American people from missile attack. 
   Mr. President, you mentioned, in closing, we are hoping to take up the permanent trade relations with China toward the end of this week. I very strongly support the efforts by Senator THOMPSON to ensure that at the same time we are moving to open our trade with China, we make it clear to China that there are certain things which are inimical to peace around the world and certainly to our security. Included in that is China's proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the missiles to deliver those weapons to other countries, countries of concern--the so-called rogue nations of Iran and Iraq and North Korea. It may also be proliferating to other countries that we would prefer not have large arsenals of these weapons. 
   The bottom line is that although we can and should move forward in developing closer and more robust trade with China, we cannot allow that kind of activity to suggest to China that we do not care about our own national security and about peace and stability and security in the world. That is why I think it is appropriate for us to also adopt the Thompson legislation which will make it clear that, for those who are involved in the proliferation, sanctions will result. I am hoping we can take that up at the end of this week. 
   Those are concerns that were expressed by my constituents this weekend. I told them I would share them with my colleagues. I have now done that and I appreciate the indulgence of the Presiding Officer, whose time I have been taking.  
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am proud to support H.R. 1791, the Federal Law Enforcement Animal Protection Act, a bill by Representative WELLER which would make it a federal crime to willfully and maliciously harm an animal used by a Federal agency for the principal purpose of investigating crimes, enforcing laws, or apprehending criminals. 
   I would first like to thank Senator HATCH for his help in discharging this important bill from Committee. I would also like to thank the advocacy groups and agencies, most notably, the Humane Society of the U.S., U.S. Police Canine Association, U.S. Customs Service, U.S. Border Patrol, and our very own Capital Police, for helping to publicize the need for legislation to protect federal law enforcement animals. 
   I was pleased when Representative WELLER called me and asked for my support of H.R. 1791. Under current law, a person who willfully injures a federal law enforcement animal can only be punished under the statute that makes it a crime to damage federal property. 
   Unfortunately, many of these animals have a monetary value of less than a $1,000, even though their training can cost up to $20,000, so the act of willfully harming them can only be prosecuted as a misdemeanor. H.R. 1791 will address this problem and punish willful and malicious harm done to these animals more severely than an act of damage to an inanimate object. 
   This bill is important for law enforcement. These animals play an integral role in protecting our borders, airports and our own capital grounds. In fiscal year 1999, U.S. Customs Canine Enforcement Teams were involved in over 11,000 narcotic or currency seizures. The street value of the narcotics uncovered by the canines exceeded several billion dollars. The dogs detected approximately 631,909 pounds of marijuana, 50,748 pounds of cocaine, 358 pounds of heroin, and $25.5 million in currency. H.R. 1791 would put federal law enforcement animals on equal ground with local law enforcement animals that are protected in 27 states, including my own state of Arizona.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, last Friday, the Senate concluded debate on the Death Tax Elimination Act, H.R. 8, and passed the bill by a bipartisan vote of 59 to 39. I am very grateful to Senators on both sides of the aisle who supported this important legislation. 
   The broad, bipartisan support the death-tax repeal bill received suggests that we have finally found a formula for taxing inherited assets in a fair and common sense way. Unrealized gains will be taxed, but they will be taxed when they are earned--not at death. Death itself will no longer trigger a tax. 
   This change--effectively substituting a capital-gains tax, which would be due upon the sale of inherited assets, for an estate tax at death--is itself a compromise. 
   When I first introduced a death-tax repeal bill in 1995, I did not propose any change in the stepped-up basis--a change that is at the heart of this bill. My original legislation would have repealed the death tax and allowed heirs to continue to step up the tax basis in the inherited property to the fair market value at the date of death. 
   That is obviously the ideal world for taxpayers: No death tax, and a minimal capital-gains tax when the inherited assets are later sold. The problem was, that approach sat idle for four years. We could not get it to the Senate floor for a vote, and we could not attract bipartisan support for it. 
   The idea behind this bill really came out of a hearing before the Senate Finance Committee in 1997. At the hearing, Senators MOYNIHAN and KERREY acknowledged that the death tax was problematic, but expressed the concern that, if we repealed the death tax without adjusting the basis rules, unrealized gains in assets held until death could go untaxed forever. 
   It struck me then that we had the basis for a compromise. If we could agree that death should not trigger a tax, we should be able to agree that death should not confer a tax benefit, either. The answer was to simply take death out of the equation. Coupling death-tax repeal with a limitation on the step-up in basis does just that. 
   So H.R. 8 represents a compromise. And that is why, I think, we were able to win the votes of 59 Senators, including nine Democrats. And that is why 65 Democrats were able to support the legislation in the House of Representatives. 
   During consideration of the death-tax repeal bill last week, some of our colleagues on the other side proposed a different kind of compromise. They said theirs would repeal the death tax for virtually all family-owned businesses and farms. Some have suggested that, if President Clinton vetoes the death-tax repeal initiative, the Democratic substitute might serve as a basis for further compromise. The problem is, the approach taken in the substitute--while well-intentioned--is fatally flawed. 
   Here is how the Wall Street Journal put it in an editorial on July 13:  
   Senate Democrats also offer to expand a small-business and farm exception that is a tax-lawyer's dream. The loophole, known as IRS Code section 2057, is so complicated and onerous that few estates qualify.  
   Let me take a few moments to explain the deficiencies of this Democratic substitute. First, there are requirements that more than 50 percent of the decedent's assets must be made up of the qualifying business; that the decedent or immediate family must have actively operated the business for five of the eight years preceding death; and that a member of the immediate family must agree to continue to operate the business for at least 10 years after the decedent's death. 
   If any of these conditions is not adhered to for 10 full years after death, the government can still collect the original estate-tax that was due, plus accrued interest. 
   And understand this: to protect its right to recapture the estate tax if the business fails to comply, the Federal Government attaches a Federal tax lien to the property for a full 10 years. For a business, like farming, which is credit-dependent, such tax liens can make it virtually impossible to secure loans and financing for business operations, for growth, and for viability. In addition, the heirs are held personally liable for the estate tax and any penalties. 
   So, far from providing meaningful relief, the Democratic substitute leaves a cloud over the family business for up to a decade after death. The government can come back any time and recapture the estate tax that was due, plus interest, if the business, at any point, falls out of compliance. The threat of reimposition of the tax absolutely limits the family's flexibility in managing and disposing of business assets in its best interest. 
   The Democratic substitute relies on the current law's onerous material participation requirement, which, in effect, forces the family to work in the day-to-day operation of the business, or face the death tax, plus severe penalties. These requirements may be difficult to satisfy if, for example, the present owners are disabled or other family members are not yet involved in the business. 
   It relies on very complex rules for determining the value of farms and closely-held business interests. Historically, the IRS has challenged virtually every valuation method used, and these challenges typically wind up in Tax Court. 
   There are currently 149 tax cases which have been decided and reported involving 2032A issues. The IRS has challenged the validity of 2032A election or planning, and has won in approximately 67 percent of the cases. An equal number may be embroiled in the administrative process before court action. So much for relief--two-thirds of the few who do think they qualify, do not ultimately qualify and have to pay the tax with interest. 
   The so-called family business ``carveout,'' which is embodied in Section 2057 of current law, is so bad that the Real Property and Probate Section of the American Bar Association has urged its repeal. 
   The reason the ABA condemns this section so strongly is that it is extremely complex and has an extremely limited application. It provides little practical help to families trying to preserve the family-owned farm or small business. It incorporates 14 sections from Section 2032A, which the ABA considers the most dangerous section of the estate-tax law because of the risk of malpractice claims against estate-planning lawyers and accountants. 
   So the fact is, if you rely on these sections of the tax code, you can raise the value of the estates eligible for relief as high as you want, and still few estates are going to get the intended relief. Estimates are that only about three to five percent of estates would benefit, and even then, as I said before,  if they do not continue to meet all requirements for 10 years after death, the government can still come back and collect the original estate-tax bill plus accrued interest. The government's interest is protected by a lien that is maintained on the business for 10 years. 
   Of course, because the family-business carveout is so complex--because it requires determining compliance and ensuring continued compliance for 10 years--business owners have to continue to engage in expensive estate-tax planning. That is a tremendous waste of resources--resources that would otherwise be plowed back into the business for new jobs, better pay for current employees, business expansion, or research and development. 
   A recent report by the National Association of Women Business Owners (NAWBO) found that, ``on average, 39 jobs per business or 11,000 jobs have already been lost due to the planning and payment of the death tax.'' NAWBO projects that, on average, 103 jobs per business, or a total of 28,000 jobs, will be lost as a result of the tax over the next five years. That would not change under the Democratic substitute, because there would still be a need for expensive estate-tax planning. 
   Mr. President, 59 Senators voted for a better approach--one that takes death out of the equation and taxes inherited assets like any other assets for tax purposes. A capital-gains tax would be paid when the assets are sold, with only a limited adjustment in the decedent's tax basis to ensure that no one is subject to new tax liability. 
   That is the true compromise. Tinkering with an already unworkable section of the tax code is not an effective substitute. I hope the President will sign the Death Tax Elimination Act when it reaches his desk. If not, we will be back next year when a new President is in the White House, and I predict that we will prevail. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I'm pleased to sponsor Senator DOMENICI's amendment, number 3782, to the fiscal year 2001 Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations bill which adds critical funding to the budgets of the Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service for hazardous fuel removal. These funds are necessary to address the immediate threats to wildland/urban interface areas across the country which are surrounded by public lands choking with natural fuels build-up from a half-century of fire suppression. The Los Alamos fire was a tragic reminder of the threat that exists today around many communities. In my own state of Arizona, which has the largest ponderosa pine forest in the world, the communities of Flagstaff, Tucson, Summer Haven, Pinetop-Lakeside, Showlow, and countless others are virtually surrounded by the national forest. 
   The work being done by the Ecological Restoration Institute at Northern Arizona University to address forest ecosystem restoration is world-class. I believe my colleagues are aware of the forest treatment and public education programs there. I understand that an agreement was reached to provide $8.8 million directly to the Ecological Restoration Institute for its ongoing efforts from within the funds made available to the Bureau of Land Management. Is this correct?

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, it was about two-and-a-half years ago that I came to the Senate floor to call on the Senate to repeal two of the most egregious and unfair taxes imposed by the nation's Tax Code: the steep taxes imposed on people when they get married and when they die. The good news is, for the second time in two years, the Senate has cleared legislation to repeal the death tax. And this week, for the third time, we will clear a measure to repeal the marriage penalty. 
   In 1995, Congress passed legislation that would have provided a tax credit to married couples to offset this penalty somewhat. President Clinton vetoed that bill. 
   In 1999, Congress again approved a measure to provide married couples with some relief. Last year's bill would have set the standard deduction for couples at twice the deduction allowed for singles. It would also have set the lowest income-tax bracket for married couples at twice that allowed for single taxpayers. President Clinton vetoed that measure last September. 
   According to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, the total tax burden borne by American taxpayers dipped slightly in 1998. That is the good news. The bad news is that Americans still spent more on federal taxes than on any of the other major items in their household budgets. For the median-income, two-earner family, federal taxes still amounted to 39 percent of the family budget--more than what they spent on food, housing, and medical care combined. One of the reasons why they paid so much is the continuation of the marriage penalty that exists in the Nation's tax code. 
   According to the Congressional Budget Office, nearly half of all married taxpayers--about 21 million couples--filing a joint return paid a higher tax than they would have if each spouse had been allowed to file as a single taxpayer. 
   The marriage penalty hits the working poor particularly hard. Two-earner families making less than $20,000 often must devote a full eight percent of their income to pay the marriage penalty. Eight percent is an extraordinary amount for couples that count on every dollar to make ends meet. 
   Let me stop here and give an example of the marriage penalty at work. In this example, the penalty comes about because workers filing as single taxpayers get a higher standard deduction, and because income-tax bracket thresholds for married couples are lower than the threshold for singles. Consider a married couple in which each spouse earns about $30,000 a year. They would have paid $7,655 in federal income taxes last year. By comparison, two individuals earning the same amount, but filing single returns, would have paid only $6,892 between the two of them. That is a marriage penalty of $763. 
   The average penalty--average penalty--paid by couples is even higher than that--about $1,400 a year, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Think what families could do with an extra $1,400. They could pay for three or four months of day care if they choose to send a child outside the home--or make it easier for one parent to stay at home to take care of the children, if that is what they decide is best for them. They could make four or five payments on their car or minivan. They could pay their utility bill for nine months. 
   The bill before us is the most comprehensive effort yet to eliminate the marriage penalty. It would expand the standard deduction for married couples filing jointly; widen the tax brackets for such couples; and increase the income phase-outs for the earned income credit. 
   Unlike President Clinton's so-called relief bill, the plan Chairman ROTH brings to us today does not neglect married couples who choose to have one parent stay at home to raise the children. It gives them relief, and, in so doing, it lets them know we value the choice they have made to stay home and raise a family. 
   Unlike the Clinton plan, which would preserve the penalty for many couples, our plan would eliminate the marriage penalty in its entirety. Sure, that means the revenue loss associated with this legislation is greater than the President proposed, but the smaller cost of providing relief under the Clinton plan is also indicative of just how little it would do to solve the problem. We should not be stingy when attempting to ensure fairness in the tax code. 
   Passage of this legislation would continue the good progress we have made this year in making the tax code fairer. First, we passed the measure to repeal the Social Security earnings limitation, a tax that has unfairly penalized seniors for more than 60 years, simply because they wanted to earn some extra income to supplement their monthly retirement checks. That measure is now law. 
   Last week, we voted to eliminate the death tax, which unfairly taxes people simply because they die. We voted to substitute a capital-gains tax so that inherited assets are taxed at the appropriate time--when they are sold, and when income is actually realized. 
   Hopefully, the marriage-penalty repeal bill, like the death-tax repeal, will pass with a strong, bipartisan majority, and President Clinton will rethink his opposition and sign it when it reaches his desk. 
   We can debate the merits of any number of changes in the tax code: whether a flat tax is preferable to a sales tax; whether tax rates should be reduced across the board; or whether we should make the tax code more conducive to savings and investment. There are legitimate points to be made on both sides. 
   But when it comes to fairness, we need to do what is right. The marriage penalty, like the earnings limit and the death tax, is wrong, it is unfair, and it is time to put it to rest. I urge support for the marriage-penalty repeal bill.

   Mr. KYL. I thank Senator ROTH for yielding me the time. 
   I appreciate the Senator from North Dakota at least attempting to yield for an answer to his question. Here is, I think, the simplest explanation. I will give two. If the Democratic plan is better for small businesses and farms, then why is it that every small business organization and every farm organization support the Republican plan? 
   I am responding to the Senator's question. We have politicians on both sides of aisle saying: Our plan is better. No, our plan is better. 
   Why is it that all of the organizations that we are concerned about--the farmers and the small business folks--all support the Republican plan? 
   Let me read into the RECORD a few of these organizations. The American Farm Bureau supports the Republican plan. There are a whole number of organizations such as the Soybean Association, the Sheep Association, and others. Let me list a few of them: the National Association of Wheat Growers, the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture, the National Cattleman's Beef Association, the National Corn Growers Association, the National Cotton Council of America, the National Milk Producers Federation, and with regard to small business, the umbrella organization, the National Federation of Independent Business. 
   And back to the farm groups: the Pork Producers Council, the Small Business Legislative Council, the United Fresh Fruits and Vegetables Association. 
   I could go on and on reading from this list. This is a three-paged, single-spaced list of small business organizations and farm organizations, and every one of them support the Republican plan, not the Democratic alternative. 
   So I think that is the answer to the question: Which one of these plans is better for small businesses and farms? It is the Republican plan. Why is that? There is actually a fairly simple answer, and then an answer that takes a little more explanation.

   Mr. KYL. Not right now. Let me finish my point. 
   The reason why the Democratic alternative is not supported by any of these organizations is because no one can qualify for the benefit it purports to grant. It does not matter whether you raise the exemption from $600,000 to $1 million or $2 million if people can't qualify for it. The fact is, it is very difficult, if not impossible, for most small businesses and farms to qualify. 
   I will cite some experts who make that point, but, first of all, the statistics: Only 3 to 5 percent of affected estates qualify under these sections. In today's Wall Street Journal, there is a reference to this fact. The lead editorial ``Death Tax Revolt,'' reads:  
   But Senate Democrats also offer to expand a small-business and farm exception that is a tax-lawyer's dream. The loophole, known as IRS Code section 2057, is so complicated and onerous that few estates qualify. That's why even House Democrats offered the cleaner alternative of a 20 percent cut in estate-tax rates.  
   It then goes on to note that Senate Democrats have offered this instead. 
   Let me quote from a couple of memos from tax experts that make this point:  
   The requirements to qualify for the new exclusion provided by 2057--  
   Which is the section we are talking about here--  
   are virtually identical to the requirements to qualify for special use valuation for farms under section 2032A........The 2032A nexus is very important since most estate tax analysts agree that section 2032A is a flawed section of the Code that is virtually unworkable.  
   Let me just go on here:  
   The frustration of farmers with 2032A and its enforcement has resulted in virtually no farm families structuring their estates to take advantage of this so-called relief in the Code........Quite simply, these provisions, while well-intentioned, are flawed and represent ``broken'' sections of the Code. Tinkering with the Code--  
   I will just interject: As the Democratic alternative purports to do--  
   and trying to engineer and mandate the circumstances for running a business or farm 10 years into the future is a gross violation of a family's right for self-determination for the business or farm and against the spirit of allowing an individual's hard-earned, after-tax life's work to be shared and enjoyed by his/her loved ones.  
   Here is what one of the experts in estate tax has noted:  
   The current Qualified Family-Owned Business Interest is 4 pages of statute as Code Section 2057. Its predecessor 2033A was condemned by the Real Property and Probate Section of the American Bar Association which urged its repeal.  
   Why? Because it is malpractice waiting to happen. All of the lawyers getting together can't figure out how to make this code work for small businesses and farms. They can't qualify. 
   Reading on:  
   The reason for this condemnation by this respected organization and others was extreme complexity and limited application, plus little practical help in preserving family farms and businesses from forced sale or liquidation to pay the 55 percent estate tax. 
   Although 2057 is only 4 pages of law, it incorporates by reference 14 sections from 2032A--valuation of certain farms, etc., real property.  
   Section 2032A, which is itself 11 pages, ``was considered the most dangerous section of the estate tax law because of the risk of malpractice claims against estate planning lawyers and accountants. Currently, there are 149 tax cases which have been decided and reported involving 2032A issues.'' The IRS has challenged the validity of the estate planning under this section and has won approximately 67 percent of the cases. 
   So what kind of great relief do we have in the Democratic package? Relief which is based upon attempting to qualify under a section that only 3 to 5 percent of the eligible estates can qualify under, where lawyers are frequently committing malpractice if they try to gain this qualification, and where the IRS is succeeding in over two-thirds of the challenges which they are making to attempts to qualify under this section. 
   The point is, you can make this exemption as high as you want to, but it is unworkable. That is the fatal flaw in the Democratic plan. As the Wall Street Journal editorial noted, House Democrats who sought to have an alternative recognized this and went at it in a different way--not our colleagues in the Senate.  
   There are additional memoranda from tax experts who make this very same point. 
   I will move on to another point. My colleague, Senator CONRAD, quoted the Larry Summers article which is grossly in error. The Secretary of the Treasury forgot two important points when he estimated the cost of the Republican plan. 
   First, remember that the Republican plan is not just a repeal of the estate tax. It is essentially a substitution of the capital gains tax for the estate tax. That is an important point. When somebody such as Secretary Summers or Senator CONRAD says, here is how much the repeal of the estate tax is going to cost, and then doesn't take into account the revenue that is brought in by the application of the capital gains tax, they are presenting a distorted picture. 
   The first point is that while the capital gains tax rate is lower at 20 percent, lower than the estate tax rate, it will nevertheless produce revenue when the property of the heirs is sold, at least it is their decision as to when to sell their property. It does not have to be sold at the time of death of the decedent in order to pay the tax. They can wait and hold it forever if they want to maintain the small business or keep on the family farm. If they would like to sell those assets sometime, they do so knowing that there is going to be a capital 
   gains tax. Granted, at a rate lower than the estate tax, but it is still a tax they are going to have to pay. 
   The second thing Secretary Summers did not take into account--and it has not been taken into account by our friends on the other side--is the step up in basis. Under the existing law, the basis is stepped up at the time of death. So let's take one of these billionaires they are fond of talking about. If the widow of a billionaire sells all of the estate the day after the death of the decedent, there is no gain. As a result, the step up in basis results in a payment of zero capital gains tax, none whatsoever. They have to pay the estate tax but zero capital gains tax. By removing this step up in basis, we take death out of the equation. If and when the assets are ever sold, they are sold knowing that the capital gains tax applies and that it is calculated on the basis of the original cost to the owner of the property. 
   So the decedent bought the property 10 years before at $10 a share, and it is up to $100 a share now. The basis is the $10. The gain is calculated based upon that. Then you pay the capital gains tax. That is why all of these wild estimates of how much this is going to cost are off the mark. They don't take into account the fact that we substitute the capital gains tax and that we repeal the step up in basis. 
   There is another point I will make. Given the fact that we are talking about a budget surplus of trillions of dollars over a 10-year period, obviously any ``cost to the Treasury'' is irrelevant. It is, A, a drop in the bucket and, B, not needed because we are running a huge surplus. Why are they so worried about this loss in revenue to the Federal Government? By definition we are running a surplus, and we don't need the revenue. 
   One of the comments the Senator from North Dakota made was that our proposal costs less. Yes, it costs less because it provides less benefit. If it is so good for the family farms and small businesses that they seem to care so much about, why would they then want to stress the fact that their plan costs less, when in fact that means it provides fewer benefits. 
   The bottom line is, the Republican alternative, which is supported by the agricultural and small business groups, is the better plan for them. It is a better plan because it doesn't rely upon a fatally flawed provision of the Tax Code to make it work. It repeals the estate tax, but it provides an important substitute. That substitute is that the estates would be subject to a capital gains tax to the extent that the property of those estates is ever sold. 
   We believe that is a very fair way to approach this issue. It takes death out of the equation. It removes that horrible Hobson's choice that a family must make at the worst possible time for them to have to deal with it, at a time when the head of the family has died; he is the person perhaps most responsible for making this farm or small business a success. They are then faced with the difficult choice of having to figure out how to pay the estate tax and, in many cases, having to sell this business in order to do so. 
   One more important point. There is a recent Gallup poll that points out that 60 percent of American people favor outright repeal. Only 35 percent oppose that. Yet 43 percent of the people who favor repeal say they know they would never benefit from the repeal. That demonstrates to me that they understand this is a very unfair tax. Only 17 percent believe they will benefit by a repeal of the tax. That may be a fairly representative number. But it is an unfair tax. 
   Another one of the reasons why it is so unfair is because a great deal of the expense associated with this is not the payment of the tax, but it is the payment of all of these lawyers and accountants and estate planners and the purchase of insurance and other products which are designed to avoid the payment of the tax. The very wealthy, these billionaires the other side likes to talk about, can well afford all of the lawyers. They end up shielding the bulk of their income as a result of the estate planning they do. It is the smaller estates that end up having to pay the tax because they haven't been able to afford these expensive products to try to avoid the tax. 
   Besides simply being jobmakers for lawyers, which I don't think we are in the business of being, this is a very expensive proposition. It is interesting that the bulk of the people who pay the taxes are the smaller estates. 
   I ask unanimous consent to print in the RECORD a brief explanation from an article by Bruce Bartlett of why the larger estates pay only 20 percent of the total taxes.

   Mr. KYL. A good opportunity to summarize: 
   I support what Senator ROTH said earlier this morning. The Democratic alternative is no alternative at all because it relies upon a definition in the code that virtually no one can meet. 
   Only 3 to 5 percent of the estates qualify. That is why the Democratic alternative is no alternative at all. Is this only me speaking? No. All of the farm and small business organizations agree. They support the Republican alternative, not the Democratic alternative. I think the best test of which one of these plans best meets their needs is to ask the people who are most affected. They answer resoundingly that it is the Republican plan that best meets our needs; it is the Republican plan that we support. 
   For that reason, when it comes to choosing between the alternative--you have to make a choice here--the Republican alternative, which passed the House of Representatives with strong bipartisan support, is the one that should be supported and the Democratic should be rejected.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Minnesota for offering this amendment. 
   This has been a long time in coming. Just about 7 years ago, on August 6, 1993, the Vice President cast the deciding vote in this Chamber to raise taxes on Social Security benefits. That same day, in the House of Representatives, I introduced legislation to roll back that Clinton-Gore tax hike for seniors. I was proud to have my colleague from Minnesota as a cosponsor of that bill, and I am pleased to offer my support for his amendment today. 
   Millions of Americans depend on Social Security as a critical part of their retirement income. Having paid into the program throughout their working lives, older Americans plan their retirement budgets very carefully assuming that expected benefits will be there. 
   The 1993 Clinton-Gore Social Security tax hike upset the carefully laid plans of millions of retirees by subjecting to federal taxation 85% of the benefits earned by seniors above $34,000--or $44,000 for a couple. For affected seniors, this constituted an increase of as much as 70 percent in the marginal tax rate. 
   The result is that seniors who had planned to continue building their nest eggs after retirement found themselves facing an overwhelming disincentive to continue earning. 
   This is not just counterproductive--it is blatantly unfair. Younger investors face no such disincentives to save and invest. And yet investment income is much more important to seniors than it is younger citizens. Sixty percent of seniors' income is derived from their investments. 
   It is simply not credible to dismiss the millions of Americans who must pay this unfair tax hike as ``the rich.'' Last year, 4.6 million American households had to pay more in taxes than they would have had the Clinton-Gore increase not been in effect. That is more than a quarter of all households that include at least one Social Security beneficiary. 
   Earlier this year, we came together on a bipartisan basis to repeal the Social Security earnings limit. At that time, I wondered if the unanimous vote  to put an end to that relic of the Depression Era indicated a new willingness to remove the barriers that discourage older Americans from supplementing government assistance with self-help. 
   Our vote on the Grams amendment will demonstrate which Members of this body are prepared to follow through on that principle. I certainly hope that this vote will be just as overwhelming as the vote on the earnings limit.

   Interestingly enough, to the point the Senator just made, only 17 percent of Americans say they would personally benefit from the tax elimination, while 43 percent say they would not benefit.

   In April 1999, the General Accounting Office reported to the Congress that 39 million acres on the national forests in the interior West are at high risk of catastrophic wildfire. The GAO also stated in that same report to Congress that the ``most extensive and serious problem related to the health of national forests in the interior West is the over-accumulation of vegetation, which has caused an increasing number of large, intense, uncontrollable, and catastrophically destructive wildfires.'' 
   As we've seen this summer on the Rim of the Grand Canyon in my state of Arizona, on the Hanford Reach in Washington State, in the community of Los Alamos, New Mexico, and now in Colorado and other western states, it's time to pay the piper. If we don't spend the money now to treat the forests and other public lands, mechanically and through the use of fire, we will pay later--and we will pay a lot more. 
   The National Research Council and FEMA have recognized wildland fires in California in 1993 and Florida in 1998 as among the defining natural disasters of the 1990s. The 1991 Oakland, CA fire was ranked by insurance claims as one of the ten most costly all-time natural disasters. And in terms of damage, the magnitude of these catastrophic fires was compared with the Northridge earthquake, Hurricane Andrew and the flooding of the Mississippi and Red River. 
   As the findings of these organizations reveal, we are setting ourselves up for costly and deadly disaster unless we act now and send money to the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management for hazardous fuels reduction in the wildland/urban interface.  
   In response to the GAO report, the Forest Service is working on a Cohesive Strategy to restore and maintain fire-adapted ecosystems across the interior West. I've seen a draft of that report, and the price tag on the draft is about $12 billion over 15 years to treat 60 million acres on the National Forest. As I understand it, the Forest Service had hoped to release a final Strategy about a month ago, but this Administration's OMB has put a hold on the Strategy as too expensive. 
   I'm not willing to wait until Flagstaff or Tucson or any other community virtually surrounded by the National Forest burns. I support providing the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management with emergency funds, assuming that the Administration designates these funds as emergency funds as required by the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. 
   Mr. President, I also want to draw my colleagues' attention to the comments of Stewart Udall that were published in the Arizona Republic on Thursday, July 6th. As my colleagues know, Stewart Udall, who now lives in the fire-threatened community of Santa Fe, New Mexico, served as Secretary of the Interior and represented Arizona in the House of Representatives. Mr. Udall notes with complete accuracy that we have altered the ecology of our forests and that it is only a matter of time before these man-made tinderboxes will ignite. Mr. Udall implores citizens to unite and demand restoration plans and aggressive, science-oriented, landscape-scale restoration action plans to prevent Los Alamos-style disasters. 
   Mr. Udall praises an organization of which I, too, am proud, the Ecological Restoration Institute, located at Northern Arizona University, and its leader, Dr. Wallace Covington. Mr. Udall opines, and I agree, that with appropriate support, the Ecological Restoration Institute can show other forested states how to use controlled burns and mechanical thinning to eliminate the threat of devastating fires.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, Senator NICKLES made the point that the amendments the minority have sought to bring up have nothing to do with repeal of the death tax. That is why the majority leader said he will enter into an agreement with them but let's make it relevant and germane to the issue before the Senate. 
   When the American people see us going through these charades, I wonder how they can have any confidence in a body that seems to be so partisan and intent on changing the subject. 
   We have one subject before us today: repeal of the death tax. It is the House bill that passed overwhelmingly. Why can't we simply consider this bill with relevant and germane amendments? 
   Why do we have to get off into prescription drugs and the rest? 
   Our distinguished colleague from North Dakota has said there is an alternative with respect to the repeal of the death tax. I would like to take that on because it relies on a section of the code today that is absolutely unworkable. Two-thirds of the cases that have been brought with respect to this section of the code have been won by the IRS. It does not work. Try to qualify, if you are a small business or a farm, under the section that they are taking about; you are not going to get relief. It is a sham proposal. 
   You can raise the exemption all you want, but if the definition precludes you from qualifying, you have not gained a thing. I can't wait to debate the alternative that the members of the minority want to propose. I will agree, right now, to consider that as an amendment that we would vote on here. If we can agree to consider that, we can move right on to the consideration of the death tax repeal because the provision they are talking about is unworkable, it is unfair, and it will not provide an adequate alternative to the repeal of the death tax that is called for under H.R. 8, the House-passed bill. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the cloture motion so we can get on with the debate about how we can finally bring an end to this most unfair and pernicious section of the Tax Code. 
   I welcome a debate of any germane alternative that members of the minority would like to present because I think when you hold them up side by side, H.R. 8 will win.

   Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from Alabama for his kind remarks. 
   Mr. President, I heard some astonishing claims this morning and somewhat this afternoon. I would like to try to respond to some of the things that have been said by some of our friends on the other side of the aisle. 
   Let me, first of all, note for those who might be watching this that the primary object of those on the minority side is to stop us from having a vote on the repeal of the death tax. That is the last thing in the world they want. That is why they are trying to confuse the issue by suggesting that they want to offer all kinds of amendments that have nothing whatsoever to do with the death tax in order to prevent us from ever getting to a vote on the death tax. 
   When we keep talking about cloture, I will explain to those who aren't familiar with Senate terms that it is required because the distinguished minority leader will not reach an agreement with the majority leader on the terms under which we could bring this up for a vote. So we have to get 60 Senators who will agree to finally bring this matter to a close so we can actually have a vote. That will be a very important vote. Whether or not we get 60 votes, we don't know. But I am counting on a great deal of bipartisan support because we have bipartisan support in the House of Representatives which voted overwhelmingly for H.R. 8, which is the bill before us. There are nine Democratic sponsors of the Kyl-Kerrey bill, which is part of H.R. 8. That is the bill we introduced to repeal the death tax which was then incorporated in the House bill. 
   Just a quick reminder that the House bill and what we are debating here today will reduce the rates over a 10-year period and in the tenth year repeal the estate tax altogether by, in effect, replacing it with a capital gains tax. That is one of the points I will get to later. We are not forgoing all of this revenue, as people on the other side of the aisle have argued. 
   Actually, the taxes that will be collected when property is eventually sold and taxed under capital gains is just about the same amount that would be collected under the death tax. Anyway, chances are there won't be much revenue lost, even if that is a concern in this era of many hundred-billion-dollar surpluses. I want to start with those particular comments. 
   As I said, I was astonished by some of the claims made here. Let me mention two: 
   One by the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. DORGAN, who in effect said that the estate tax should be imposed on successful people as the price for the privilege of living in America and making a lot of money. 
   That turns the American dream on its head. The American dream, as I understand it, and as folks with whom I have talked in Arizona understand, is being able to work hard, to save, to invest, and to be able to create a situation where the next generation can have a little better opportunity than you had. That is the American dream. We all live for that, for our kids and our grandkids. It is exactly the opposite as expressed by some on the other side--that if you are successful, by golly, the Government is going to come in and take it all from you. No, excuse me--take half it from you when you die. First, they are not taking it from you. They are taking from your employees, from your kids, and from your grandkids. That is not fair. That is not the American dream. 
   The Senator from California, Mrs. BOXER, employing some of the new Gore rhetoric, said it all boils down to a question of, Whose side are you on? Well, I will accept that challenge. Whose side are we on here?

   Mr. KYL. I will not read the entire list. It includes not only organizations that we are familiar with such as the American Farmer Bureau Federation, the National Federation of Independent Business, the National Newspapers Association, the Small Business Legislative Council, and groups similar to that. It also includes groups such as the National Black Chamber of Commerce, the National Indian Business Association, the National Association of Neighborhoods, U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, the Texas Conference of Black Mayors. Also, environmental organizations such as the Wildlife Society, the Isaak Walton League, Wildlife Management Institute, International Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, and more. 
   Whose side are you on? We are on the side of the American people who believe, by percentages of 70 to 80 percent, the death tax ought to be repealed. That is whose side we are on. If we could ask the American people, 70 percent to 80 percent of whom believe this ought to be repealed, how do they vote, they vote to repeal it. That is whose side we are on. 
   The second point was, we should soak the rich; after all, they can afford it. There was a suggestion by Senator FEINGOLD a moment ago that, after all, this property never gets taxed unless we can tax it at the time of death. That is not what this bill says. We replace the death tax with the capital gains tax. Death is taken out of the equation. There is no tax when someone dies. But when the heirs decide to sell the property, if they ever do, they pay a capital gains tax, as the original owner would. They pay it on the basis of the original owner's cost in that. 
   This is why, according to the President's own budget, the Analytical Perspective of the Budget of the United States, for this next fiscal year, notes that the step-up basis of capital gains on at death--the current law--in effect costs the Federal Government almost $153 billion over a 5-year period. That is about the tax collections from the inheritance tax. 
   While I am not suggesting this is going to be a complete wash, I am suggesting there is not going to be all that much revenue lost to the Treasury, if you are concerned about that and with multihundreds of billions of dollars of surplus. I am not concerned about revenue to the Treasury. If that is your concern, be not concerned. According to the President's own budget, the step-up in basis loses the Federal Government about $153 billion. If you calculate the amount of the estate tax that will be collected over 5 years, it is not a great deal more than that. 
   What is this business of step-up in basis? Senator FEINGOLD said this property is never taxed and that is why we have to have a death tax. It is taxed. First, your income is taxed. You are then going to buy things with it. You buy stock; you will invest in other kinds of investment. Of course, you spend a great deal of it. Whatever you spend, you are spending with after-tax  dollars. It has already been taxed. However, if you want to tax it again, the fair way to tax it again is not at death, over which the decedent has no control, but rather as a capital gain by the individual or people who end up selling the asset, if and when they sell. That is an economic decision taking tax consequences into account. That is what we do here. 
   I am afraid some on the other side have not read the bill. What it does is, in effect, replace the estate tax with a capital gains tax. But a 20-percent capital gains rate is a whole lot better than a 55-percent death tax rate. The voluntary decision to sell the property and accept that tax burden is a whole lot more fair than having to pay the tax at death. This is not property that is not being taxed and, in fact, it is taxed as a result of the way we have structured this legislation.

   Mr. KYL. I will read from part of this piece. He is a senior fellow with the National Center for Policy Analysis.  
   The latest data from the Internal Revenue Service tells the story. In 1997, more than 50 percent of all estate and gift taxes were collected from estates under $5 million. Only 20 percent came from the very wealthy--those with estates more than $20 million.  
   He goes on:  
   An estate between $2.5 million and $5 million actually pays a higher rate than that paid by estates of more than $20 million--15 percent for the former and only 11.8 for the later.  
   How can this be, he asks, when estate tax rates are steeply progressive, taxing estates of more than $3 million at a 55-percent rate? The answer is, that estate planning can eliminate the tax if someone wants to spend enough money and enough time in setting up trusts and organizing one's affairs for that purpose. 
   Those with more wealth obviously take advantage of that, whereas the small farmer, the small businessman or someone with a modest stock portfolio is not going to do it, and, in fact, doesn't, according to the statistics. The Government gets more than two-thirds of all estate tax revenue from the estates under $10 million. The idea that taxing the stuffing out of such estates does anything to equalize the distribution of wealth in America, he says, is ludicrous. All it does is prevent those with modest assets from becoming wealthy. Academic research has shown that estate taxes squeeze vital liquidity out of small businesses, often forcing them to sell out to larger competitors. 
   I told the story earlier in this debate about a family in Arizona in which that is precisely what happened. 
   Thus, he concludes, the estate tax makes it more difficult for small firms to grow and become large. 
   He makes another point:  
   One could, perhaps, make a case for a heavy estate tax if there were evidence that a large share of the nation's wealthiest families got that way through inheritances. But this, in fact, is not the case in America and never has been. A 1961 study by the Brookings Institution found that only 6 percent of the wealthy acquired most of their assets through inheritance. Sixty-two percent reported no inheritance whatsoever. 
   A 1995 study by the Rand Corp. got similar results. They found among the top 5 percent of households, ranked by wealth, inheritance accounted for just 8 percent of assets. A 1998 study by U.S. Trust Corp. found among the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans' inheritances were a significant source of wealth for just 10 percent of them.  
   He concludes his piece with this:  
   It simply defies logic to tell people they need to save for retirement and then punish them for doing so by threatening to confiscate their estates after death. It is absurd to tell such people that they are the unworthy rich who merely won life's lottery, when every penny they have has come from their own hard work and investment. Yet that is what those fighting estate tax repeal are doing. 
   It is precisely because the estate tax is more of a tax on the middle-class that the left believes it to be that the repeal effort has gotten so far.  
   It seems to me, that the argument we have to keep this because it is important to soak the rich flies in the face of the studies I have cited. It is not the rich, in fact, who are getting soaked. 
   There has also been a suggestion, and Senator DORGAN made the point, there  are all kinds of ideas for how to spend the money collected by this tax. I am sure those who like to tax and spend, who like to redistribute wealth, who believe in the liberal class warfare rhetoric, will find lots of ways to spend money. As I pointed out, we already have a huge surplus. This doesn't even make a dent in it. 
   Their argument is, therefore, we ought to be voting on other issues rather than voting on this. One of them was we should vote on the Patients' Bill of Rights. We already voted on the Patients' Bill of Rights. The other side lost. They don't like to accept the fact they lost, but it is called accept majority rule. That is what democracy is all about. 
   They also want to vote on drug benefits. We are going to have votes on drug benefits. 
   Everybody in America understands that you do things in order. The House passed the estate tax repeal. It is now before the Senate. Let's get it done and then we can take up that other legislation the other side wants to take up. It will be taken up. Let's do this now. 
   What is the reason not to? It all boils down to politics. That is the unfortunate proposition. 
   There is another point I find very interesting.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will make this point briefly. One of the alternatives suggested by the other side is to increase the amount of the exemption. The problem with that is there has never been a way to define who qualifies for the exemption in a simple enough way for it to be effective. In fact, we have a lot of tax experts who point out that few people are able to take advantage of the exemption today because it is just too difficult with which to comply. 
   In fact, the American Bar Association condemned it because it, in effect, created too much malpractice risk for lawyers who could not figure out how to make it work for their clients. It is considered the most dangerous section of the tax law because of the risk of malpractice claims. 
   I point out that currently there are 149 tax cases that have been decided and reported involving issues relating to section 2032A. The IRS has challenged the validity of section 2032A in estate planning, and the IRS has won approximately two-thirds of those cases. 
   Now section 2057, the successor, is the most dangerous and, if changed as suggested here, is going to be even worse, but it will, of course, create billions of dollars in legal and accounting fees. That is not what we should be all about, Mr. President. We should be about saving money for those who would no longer have to spend all of these millions of dollars to plan against the possibility of the estate tax. That is a huge amount of money that could be saved, about as much as is paid in estate taxes, by the way, and we can get back to a situation which is fair; namely, there will be a tax, but it will be a tax when the property is sold, not when the death occurs. 
   That is the basic fairness of this proposition. That is why I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture so we can vote for H.R. 8 and repeal this unfair death tax.

   Mr. KYL. Madam President, tomorrow the Senate is expected to vote on a motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to the consideration of the House-passed Death Tax Elimination Act, H.R. 8. I want to take a few minutes today to explain a key element of that legislation, one that wasn't discussed much during the House debate but which I think is critical to Senators understanding actually how the legislation works. 
   The bill which passed the House on June 9 by a vote of 279-136--incidentally, 65 House Democrats joined Republicans in very bipartisan support for the bill--ultimately repeals the Federal estate tax. But the change in policy is really more substantial than just that. The details are very important because they offer a way for both  sides of the aisle to bridge past differences with respect to the estate tax, specifically with respect to how transfers at death are taxed. 
   Although it is true that H.R. 8, the bill that passed the House, would repeal the estate tax at the end of a 10-year phaseout period, the appreciation and inherited assets would not go untaxed. That is a very important point, Madam President. This is a departure from previous estate tax repeal proposals. 
   Under H.R. 8, a tax would still be imposed, but it would be imposed when the inherited property is sold; that is, after the income is actually realized, rather than at the artificial moment of death. The House bill, therefore, removes death from the calculation of the imposition of the tax. Earnings from an asset would be taxed the same whether the asset were earned or inherited. 
   The plan broadens the capital gains tax base by using the decedent's basis in the property to calculate the tax. That 
   differs from current law where the basis can be stepped up to the fair market value at the time of death. In exchange for the broader tax base, a lower tax rate would apply. The capital gains tax rate would be the general rate that would apply. 
   I also note that a limited step-up in basis would be preserved to assure that small estates bear no new tax liability as a result of these changes. 
   What we have done is to ensure that nobody who would escape paying the estate tax would ever have to pay a capital gains tax on that amount of money, so everybody would be treated the same in terms of avoiding liability from any tax; and only those who choose to sell an asset at a later point in time, after the property is inherited, would pay a tax. They would pay a capital gains tax--a much lower rate than the estate tax--and they would have the benefit of an exemption even more generous from the estate tax today. 
   Here is how the bill would actually work. The estate tax would essentially be replaced by a capital gains tax. That tax would be imposed on the gain or the increase in value of the inherited property relative to its original basis or cost, plus any cost of improvements. As with the estate tax, as I said, there would be an amount of property exempt from taxation. In the case of the new capital gains tax, the exemption would be $1.3 million of gain. That is, the decedent's basis would be exempt, whatever that amount of money is, plus $1.3 million. That exemption would be divided among all of the heirs. Now, $1.3 million is the amount that can be currently shielded from the estate tax by family-owned businesses or farms. So we have provided a basic exemption here that is the same as the most generous exemption under today's law. 
   In addition to that, we provide an additional exemption. A surviving spouse will be entitled to $3 million more, in addition to the exemption I just mentioned; that means the decedent's basis--his cost of the property--plus $3 million for the property transferred by the decedent to him or her. For married couples, there is an additional $1.3 million in exempt gains that can be added for the second spouse, for a total exemption of $5.6 million above the decedent's basis in the property, $1.3 million for the first spouse, plus $1.3 million for the second spouse, plus $3 million for spousal transfers. 
   In each case, the exempt amount is added to the basis. It, of course, cannot exceed the fair market value of the property at the time of death. That is the way these exemptions add up. They provide a significant exemption from the payment of any capital gains tax even when the property was inherited and later sold. 
   Why is this change important? For one thing, it removes death as the trigger for the tax. That is the object that most of us want to achieve--to take death out of the equation. It is an artificial event. People are certainly not making plans based upon death. I don't think anybody can justify death being a taxable event. Ordinarily, we see taxable events as the earning of income, the gain of profit from an investment, the sale of property, and the result of income from that. Those are taxable kinds of events. Death is purely an artificial event which should not be a trigger for any payment of tax. In fact, we all appreciate that it creates a great hardship on families at the very time of death. 
   For example, frequently the owner of the business--the person who started the business--has to figure out at that very difficult time in their life how to pay the estate tax. Frequently, the only way to do that is actually to sell the business, sell the farm, or sell the assets in order to acquire enough liquid assets to pay the estate tax. It takes death out of the equation. 
   That is the first object of this. I think it is the most important. 
   But a tax would be imposed on the beneficiaries of an estate just as it would have been imposed if someone had realized a capital gain during his or her lifetime. The beneficiaries of an estate would not only inherit assets but they would also inherit the decedent's tax basis on that property. The trigger for the tax is, therefore, the sale of the assets and the realization of income. That is the appropriate time to levy a tax--not when someone dies. 
   Advocates of the death tax often note that it serves as a backstop for the income tax by imposing taxes at death on income that previously escaped taxation. They are referring to capital gains that have never been realized. It is theoretically possible for that to be the case, although it is ordinarily true that you have spent ordinary income to acquire an asset and you have already paid income taxes on that ordinary income. But for someone who may have come into property in some other way, there could theoretically be unrealized gains that would escape taxation, except for the proposal that we have. 
   It is true that under current law those gains, but for the estate tax, would go untaxed forever because of the step-up basis. In other words, under current law, you acquire the market value as of the date of death, and that is the value of the property. So if you later dispose of it, there is very little gain if you dispose of it quickly. But of course you have to pay a 55-percent or lower percent death tax on that property. 
   The House-passed bill addresses this concern of unrealized gains never being taxed head on. It not only eliminates the death tax but also the step-up basis. So unrealized gains will ultimately be taxed if and when the inherited property is sold off. Therefore, nothing escapes taxation. 
   This concept, I must confess, was one which I heard Senator MOYNIHAN talking about when I first presented the death tax 
   repeal to the Finance Committee. There was some concern. While we all appreciate that it is not good tax policy to impose a tax at the time of death, there has to be some way to recapture a tax on these unrealized gains. This is the proposal that does that. Therefore, it is not only eminently fair but it conforms the tax policy for everyone--people who acquire a decedents' estate or people who simply earn money--and it doesn't contain this bad element of taxing at the time of death. Instead, when you make the economic decision to sell property you have inherited--if you make that decision--you know what the tax consequences are. You know how much income you are going to receive. You can figure out how much tax you are going to pay. If you decide to go ahead and sell at that point, then you pay a capital gains tax using the original basis. But it is your decision based upon your timing and your economic circumstance and not because of a fortuitous event of death. 
   It is interesting; President Clinton's fiscal year 2001 budget, on page 109 of the analytical perspectives, scores the existing step-up basis in capital gains and death at $28.2 billion in fiscal year 2001, and a total of $152.96 billion over 5 years. So elimination of the step-up basis as proposed in H.R. 8 can, therefore, be expected to recoup a portion of the revenue lost from the death tax repeal. That reduces the cost of the death tax repeal substantially. 
   To say it another way, when you eliminate the death tax altogether, you are eliminating all of that revenue. But if you come back and collect a capital gains tax using the original basis on any of the inherited assets that are later sold, the Federal Government is at least going to recoup some of that revenue. Will it be 40 percent? Will it be 30 percent? I don't know. 
   But it is interesting that the President's own people score the step-up  basis of capital gains at death at over $28 billion in fiscal year 2001. That is roughly the amount of the estate tax that is going to be collected. 
   So if you assume that all of the property would be immediately sold, then the Government theoretically would recoup all of that money. 
   That won't happen. Obviously, people will wait a while to sell assets. But the point is that it illustrates the Government is not going to have a total loss of revenue as a result of the repeal of the estate tax. There will be revenue coming in from the capital gains tax that replaces it. 
   I think whatever revenue losses are associated with repeal, of course, also needs to be put in perspective. This is the point that is most important to me. 
   The President's budget, on page 2, estimates that revenues for 2001 will amount to over $2 trillion, rising to $2.92 trillion--almost $3 trillion--by the year 2010, the year that the death tax repeal would actually be implemented. In other words, by 2010, the Federal Government will collect an additional $840 billion in just that 1 year. Surely, with an $840 billion surplus in just that tenth year that the estate tax is repealed, we can afford to eliminate this unfair tax and still satisfy pressing national needs with the additional $840 billion. 
   It is pretty clear when you put that in perspective that no one should vote against estate tax repeal on the basis that the Federal Government can't afford it. Clearly, it can afford it. 
   One final point: I call Senators' attention to a letter 
   that should be reaching their offices from the National Association of Women Business Owners, or NAWBO as it is sometimes called. The organization is writing in very strong support of death tax elimination. They write that women business owners in the country employ one out of every four workers. 
   By the way, about half of the small businesses in the country are women owned. So this is a very important point to the National Association of Women Business Owners. It is one of the groups that very strongly supported us when we had the White House conference, and repeal of the death tax was No. 4 on the list of legislative items. 
   In any event, here is what they write with respect to the point that one out of over four workers, or about 27 million workers in the United States, are employed by women business owners:  
   When a woman-owned business has to be sold to pay the death tax, jobs are lost.  
   This was written by president Barbara Stanbridge and vice president for public policy, Sheila Brooks. 
   They say, ``on average, 39 jobs per business, or 11,000 jobs, have already been lost due to the planning and payment of the death tax.'' 
   It is not only the payments that will suffer, but it is also the planning. The payments that go to the lawyers, estate planners, and insurance also increases expenses and results in job loss. 
   NAWBO projects on average 103 jobs per business--or a total of 28,000 jobs--will be lost as a result of the tax over the next 5 years. 
   Ms. Stanbridge and Ms. Brooks note that women businesses are just starting to grow. Many are first-generation businesses, and they have just begun to realize that, due to the death tax, their business will not be passed on to the next generation--at least not without a 55-percent estate tax and perhaps a 55-percent gift tax during life. Most of the businesses can't afford to pay the tax. As I said before, they are sold off frequently to big corporations that are not subject to the death tax. 
   Let me make this point. 
   I was asked by a reporter today what the original theory of death tax was. The reporter said it doesn't seem to make any sense. It doesn't make sense. But the original theory was they would prevent the accumulation of wealth. It was put in at a time when it was kind of the progressive or populist time, and there was a feeling that we should prevent the accumulation of wealth. 
   Let me give you a story of a friend of mine in Phoenix, AZ. He came to Arizona from New York and built a printing business. Eventually, he employed about 200 people. He was a very successful entrepreneur. A lot of people depended on Jerry Wisotsky, a pillar of the community, who contributed huge sums of money to all kinds of causes. He was a very rough and gruff guy on the exterior. On the interior, he had a heart of gold. He could not turn down any request for a charity in town. He was very generous. All of his family were. When he died, the family found that everything had been plowed back into the business--the latest of printing equipment and so on. He had no hard cash to pay the huge estate tax. They had to sell the business. 
   To whom did they sell it? It was some big conglomerate--a big German company, I think. But it was a big corporation. 
   So much for the death tax preventing the accumulation of wealth. 
   It took a whole bunch of wealth from one family in Phoenix, AZ, and transferred it to a big international corporation. 
   It doesn't prevent the accumulation of wealth. It concentrates wealth in the big companies that end up being able to afford to buy the business--frequently at bargain basement prices. It is unfair. It is not good for communities. 
   I made the point about contributions of this one family. As I said, that family used to contribute to every charity in Arizona. They are still very generous, but they don't have the assets they used to have when Jerry owned the business. This argument that charities are going to suffer if we repeal the estate tax I know to be wrong. 
   I am waiting for the first executive director of some big charity organization in the community to come back to me and lobby against the repeal of the estate tax on the grounds that it will hurt contributions to charity. I will immediately call every member of that person's board of directors and say: Do you know what your hired person is lobbying for back here? They are lobbying to pay 55 percent of the estate tax to the U.S. Government because it might be an incentive to contribute more to their charity. 
   I think these folks will turn tail and go home. The reality is people who are big hearted will make big contributions, as the Wisotsky family, and they can do it if they have an income stream coming, rather than if they have to sell the business to somebody else. 
   I talked about the women-owned businesses. Minority-owned businesses are in the same position, which is why we have strong support from various minority business organizations. However, the point of repeal of the estate tax is it is in keeping with the American dream. The American dream is to work hard, be successful, and give your children a greater opportunity than you had. That is the American dream. The estate tax works counter to the American dream, the ability to pass on something to your children and grandchildren after you have worked very hard during your lifetime to save that money. 
   That is another point. The death tax penalizes savers. We talk about tax policy and trying to promote savings and investment. The estate tax is exactly contrary to that. On the one hand, the Federal Government seeks to encourage people to save through IRAs, Roth IRAs, 401(k)'s, education savings accounts, and lower tax rates on capital gains. Yet on the other hand, it penalizes savers upon their death with death tax rates as high as 55 percent. 
   Consider two couples with similar lifetime earnings. One spends lavishly during their lifetime and leaves only a small estate. That couple is not subject to the death tax. The second couple who foregoes lavish spending and sets money aside for family, for the future, for contingencies in the future--as the Government policy seeks to have them do--gets hit with a substantial tax on death degree. That is not right. It is not good tax policy or good national economic policy. 
   It is particularly not fair because there is a better way: Tax the gains when they are realized; don't tax at death. That is what the Death Tax Elimination Act is all about. I urge Senators to take a very close look at this when we have this issue of the cloture vote. Think very carefully about not allowing us to proceed. There is some notion that politically some people will want to use the death tax repeal legislation to offer all kinds of nongermane amendments to make whatever other 
   points they may want to make. Everybody around here knows the Senate schedule is very tight. Everybody knows the death tax repeal is  extremely popular around the country. A very high percentage, 70 to 80 percent of the American people, support its repeal. It passed the House of Representatives. If everyone had been there, it would be a veto-proof vote. I believe it will be a veto-proof vote. It is pretty clear the death tax repeal is going to pass. It will be successful if it comes to a vote. 
   I don't know whether some people plan to play political games and use this vehicle to score political points on totally unrelated matters. I urge those Members to think very carefully about that strategy. If we are not able to get the clean version of the House bill, H.R. 8, to a vote, I will be standing on the floor pointing fingers at those people who have prevented the Senate from doing that. I think that is very fair. It is very appropriate. 
   The House of Representatives overwhelmingly repealed the death tax. The American people want it repealed. We will have an opportunity to consider it in the Senate. Those Senators who stand in the way of this, playing parliamentary games, using amendment tactics with amendments that are not germane to the estate tax, we are going to be on the floor pointing out the results of their efforts. If they stop this with those tactics, they will have to accept the consequences of their actions. It is fine with me to have people try to amend the bill. I don't think they will be successful. This bill, written by Chairman BILL ARCHER and Representative DUNN and others in the House of Representatives, including members of the minority, is very well put together. It reduces rates for the first 10 years and has a repeal at the end of the 10-year period. By then it is all gone. That should give everybody time to adjust to the fact that it is going to be repealed, however it will be repealed. 
   I hope my colleagues will not decide to try to derail the opportunity to repeal the death tax through a strategy either of denying cloture--in other words, the ability to bring the bill to a final vote on the floor of the Senate--or alternatively, to require the majority leader to agree to nongermane amendments, which obviously would sink the ship. 
   It is my understanding from talking to the majority leader today that he does not yet have an agreement to permit bringing the bill to the floor with a limited number of germane amendments, with a clear vote before the end of this week. If that can't be accomplished, we will have to move for cloture and we will have a cloture vote. I believe we will get cloture. When we do, then only germane amendments are allowed. There will be a vote by the end of the week. Members can't say they are for repeal of the death tax and then engage in tactics which prevent the Senate from ever getting to that vote. 
   Let me make a couple of other points. This is a very bipartisan approach both in terms of outside groups and the strong support we have had both in the House and in the Senate from Members on both side of the aisle. That is why I do not make a blanket action over who might use dilatory tactics. Many members of the minority are cosponsors of this legislation. When I originally developed this concept, Senator BOB KERREY of Nebraska was very supportive and immediately became a cosponsor of what is now known as the Kyl-Kerrey bill. We have 29 cosponsors. Frankly, we could have more. Nine are members of the minority party. The rest are members of the majority party. 
   Let me single out these members of the minority party who have been willing to support us. I am sure there will be more, but cosponsors include Senators BOB KERREY, JOHN BREAUX, CHUCK ROBB, BLANCHE LINCOLN, RON WYDEN, MARY LANDRIEU, MAX CLELAND, EVAN BAYH, and PATTY MURRAY. These are all Senators who I think have studied this and realize there is a tax on the unrealized gains incorporated in this bill, so it becomes a very fair bill just taking death out of the equation. I particularly thank those Senators for putting aside any partisanship in recognizing the importance of this repeal. 
   For those who are not totally familiar with the overall essence of the bill, let me describe the key elements of it. 
   As amended, H.R. 8 would, first, in the year 2001 convert the unified credit to a true exemption and repeal the so-called 5-percent bubble and expand the availability of qualified conservation easements. It would also repeal rates in excess of 53 percent in that first year. 
   Between 2002 and 2009 it would phase down the estate tax rates by 1 percent to 2 percent each year. 
   Third, in 2010 it would implement the Kyl-Kerrey language eliminating the death tax and implementing a carryover-basis regime, as I discussed earlier. 
   Over the Fourth of July, I had occasion to attend some ceremonies and hear our Founding Fathers quoted. Of course Benjamin Franklin is always one of the most fun to quote, but he is one who, some 200 years ago, said: Nothing in this world is certain but death and taxes. 
   It should come as no surprise that after 200 years the Federal Government would find a way to put those two inevitabilities together to create a death tax which is not only confiscatory but also offensive to the American sense of fairness and also harmful to small business and to the economy. It was also harmful to the environment, and this is so because what happens is families find, in order to pay the tax, they have to sell land they would like to keep in the family for its environmental value. But they find they have to sell it to generate income. Inevitably what happens is the property is developed. That development is the reason why there are conservation groups who have also joined us in opposition to the estate tax and in favor of its repeal. 
   There is another point I want to mention. Opponents of our legislation say this only affects a few people. First of all, it is not true; it affects a lot of people. It is true in the end only a few people have to end up paying. But a lot of people have spent a lot of money preparing various tax shelters to escape the payment of the estate tax. 
   Who benefits, of course, are the lawyers and the estate tax planners and the insurance companies. I have nothing against any of those folks, but I don't think we need to create tax policy just to create jobs for lawyers. I am a lawyer. I know I always had plenty to do without having to get into this. So I don't think any of those folks would have real grounds for suggesting that in order to keep them in business we have to keep the estate tax. So it is not just the people who pay, it is also the people who have to try to avoid paying. 
   There is another thing. The Chair is well aware of this because she and I share the same concern about this problem, as a result of which I understand either tomorrow or Wednesday there is going to be a hearing before the Aging Committee, talking about senior citizens who end up getting bilked or scammed because of people who come to them and say to avoid the death tax they have to give them a bunch of money to set up some kind of trust to save their assets. Most of these people are people who would not have to pay the tax; their estates are just not big enough to be taxed. They fall within the exemption. But they are afraid. They have heard about this death tax and they are susceptible to these scams which take large amounts of money from them under the guise of estate planning which is not necessary for them. 
   So you not only have the people who have to pay the tax, you not only have the people who have to pay not to pay the tax, but you also have people who get scammed into paying some of 
   these unscrupulous folks, setting up trusts they do not need because they would never be subject to the tax. 
   You also find--again I go back to the example I cited before--when businesses are sold, frequently jobs are lost, and those jobs are also affected, as I pointed out, by the reduced income from the businesses that have to prepare not to pay the tax. So it is just not true the tax only affects a limited number of people. In fact, I believe it was 3 years ago that we had the latest statistics for the amount of money spent to avoid paying the estate tax. It was almost exactly the same as the amount of tax paid in that particular year. In effect, it is a double taxation and a very inefficient tax when you have to pay that much money to avoid paying the tax. 
   Edward McCaffrey--I don't think he would mind me putting this label on him--who is a liberal, a professor of law at the University of Southern California, put it this way.   
   Polls and practices show that we like sin taxes, such as on alcohol and cigarettes........The estate tax is an anti-sin, or virtue tax. It is a tax on work and savings without consumption, on thrift, on long-term savings.  
   He is exactly right. We may all be for sin taxes. But one of the reasons why the bulk of Americans, whether they will ever have to pay the tax or not, oppose the estate tax is they realize it is contrary to everything we believe in America. It is not a tax on sin; it is a tax on virtue--saving something for your kids when you die. 
   Let me also cite economists Henry Aaron and Alicia Munnell, making the very same point. Writing in a 1992 study, they said that death taxes:  
   [H]ave failed to achieve their intended purposes. They raise little revenue. They impose large excess burdens. They are unfair.  
   As I noted, opinion polls constantly show between 70 percent and 80 percent of Americans favor repeal of the death tax. When Californians had the chance to weigh in with a ballot proposition, they voted 2 to 1 to repeal their State's death tax. I think that is a very important point because that vote was very recent. 
   The legislatures of six other States have enacted legislation since 1997 that would either eliminate or significantly reduce the burden of their States' death taxes. In fact, the minority leader was here a moment ago. I note on the ballot in the home State of the distinguished minority leader, South Dakota, there will be a proposition this fall for the elimination of the death tax. 
   If you talk to the men and women who run small businesses around the country, if you talk to people who join in meetings, gatherings that I talk to all the time, you will find very strong support for repeal of the tax. Remember, it is a tax that is imposed on a family business when it is least able to afford the payment, on the death of the person with the greatest practical and institutional knowledge of that business' operations. That is the reason why so many businesses cannot make it to the second generation or the third. 
   I mentioned before the women- and minority-owned businesses. Instead of passing hard-earned and successful businesses on to the next generation, many of these families have had to sell their companies in order to pay the death tax. That certainly stops the upward mobility that is so important to some of these groups. It is why death tax repeal is supported by groups such 
   as the National Association of Women Business Owners, the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, the National Black Chamber of Commerce, the National Indian Business Association, and the National Association of Neighborhoods. 
   This is a very wide spectrum of organizations representing a very broad spectrum of the American community. I cannot think of a policy that has come to the Senate in recent times that has a more broad appeal to it than the repeal of this very unfortunate and unfair tax. 
   I mentioned before the argument about concentration of wealth. I just want to go back to that for a moment. There is a February 2000 study by the National Association of Women Business Owners, the Independent Women's Forum and the Center for the Study of Taxation combined. It found the death tax costs female entrepreneurs nearly $60,000 on death tax planning, obviously money they could use to put back into their businesses. They report that 39 jobs were lost per business due to the costs of death tax planning during the last 5 years. Think about that. Women business owners report that the cost of death tax planning will create 103 new jobs per business in the next 5 years. 
   Think about that statistic. Most of the businesses we think about are much smaller than that to begin with, but we know small businesses can grow to 200 or 300 employees if they are successful. These numbers are staggering when you stop to think about the amount of job loss that results, just from the costs of planning to avoid the estate tax. It is an incredible statistic. 
   There is a June 1999 survey of the impact of the death tax on family business employment levels in upstate New York which found that the average spending for death tax planning was as much as $125,000 per company. Think of that. For the 365 businesses surveyed, the total number of jobs lost already as a result of the cost of death tax planning was over 5,100 jobs. 
   The average estimated number of jobs these businesses would lose over the next 5 years if they actually had to pay the death tax exceeds 80 per business, with the numbers of jobs at risk at a minimum of 15,000 jobs. This is just among something like 300 companies in upstate New York. These are staggering statistics. If you expand that to the rest of the country, it is impossible to argue that the estate tax is not my problem, that it is just for a few rich folks. It affects everybody in this country. 
   What it suggests to me is that although it is paid by only a small number of individual taxpayers, it has a disproportionately large negative impact on the economy. As someone said, it is the tax with the longest shadow of any on the books. 
   The adverse consequences are compounded over time, too. A December 1998 report by the Joint Economic Committee concluded that the existence of a death tax in this century has reduced the stock of capital in the economy by nearly half a trillion dollars. 
   Think about what a half of a trillion dollars of capital stock infused into the economy in the future could mean. These surpluses that are projected now would be expanded even more significantly because the growth in capital would obviously provide a lot more return on investment. 
   It is really staggering when one stops to think about the impact of this one tax and how pernicious it is, all the way from the individual minority-owned business to the economy of the United States losing half a trillion dollars in capital stock. Just think, by repealing the death tax and putting those resources to better use, the joint committee estimates that as many as 240,000 jobs could be created just over a period of 7 years. Americans would have an additional $24.4 billion in disposable personal income over that period of time. If we said to the American people: We have a great deal for you; how would you like another $25 billion in the next 7 years and all we have to do is repeal this tax that does not bring in revenues to the United States proportionate to the cost that it imposes on the economy, I think they would say that is a very good deal. 
   It seems to me almost all of the arguments for those who used to favor the tax have been pretty well laid to the side, and the only question now is how we are going to get this to a vote in the Senate and how we are then going to be able to send it to the President. 
   I mentioned the cost to the environment a moment ago. Maybe those who have in mind offering amendments would like to consider this for just a moment: An increasing number of families who own environmentally sensitive lands, as I said before, have had to sell property for development to raise the money to pay the death tax, which destroys natural habitats as a result. With that in mind, Michael Bean of The Nature Conservancy observed that the death tax is highly regressive in the sense that it encourages the destruction of ecologically important land. So maybe folks who were planning to speak in opposition to this would like to take that into consideration. 
   Because it tends to encourage development and sprawl, a lot of environmental organizations have endorsed its repeal. Among those organizations: The Izaak Walton League, the Wildlife Society, Quail Unlimited, the Wildlife Management Institute, and the International Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies. 
   Incidentally, pending repeal in 2010, as I noted before, H.R. 8 expands the availability of qualified conservation easements, which is something I am sure all of these conservation organizations support. 
   For all of these reasons, it is going to be very hard to explain why we would not support repeal of this tax. It overwhelmingly passed in the House of Representatives. 
   The repeal portion of the death tax recaptures taxes on unrealized gains, something that had been a problem for some Members of the other side of the aisle. I understand why, and I was happy to include that compromise in this legislation, and Representative ARCHER did the same.  
   In the meantime, it enhances conservation easements, reduces rates. I really cannot think of a good argument against this. And yet constituents may ask: Why can't you get it to a vote? Why do you need to worry about this? 
   The reason is, frankly, because of the rules of the Senate, any Senator has the ability to raise nongermane matters until we have had a cloture motion voted on and approved. There are 
   those who would like to take advantage of this opportunity to raise their favorite issue in that way. If enough people do that with these nongermane riders which we have all heard so much about, it can sink the ship that otherwise would carry the legislative business to the President for his signature. 
   I hope that will not happen. I hope very much we can reach an agreement to quickly take up and consider any amendments and then vote for the repeal of the estate tax, vote for the House-passed bill, H.R. 8. I hope we can do that tomorrow at the very latest. If we cannot, then obviously we are going to have to file cloture and have that vote on Thursday. 
   I encourage all of my colleagues to look at this legislation very carefully because there is some misinformation about it. I know I talked for some time today, but hopefully I have been able to answer some of the questions that have been raised in my remarks. I stand ready to work with Senators who want to understand better exactly what we are trying to do here, what the effect of it will be, and what the many organizations are that support this legislation because they are significant. I certainly hope they will make their feelings known during the course of the next few days, too, because it is important for our colleagues to understand the depth and breadth of support for repeal of the estate tax. 
   I conclude by thanking Senator LEVIN, again, for allowing me to take this time and to urge my colleagues to support H.R. 8, to agree to a time agreement that will enable us to take it up in a timely fashion, to get it disposed of with germane amendments as quickly as possible so we can have a vote on repeal sometime this week. 
   That is something the American people would feel very proud we accomplished. Everyone can go back to their constituencies and brag about it. It is not partisan; it is bipartisan. Republicans cannot brag they did it all alone because many Democrats in the House made it possible with a veto-proof margin. Without the support of our Democratic colleagues in the Senate, I know we would not have gotten this far today. 
   I am very hopeful people on both sides of the aisle will see not just the fairness of it but the political benefit in responding to our constituents, which is, after all, what we are supposed to be doing around here. We know they would like to see repeal, and I think it is time for us to show them we can get something done here; we can do this and not hide behind all of the usual parliamentary maneuvers that are so common in the Senate. 
   I am very hopeful we will be able to finish this bill by the end of this week, send it on to the President, and go back to our constituents and say we did something very important for them: We repealed the death tax. 
   I thank the Chair, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. KYL. In that event, Mr. President, I would like to conclude with some remarks in opposition to the nominee. 
   With all due respect to Senator LEVIN--he knows I have the utmost respect for him--I believe Madelyn Creedon is not qualified for this very important position, one of the most important positions in our Government. She has never held the kind of positions, as her predecessors have, that would qualify her to head this particular agency. 
   The Deputy Administrator for Defense Programs has the direct authority over the Directors of the three National Laboratories, the head of the Nevada Test Site, and the heads of the four nuclear weapons production facilities. This is the person who is in charge of our nuclear weapons production facilities, as well as the nuclear weapons laboratories and programs. 
   While Ms. Creedon has worked as Senator LEVIN's counsel, before that and in between working for Senator LEVIN, she has also served as general counsel on the Base Closure Commission. She also served for a little over a year as an assistant to the Deputy Secretary of Energy. And she was counsel for special litigation at the Department of Energy from 1980 to 1990. 
   She has never had the kind of educational background or administrative background that would qualify her for this position. The Deputy Administrator will be called upon to manage numerous large and very technically complex projects that are expanding the limits of America's scientific knowledge. Experience in managing large organizations and a technical background are highly desirable. 
   The previous holder of this position, for example, Dr. Victor Reis, has a Ph.D. in physics and previously headed the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency--or DARPA, as we know it--and also served as Director of Defense Research and Engineering at the Department of Defense. 
   We have known for a long time that our nuclear weapons program has had great problems. With the appointment now of General Gordon to head the security side of this program, as Senator DOMENICI has just talked about, I think it is important that we have somebody really well qualified as the Deputy Administrator. I do not believe it is accurate to say that Ms. Creedon is his nominee. I think it is accurate to say he has no objection to her nomination. 
   But as was pointed out, her nomination was made prior to the time he took his position. While I am certain that her nomination will be confirmed here today, I think for those of us who believe very strongly in national security, a strong nuclear weapons program, and a future that will ensure that our weapons are safe and reliable, it requires us to vote ``no'' on a nomination which is clearly inferior. 
   There are 50 people who could readily be identified who have far superior qualifications to serve in this highly technical, very important post. For that reason, again, with all due deference to Senator LEVIN, and with deference to the nominee, I will be voting ``no'' and urging my colleagues to do the same. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, today the Senate is voting on final passage of the FY2001 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education appropriations bill, H.R. 4577. 
   This measure includes funding for many good and worthwhile programs: medical research conducted by the National Institutes of Health, a drug-demand reduction initiative, efforts to combat bioterrorism, Pell Grants, Impact Aid, and services for older Americans, to name a few. 
   The amount of funding allocated to this bill is very generous: $97.8 billion in discretionary appropriations, or about 12 percent over last year's level. 
   There are very substantial increases provided for particular programs. For example, there is a 12 percent increase for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, a 13 percent increase for the Ricky Ray Hemophilia Relief Fund, a 15 percent increase for the National Institutes of Health, a 19 percent increase for Head Start, and a 13 percent increase for education. 
   I believe the OSHA increase, for one, is something that can and should be cut back in conference. If we want to maintain the other large increases, though, we need to find other programs, of lesser priority, to cut in order to moderate the total cost of the bill. 
   My concern is, as we get to conference, there will be pressure to increase spending even more. We are going to hear a lot, for example, about the need for more funding for the Social Services Block Grant program. If  the amount in the bill for SSBG is going to be increased, we are going to have to find somewhere else to cut. I hope proponents of these increases will keep that in mind as we proceed to conference. 
   The sky is not the limit here. I am going to support this bill today to get it to conference, but I am not inclined to support a dollar more in the conference report. We have got to do a better job of prioritizing, or we will soon find Congress once again raiding the Social Security surpluses to pay for other government programs. 
   We just put a stop to that two years ago. We have to honor our commitment to preserve Social Security surpluses for Social Security. 
   The question is on the engrossment of the amendments and third reading of the bill. 
   The amendments were ordered to be engrossed, and the bill to be read a third time. 
   The bill was read a third time.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I, too, want to comment briefly on the comments of the Senator from New Mexico. We will have a lot more to say about this in the future because this is a national crisis. 
   For today, let me simply acknowledge that what Senator DOMENICI and Senator CRAIG have said represents a huge challenge to this Nation. According to the GAO, 38 million acres of forests in the United States are in jeopardy of either dying or burning unless they are quickly treated. We have less than 20 years to accomplish this treatment. It is not only the risk of catastrophic forest fires, including the danger to communities around which these forests are located, but also the prospect that they will die of disease or malnutrition because they are so crowded together that they are competing for the nutrients and the water which, at least in the Southwest, are so scarce. 
   In the area of Arizona where there has been research into this--now at least half a dozen years of experience--we find that when the areas are thinned and then prescribed burning is introduced, you don't get the catastrophic fire. You do get much better tree growth, more pitch content, so that they are not subject to the beetle infestation, for example, and higher protein content so the grasses can grow on the floor. This brings in more mammals and birds into the area. And the forest returns to the park-like condition that existed at the turn of the century. 
   There have been a lot of bad policies since then, and a century of activity which resulted in the destruction of the national forests of this country. 
   The task is huge. We need to get started. I will be supporting the efforts of the Senator from New Mexico and others in trying to ensure that we can literally save our beautiful national forests. 
   I thank the Senator.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the Senate is today considering the conference report to accompany the FY2001 military construction appropriations bill, H.R. 4425. The bill includes funding for military facilities and infrastructure, including base improvements, operation and training facilities, barracks and family housing, and environmental compliance. 
   Attached to the military construction bill is a supplemental spending package for FY2000 that includes funding for anti-drug efforts, including in Colombia, funds to replenish defense accounts that have been drawn down by the Clinton administration to pay for military operations in Kosovo and Bosnia, and funds for disaster assistance, wildland firefighting activities, and administrative expenses associated with repeal of the Social Security earnings limitation earlier this year. 
   I am pleased that the total cost of the supplemental package was reduced from the original $13 billion proposed by the House to about $11 billion. I want to commend the Majority Leader, Senator LOTT, and the Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator STEVENS, for working to limit the cost of the supplemental package. 
   I think we could have gone further, though. The bill includes about $600 million for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. I question the need to include that money here. There is $7 million for peanut assessments. There is language in the bill that lifts the firewall that would prevent defense funds from being diverted to certain domestic programs. These are things I would omit from the bill, if I could. 
   The fact is, though, that the bulk of the supplemental spending is urgently needed, even though some provisions of questionable merit have been included. More than half of the supplemental--$6.5 billion--is required to replenish defense operations and maintenance accounts that President Clinton has tapped to cover the cost of unauthorized military missions around the globe, including in Bosnia and Kosovo. Because O&M accounts have been seriously depleted, we find that we are now on the brink of serious readiness problems in our military if we do not replenish these accounts, and do so quickly. 
   Mr. President, the firefighting money in this bill--$350 million--like the defense money--is an urgent matter. The Los Alamos, New Mexico, fires have dominated the news, but wildfires this year have consumed more than 25,000 acres in Arizona, as well. Nationwide, over one million acres have burned this year, and we still have several months remaining in our fire season. The money in this bill will reimburse the Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service for costs incurred in connection with firefighting efforts on the Grand Canyon rim and elsewhere around the country. The firefighting funds have to be allocated. 
   The bill allots $1.3 billion for counternarcotics activities, including Plan Colombia. That is a start, but we are likely going to have to do even more to help gain control of drug production and distribution from Colombia. 
   There are several items of particular importance to the state of Arizona that I would like to highlight at this point. First and foremost is language to prevent the Secretary of the Interior from moving forward with a unilateral reallocation of Central Arizona Project (CAP) water. This language is defensive in nature--that is, it is intended only to counter a threat by the Interior Secretary to reallocate CAP water by the end of the calendar year contrary to the terms of Indian water settlements now being negotiated. Water is a precious and scarce resource, and the allocation of CAP water is one of the most important decisions affecting the future of my state. Arizona simply cannot allow the Secretary to reallocate its water merely because he is about to leave office. 
   The bill includes a $12 million one-time appropriation to be split equally between Arizona, Texas, California, and New Mexico to help cover the overwhelming costs associated with processing criminal illegal immigrants and the significant number of border-related drug cases. 
   It also includes a one-time, $2 million appropriation for Arizona to assist Cochise County and other affected jurisdictions along the U.S.-Mexican border that are incurring significant costs for local law enforcement and criminal justice processing because of record-breaking levels of illegal immigration and smuggling of drugs and people into the state. 
   Dr. Tanis Salant, a professor at the University of Arizona, is close to completing a study on unreimbursed costs that occur as a result of increased illegal immigration in the area. He estimates that Arizona's border counties collectively spend $15.5 million to bring criminal illegal aliens to justice. Cochise County spends 33 percent of its overall local criminal justice budget to process criminal illegal immigrants. This does not even include incarceration costs, which are also severe. 
   Finally, the bill funds important military construction projects in the state: 
   $2.265 million to improve the readiness center at the Army National Guard's Papago Military Reservation; 
   $1.598 million for the readiness center at the Guard's Yuma installation; and 
   $3.35 million for the child-development center at Fort Huachuca. 
   These were projects that were not identified in the President's budget, but which are important priorities in the state. 
   As I said early on, there are some things in this bill that I do not support. There is questionable need for some of the military construction projects that are funded. The LIHEAP money should not be included here. Peanut assessments. The breaching of the defense firewall. But it seems to me that the good in the bill outweighs the bad. 
   Mr. President, I will vote for this bill. We have no choice but to replenish our defense accounts and pay for emergency items, like firefighting and disaster relief.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I introduce a bill today to facilitate the construction of a secondary port of entry in Yuma County. I introduce this measure in collaboration with Representative ED PASTOR, who has taken the lead on this issue in the House of Representatives and has seen his bill H.R. 3023, through to passage just this week by a vote of 404 to 1. 
   The identical bill I introduce today will convey to the Greater Yuma Port Authority an area of land currently controlled by the Bureau of Reclamation for the purpose of constructing a commercial port of entry on approximately 330 acres of land just east of the city of San Luis. 
   Anyone who has ever been to the U.S. port of entry in San Luis, Arizona, knows that traffic congestion there causes such bad delays that oftentimes individuals attempting to conduct cross-border trade there, bring goods across the border, or simply visit relatives and friends, are discouraged from crossing the border or are faced with spending two to four hours to cross. The port of entry at San Luis has become one of the busiest ports-of-crossing in the nation. 
   After months of negotiation, all of the local principals involved in this effort, from the city of Yuma to Yuma County, the city of San Luis and Somerton and the Cocopah Indian Nation, and the Bureau of Reclamation, now fully support this effort. The bill will facilitate the construction of an additional commercial port of entry just east of San Luis, to be conveyed to the Greater Yuma Port Authority (YMPO) for fair market value. 
   Mr. President, this legislation will make a difference to the people of Arizona, particularly to the people of Yuma and surrounding areas. It will help increase cross-border trade in the area, and will help to spur economic development for an Arizona region in need. I urge expeditious consideration of this legislation.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the reason I wanted to speak this afternoon is to address the issue of energy policy and gasoline prices. 
   It seems now that we are in the finger-pointing mode trying to blame one another for what is in effect a market condition; that is, the increasing rise in the price of gasoline. 
   My point this morning is that it should come as no surprise to any of us that gas prices have gone up. Why is this so? 
   First of all, thanks to Senator PETE DOMENICI, the chairman of the Energy and Water Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee, who yesterday in response to a question on a national TV program made, I think, the most succinct statement on this, we have the basic answer. He said, ``The chickens have come home to roost.'' 
   He said that after 7 years of the Clinton-Gore administration policy, which is in effect no policy with respect to improving our energy situation, ``The chickens have come home to roost.'' 
   While we have enjoyed a great time of prosperity in this country, we have been doing nothing to ensure that we would be able to provide the energy resources--the oil and gas on which our economy runs--at the time when our economy is up and running, as it is now; and, therefore, we should not be surprised that the demand for this product has outstripped the supply. He is correct in that. 
   Thanks to Senator MURKOWSKI, who chairs the Energy and Natural Resources Committee in the Senate, we have the statistics which back up this statement. 
   Since 1992, U.S. oil production is down 17 percent, but consumption is up  14 percent. That is the basic fact right there. Demand is up significantly but production in this country is down significantly. The reason production is down is because of the specific policies of this administration. 
   It should come as no surprise to us that when demand is greater and supply is less, the price is going to go up. Only those who do not understand the free market would fail to appreciate this fact and point the finger at someone else. 
   Imports, we learned from Senator MURKOWSKI, are now at 56 percent of our total supply and growing rapidly. In fact, they are in the neighborhood of about 62 percent during some months--specifically during this period of time. 
   By comparison, in 1973, during the time of the Arab oil embargo, we imported about 35 percent of foreign oil. 
   Remember how we were complaining at that point about how dependent upon these OPEC supplies we were--35 percent then and up to 62 percent now. 
   We are approaching twice as much dependency on foreign oil supplies as we had during the time of the great oil embargo of the early 1970s. 
   At current prices, I might add, the United States spends $300 million a day on imported oil. That is over $100 billion per year on foreign oil, which, incidentally, is about one-third of our entire trade deficit. 
   This puts into clear perspective the amount of our reliance on these foreign sources. 
   Are the people who supply this oil from abroad our friends when it comes to the supplying of this particular product? Are they working with us to keep the prices down? No. We know, as matter of fact, in this area even that our friends are willing 
   to take advantage of the great demand and thirst for this product in the United States. 
   The OPEC nations, which include our friend to the south, Mexico, and other countries in this hemisphere, but most especially the countries in the Middle East led by our friend, Saudi Arabia, have restricted the supply so as to drive the cost of the product up. 
   It is real simple. When we don't have control over the supply that our friends do, they will take advantage of us. Frankly, we can't blame them. That is part of the way the market operates. We would object that they have gathered together in the form of a monopoly or oligopoly, and they are controlling the price. But it is their ability to do that on the foreign market. We understand that. We should not be surprised by it. But we should be committed to doing something about it. 
   For 7 years, this administration not only has not done anything about it; it has gotten us more and more deeply in the hole of reliance on foreign oil. 
   I have a friend back home--a rancher. The Presiding Officer will probably appreciate this kind of western humor, since he likes to collect these items. He said he has an attitude. He said: When you are trying to get out of a hole, the first thing you do is stop digging. 
   I submit that we are going to keep digging the hole deeper and deeper if we don't stop this reliance on foreign oil, and if we don't start doing something about increasing our supply here at home. 
   It turns out that we have plenty of opportunities, which I will get to in just a moment. 
   One other fact that I think is important to note is that 36 refineries have closed since 1992. We have had no new refineries built in this country since 1976. It is not only the fact that we have less oil being produced in the United States, but also that less oil product is being refined in this country primarily because of the stringency of environmental regulations. 
   What has been the administration's policy? Its energy policy says that we should have a mix of energy sources. But let's look at the facts. 
   We have the lowest production in this country since world War II. We are importing more oil than ever before. We have regulations and taxes designed basically to close the oil industry. The President himself vetoed a bill to open so-called ANWR in 1995 with 16 billion barrels of oil--that is about a 30-year supply of imports from Saudi Arabia--and has instead advocated increasing royalty rates, which, of course, would make foreign investment even more attractive to U.S. companies and cause them to not want to produce oil here in this country. 
   I get letters from constituents who say we should close down any offshore drilling or any drilling of oil in the Alaska reserve. I think these people need to appreciate that there was an area cut out of the wilderness area in Alaska and designated specifically for the production of oil. It is a very small area. We created a vast new wilderness on the North Slope of Alaska. It is a beautiful area. I have been there. But we created a very small island in there in effect that does not have any particular environmental benefit compared to the areas around it. 
   We said in that particular area we would explore for oil. It is in that area that we are talking about producing this 16 billion barrels of oil. 
   I have been to that area. I suggest anybody who believes we should not pursue the exploration for oil in that area ought to visit it. I think they will see two things. First, we have found a way to drill for oil that is very environmentally safe and benign. In effect, in a very small area about the size of this Senate Chamber, up to 10 wells can be drilled at a depth of about 10,000 feet with another 10, 15, or more thousand feet of drilling horizontally to a point of oil. We have a very small area where the oil drilling is actually evident from the surface of the Earth but a very large area underneath from which the oil is taken. This is done in an extraordinarily environmentally safe way. You cannot even tell, when you are on the surface, what is being done. 
   We can explore for and obtain oil from these sites, such as the Alaska oil, as well as offshore sites, using the same technology without environmental damage. However, the administration has precluded us from doing so. 
   Now, we have a great deal of coal, much low sulfur. The cleanest coal in the lower 48 States was locked up when the President declared the large area of Montana a national monument and, therefore, we could not take advantage of the low-sulfur coal that is located in that area. 
   Nuclear power is the cleanest of all, but this administration has been opposed to nuclear power. In fact, there have been no new power plants, and the President, of course, vetoed the nuclear waste disposal bill. This is essential for the further development of nuclear power. 
   With respect to hydropower, we have a Secretary of Interior who says he was to be the first Secretary to tear down dams. We cannot produce hydropower without dams. 
   With respect to natural gas, vast areas of coal development in both the OCS and the Rocky Mountain area have been closed to natural gas. 
   The bottom line is this administration's policy is not conducive to the development of new sources of energy in the United States, even environmentally safe, environmentally benign sources. Instead, virtually every policy this administration has pursued has had the effect of reducing U.S. oil production and increasing our reliance upon foreign sources. All that does is enable those foreign sources to take advantage of this reliance by reducing their production and jacking up the price. American consumers are paying the result of that at the pump. 
   I have one or two other statistics. Since the start of the Clinton-Gore administration, according to Senator MURKOWSKI's figures, domestic oil production in the United States has fallen by 17 percent for the reasons I articulated. We can't, with that level of reduction in U.S. oil production, maintain a level which enables the U.S. to control our own destiny in terms of the price of oil. We are already spending over $100 billion per year on foreign oil, about a third of our trade deficit. 
   As a result of these facts, I have joined with Senator LOTT, our majority leader, and others, in introducing the National Energy Security Act of 2000, S. 2557, the goal of which is to roll back our dependence on foreign oil to a level below 50 percent. 
   In conclusion, there has been a lot of finger pointing. Some say it is the result of taxes. I support, at least 
   temporarily--in fact, I would support permanently--removing the 18.4-percent Federal gas tax. People say that is only a drop in the bucket. It is almost 20 cents on the price of a gallon of gas. That is not peanuts if you have to fill your car as much as a lot of folks do. 
   The EPA has been changing its mind about additives. In some parts of the  country that has increased the cost of a gallon of gasoline. 
   We have fewer refineries, as I indicated. 
   Most of all, it is ``the chickens are coming home to roost'' answer that Senator DOMENICI provided; namely, that we have decreased the United States oil production at the same time we are relying more and more on foreign oil. The net result of that should come as no surprise to anyone. We are going to have to pay higher prices at the gas pumps as a result. 
   It is time that the United States had a clear strategy, a good energy policy, that promoted the development of oil resources in the United States in a safe and environmentally clean way. That can be done. I believe under a new administration which is focused on developing an energy strategy that will suit the American people, it will be done. 
   I thank Senator THOMAS for making some of his time available to talk about this important subject.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, one of the reasons we have time today is to discuss the breach of security at the National Laboratories. I want to address that subject for a moment this afternoon. 
   We are all aware of what happened in the last couple of weeks regarding the lost computer disks at the Los Alamos National Lab, and the news that those disks have now been found. But the questions remain about what happened to them during the time they were gone--whether or not they were copied and whether or not in any event our National Laboratories are, in fact, secure. 
   Let me go back in time to about a year ago when we were debating the Defense authorization bill of last year. One of the portions of that bill was an amendment that I offered, along with Senators DOMENICI and MURKOWSKI, to create a new semiautonomous agency at the Department of Energy, the Department of Energy Reorganization Act. That was in response to the recommendation of one of the President's own commissions, a group called the President's Forward Intelligence Advisory Board, or the so-called PFIAB Act. 
   Former Senator Rudman chaired the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board and made some recommendations concerning the creation of this semiautonomous agency in response to the effect of the theft of some of our most sensitive nuclear secrets from the Los Alamos Lab a few years ago. 
   We discovered that the Chinese Government had possession of what were, in effect, the blueprints for some of our Nation's most sophisticated nuclear weapons ever built. We didn't know how those blueprints were obtained by the Chinese Government, but we believe they had to have been obtained from the Los Alamos nuclear lab. We determined that we needed to make some changes in security practices at the laboratory. 
   It was believed that a scientist there by the name of Wen Ho Lee had taken charge of these documents and had somehow gotten them to someone representing the Chinese Government--a matter that has not yet been proven. We wanted to get to the bottom of it, and to make sure there would never again be a security breach at our National Laboratories. 
   By way of background, these National Laboratories, two of them--Lawrence Livermore and Los Alamos--are technically run by the University of California at Berkeley. But they do their weapons work under the auspices of the Department of Energy. 
   The PFIAB reports found that the culture of the laboratories to promote good science and develop all of these new technologies relating to nuclear weapons was such that it would be very difficult to reform from within, for either the Department of Energy or the laboratories themselves to put into place the security measures necessary to protect these secrets. 
   As a result, the Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board recommended the creation of an autonomous agency, totally separate and apart from the Department of Energy, under which this work is done, or, at a minimum, the creation of a semiautonomous agency within the Department of Energy for this weapons work to be done. Some called it a stovepipe; in other words, an organization within the Department of Energy that was totally enclosed, that would be run by an Under Secretary, and would be very much focused on security at the labs. 
   The Secretary of Energy, Bill Richardson, didn't like this idea. He wanted to remain in charge. On the debate just about a year ago, my colleagues on both the Democrat and Republican sides of the aisle concluded that the President's own Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board was correct, that we should create a semiautonomous agency and take that out of the Secretary's direct control. The Secretary was so much opposed, he tried to get the President to veto the bill over that, because we passed it in the Senate and the House of Representatives passed it. It became part of the Defense authorization bill for last year. The President signed the bill, and it became the law. 
   The Secretary continued to fight it, maintaining he should maintain the jurisdiction over this nuclear weapons program, that he could do the job. As a result, the President did not send up the name of this Under Secretary to head this new, semiautonomous agency, and Secretary Richardson did not implement the new law. He did virtually nothing to see that the new law was put into place. He kept maintaining that he was in charge and that so  long as there was not an Under Secretary, he would still personally be in charge. 
   In fact, he testified last October before the Congress that he would remain in charge until a new person was put in charge. He specifically said: The buck stops with me. He said: The President has asked me to remain in charge until there is a new Under Secretary, and the President will hold me accountable, and I intend to be held accountable. 
   Senator FITZGERALD asked him a specific question as he said: The buck stops with me. Senator FITZGERALD asked the Secretary: If, God forbid, there should be a security breach at one of the laboratories, you would assume full responsibility, is that correct? And Secretary Richardson said: Yes, I will assume full responsibility. 
   Now, that was then and this is now. We know there was not an Under Secretary appointed, that Secretary Richardson continued to maintain control over the situation, to take the responsibility for it, to assure the American people that our weapons labs were safe and secure. In fact, he said last year: I can assure the American people that our nuclear laboratories are safe and secure. Because he was in charge. 
   But what we now know is this past April and May, or presumably during that period, sometime in April, at the Los Alamos Nuclear Laboratory, two hard drive disks containing some very sensitive information relating to both U.S. and other countries' nuclear weapons were taken from the vault, from a portion of Division X of the nuclear program at Los Alamos. They were missing. They were missing for several weeks. They were believed to have been found in the last few days behind a copy machine in Division X. But the FBI has not yet disclosed its findings with respect to how the disks were removed, how they were returned, and what might have happened to them in the interim. 
   The Secretary said he believes an employee was trying to cover up the fact that he had the disks and that there is no evidence they have been copied. The fact is there is no evidence either way. It is very difficult for the FBI to determine whether or not these hard drive disks were, in fact, copied. We may know more about that in the next several days. Whether they were, whether someone also has that sensitive information or not, there was still a significant security breach and lapse at the laboratories, revealing that they are still not safe and secure; there are still problems. We have to figure out what to do about it. 
   What would happen if that information had been obtained by someone else? In addition to telling that person or country a lot about our nuclear weapons and how they work, it would have provided an opportunity for them to understand how we intended to dismantle or disable a nuclear weapon because these disks were in the possession of the team we have put in charge of disarming a terrorist nuclear weapon. There is a special kit prepared, and these disks are part of that kit. If we find that there is a nuclear device somewhere in the country, these experts will immediately take that kit to the site and begin to try to dismantle the weapon. The hard drives contain information which is helpful to them in determining how to dismantle the weapon. Obviously, if you have that, you have some ideas about how to prevent the dismantling and how to boobytrap it if you are a terrorist. It is an important piece of information. 
   What happened from the time Secretary Richardson maintained he was in charge until now? 
   Finally, last month, the President sent up the name of Gen. John Gordon to become the Under Secretary and head up this agency. But the Senate still hadn't confirmed General Gordon until last month. Why? Because Democrats were still trying to change the underlying law, at Secretary Richardson's request. 
   A member of the Senate minority had held up the confirmation vote on General Gordon for several weeks, almost a month, trying to get us to make changes in the law that were acceptable to Secretary Richardson. It wasn't until the embarrassment of last week that they finally agreed to have a vote. Of course, when we took the vote, his confirmation was approved 97-0. Presumably, he is on the job as of today. I have a great deal of confidence in General Gordon, if Secretary Richardson will allow him to do his job. That remains the question. 
   I summarize in the following way: It is clear we still have problems at our national labs. It is clear that General Gordon and his new semiautonomous agency needs to be allowed to get to the bottom of the situation and to put into place protections that will prevent further security breaches at our national labs. 
   I believe Secretary Richardson should step down from his position for two reasons. First, it was his choice to maintain personal responsibility over this for the last year. We afforded him the opportunity to put somebody else in charge. At one point I said to him: Mr. Secretary, cooperate with us. Let's get an Under Secretary nominated and put into place and let that expert run this semiautonomous agency and give him the responsibility for this. Secretary Richardson, in effect, said: No, I will remain personally responsible because I want to do it my way. 
   Because he wanted to take personal responsibility, contrary to the law that had been then signed by the President, and because he said he would accept full responsibility, it seems to me we should now take him at his word and allow him to assume full responsibility by taking the blame, rather than passing it on to other people. 
   The second reason he should step down is that I don't have confidence in him allowing General Gordon to do the job even now. He has ``dual-hatted'' several employees in the Department of Energy, asking that current people be allowed to fill positions we created under this new law, positions we intended to be part of this separate, semiautonomous agency, not employees of the Department of Energy who would wear two hats--their regular Department of Energy hat and fulfill the responsibilities under this new law. 
   We don't think you can do both. Secretary Richardson didn't want to have separate employees. He wants to use his own employees under his control, and therefore he has been dual-hatting these employees. To this day, I don't know whether he will allow separate employees to be hired, whether he will allow General Gordon to bring his own team, or allow him to do the job as he sees fit, or whether Secretary Richardson will continue to maintain the fixation for personal control of the situation. I have no confidence in that. I call for him to step down and allow General Gordon to do the job. That is what the law provides. That is why the President signed the law. I think the American people want to know that our nuclear weapons laboratories will be secure. This is the only way they will be secure. 
   Finally, I heard a colleague on television yesterday say, back in his day, President Bush issued a regulation which changed some of the security procedures at the laboratories, as if somehow that had something to do with what has recently occurred. The point is this: If Secretary Richardson was in charge, then he had the full authority to change anything he didn't like, including any directives President Bush may have put into place. 
   But Secretary Richardson's bent is to blame other people rather than accept the responsibility himself. So if he thought there was something wrong with the way President Bush did it, he could have corrected it since. Remember, he was in charge. 
   My purpose here is not just to point the finger at Secretary Richardson for political purposes but to say that until he steps aside, I don't have any confidence the situation is going to get any better because he has had a year now to correct the situation, and all he has found time to do is to criticize others when he himself had accepted the responsibility. 
   I am hoping, A, that the FBI will in the next few days get to the bottom of it, tell us exactly what occurred, and hopefully be able to assure us that no secrets have gone to an unauthorized party; B, that the people responsible for the breach in security will be found and will be properly punished; and, C, that General Gordon will be allowed to do his job, as Senator Rudman's commission, the President's advisory commission, and the Congress hoped when we passed the legislation creating his position and this new semiautonomous agency.  
   The American people deserve to know that our most important nuclear secrets can be kept safe and secure. Especially with the terrorist threat that confronts this country, we need to know we can disarm a terrorist nuclear weapon if we should ever be faced with that particular kind of threat. We need to know our ability to do it has not been compromised. 
   For that reason, I hope that the Secretary will step down, that General Gordon will be able to do his job, and that from now on our nuclear laboratories can operate in a way that protects the vital information they have been able to develop over these many years. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, as a cosponsor of the Warner amendment, maybe I can offer a little solace to my colleague from Nebraska, which I think is consistent with the intent of the chairman of the Armed Services Committee. 
   First of all, as the Senator from Colorado pointed out, the primary point of the Warner amendment is to ensure that two specific studies are done; that this cannot be done just on the certification of the President. That is the primary distinction between this amendment and the amendment from the Senator from Nebraska. 
   With respect to those two studies, one of them is the quadrennial review. That is the review that Congress now requires of the President every 4 years. It is a very long set of requirements that take all of the defense needs of the country into account in a coordinated, structured way. 
   It is in that context that I believe, incidentally, Governor Bush would probably want to have this review done. I can't speak for Governor Bush. But I am certain after having talked to him that he has in mind approaching our defense structure generally in a somewhat different way than the past administration has. He has some different strategies in mind. 
   My guess is that he would want the nuclear review to be done consistent with the quadrennial review so that the Nuclear Posture Review would be coordinated with the quadrennial review. That is precisely what the Warner amendment calls for. It says:  
   The secretary of defense shall submit to Congress in unclassified and classified forms as necessary a report on the result of the Nuclear Posture Review concurrently with the Quadrennial Defense Review due in December of 2001.  
   The Senator from Nebraska is quite correct. That report would be accelerated some. As a practical matter, however, it is not going to be accelerated to the point that would occur in the year 2000, and as a result it would, in fact, occur during the next administration--not this administration, the way the amendment is written, at least as I read it. 
   While it does not tie the Nuclear Posture Review to a specific date, it does say that it should be submitted concurrently with the QDR, whenever that happens to be submitted. 
   I think that is the answer to the Senator's question. I think this is a very reasonable approach. I hope the Senator 
   will support the amendment for that reason. 
   I again go back to primarily the point that was made, and that is that we have two different approaches. One relies on just the certification of the President that he thinks this is a good thing to do. The other specifically requires him to do the Nuclear Posture Review and the quadrennial review and to submit those two concurrently. Then the President can, if need be, bring the force structure down. 
   I would like to make one other point, if I could. If the Senator from Nebraska wishes to interrupt me, that is fine. 
   The second point I want to make is this: There is a tendency to speak in just sort of hypothetical terms about numbers: Well, 6,000 is a lot or 3,000 seems more reasonable. 
   What everyone really needs to understand is that we are talking about one of the most complex sets of interrelated considerations that exist in our defense strategic posture. 
   The Senator from Nebraska, as the vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee until very recently, appreciates this point as well as anyone. I know that. Among the things that have to be considered, for example, in bringing the number of warheads down, are two things: First, though we all talk in terms of warheads, the Senator from Nebraska knows and the chairman of the Armed Services Committee knows that isn't what we really count. We count delivery systems. Those delivery systems include ICBMs, missiles on submarines, and bombers, which are the three legs of the triad that deliver the warheads. 
   Here is just one consideration that goes into this equation. The United States has a need to project its conventional forces. We are the superpower of the world. We try to keep peace in parts of the world when other nations cannot do so because among other things, we have the reach to get to those places. We recently involved those forces in Kosovo, and before that we did it in the gulf war. In both cases we used our bomber forces. 
   Some of these bomber forces, such as the B-2 bomber, clearly count in terms of strategic warheads. If we were to bring the strategic warheads down too far, the result of that would be to take out of service bombers which we need not just for strategic purposes but for conventional purposes as well. 
   That is why this gets to be a pretty complicated matter and why it shouldn't be done quickly. It certainly shouldn't be done merely for political reasons. I am not suggesting that any President would do that. 
   That is why clearly a Nuclear Posture Review is critical to any proposal that the President would make in this regard or any decision he would announce. Because you are talking about the interrelationship between conventional and strategic forces, you should tie this to the QDR as well. 
   That is why the Warner amendment very wisely says the Nuclear Posture Review, and the quadrennial review should be submitted concurrently, and that when they are, the President could make a decision to reduce our warheads below that called for by this agreement. 
   One more point in response to a point that the Senator from Massachusetts made earlier. The inference of his remarks was now that START II has been ratified by both the United States and Russia, there is no reason why we can't bring these warhead numbers down. But that is not true. START II has not been ratified unconditionally by the Duma. The Duma in Russia ratified START II with conditions, and until those conditions are satisfied, Russia will not submit its articles of ratification. They will not become effective. Until they are deposited with the appropriate international body, and I believe it is Geneva, Switzerland,  the Duma ratification of START II is not effective. It is conditional upon two things that the U.S. won't approve: the so-called multilateralization agreement and another agreement which limits the way in which our tactical missile defenses could be arrayed. 
   We are at a stalemate in terms of START II. That is why it is inaccurate to argue that since both countries have now ratified START II, the President might as well bring the numbers down. That is not true. There may be good reason to bring those numbers down irrespective of START II, but it is not an argument that because both countries have ratified START II, now the President should bring the warhead numbers down. In point of fact, START II has not yet been legally ratified by Russia. 
   The bottom line is I agree with President Bush. I take it, to some extent based upon what I know of Senator KERREY's comments, that we ought to make a determination which makes sense for America. The world is different now than it used to be. The President ought to, upon proper review, determine the size of our nuclear strategic forces. 
   Where I think perhaps we may have a disagreement, although perhaps he now is convinced, is that rather than simply saying the President can have that authority and can exercise it irrespective of what the Congress did last year in passing the law that said no, rather than taking that approach, it makes much more sense to ensure that the President makes this decision with the calm, cool reflection of the quadrennial review and the strategic nuclear posture review having been done. When those two things are done and submitted concurrently, it will be an appropriate time for the President then to make this decision.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I believe the question of the Senator from Michigan through the Senator from Nebraska to the Senator from Virginia is whether he agreed with me. 
   My interpretation is simply the language of the amendment which says that the Nuclear Posture Review shall be submitted concurrently with the quadrennial review, which is due in December----

   Mr. KYL. No later than December 2001. It could be, therefore, submitted prior to that date. It all depends upon when the QDR would be submitted. But it does have to be at the same time. 
   If I could just make one other point, I am advised by staff that the last quadrennial review did not include a review of the nuclear posture. So the last Nuclear Posture Review was in fact in 1994.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I want to follow my colleague's remarks with some thoughts of my own concerning the appearance that the Senate is not getting anything done these days, and talk a little bit about the reasons why. Anybody watching the Senate proceedings over the course of the last couple of weeks would probably wonder what we were accomplishing and would have some reason to criticize the Senate for not getting a lot of business done.  
   What is the reason for that? I think it is very important, and that is why I wanted to come to the Senate floor to talk about it because I am becoming very frustrated at the tactics of many people on the other side of the aisle, the Democratic minority, in attempting to preclude the Senate from doing its business, the people's business. 
   We have important legislative initiatives that the majority leader has tried to bring before the Senate repeatedly, and repeatedly he has been thwarted by the minority which seems intent on bringing the Senate to an absolute stop, to a standstill, to prevent it from doing any business unless the majority accedes to the minority's request that they be permitted to offer amendments which are nongermane, irrelevant, to the subject matter of the Senate. 
   When people reflect on the organizations to which they belong and their understanding of things as basic as Robert's Rules of Order, they appreciate that almost any organization has to have certain rules under which to live. 
   In the House of Representatives, as the Presiding Officer is well aware, both of us having come from the House of Representatives, there are pretty strict sets of rules to apply. There are 435 people in the House, and if they all did what they wanted to do, they would never get anything done. We pretty much have to talk about things that are germane and relevant to the pending business, and if we do not, someone can make an objection that this is out of order, and everybody knows under Robert's Rules, one can say: Mr. Chairman, that's out of order; that's not relevant to the subject we are supposed to be discussing. 
   In the Senate, the rules are much more liberal. Members generally work together on things and do not enforce the rules as strictly as they are enforced in the House. Nevertheless, the Senate has essentially always had rules respecting germaneness and relevancy, and until very recently, we could make an objection that a proposed amendment, for example, on an appropriations bill was not germane or was irrelevant, and in order to continue to debate that amendment, the proponent would have to get 60 Senators to agree to do that, to overrule the ruling of the Chair that the amendment is not germane or irrelevant. 
   I know this is all somewhat procedure and it may make some eyes glaze over, but it is an important foundation for my point. We decided if we were going to do the business of the people, we had to ensure we could get on with it and not have a lot of riders on these appropriations bills and, therefore, we would begin enforcing rule XVI, which says if a Senator is going to debate something, it needs to be relevant or germane to these bills. That is the basic issue that has members of the minority upset. 
   How dare you gag us, they say. Gag them? Nobody is being gagged. We are simply going to enforce the rules that say if you are going to propose an amendment, it needs to be relevant 
   or germane. Everybody in the country understands that--the organizations to which they belong. Why wouldn't the minority want that? Because they want to accomplish two objectives apparently: One is to prevent the majority from accomplishing anything this year so they can call us a do-nothing Congress; in other words, create a self-fulfilling prophecy. By preventing us from doing anything, they will criticize the majority leader for not doing anything. 
   The other objective apparently is to be able to debate their agenda, things such as gun control and the minimum wage, maybe prescription drugs, and so on, on their timetable. So whatever bill we bring up, they try to attach to it an irrelevant or nongermane amendment relating, for example, to gun control. 
   We have had lots of gun control debates. I remember 2 weeks last year when the majority leader finally said: OK, we will have the debate; it will be on the juvenile justice bill. We voted on lots of amendments, including some the minority really liked. We had that debate; we had those votes; but that was not enough. It appears we have to talk about these things all of the time because that is what is going to be politically popular in this fall's elections. 
   That is wrong. To tie up the people's business, to tie up the Senate for political gain is wrong. If any of the members of the minority are engaging in this procedure for that purpose, they clearly ought not to. 
   We have accomplished a lot this year, notwithstanding these tactics. I note things such as repeal of the Social Security earnings test, something Republicans wanted to do for a long time, and the Presiding Officer and I have been working on for a long time; the budget resolution, which maintains a balanced budget--we got that done; bills such as the African-Caribbean free trade bill; financial services modernization; the FAA reauthorization--a lot of different pieces of legislation that are good, that help maintain a part of our economy or ensure we are going to have a balanced budget, for example. 
   There are many other pieces of legislation we want to pass. We want to pass the marriage tax penalty relief bill to do away with the marriage penalty in the IRS Code. The minority will not let us bring it for a vote. They say they are for it, but they are not going to let us vote on it. 
   It is the same thing with the reauthorization of the education bill. This is a bill that needs to be reauthorized because it deals with all of the rules under which the Federal money goes to the States to support primary and secondary education. The minority will not let us vote on it. 
   Appropriations bills: We have to pass 13 appropriations bills to keep the Government running. People get mighty upset when the Government cannot continue to operate. Who is stopping us from acting on these appropriations bills? The Democrats in the Senate will not let the majority bring these appropriations bills up, except one. We can bring up the legislative branch appropriations bill, the bill that provides the money to run the Congress. They will let us bring that one up but none of the others. 
   We have a very important agricultural supplemental appropriations bill to help out farmers in this country. Democrats will not let us bring it up. When I say they will not let us bring it up, people say how can they stop you? Under the rules of the Senate, one Member can object to any piece of 
   legislation being brought up for its consideration or being voted on, and in order to override that person's objection, you have to get 60 Members of this body to agree to override that and proceed to a vote or proceed to consideration of a bill. That is called invoking cloture. 
   There are 55 Republicans and there are 45 Democrats. On these procedural matters, the Democratic Members tend to vote in a block, the net result of which is we can never get 60 votes to proceed with business. Because of the party loyalty and the partisanship that has gotten involved in our legislative agenda, we are not able to move matters forward because there is an objection to proceeding. That is why I say members of the minority preclude us from moving forward and doing the people's business. 
   We wanted to pass a very important amendment to me, and I note to the Senator from California, Mrs. FEINSTEIN, who is on the floor now--the crime victims' rights constitutional amendment. Frankly, parliamentary tactics were used and threatened to make it clear that we would be debating that bill for weeks, something that obviously we did not have time to do if we were going to do the other important business of the Senate. Senator FEINSTEIN and I had to pull that bill down. 
   Since I am being critical of members of the Democratic minority, let me say that there have been some Members, such as Senator FEINSTEIN, who have worked very closely with me and others to try to move some of these important bills forward. 
   We all get caught up in our own partisan battles here. That is to be expected. It is a political year, after all. It seems to me we can and ought to agree there are some things so important that we ought to get together as Democrats and Republicans and move the legislation forward. 
   One of them clearly is the education bill. Another is the repeal of the marriage tax penalty. Another is the appropriations bills. For the life of me, I do not see why there have to be objections to bringing forward appropriations bills, and I do not subscribe to the notion that it is wrong for us to  bring those bills forward if members of the minority cannot seek amendments which are nongermane or irrelevant. 
   We all know what Robert's Rules provide. Those are not the rules of the Senate, but we all understand why we have to have rules such as that, and that is to keep the process moving along so that we can do the important business we have to do. 
   I am very frustrated today, Mr. President. It is obvious because I do not ordinarily come to the floor, and I do not like to criticize in a partisan way. But people have to understand today or tomorrow we are probably going to begin the Memorial Day recess, which means there will be another 12 or 13 days of nonaction in the Senate, the net result of which will be we are way behind getting our business done, especially the appropriations bills to run the Government. 
   The danger is that there are not very many opportunities for us to get these bills done before the Senate has to adjourn for an election this year, and we will end up, instead of focusing on each of the appropriations bills, in turn having to put it all into one giant appropriations bill. 
   What happens when we do that? Every Member comes back to the Senate months later and says: I didn't know they put that in the bill. Nobody has a chance to read these giant omnibus bills. So we vote on bills we haven't even had an opportunity to read. Staff gets all kinds of things inserted. People on the inside get all kinds of things inserted in the legislation. We find out weeks later about the mistakes we have made. It is impossible to have a good, informed vote on a bill. 
   The other danger, of course, is that it is easier; that instead of resolving disputes and prioritizing spending, by offsetting this spending with this savings--for example, in those last days to put together these giant omnibus appropriations bill--you don't make those hard decisions; you just add more money. So you resolve the dispute by saying: we are taking care of you, and we are taking care of you. And pretty soon we have busted the budget. Most importantly, we may make the mistake of spending Social Security surplus money. 
   This past year, we did not spend a dime of Social Security surplus money. The previous year, we saved most of that Social Security surplus from being spent. Republicans, this year, are committed not to spending any of the Social Security surplus. But, unfortunately, I will make this prediction: If we get into this giant omnibus appropriations process at the end because we could not do our business during the weeks we have now to do that business, we are going to end up spending Social Security surplus money. I will never vote for such a bill. I think, therefore, we ought to be very careful about getting ourselves into that box. 
   Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to speak to this issue. I hope people with goodwill can work it out, so when we come back from our recess, we can begin to get the people's business done and get it done on time. It is important for the future of this country.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague, Senator DOMENICI, to introduce the Navajo Nation Trust Land Leasing Act of 2000, a bill to establish a streamlined process for the Navajo Nation to lease trust lands without having to obtain the approval of the Secretary of the Interior. This new authority would apply to individual leases, except leases for exploration, development, or extraction of any mineral resources. 
   Mr. President, the current leasing process simply does not work very well. It can be cumbersome, and, because of the need to obtain approval from both the Nation and the Interior Department, the process can be lengthy. That can discourage many businesses from even considering locating the Navajo Reservation. 
   The fact is, there is no longer a need for the Secretary to be involved in routine leasing decisions that can and should be made by the Nation itself. 
   The changes proposed in this bill are intended to speed up the process for issuing leases by at least 50 percent, create predictable procedures for leasing trust land, and create incentives for businesses to open and operate in the Navajo Nation. It would help improve the management of tribal property, and promote economic development within the 100 Chapters of the Navajo Nation. 
   The need to create jobs and diversify the Reservation economy are clear. A December 
   1998 report by the Navajo Nation Division of Economic Development reported that the unemployment rate for the Nation was 43.3 percent, up 15.5 percent from 1990. An estimated 56 percent of Navajo families live below the poverty level, with a per capita annual income of just $5,759. 
   The lack of employment opportunities, low industrialization, slow development, insufficient infrastructure, weak economy, and difficulty in obtaining homesites and housing are causing many Navajo people to relocate to urban areas. 
   The Navajo Nation is looking for ways to reform its regulations to make it easier to attract and retain new businesses, and to create jobs that will improve the standard of living of Navajo people. The reforms in the Navajo National Trust Land Leasing Act will give the Nation some of the tools it needs to succeed in that regard. 
   Mr. President, the bill incorporates suggestions made by both the Navajo Nation and the Department of the Interior. There is one provision, though, that I will ask the Nation and the Department to review and provide further input. That is paragraph three of the proposed new Section 415(e) of title 25 of the U.S. Code. 
   As introduced, the bill gives the Secretary of the Interior the authority to approve or disapprove the Navajo Nation regulations under which the tribe will subsequently consider and approve leases of trust land. The Nation understandably wants to ensure that the Secretary acts promptly on the regulations once they are submitted. We do  not intend that the Secretary should be able to veto the regulations through inaction. 
   One way to address that concern is through the imposition of some time limit for Secretarial review--maybe 30 days. Another way might be to establish criteria in the law for the Secretary to use in reviewing the Nation's regulations. That approach would give the Secretary some guidance as to how the regulations should be assessed. It would also give the Navajo Nation some assurance that objective criteria will guide the Secretary's action. If the regulations meet the criteria, the Secretary's ability to disapprove them would be limited. 
   As I said, I will be asking both the Interior Department and the Nation for their further recommendations about these various approaches. The bill language on Secretarial approval or disapproval should, therefore, be considered open to change.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, today the Senate will be in a period of morning business with Senators DURBIN and THOMAS in control of the first 2 hours. For the information of all Senators, it is the intention of the majority leader to begin consideration of the agricultural appropriations bill during Tuesday's session. The leader has announced that the Senate will remain in session notwithstanding the Memorial Day recess in order to complete this important spending bill. Therefore, Senators can expect votes throughout the week and into the weekend if necessary. 
   Mr. President, I observe the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me begin by thanking Senator THOMAS, again, for allowing the time to be devoted to this important subject which we began discussing last week and hopefully will be able to continue this week, namely, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and specifically the bill the Republican majority in the Senate has put forth called the Educational Opportunities Act, S. 2. 
   It is my hope that by the end of this week we will have an opportunity to vote on this legislation, to finally conclude our work and move this bill forward so we can present it to the President for his signature and actually achieve a historic reform opportunity this year. As I said, I hope we will have that result. The reason, however, I have some doubt is that we have seen what I fear is a trend, on the part of  the Democratic minority, to continue to talk about education but in the end not allow the Senate to vote on any meaningful piece of legislation. I think the debate so far has vividly portrayed two very different views of how the Federal Government should proceed with educational reform in our country. 
   On the one hand, you have the majority arguing for flexibility combined with accountability: Flexibility, so the local entities, the school districts, the States, the schools, and the parents can have the ability to direct the dollars from the Federal Government to do those things they know work best in their particular area, and to have some accountability for that by ensuring that at the end of the year they demonstrate what they have done with this money has actually produced results. We are talking here about academic achievement, we are talking about meaningful results, not simply more students in a particular 
   program or more teachers hired or more school buildings built. We are talking about some tangible results of those particular actions. So it is flexibility with accountability. 
   Part of the way we achieve that is through greater competition, which is driven by more parental choice, parents having the ability to decide what is best for their kids; after all, they are the ones we presume care the most about them, know the most about their needs, and understand how best, therefore, to deal with those kids' needs. 
   On the other hand, you have the minority that has been arguing for the same system of Federal mandates and regulations that, frankly, after 35 years have proven to be a failure. It is the same system with a new layer of mandates and poll-tested, Washington-run spending programs added onto what we have right now. One of our colleagues from the other side put it this way. He said:  
   The Senate has a choice. Will it pass the Republican Educational Opportunities Act or, on the other hand, are we going to follow the tried and tested programs that have demonstrated results for children at the local level?  
   They vote for the tried and tested programs that have demonstrated results. They have demonstrated results, all right. The problem is, not many people I know are very happy about those results. An old farmer friend of mine once said: If you want to get out of a hole, the first thing you do is stop digging. We just want to keep digging the hole deeper and deeper, it appears some of our colleagues are saying. That is not producing the right kind of results, good results: Enhanced achievement on test scores, enhanced ability to compete, and a real achievement-based accountability, which is what the Republican plan is asking for. 
   I have to say I am disappointed by this debate. I am disappointed with the direction in which the legislation itself appears to be heading because the American people have told us they want results. They would like to see reform now. Every poll says this is the No. 1 issue of concern of the American people--to improve our educational system. 
   As our colleague on the other side said, yes, the current system has produced tried and tested results. But over 80 percent of the American people do not like those results. They are not happy with those results. They think we can do better. We can do better. We are spending an awful lot of money, and we ought to get something for that money. But more important than that, more important than the accountability to the taxpayers, is the accountability to our children, our future. 
   These kids have one opportunity to get their education--right now. We are not talking about 20 years from now. We are talking about the children who are in our educational system today. Each year we delay is another year our children are involved in a school system that is less than adequate by most standards. 
   The American people who are demanding accountability are going to be very disappointed if we conclude this debate with yet another year failing to enact fundamental reforms. That is what has me concerned because there seems to be a rather cynical strategy developing on the other side to talk this thing to death, to set up a whole lot of amendments on which we have to vote, some of which have nothing to do with education, and then, in effect, put the blame on the Republican majority until, finally, when we have to move on to other business, the majority leader has to say: If you are not going to let us get to a final conclusion on this, if we cannot vote for these reforms, we have to move on. However, the blame would not be on the majority but on the minority for its refusal to let us move on and get this legislation passed. 
   I do not think it is too late to put politics aside and put our children first, but time is running out. I call upon my colleagues: Let's keep talking about education. Let's put the political gamesmanship aside for just a few hours. Is it just possible, for example, that we can conclude debate on one bill without getting bogged down on gun control? 
   Yet I predict, before this week is out, we will have colleagues from the other side say: We cannot really deal with S. 2 unless we deal with issues relating to gun control. 
   Let's talk about what is in this education bill, what is in our proposal. It may be that some of our colleagues on the other side are actually uncomfortable focusing the debate on education because of this notion that the current system is working just fine. I think they are reluctant to talk about reform, but the American people want reform. As I said, they know we can do better. 
   We heard last week from members of the minority that we cannot trust parents to do what is right for children. One of our colleagues said: Where are the guarantees that the parents will make the right decisions? There are no guarantees that parents will make the right decisions, but I suppose one can ask: Who is more likely to make right decisions for their children, the parents or some bureaucrat in Washington, DC, or some Senator in Washington, DC? 
   My heart is in the right place when it comes to taking care of the schoolkids in this country, but I certainly would not presume to set all the policies in Washington that would fit the needs of every single schoolchild in this country. We in Washington just do not have that capability. There are no guarantees that every parent will make every decision correctly, but it is a lot more likely that parents making the decisions will result in good decisions for the most number of kids than if those decisions are relegated to Washington, DC. 
   Another thing we heard was that the leaders in our States and communities cannot be trusted to do what is right for America's young people; again, we need guarantees. By guarantees they mean Federal enforcement that these local officials will do the right thing and, of course, the right thing is defined by the bureaucrats in Washington, DC: You have to do it the way Washington wants to do it or you are not going 
   to get the money. 
   One of the things we heard was that it would be a better approach to the Republican reform ideas to simply fine-tune the Federal regulations that impose 50 percent of the paperwork requirements on the local schools, and that is in exchange for only 7 percent of their funding. In other words, the 7 percent of funding that primary and secondary education receives from the Federal Government accounts for 50 percent of the paperwork. It is a pretty expensive proposition, in other words, to get the Federal funding. Schools go after that Federal funding even though it is a very inefficient way for them to fund the education of the children. 
   The point is this: How can you expect to get different results if you keep doing things the same way? The answer is, of course, you cannot. That is where the reforms in S. 2 come into play. One of the things which exemplifies this debate is the issue of class size or class size reduction. 
   Members of the minority have said we have to use this money for the purpose of hiring more teachers so we can achieve a class size reduction. The majority has said we need to let the local schools decide if that is their top priority. If it is, then they have the ability to use the funds for that purpose. If they have a higher priority, who should make that judgment of how to spend the money? Should it be those of us in Washington or should it be the people who understand what their priorities are?  
   Almost everyone would like to see smaller class sizes. We intuitively believe that would be better for education, but with every other area of this debate, we do have to look at the track record. The fact is that class sizes have fallen over the period that the Elementary and Secondary Education Act has been in existence, but performance has not tracked. George Will, with his wonderful characteristic dry wit, looked at the data, and this is what he said:  
   Pupil-teacher ratios have been shrinking for a century. In 1955 pupil-teacher ratios in the public elementary and secondary schools were 30.2-to-one and 20.9-to-one respectively. In 1998 they were 18.9-to-one and 14.7-to-one. We now know it is possible to have, simultaneously, declining pupil-teacher ratios and declining scores on tests measuring schools' cognitive results.  
   The truth is, we have declining class sizes and with it declining test scores. We still think it would be a good idea to reduce the size of classes; that there are other reasons why those test scores have not improved. But under the proposal from the President, they have to spend the money strictly on hiring teachers. They cannot use it for anything else, as I will get to in a moment. 
   One of the things this money can be used for is to create more charter schools, something that has improved the education in my own State of Arizona. Our State superintendent of education, Lisa Graham Keegan, has pointed out under the President's proposal, the $17 million Arizona would receive to hire new teachers could actually start 425 new charter schools across the State, more than enough schools to keep class sizes relatively small, but they would not have that flexibility under the President's plan, under the Democrats' plan. No, they have to do it their way or no way. The only way they get the money is if they follow precisely their guidelines. That is the way it has been all these years. We can see the results. Again, 
   the American people are asking for something different. 
   One of the ideas embodied in our legislation is something we call the Straight A's approach. The idea behind it is to actually look at where the Federal Government has been successful in making major reforms and applying that same technique to education. 
   There are few successes more dramatic than our success in welfare reform. It cannot be done, we were told, but we did it, and the results have been dramatic. The idea was pretty simple. The Federal Government said: We will repeal the regulations that have historically defined this program, and we will give unprecedented flexibility to the reformers in State government, as well as unprecedented accountability for them. Go out and pursue reforms, we said, and if you are successful, you will be rewarded. If you fail, then you will lose some of your latitude. 
   As with welfare reform, we need to put aside the certainty that Washington knows best and all wisdom that is formulated comes from Washington. 
   I know there is no such monopoly because I have the good fortune of coming from a State where education policy is made by people who really have been innovative, people such as our State superintendent of education, Lisa Graham Keegan. 
   I want to present some of the things she has had to say. When we consider how to provide this flexibility to education just as we did with welfare reform, I think we will see the same results. This is some of what Ms. Keegan had to say:  
   Federal programs have tied dollars to bureaucracies and institutions, not to students.  
   What that illustrates is the disorientation from Washington. We believe if you send the money to the institution, to the organization, automatically good things will happen. The fact is, we ought to be focused on what some call child-centered education. We ought to figure out how to get the money we want to educate these children as close to those children as possible because the sad fact is, when we send it to an institution or a bureaucracy, a significant amount of that money gets stuck at that bureaucracy. 
   As with many Federal programs, it costs a lot of money to administer the program, to comply with all of the Federal redtape and paperwork. That is why we say that, while the Federal Government only supplies 7 percent of the primary and secondary education dollars the States spend, the States have to spend 50 percent of their administration costs just administering that 7 percent at the Federal level. That is why if we can get over this business of tying dollars to the bureaucracies and the institutions and tie it more to the students, it will be a much more efficient expenditure of the money. 
   Ms. Keegan also says:  
   But before we ask Washington to get involved with the education of our children, we need to think about exactly what we're asking for. Sometimes, when we ask Washington for help, we run a very real risk of getting it....... More often than not, the government's preferred method for alleviating a perceived problem is to create a federally funded program with federally authored strings and federally enforced regulations. This approach may work fine when it comes to matters that have clearly defined federal responsibilities, such as highways or post offices. When it comes to education, which has always been largely a state and local matter with no clear federal role, such an approach tends not to work so well....... 
   ..... we still let Washington drive state and local decision making through the lure of federal dollars tied to programs with hazily-defined goals and well-defined regulations.  
   Then here is how she concludes this point:  
   The problem with this approach is that the federal government has tied its dollar to a program rather than to a student. An at-risk student who succeeds will, more often than not, find him or herself ineligible for more at-risk services. When the student moves on, the federal dollar dries up--and it won't come back until that child again slips into the at-risk group and becomes eligible for the federal program once more. These kinds of programs thrive on student stagnation, even failure.  
   We had that same situation with the welfare program. We tended to measure the success of the welfare program by how many people we had on the welfare rolls, by how much money we were spending on that. Then one day it dawned on someone that we ought to be measuring the success of the welfare program by how few people were on the welfare rolls and by how little we had to spend. 
   As a result, by giving flexibility to the local governments with regard to welfare, we have cut the welfare rolls in half. We are not spending near as much money on welfare. We have only half as many people involved in the welfare program. Is that failure? No. It is a success. And so it is with education. 
   If we are going to devote Federal dollars to the education of the students, then we ought to provide those dollars to the students so that wherever they think they can get their best education, whatever their needs are in terms of priorities, the money will be spent for that, not because the Federal Government makes a judgment that a particular expenditure is necessarily the right thing. 
   I think it is important to reiterate our responsibility to those who will pay the highest price if we fail to take advantage of the opportunities that are here presented. As I said, it is not necessarily the American taxpayer, even though we have, as stewards of those taxpayer dollars, an obligation to see that they are efficiently spent. 
   No. Those that will pay the highest price, if we fail, are the schoolchildren, the children who, this year, will not receive an improved education because, perhaps, we will not get these reforms passed this year. They will have to go yet one more year stuck with the kind of bureaucratic redtape and regulations that have failed them thus far in their careers. 
   Last week, we also learned that there are those on the other side who do not agree that choice should be available to children in failing or unsafe schools. I always find this interesting because very frequently people who make this argument have sent their kids to private schools. 
   I am a product of the public schools. That is where I received my education, including my college and law school education. It was from the public schools. Both of my parents were public 
   school graduates and public school teachers. And others in my family are or have been teachers in public schools. So I fully appreciate the need to improve our public schools. 
   I think one does that by enabling some competition between these schools, and also with the private schools. What we find is that when that competition is allowed to work, everyone benefits. To use a crude example, it  is similar to the automobile manufacturers. If one of them finds a new way to improve the way a car operates, it isn't long before the others find a way to incorporate that same technique or technology into their cars. If they do not, they are going to lose sales. 
   By the same token, when a school finds that something really works well--if we give parents a choice to send their kids to that school--the other schools are soon going to find that they will want to incorporate that same kind of technique to keep the kids there. 
   That is especially the case because so much of our Federal and State funding goes to the institutions, as we have said. If they want to continue to get that funding, under the Republican proposal, they would have to be able to continue to attract the kids. 
   In my State of Arizona, we have, in effect, open enrollment so there can be some degree of competition among the public schools. We also have more charter schools--almost 350 at last count--than any other State. I think it is a third of the charter schools in the country. These charter schools promote a lot of competition. A lot of them have learned to attract students by doing things a little differently. Some of the larger public schools have picked up on these techniques and have incorporated them into their curricula, into their procedures. As a result, they can be quite competitive with those charter schools. It does not hurt one at the expense of another. 
   It is not a zero sum game. Competition is like invention. What it does is lift all of the boats. When one begins to do something better, the others soon follow behind and copy it in order to keep up with the first one. When you have that kind of competition, therefore you can have innovation. If you have flexibility, you have the ability to experiment, and the net result is a better opportunity for more kids. That is what we want to promote in this Federal legislation. 
   As I say, in my own State of Arizona we already have a significant element of this in our public schools. But what we found last week from those on the other side of the debate was that there is a real desire to keep students and parents from having this additional flexibility, this additional choice. It seems to me there is a fear of it. There is a fear that not everyone will be able to do as well as those who do the innovation, and somebody might actually fail or fall behind, which would be bad. 
   Who is the somebody they are talking about? They are not focused on the student. They are talking about the school, that it would not be fair if a particular school failed. Why wouldn't it be fair if a particular school failed if the students all had the opportunity to go to the successful school? What is not fair is that failing schools keep ahold of failing students. We are failing in the education of these kids, and they will never be able to go back and get it. 
   Yes, we have some remedial education. But that is a very 
   hard way to reeducate people in our society. So it is not the schools that we ought to be concerned about; it is the students in those schools. I remain convinced that no American child should be trapped in a school that cannot guarantee a good education. We have an obligation to those students. 
   So whatever happens with this bill, I believe we will continue to pursue this idea of choice, of competition, of flexibility, because it will work. Sooner or later, this approach will provide the basis for reform that will characterize the Federal program that provides the Federal funding to primary and secondary education. I still believe we can make a difference in this area. 
   So while it may become a disappointment that we are not able to conclude work this year on this important bill, that we may not be able to pass a bill that we can send to the President for his signature, I think, in the end, the power of this idea of flexibility and accountability and more choice--the power of that idea--will end up defining the Federal program. 
   It would be better if we could do it this year because that would mean we would not allow another year to pass with the same devastating results for the kids who are in school right now where far too many of them are failing. That is my hope. 
   I urge my colleagues this week to take this debate seriously, to try to move on beyond extraneous issues, and in the end, to bring it to a close so we can actually have a vote on S. 2 and get this important reform measure to the American people where it can begin to work.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, later today the Senate will officially begin the debate on S. 2, the Educational Opportunities Act. I am pleased we will finally have the opportunity to discuss our ideas for improving elementary and secondary education. Of course, one of the reasons we are discussing elementary and secondary education this year is that the ESEA, the statute authorizing most of the Federal Government's education programs in this area, is expiring. I should assure everyone that even though there is no reauthorization bill, it is possible to continue the ESEA programs through the annual appropriations process. 
   The time has come to act. The American people have been sending us a message to do something to improve America's schools. I agree with the American people about the importance of this issue. If we can get education  right in this country, almost everything else should follow. A better educated citizenry will give us an advantage in technology and national defense, better trade and economic opportunities, better citizenship and stronger values, a reduction in crime, and, of course, more personal fulfillment for our citizens. This is an important debate, one of great significance for our Nation. 
   The bad news is that in the coming days there will be so much politics and partisan acrimony emanating from the floor and that many people who watch us might wonder whether it is worth the trouble. The good news is that if concerned Americans listen closely to this debate and have the patience to endure the political sound and furry, I believe they will see their concerns are taken seriously by the majority. 
   It is important to keep in mind that the Federal 
   Government's share of America's total education expenditures is quite small, about 7 percent. As a result, Federal attention has been focused on a few specific objectives: 
   First, providing a quality education that can help offset the effects of poverty and social distress that many of our students experience. It is wrong to expect less of minority and poor students. They can do very well. 
   Second, improving teacher quality and accountability is critical--teaching the English language to students who do not know it well, particularly in my State and other States in which we have had a real upswing in immigration with students coming to this country who are not as fluent in English as the others. 
   Third, promoting familiarity with technology, which is the future. 
   And, of course, providing a safe school environment. 
   These are the things on which we will focus. 
   Unfortunately, after some 35 years, the record of progress toward these objectives at the Federal level is not impressive. I believe this record of failure stands as an indictment of the traditional ESEA strategy, which is to establish a new division of the Federal Government in Washington, DC, and put a small army of people to work writing regulations and processing paperwork from the States. 
   A promising alternative approach has emerged, and this new alternative is known as Straight A's. The idea behind the Straight A's phrase is very similar to the idea that led to our success with welfare reform. It is a concept of a Federal-State performance partnership as in welfare. We do not measure the success in welfare by how many people we have on welfare or how much money we spend on welfare. We decided to begin measuring success on how few people we had to have on welfare and how little we had to spend. 
   We have to get to the same kind of performance-based criteria with respect to education, not how many kids we have in some remedial program but how few we have in those kinds of programs because our education system is working to educate our young people. This is the concept of accountability at the State and local level. 
   When Congress took on welfare in 1995 and 1996, the prerequisite for our success in passing significant reforms was a recognition that very promising ideas were being developed by leaders at the State and local government level. We rejected the old premise that ``Washington knows best,'' and we allowed these innovators outside of what we call the Washington beltway to actually pursue some bold, innovative ideas without a lot of strings attached from Washington. 
   We have all seen what the result can be. We all understand how welfare reform has been working now to get people off welfare and into a productive capacity in our society. It is time to consider the same possibilities with respect to education. 
   The HELP Committee's bill permits as many as 15 States to enter into Straight A's performance contracts if they choose to. These contracts will allow significant flexibility for innovation by these States. My guess is, as we saw with education flexibility, the bill we passed earlier--the Ed-Flex bill--the other States will want to participate in this, so it will quickly move from a 15-State demonstration project to one in which all 50 States want the right to participate. 
   I am sure we will hear objections from the same folks who posited objections to welfare reform. They will say it is a 
   risky scheme: you cannot trust the States and local leaders to do this; Washington knows best. Given the Federal Government's record over the last 35 years, this reactionary posture is impossible to sustain. We cannot keep doing things the same old way and expect different results. 
   I expect, just as with welfare reform, the American people will come to agree with the majority and at least some members of the minority who have now concluded that flexibility, combined with accountability, can bring needed change to education, where control by the bureaucrats in Washington has failed. 
   I also look forward to debating proposals aimed at enhancing parents' influence over the decisions affecting their children, especially when a student must overcome poverty or a language barrier. The stakes are very high, and we should not tolerate a system that ignores the views of the people with the keenest appreciation of that fact--parents. 
   The committee-passed bill recognizes that choice must be available to children in failing or unsafe schools, and I welcome this recognition and urge the greatest possible expansion of choice and competition. 
   In fact, I am proud that my own State of Arizona has provided leadership in this area by establishing an open enrollment policy that allows parents to enroll a child in any public school of their choice, undeterred by artificial geographic boundaries, and that this latitude has led to the creation of hundreds of new charter schools in Arizona. That has, in turn, improved the traditional public schools with which these charter schools compete. 
   In fact, I was buoyed to see in the big newspaper at home in August a couple of years ago one of our better public school districts put a full-page ad in the newspaper saying to the parents: We are having to compete with these charter schools. We were losing enrollment to these schools. We figured out what we were doing wrong, and we have improved. Come back to our public school system and see what a great program we have. 
   That kind of competition and innovation has caused improvement, and we have seen it in our own State of Arizona. 
   As the author of the Dollars Follow the Students Act, which is the first piece of Federal legislation to advance this idea of making these aid dollars portable, I am heartened the bill we are going to consider will provide unprecedented portability for students aided by title I, which is our largest Federal education program. 
   There are those who will resist the idea of choice and competition in education. But I am looking forward to this debate. 
   No American child should be trapped in a school that cannot guarantee a quality education and a safe education. We have an obligation to provide a lifeline for families whose schools are failing, particularly those families who live in our country's most disadvantaged areas. 
   So once again, I urge the American people to follow this debate closely. If they do, I think they will find that we have been listening to their calls for change and for real reform. That is what the legislation we will be bringing to the floor today will provide. I am looking forward to this debate. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, since we have a few more minutes before we have to end this morning's session, I will take a moment to comment on a few things the Presiding Officer said a little while ago. There are two points I will make. 
   The first has to do with the percentage of funds the Federal Government spends on primary and secondary education. The second is more general. 
   The Senator from Wyoming made the point that about 7 percent of the money spent in local schools comes from the Federal Government. It is also true that the average proportion of paperwork imposed on State and local schools by Federal mandates is about 50 percent. In my State of Arizona, it is about 45 percent. Why is that and what is the effect of that? That goes to the heart of what we are proposing to change. 
   We understand it is not a good economic bargain to give the States $7 for education and to make them spend $3.50 of that on administration. Yet that is exactly what is happening. 
   Why is this so? States and school districts see pots of Federal money. There are over 100 different Federal programs for which States and local school districts can qualify. Sometimes they have to have matching funds. In most cases, they have to submit a lot of paperwork in order to get this money from the Federal Government. So even if it is only $20,000 or $30,000, a school district will hire an administrator to apply for the money, to fill out the forms, to provide the follow-up information, and then to administer that money when it finally comes. The net result is that about half of the money in administration is spent to get this 7 percent.  
   There is no surprise, therefore, that so many of the people the school districts hire are not teachers. That has an impact on education. It is one of the reasons why over the last many years, as the Federal Government has dangled these relatively small chunks of funding out to the schools, the schools, in order to get that funding, have jumped through more and more hoops, have spent more and more time and effort and more and more dollars chasing after that relatively small amount of Federal money. 
   This is inefficient. It is uneconomical. That is not to say the original ideas for the Federal programs were bad ideas. We are smart people in Washington. We come up with all kinds of great ideas. Therefore, we provide funding to implement those ideas. We say: If you will only jump through these various hoops, you can get some Federal funding for this particular great idea. The problem is, that is a very inefficient way to use taxpayer dollars. 
   It makes a lot more sense to say to the States: We have about 7 percent of the funding for your schools. If you will figure out how you can best spend that money on your own, let us know, set your own goals and make sure you meet those goals at the end of the year--in other words, there still has to be accountability--we will send the money to you without having to have these armies of bureaucrats filling out the forms and administering the Federal programs based upon the ideas we think are great. 
   It will probably turn out that a lot of those great ideas are implemented by the local schools but they won't always be implemented in every place. As the Presiding Officer noted, one school may need that money to decrease class sizes, to hire more teachers. Another may need that money to hook everybody up to the Internet. Another may want to focus on some kinds of remedial programs in math or reading, for example, tutorial kinds of 
   programs. There are all different kinds of specific needs in specific school districts. 
   We, in Washington, should not suppose we know best what each school needs, nor should we assume that if we just throw money at the problems, we will get better education. 
   It turns out that the States that spend the least amount on education are among those with best test scores. There are a lot of different reasons for that. It is also true that where we spend the most money, we have the worst test scores--right here in Washington, DC. So there is no direct correlation between the expenditure of money and a good education. It is where you put your funds, how you make use of those funds, how you prioritize. 
   That is what we want to address with this change in policy. No longer will everybody have to apply for these little grants and go through all of the hoops that it takes, fill out all of the paperwork, and then follow that paperwork throughout the years. Rather, we are hoping, at least for some States, we are going to create a contract whereby they can apply for the funds at the beginning on the basis of a very general set of goals that they establish, without all of the paperwork required to meet the Federal goals. They can set their own goals and, at the end of the year, demonstrate to us by a good accountability of how they have done whether or not the expenditure of those funds has worked to achieve their goals. If it has, then they can continue to apply for these funds in the future. If not, then they have to be relegated to the same old program they are under today, where they have to continue to apply for each individual program, spend all of the money to do that, and be relegated to this very inefficient way of getting the Federal dollars to them. 
   That is the essence of what we are trying to do--free up those dollars so people at the local level who know best what to do with them can put the money toward the goals they establish and not have to spend half of the money on administering the programs so that none of that money gets down to the kids we are trying to teach. 
   The second point is--I mentioned this earlier--if we get education right in our country, almost everything else will follow. Let me illustrate. 
   First of all, we will have an advantage in national defense. Why did I mention that first? We are the only superpower in the world right now, and we have the technology in our defense to beat anybody in the world should they challenge us. That technology is not static. It is dynamic. If we don't train the young people to continue to innovate, to continue to invent new things which will enable us not only to progress as a civilian society but also to have the capability to defend ourselves with new types of defense technology, we will not stay on top. The history of the world is littered with countries that at one time were on top but did not maintain their edge. 
   I was talking to some astronauts one day. I said: ``What is the difference between you and your Russian counterparts who go up in space with you?'' They said: ``There isn't any difference; they are just like we are.'' I said: ``Well, surely there has to be something.'' One of them said: ``Well, I can tell you a story. When something goes wrong up there, we immediately get on our computers and try to figure out how to fix it.'' 
   ``Our Russian friends get out their tablet of paper and pencil and they start doing the math, the algorithms, long division, calculus, whatever it takes, to figure out what to do.'' 
   I think there are two lessons in that. First of all, it is wonderful that, as a society, we are all trained in the use of computers, and we have everything so computer-literate that we can quickly figure out the answer. But the second lesson is that we also have to have people who understand what the Russian scientists do--the long math, the calculus--to be able to figure all of this out, because it is only by knowing that that you can program the computers to do the things we can do with computers. 
   Somebody has to understand the fundamental science. People in other countries are still being educated the old-fashioned way, using the fundamentals. We have to have enough people in this country who are educated in the fundamentals to maintain our technological superiority, while at the same time making the calculations from computers available to all of society to enable us to rapidly advance in all the different areas in which we have advanced. 
   But if we lose this technological edge because we are no longer educating our citizenry--at least the best and brightest--in the fundamentals of math and science, we will lose this edge. That is why I said we can maintain an edge in defense only if we continue to have the best educated citizenry in the world. Today, we have to import many scientists and computer specialists from other countries, and it demonstrates to us that we are not doing a good enough job of educating our own citizenry. 
   The same thing applies to better trade and economic opportunities. If we continue to be the inventors of the world and to take those inventions and create applications that make our lives better, we will continue to have the best products in the world that others want to buy, and we will maintain our general superiority in trade. But if we don't provide the education to our students to be able to continue to put out these kinds of products, if we become mostly a service-oriented society, other societies will take up the slack and will gain the advantage in trade and economic opportunities. As I said, we would have a better citizenry. 
   We have to continue not only to train people in science and math, but also in history, in learning the lessons of life from other subjects that enable us to work better as a society as we become more and more diverse, and to remember the key lessons of our Founding Fathers who understood that our democratic-republican form of government could not continue in perpetuity without a well-educated citizenry--a citizenry understanding the issues of the day because they had to make the decisions. 
   This is a do-it-yourself government, America. Our people vote on things; they have to be well enough informed to elect good representatives to represent them in the places of our representative government--the legislative branches of government, for example. If they are not engaged enough in the issues of the day to make intelligent decisions, then obviously the people they send here will likewise not be so educated. The quality of decisionmaking and public policy will falter.  Moreover, the understanding of their role in our government will gradually diminish. 
   Abraham Lincoln was very concerned about this. He said often that one of his big fears was that, little by little, each generation would lose some understanding of the ideas of the Founding Fathers and why the perpetuation of those ideas was so critical to the continuation of our democratic-republican form of government--the notion of citizen participation, the understanding of the checks and balances of our government, why we set the government up the way we did. 
   Frankly, I was distressed during the time of the impeachment 
   trial of the President--whatever you think of the outcome of that trial--about the lack of understanding of a lot of my fellow citizens about what that was all about, why we had such a procedure, why it was important to maintain the rule of law, and so on. These are subjects that our great-great-grandparents were well versed in from their education. They studied them long and hard. I am distressed that today our kids and grandkids don't take the humanities courses in college that we took, which brought us a real knowledge of the underpinnings of the philosophy of our government, our society, our civilization. 
   Our students today are caught up in all kinds of studies of minorities of one kind or another and in other fads of the day. They are not as well educated about the traditional concepts. In fact, some even assault these concepts as inapplicable to today's world, when in point of fact, the lessons of the great philosophers are totally applicable. You will find philosophers on every side of every issue. If you study them well, you will appreciate and understand the problems of today, the kinds of choices we should be making in our society today. 
   History is relevant and, as has been noted many times, those who ignore history are bound to repeat it. That was said in the context of the bad times of history--primarily the wars that have to be fought--because we don't understand that history. So a better education provides better citizenship. 
   It can provide stronger values because we study the great books and the philosophers who wrestled with the questions of what is the meaning of life and how we should conduct ourselves. There is a difference between right and wrong. There are truths and there are values. Young people today are not reminded that in the Declaration of Independence, our founders said there are ``inalienable rights,'' and ``we hold these truths to be self-evident.'' There were some things that are so true and we understand that. They were self-evident. But today, relativism has begun to teach our kids that there is no real truth, there is no definite right and wrong; there are only shades of gray. 
   If society comes to believe that and bases decisions upon that misunderstanding, then we cannot long survive as a free society, as a society founded on the principle that there are certain truths, and that part of those truths are that there are inalienable rights that are given to us by our Creator--not by some government. We then begin to rely upon government to do things because it is the benevolence of government that is the basis for our rights. Wrong. Government doesn't give us any rights. The best we can expect from government is the protection of our God-given rights. But if generations are not taught that, then we won't be able to make public decisions on the same foundation that our Founding Fathers understood were so important to future generations. 
   A reduction in crime. If we have a well-educated citizenry, we are going to have less crime. I think it is absolutely wrong to believe that people from disadvantaged backgrounds have to be relegated to a life of crime, that they somehow aren't as capable as everybody else at learning and improving their lives and staying free from a life of crime. It is so at odds with the fundamental precepts of our country that I can't believe people would still expect less of students in these kinds of communities. 
   Our proposal, as the Presiding Officer noted, is to recognize that everybody is entitled to an equal opportunity for education, and we cannot expect less of those in our most distressed areas. But if we don't give them the same opportunity to go to areas where they can get a good education and have safe schools that provide a quality education, then we are, in effect, saying: You are second class, you just can't make it, and we are not going to bother to give you the tools to make it. That is fundamentally wrong and un-American. 
   Finally, a good education--if we get it right--will allow for more personal fulfillment. We all want to make the very best of our God-given talents, to do the very best we can in life, because most of us, toward the end of our lives, begin reflecting on why we are here and what was so important about our life and what we want to leave behind. 
   We speak in terms of legacies. The reality is that most of us begin saying, well, did we make the most of what we had? We all have wonderful talents given to us, and we feel very good about ourselves and our lives if we have been able to take advantage of those talents, if we have fulfilled our expectations. Yet we know today we are not challenging our young students as much as we could be. It is a crime to me that we don't challenge them to the ultimate, the maximum, so they can make the most of what God has given them. 
   We fail them if we don't do that. If we are so lazy and so wrong about the way we provide an educational opportunity that we don't challenge them to be the very best they can be, that is the worst thing we can do for our young people today. That is why I said if we get education right, everything else will follow in our society, and that is why I think it is the most important thing we can do. 
   I was asked by a journalist: If you could do one thing in public policy as a member of the Federal Government, what would it be? I said: Well, other than ensuring our national security, which we have to put that first because that is the difference between life and death for all of our people, I would allow real choice in education so that people would be able to go to the place where they thought they could get the best education for their kids wherever that might be, and that the Federal Government not stand in the way of the exercise of that choice. And the very exercise of that choice would ensure a quality education and a safe education because the people who provide the education would have to rise to the challenge. They would have to understand that they would no longer be in business if people didn't come to them. If students didn't come, they wouldn't be able to educate. But if they did a good job, the students would come. It can be done. 
   I visited a school district in Arizona not long ago--the Alhambra School District--not a wealthy school district. There are a lot of minorities there. Carol Peck is the superintendent. She told me there are 39 different languages and dialects spoken at that school. Yet they have achievement at that school because they have innovative administrators and teachers and the kids learn. 
   We can learn lessons from that if we will allow innovation at the local level--if we will not bind them by all of these Federal rules and regulations. If we will lay those aside and at least let the small amount of Federal money that goes to local schools be used in an innovative way, we will begin to remove the barriers to innovation, and we will provide quality education for our kids. 
   As I said in the beginning, just like welfare reform, we can succeed if we will just throw off the old ideas and allow innovation to prosper at the local level and at the parental level--and among our teachers, who, after all, are on the front lines of this wonderful opportunity we have. 
   I appreciate the indulgence of the Chair. I thought since we had a little extra time I would embellish a little bit on the remarks I made. 
   I thank the Presiding Officer for setting aside this time for us to focus on this particular subject, and for the great job he has done over the many months in which he has been in charge in the effort to take some morning business time like this so we can all express ourselves on subjects that we are about to debate. I think the upcoming education debate is the most important debate we can engage in as a Senate.

   Mr. KYL. I thank the Chair. 
   We are in the process of determining just how much time speakers are going to need in order to conclude debate on the motion to proceed. Senator FEINSTEIN and I both have some preliminary remarks we would like to make in connection with that debate as the two chief proponents of the resolution. We understand Senator LEAHY and Senator BYRD wish to take some time, and Senator BIDEN as well a little later on. 
   As soon as we can confirm the amount of time people will need, we will probably propound a unanimous consent request in that regard.

   Mr. KYL. We will announce to all Members, if we can work that time arrangement out, just exactly how this will proceed. 
   In the meantime, let me see if I can set the stage so everyone will know where we are in this debate. Then I would like to thank some people and then move on to a colloquy with Senator FEINSTEIN, if I might. 
   Because of the way the Senate works, we have moved back and forth in Senate business. But the pending business is the motion to proceed on S.J. Res. 3; that is, the crime victims' constitutional rights resolution sponsored by Senator FEINSTEIN and myself. 
   We gained cloture earlier this week so we could proceed, and the motion to proceed will certainly be agreed to, if we carry the debate that far. Senator FEINSTEIN and I, however, are of the view that because of various things that have occurred, it is unlikely that a cloture motion, if filed, would be supported by the requisite number of Senators to succeed early next week. 
   Therefore, what we are prepared to do is speak to the issue of the resolution, where we are with respect to the resolution, to thank the many groups and sponsors and other individuals who have been so supportive of this effort, and to seek permission of the Senate, when people have finished their comments, to withdraw the motion to proceed and to move to other business. 
   That merely means a timeout in our efforts to secure passage of this constitutional amendment. 
   We recognize at this point in time that proceeding will simply encourage more Senators to use a great deal of the Senate's time in unproductive speeches that really do not go to the heart of our constitutional amendment but take time away from the Senate's important business. We have no intention of doing that. 
   So we will make some remarks that will set the stage for what we are about to do. But let me begin by noting the tremendous amount of support around the country that has accompanied our effort to bring this measure to the floor of the Senate. I have to begin by thanking two people in particular, Senator DIANNE FEINSTEIN and Majority Leader TRENT LOTT. We could not have brought this amendment, over the course of the last 4 years, to the bipartisan level of support it now enjoys without the ability to work on both sides of the aisle. No one could have carried this matter on the Democratic side more capably than Senator DIANNE FEINSTEIN. Before she came to the Senate, she was a passionate advocate for victims of crime. As mayor of San Francisco, she was a proponent of area residents who were victims of crime and carries that passion with her to this debate now. 
   She and I have worked closely with victims' rights advocates to shape the legislation. I might say, while some of our colleagues have suggested there is something wrong with the fact that we have conducted dozens of meetings with the administration, Department of Justice, and many others, and honed this amendment in 63 different drafts, we are very proud that we have included anyone who wanted to talk about this in our circle of friends working to get an amendment that could pass the Senate and that we have carefully taken their suggestions into account, thus accounting for the many different drafts as the 4-year progress of this resolution has brought us to this point. 
   The fact that we have taken their suggestions to heart and continually polished this amendment we think is a strong point. While we were criticized yesterday on the floor for engaging in yet more negotiations that might result in a final, 64th draft, I must say that was largely at the instigation of Senator FEINSTEIN, who said, given the fact the Department of Justice has four concerns still pending with regard to our specific proposal, let's meet with them and see if we can come to closure on those items. 
   Because of her leadership, we were able to come to closure on three of them. We believe we made more than a good faith effort with respect to the fourth, which had to do with the protection of defendants' rights. We were willing to acknowledge that the rights enumerated in this proposal take nothing whatsoever away from defendants' rights. I do not know how more clearly we can say it. That was not acceptable to the Department of Justice. 
   But it is not for want of trying, on the part of Senator FEINSTEIN, that we have been unable to secure the support of the Department of Justice for this amendment. So my first sincere thanks go to the person without whom we would not be at this point, my colleague Senator FEINSTEIN. 
   I also thank Leader LOTT. When I went to him with a request for floor time for this amendment, his first response was: You know all the business the Senate has to conduct. Are 
   you sure you want to go forward with this? I said we are absolutely certain. 
   Despite all the other pressing business, he was willing because he, too, believes strongly in this proposal, as a cosponsor, to give us the floor time to try to get this through. It is partially out of concern for his responsibilities as leader that we recognize that to proceed would result in a vote that would not be successful, and therefore, rather than use that precious time, we are prepared to visit privately with our colleagues to further provide education to them about the necessity of this amendment since, clearly, the methodology we have engaged in thus far was not working. We would make strong arguments, but I daresay it didn't appear that anyone was here on the floor listening because when various opponents would come to the floor, they would repeat the same mantra over and over again that we had already addressed. 
   Part of that mantra was, Did you know this amendment is longer than the Bill of Rights? We would patiently restate that is not true, that all of the rights of the defendants in the Constitution are embodied in language of more words than this amendment that embodies the victims' rights and so on.  Then that individual would leave the floor, and another individual would come to the floor and repeat the same erroneous information, and we would have to patiently respond to that. 
   Rather than continue that process, we believe it is better that we visit with our colleagues when we are not using this time on the floor and explain all of this to them, with the hope they will then be better able to support us in the future. 
   So I thank Senator FEINSTEIN. We have gone through a lot together on this. There is nobody in this body for whom I have greater respect. 
   Again, I thank Senator LOTT, the majority leader, for his support for us as well. 
   The National Victims' Constitutional Amendment Network is one of the really strong victims' rights groups that has backed us throughout this process. Roberta Roper has been involved in that. She was in my office this morning. She was with us yesterday. She has been with us throughout the process, helping us evaluate these various proposals and assisting us. 
   The National Organization for Victim Assistance, known by the acronym NOVA, headed by Marlene Young and John Stein, and all the people on the NOVA board, we are enormously appreciative of their strong support and assistance throughout this effort. They are going to continue to fight for sure. 
   Marsha Kight, whom Senator FEINSTEIN and I have come to know and respect because of her advocacy as someone whose daughter was killed in the Oklahoma City bombing, brought the experience of that trial and the firsthand knowledge of how victims were denied their rights even to attend the trial. She has been an important witness for us before the Judiciary Committee and at various other forums. 
   One of the groups in the country that is most strongly in support, and has provided a lot of grassroots support, is Mothers Against Drunk Driving, or MADD. Also, Students Against Drunk Driving, SADD, a group of younger people, has been helpful. Tom Howarth, Millie Webb, Katherine Prescott, and others have been very helpful to us in that regard. 
   Parents of Murdered Children has been enormously helpful. Rita Goldsmith is from my State of Arizona, from Sedona. 
   We have had tremendous help from legal scholars such as Professor Laurence Tribe, Professor Doug Beloof, and Professor Paul Cassell. I thank them for their enormous help in this effort, including their testimony before the Judiciary Committee. 
   There are many prosecutors. I need to mention a couple from my own State. The two largest counties in Arizona are Maricopa and Pima Counties. Rick Romley, the Republican-elected attorney from Maricopa County, the sixth largest county by population in the country, and Barbara LaWall, a Democratic-elected attorney from Pima County, have been very strong supporters and helpful in our work. 
   Law enforcement has been very well represented by organizations and individuals. From the Law Enforcement Alliance of America, Darlene Hutchinson and Laura Griffith have been helpful. 
   Various attorneys general, such as Delaware Attorney General Jane Brady, Wisconsin Attorney General Jim Doyle, and Kansas Attorney General Carla Stovall. By the way, these are Democrats and Republicans alike. It is a totally bipartisan effort. As a matter of fact, the National Association of Attorneys General--we have a very good letter signed by the vast majority of attorneys general in support of our crime victims' constitutional rights amendment. 
   We also have support from former U.S. Attorneys General: Ed Meese, Bill Barr, and Dick Thornburgh are strongly supportive of our proposal. 
   From a show with which Americans are familiar, ``America's Most Wanted,'' John Walsh has been an early and strong supporter of our proposal. 
   From the Stephanie Roper Foundation--I mentioned Roberta Roper--but Steve Kelly of the Stephanie Roper Foundation has been very helpful. 
   Arizona Voice for Crime Victims; a person who helped Senator FEINSTEIN in the early years, Neil Quinter, a superb former Senate staff member and with whom I visited just this morning, continues his support for this. 
   Matt Lamberti and David Hantman of Senator FEINSTEIN's office; Jason Alberts, Nick Dickinson, and Taylor Nguyen of my office; and, most important, Stephen Higgins of my staff and Steve Twist, an attorney from Arizona, whose support and competence in helping us through this process was, frankly, simply indispensable.

I will make those comments after Senator FEINSTEIN has had an opportunity to make some comments that I know she strongly wishes to make.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I reiterate what I said yesterday, and that is, the best part of the debate we had was the debate with Senator SCHUMER whose approach to this was serious and intelligent. He asked the best questions. I believe we answered them, but we did not come to agreement. Of course, we will be working with him in the future on this matter and, hopefully, persuade him that a constitutional amendment is the best way to go. The debate we had among Senator FEINSTEIN, Senator SCHUMER, and myself I thought was the highlight of this debate. I appreciate his remarks. 
   I yield to Senator FEINSTEIN for comments I know she wants to make.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, Senator FEINSTEIN is exactly correct. I think it illustrates the inconsistency of the opponents of the amendment. In the first place, they say we should try a statutory remedy. When we try the statutory remedy and the court says you lose, you still don't have the rights--and as Senator SCHUMER said, the court essentially ignored what Congress did, and that was offensive to him because he had been one of the authors of that legislation--we come back and say that illustrates the fact that you need a constitutional protection because until you have that, the courts can't continue to ignore these statutes. Then Senator SCHUMER said: But courts cannot ignore statutes; they are just like the Constitution. You have to apply statutes. The answer to that is, well, you should, but what is the remedy if you don't? 
   As the Senator pointed out, until we provide standing in a constitutional amendment, if the courts don't abide by the statutes, there is no recourse. That is the bottom line as to why a constitutional amendment is necessary in these kinds of cases. 
   The other inconsistency is the other side says you don't have a lot of court decisions overturning statutes for State constitutional protection, so we don't need a constitutional amendment. 
   That is an odd argument. Most of the constitutional protections are not the result of a Supreme Court decision to strike down a statute or a State provision. In fact, I don't know of any that are, frankly. 
   Most of the constitutional protections for defendants and other citizens have come about because of the recognition that there are certain fundamental rights that need to be protected, and we ought not to wait for courts to strike something down in order to assume that it is time to propose a constitutional amendment. But if that were the proper standard, then we have a clear reason to do so because as the Senator from California pointed out, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals has now ruled 
   that is the precedent, and for at least, I think, seven States in the Tenth Circuit, they have a very bad ruling on their hands; namely, victims have no standing to assert the rights we provided for in statute. So if that is to be the standard--that you have to have a court decision that proves the need for a constitutional protection--we have it. So whichever way you want to argue it, I think the point is made that we need a constitutional amendment to provide real protection for victims of crime.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, another point Senator FEINSTEIN made yesterday which people need to continue to focus on is that a Federal statute is going to apply to Federal crimes. A U.S. constitutional amendment applies to all cases in all courts in every State, whether at the trial court level in the county--we call it superior court in Arizona--all the way to any other court,  including Federal courts. But a statute that we pass applies to Federal court trials for the most serious crimes. In Federal law, that accounts for about 1 percent of the victims of violent crime in the entire country. 
   Almost always the local police catch the perpetrator, that perpetrator is tried by the local county prosecutor in the county courts, and the appeals go up through the State court process. Sometimes they can jump over to the Federal court because of a constitutional issue involved. But except on military reservations, Indian reservations, certain kinds of kidnapping cases, and things of that sort where it is not a Federal case, a Federal statute doesn't apply.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, Senator FEINSTEIN has touched on a central point because none of the advocates for victims have ever sought to deny one single right to the defendant. In point of fact, the victims' rights that we protect do not deny or abridge the defendants' rights under the Constitution. It is not our intention, and it doesn't happen. We have been willing to acknowledge that in a variety of ways and in a variety of words in the Constitution. 
   We are not willing to say if there is ever a case in which the defendant asserts a right under the Constitution then that right automatically wins over any of these victims' rights. What we said, and what people in the Department of Justice and the President and others have agreed with, is there should be a balancing just as there is a balancing of two constitutional rights, defendants' rights to a speedy and public trial, a fair trial, and the right of free press. 
   When the press wants to get into the courtroom, sometimes, as we all know, the judges say: No. We are only going to allow a limited number of certain kinds of media in the courtroom. We don't want a media circus in the courtroom. That wouldn't be fair to the defendant. 
   The media says: Wait a minute. We have a first amendment right. 
   The defendant says: I have a constitutional right, too, which amounts to a right for a fair trial. 
   The judge says: You are both right, and you are both going to get your rights vindicated, but neither of you have an absolute right that excludes any other consideration. The judge says to the defendant: I am not going to allow your case to be prejudiced by a media circus. Media, you are going to have to restrain yourselves to the following conditions. Judges say that every day. 
   The defendant has a right to sit at his trial. But he can't sit there if he is going to be yelling, screaming, and jumping up and down and threatening people. The judge has a way to control his courtroom, and so on. 
   We are perfectly willing to make it crystal clear in our language that the enumeration of these rights for victims does not abridge any rights guaranteed in the Constitution for defendants or those accused of crime. We are unwilling to say, if there has to be any balancing, the defendant always wins. That would deny exactly what we are trying to achieve for the victims, which is some equal consideration under the Constitution for their fairness given all of the things we have rightly done for defendants.

   Mr. KYL. I do. If I may read one paragraph from a piece written by Professor Paul Cassell, I think it helps to elucidate what we are talking about, if the Senator would not mind. 
   We are talking about potentially conflicting rights under the Constitution. Senator BIDEN has made this point. Hopefully, he will be here a little bit later to speak to this, but he made the point he can't see there ever being an irreconcilable conflict between the defendant's rights and the victim's rights, and in one sense I think he is absolutely correct because you can vindicate two conflicting rights through a balancing test. But the fact is, there is only one situation I can think of in which you even have that conflict, and that is the right to attend a trial, where the defendant would say, it is not fair to me if the victim or the victim's family attends the trial, and the victim's family or the victim says, wait a minute, that's one of my most fundamental rights, and the Senator guaranteed that in this provision. 
   There are ways to accommodate both the defendant's and victim's rights, of  course. At least the Senator and I understand that, but there are some who find that very difficult and troubling. But here is the analogous situation which I think makes our 
   case. This is what Professor Paul Cassell says:  
   Confirmation of the constitutional worthiness of victims' rights comes from the judicial treatment of an analogous right: the claim of the media to a constitutionally protected interest in attending trials. In Richmond Newspapers v. Virginia, the Court agreed that the First Amendment guaranteed the right of the public and the press to attend criminal trials. Since that decision, few have argued that the media's right to attend trials is somehow unworthy of constitutional protection, suggesting a national consensus that attendance rights to criminal trials are properly the subject of constitutional law. Yet the current doctrine produces what must be regarded as a stunning disparity in the way courts handle claims of access to court proceedings. Consider, for example, two issues actually litigated in the Oklahoma City bombing case. The first was the request of an Oklahoma City television station for access to subpoenas for documents issued through the court. The second was a request for various family members of the murdered victims to attend the trial, discussed previously. My sense is that the victims' request should be entitled to at least as much respect as the media request. Yet under the law that exists today, the television station has a First Amendment interest in access to the documents while the victims' families have no First Amendment interest in challenging their exclusion from the trial. The point here is not to argue that victims deserve greater constitutional protection than the press, but simply that if press interests can be read into the Constitution without somehow violating the ``sacredness of the covenant,'' the same can be done for victims.  
   That is the end of Professor Cassell's quotation, the point being--to those who say the Constitution is sacred; we cannot change it--it includes rights of the media to attend trials, but somehow it would be wrong to grant those same rights to victims. That, indeed, is a disparity. To the extent a defendant might say, ``but I don't want the victim or the victim's family in the courtroom,'' just as the Constitution says, but there is a right that we have to balance with your concerns--and that is the media's right--we would be saying here: The victim also has some consideration here, and the court needs to take that into account in deciding the circumstances under which victims and victims' families would be present. 
   If we were to somehow insert language that made it possible for courts to rule that the defendant would always win in the case of such an assertion, then we would have, I think, perpetrated a cruel hoax on victims who would think they had something that in fact they would not have. It would be similar to what victims experienced when they proudly went into court with their new statute that the Congress had passed, saying: ``Now, judge, we have a right to attend the trial,'' and he ignored it. If we put it in the Constitution, the judges can't ignore it. 
   But if we said in the Constitution: However, the defendant is always going to prevail in the case of a conflict, then that would be a cruel hoax. I think we have gone so far as to suggest we are willing to acknowledge that the rights enumerated for victims do not abridge rights guaranteed in the Constitution to defendants. I do not know how much more clearly we can say that. It leads us, and those who are supportive, to conclude, if that is not good enough, that perhaps there really is not a 
   desire on the part of those on the other side to come to an agreement here in a way that could permit us to have a chance of succeeding in this debate this week or next. 
   That is the unfortunate state of play. Senator FEINSTEIN is absolutely correct. Perhaps in the ensuing weeks we will have an opportunity to explore other ways of expressing this that make it clear we are not taking anything away from defendants. But by the same token, we have to give meaningful rights to victims.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, until those in opposition wish to be here, then, I will speak to close out, really, what I have to say about this. I would like to do two things: Just to reiterate a couple of circumstances why this is necessary, and, second, to respond to some of the arguments that have been adduced against what we propose. 
   Why do we need these rights? Suppose your daughter was raped and murdered and you wanted to attend the trial and you were told that, under the law, you were going to have to sit outside the courtroom every day. The defendant, the defendant's family and friends, they can be in the courtroom, they can watch the trial, but you are going to have to sit outside on the bench in the hallway. That is not fair. It tears at the gut of those who have been victimized already by the commission of the crime that hurt or killed their loved one. 
   Suppose you pick up the newspaper someday and read that the person who raped you, or assaulted you, is out on the street. He had been incarcerated. Your testimony helped put him there. You have no idea he is running free. His may be the knock on your door or the person at the other end of the telephone which rings. You did not get notice of his parole hearing. You could not even go down and tell the parole board how vicious a person this was and why they ought to think twice before releasing him on parole. You did not even have a chance to go down and say, ``Will you please consider my safety in establishing conditions for his release, that he has to stay away from me,'' for example. 
   We are talking about things that are serious, not frivolous. These are real cases. Both of the examples I cited are real cases--multiple cases, I might add. What are the arguments against it? One argument is it is too long and specific. Right after that, we heard it is too general. Senator SCHUMER said we should just have a general statement about the fairness that victims are entitled to and leave it at that. Others say that would be far too general. How would we ever define ``unreasonable,'' which is one of the words in our amendment here? 
   Of course, one could have argued that same thing about some of the protections for defendants in the Bill of Rights. How will we define ``unreasonable search and seizure,'' it could have been argued. We have done all right on that. 
   We were fairly specific about the enumerations of these rights because we didn't want to take anything away from defendants. We wanted it to be crystal clear exactly what the rights were so nobody could contend they went further than they go, so that nobody could argue we might be stepping on the toes of a defendant. We didn't want to step on the defendant's toes. 
   We wanted to make sure the government wouldn't deny victims access to certain points in the criminal justice process. We were very careful to define this. Indeed, the Department of Justice met with us on numerous occasions and said we would have to be more precise in our description because they could envision possible problems if we do not nail it down. We nailed it down. That took a few words. 
   Then we were criticized for having too long an amendment; it is longer than the Bill of Rights. We pointed out, it is not longer than the Bill of Rights. Indeed, our amendment is shorter than all of the rights guaranteed to defendants in the Constitution. The defendants' rights consume 348 words; the victims' rights consume 179 words. There are 307 words in our amendment, excluding the purely technical provision. 
   Isn't it amazing we have gotten down to a word count, if that is one of the big objections of opponents? ``It is a little too long.'' It is not too long. If it were shorter, their argument would be it is not specific enough, we need to be more specific--and that takes more words. 
   Perhaps the least argument--and there will be others propounding this argument--is that because the Constitution is sacred, it should not be amended. Maybe it is appropriate to read something in the sacred document, article V: Whenever two-thirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose amendments to this Constitution ..... when ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several States, it becomes effective as part of this Constitution. 
   Thomas Jefferson said: I am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws in the Constitution, but laws and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind. As that becomes more developed, more enlightened, as new discoveries are made, new truths discovered and manners and  opinions change, with the change of circumstances, institutions must advance to keep pace with the times. 
   Indeed, Thomas Jefferson also said: Happily for us, when we find our Constitution is defective and insufficient to secure the happiness of our people, we can assemble with all the coldness of philosophers and set them to rights, while every other nation on Earth must have recourse to arms to amend or restore their constitutions. 
   It is certainly a reflection of our wonderful United States of America and our Constitution that from time to time we have found it necessary to grant rights in this sacred document: the right to vote, the right to vote when you are 18, the right to vote and not to be defined by one's sex, the right to a speedy trial. These are rights that were granted by amendment to citizens after this sacred document was written. We all agree with the proposition that it is a wonderful document, a sacred document, a document that ought not lightly be added to, which 
   has a wonderful and glorious history. Indeed, I submit that some of the most profound and glorious aspects of the history of this Constitution are found in its amendments. 
   To suggest that somehow those who propose an amendment to the Constitution are doing a great disservice and are assaulting the Constitution is itself a great disservice to the process set forth in the Constitution. 
   It is said that the Constitution ordinarily precluded the government from affecting the rights of citizens, whereas we are granting rights to people. I talked about three or four amendments that granted rights to people: the right to vote if you are 18, the right to vote if you are a woman, the right to a speedy trial. Those were rights granted to citizens. Other rights are expressed in terms of preventing the government from intruding on your rights. For example, the government will not preclude you from having a speedy trial. They will not deny you the right to a speedy trial. They won't deny you the right to counsel. 
   You can express it either way--as a grant of a right or the government not denying you the ability to do these things. We say the government cannot exclude you from the courtroom. They can't exclude you from the trial. We are not really saying you have a right to attend the trial; we are saying you have a right not to be excluded from the trial. There is a difference. The former could lead to assertions that the government should pay for your getting to the trial, that your employer should have to let you off work or pay. We don't address that. We only say if you show up, you get to attend; the government cannot exclude you. 
   Some of the other rights are expressed in terms of direct rights. However, they all infer that the government can't exclude you from these proceedings. We are doing exactly what other amendments to the Constitution have done. They are similar rights. The right of the press to be able to cover a trial, it seems to me, should be no greater than the right of a victim to be present at the trial. What is the difference? I conclude by challenging anybody to tell me what the difference is between granting the media the right to attend a trial and granting the victim in the case the right to attend the trial. 
   I don't understand why there is such a visceral negative reaction to what we are trying to do. If you have ever been a victim or been part of a tragedy that has affected others, you know how much they want to bring closure to the event, why they want to witness the criminal justice process that brings the matter to a close, why they want to participate at a couple of the stages, particularly at the time of sentencing and also at the time of a conditional release so that their safety can be considered, as well as the safety of others. 
   No one opposing our amendment has suggested that those are unworthy of protection. Rather, they have said we can do it by statute. But what did we find yesterday when we looked at the data according to the National Institute of Justice? After 18 years of Federal and State statutes and State constitutional provisions, looking at the statistics from the States that do it the best, that have the most stringent requirement for notice, fewer than 60 percent of victims were notified of the sentencing hearing and fewer than 40 percent were notified of the pretrial release of the defendant. 
   As I said yesterday, would we consider those adequate percentages for defendants being given their Miranda warnings, 
   something which isn't even in the Constitution? No. But somehow we think it is OK that statutes provide notice to only 40 percent of the people who want to be present at the parole board, or at least have the opportunity to be present, to say, please, don't let my assailant go; he will hurt someone. We are no longer talking about somebody accused of a crime; we are talking about somebody who has been convicted and who has been serving time for the commission of that crime. 
   I mentioned the case of Patricia Pollard--because it is a case from Arizona--who was brutally raped and left to die. She wasn't told that the parole board was meeting to consider and then eventually decided to let her assailant out of prison on a home arrest kind of program. By accident, she was made aware of it. When she went back to the parole board and asked them to reconsider their decision, after hearing her story, they kept him in prison. 
   When I asked her if she thought her life was in danger had he gotten out, she said: Maybe he would have tracked me down, but, frankly, I was a random opportunity for him. I came along at just the time he wanted to do this to somebody, and he did it to me. Mostly I was concerned what would happen to somebody else because if he got out he would be sure to do this to somebody else. 
   This is what we are talking about. This is not frivolous. This is not trivial. This is people's lives we are talking about. When opponents say, we can protect it by statute, we say, the State of Arizona had a very good statute. In fact, it was better than a statute; it was a constitutional provision in the State. She still didn't get notice. In fact, 60 percent of people don't get notice under these constitutional provisions and State statutes. 
   Opponents say: That is good enough; maybe we can pass a Federal statute. 
   We say a Federal statute can only affect 1 percent of all of these cases, and there is little reason to believe a Federal statute would be observed any better than State constitutional provisions are, as the Oklahoma City bombing case reveals. 
   I am at a loss. I agree with Senator FEINSTEIN. We are moved by these cases. We are moved by the people. We want to help. Everybody wants to help. Even opponents, I am convinced, want to help. So let's do something about it. It is not doing something effective about it to fall back on the notion: Well, we will just rely on another statute; let's pass another law. That is not the answer. 
   We are at this point now because we have not done enough to educate our colleagues, and I will accept part of the blame for that. I should have spent a lot more time--although I must confess my colleagues got tired of me coming around saying: Are you sure you wouldn't like to hear a little bit more about this? Maybe we should have tried a little harder to say: Will you please listen one more time to our plea? 
   What has happened is a very superficial mantra of inaccuracies and falsehoods have persuaded colleagues to oppose this to the extent they would not be willing to allow it to come to a vote. In other words, when we would seek to bring this to a final vote, we would not be able to stop the talking, to stop the filibuster, in effect, to get 60 of our colleagues to agree to bring the matter to a vote or to prevent nongermane amendments. There had been a suggestion by some that if we proceed, then we can expect a whole flurry of amendments that have nothing to do with what we are talking about. 
   Obviously, we do not want to tie up our colleagues' time with that, so we come to the unhappy conclusion that we have more work to do. 
   The good news is that we prevailed with 80-some votes--perhaps the Senator can recall exactly how many votes we got on the cloture motion to proceed. But it was over 80, as I recall. We have 41 cosponsors of our amendment now, which is real progress. We got a good bipartisan vote out of the Judiciary Committee. 
   This is the first time this Federal constitutional amendment has been brought to the floor of either House. We have reached a real milestone. We  have done well. Most constitutional amendments never pass. All of them take a long time. I do not know of any, at least in modern history, that passed the first time they were presented on the floor of the Senate. 
   The fact we have been thwarted part way down the road temporarily, while a setback of sorts, should not dissuade those advocates or crime victims in their efforts. As Senator FEINSTEIN said, we will be back, and hopefully next time when we are back, more of our colleagues will have had an opportunity to study this carefully, more victims and victims' rights organizations will have had an opportunity to visit with Senators and Representatives, and we will have been able to persuade a sufficient number of them to allow us to proceed to a final vote. 
   While there is some sorrow in our inability to bring this to conclusion today, I am buoyed by the prospect and the fact we have at least gotten to this point.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I want to add something to a point Senator FEINSTEIN just made. I do not think she would take offense at my mentioning what occurred in my office about 4 hours ago. 
   We were summarizing the events and what led to the inability to get this across the goal line this week. I said it is partially my fault for not bringing more victims to the Senate to talk directly with Senators and share their personal stories. 
   I told that to Roberta Roper, who heads up the Stephanie Roper Foundation. Stephanie Roper was brutally murdered, and Roberta, her mother, has carried this cause in Stephanie's name. They do a lot of good in terms of victim support, in addition to victim advocacy. 
   She said: You have to understand, though, we are conditioned not to present these stories in an emotional, personal way. We have been told over and over again in the court that ``there can be no display of emotion.'' Those are the words the judges used. I have been told that a display of emotion would be wrong. 
   Now, think about that. Part of what makes us great as a people is the willingness to act out of our heart as well as our mind. We should never do incorrect things or unintelligent things, acting purely on the basis of emotion, but nor should we deny that emotion can be a potent force in developing public policy. 
   I tried to tell Roberta that I think it was a mistake, on my part, not to appreciate what she was telling me, not to understand it in advance, and not to counsel her to go ahead in this environment and express it in emotional terms. This is not a court of law. This is where the people's business is done. 
   I believe that until one fully appreciates what a victim goes through, it is hard to appreciate the necessity for what we are doing here. 
   Perhaps I could conclude by reading a paragraph again from the remarks of Professor Paul Cassell before the Judiciary Committee. 
   He said:  
   The available social science research suggests that the primary barrier to successful implementation of victims' rights is ``the socialization of [lawyers] in a legal culture and structure that do not recognize the victim as a legitimate party in criminal proceedings.''  
   He is talking about a professor, a colleague of his, who disagrees with our position, Professor Mosteller. 
   He says:  
   Professor Mosteller seems to agree generally with this view, explaining that ``officials fail to honor victims' rights largely as a result of inertia and past learning, insensitivity to the unfamiliar needs of victims, lack of training, and inadequate or misdirected institutional incentives.'' A constitutional amendment, reflecting the instructions of the nation to its criminal justice system, is perfectly designed to attack these problems and develop a new legal culture supportive of victims. To be sure, one can paint the prospect of such a change in culture as ``entirely speculative.'' Yet this means nothing more than that, until the Amendment passes, we will not have an opportunity to precisely assay its positive effects. Constitutional amendments have changed our legal culture in other areas, and clearly the logical prediction is that a victims' amendment would go a long way towards curing official indifference. This hypothesis is also consistent with the findings of the National Institute of Justice study on state implementation of victims' rights. The study concluded that ``[w]here legal protection is strong, victims are more likely to be aware of their rights, to participate in the criminal justice system, to view criminal justice system officials favorably, and to express more overall satisfaction with the system. It is hard to imagine any stronger protection of victims' rights than a federal constitutional amendment. Moreover, we can confidently expect that those who will most often benefit from the enhanced consistency in protecting victims' rights will be members of racial minorities, the poor, and other disempowered groups. Such victims are the first to suffer under the current, ``lottery'' implementation of victims' rights.  
   I think that expresses well the reason for the frustration we have shared, the reason so many of our colleagues have come here repeating the mantra of the legal profession that it has never been this way before. Maybe it is time to change the way things have been. That is why we have been so strongly in support of this amendment. 
   I see one of the opponents of the amendment is here. I know he wishes to speak. Therefore, let me conclude my remarks by again thanking Senator FEINSTEIN for her stalwart, effective support and her desire to continue this battle on behalf of the victims of crime. 
   I assure you, Mr. President, that even though we will be withdrawing our motion to proceed on S.J. Res. 3, we will continue to meet with, and work with, anyone who wishes to work with us on this--opponents and proponents--to try to get it into the condition that will finally be approved by two-thirds of this body and two-thirds of the other body. That is our challenge. That is our commitment. It is our promise that we will continue in this effort.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I remind my colleagues of the status now of business on the Senate floor. It has been a little confusing, I know, particularly for those who might be watching who aren't familiar with Senate procedures. But sometimes we take something up and then lay it aside, take something else up, and then go back to the original matter, and so on. That is what we have been doing. 
   Yesterday, you will recall that we began the debate on S.J. Res. 3, which is an amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would provide rights to victims of violent crime. Senator FEINSTEIN of California and I are the primary sponsors of that resolution. 
   At the end of yesterday, we went to other matters. We are now going to resume debate on the motion to proceed to this resolution. 
   The Senate procedure is that we first have to decide to proceed, and then we can proceed. So later on this afternoon, hopefully, the Senate will vote to proceed to formal consideration of this constitutional amendment. Technically, for a while this afternoon we are going to be debating on whether or not we should proceed. 
   I am hopeful our colleagues will agree, whether they support the amendment or not, that they should permit us to proceed to make our case so they can evaluate it and decide at the end of that period whether or not they want to support a constitutional amendment. 
   I think it is a little difficult, given the fact that there hasn't been a great deal of information, for people who are not on the Judiciary Committee to decide what their position is on this until they have heard arguments. 
   Yesterday afternoon, Senator LEAHY primarily, but several other members of the Democratic side and one Republican, came to the floor and discussed at length, I think for at least 3, maybe 4 hours, reasons why they thought that constitutional amendment should not be adopted. Certainly there are legitimate arguments that can be adduced on both sides of this proposition. 
   But I would like to begin today by explaining a little bit why we believe that it is important, first, to take the amendment up, and, second, why we believe, if we do take it up, it should be supported by our colleagues. 
   Senator FEINSTEIN will be here shortly, and she will begin her presentation by discussing a case, the Oklahoma City bombing case, that in some sense is a metaphor for this issue generally, because in the Oklahoma City bombing case victims were denied their rights. Families of people who were killed were not permitted to sit through the trial. They were given a choice over a lunch break during the trial either to remain in the courtroom or to leave if they wanted to be present at the time of the sentencing and to say something to the judge at that time. There was enough confusion about the matter that many of them gave up their right to sit in the courtroom in order to be able to exercise their right to speak to the judge at the time of the sentencing. 
   Congress was so exercised about that it actually passed a law--it was specifically directed to the Oklahoma City bombing case but it pertained to other similar cases--so that victims have the right to be in courtroom, and they shouldn't have to make a choice between the trial and sentencing. They should be able to appear at both. 
   Senator FEINSTEIN will discuss in a moment the details of how that case proceeded and why it stands for the proposition that we need a Federal constitutional amendment. 
   The bottom line is that even the Federal Government passed a statute designed to pertain to this exact case which was insufficient to assure that those people could exercise what we believe is a fundamental right to sit through that trial. They were denied that right. 
   What is worse, because the case was taken up on appeal, and because the U.S. Constitution clearly trumps any Federal statute, or any State statute, or State constitutional provision, it wasn't possible to argue that this Federal statute trumped the defendants' rights if those were bases for the rights asserted. 
   So you have at least seven States, or thereabouts, in the Tenth Circuit that are now bound by a precedent that says this Federal statute doesn't work, to let you sit in the courtroom during the trial. 
   That has to be changed. There is only one way to change it. That is with a Federal constitutional amendment that says to the courts, from now on, these are fundamental rights and courts must consider these rights. 
   As Senator FEINSTEIN will point out, supporters of this amendment include a wide variety of people who had family and friends involved in the Oklahoma City bombing case. One is Marsha Kight, whose daughter was killed. Marsha has been a strong supporter of the victims' rights amendment because she had to sit through all that. That is what Senator FEINSTEIN will be talking about. 
   We listened to arguments yesterday from Senator LEAHY and others about the amendment. I understand they wish to talk this afternoon. I will be paying attention to what they have to say and try to respond as best I can. The arguments fall into two or three general categories. One notion they presented is that this is a complicated amendment, it is too long--even longer than the Bill of Rights. It is not longer than the Bill of Rights. We have counted the words. I will have my staff tell Members exactly how many words are in the Bill of Rights and how many words are in this amendment. 
   The point is, to find defendants' rights, one has to look all over the Constitution. We have amended the Constitution several times to give people who are accused of crime different rights. If you added up all rights of the  accused and put them into one amendment, it would be much longer than the amendment we have for victims' rights. We have all of our rights in one place. 
   I don't think it should be an argument against providing victims of crime certain fundamental rights because it takes up several lines of the Constitution. We either mean to give them fundamental rights or we don't. Defendants have all of the rights now. That is fine. We take nothing away from the defendants. But this should not be based on whether there are more words describing the defendants' rights than there are describing victims' rights. 
   One reason we take a little longer to describe victims' rights--although it is shorter than the defendants' rights if we add them up--we have described them with great precision. They are very limited. 
   Defendants' rights are expressed in broad terms. Defendants have a ``right to trial by jury.'' Does that mean in all cases? Does that mean just in felony cases? What kind of a jury? Defendants are protected from ``unreasonable search and seizure.'' What does that mean? There is a basic ``fair trial'' right, and a right to counsel. All of these are expressed in very general terms. 
   There are thousands of pages of court decisions interpreting what ``unreasonable search and seizure'' means. I suppose the Founding Fathers could have written 10 pages describing exactly what they meant by ``unreasonable search and seizure.'' They didn't do that. 
   In our proposal, we have described these victims' rights with great care so that there could be no argument the rights took anything away from defendants. That is why some of the wording is apparently a little bit longer than our friends on the other side desire. 
   I guarantee if they were shorter, if they merely said victims have a reasonable right to attend the trial, their argument would be: We haven't nailed this down; This is too 
   broad and subject to interpretation. You have to state exactly what is meant or it might conflict with the defendants' rights. Those who oppose this will argue it either way. In effect, we are damned if we do and damned if we don't. We have tried to word it carefully. 
   I have the exact number of words for anybody who is interested. Without the technical provisions which concern the effective date, the amendment is 307 words. The victims' rights are described in 179 words. Defendants' rights in the U.S. Constitution consume 348 words. 
   OK, so if this is all about how many words there are, we win. However, that is not what this is about. Let's get serious. 
   The other argument from the opponents was, we have written 63 drafts of this amendment. Yes, indeed, we have. In fact, we are proud of it. We have been making the point that this isn't some unthought-through proposition, written on the back of an envelope. We have written draft after draft after draft, as a good craftsman would polish a fine piece of furniture over and over and over until it was absolutely smooth and shiny. We have done the same thing with this amendment. 
   We have talked to prosecutors. We have talked to the U.S. Department of Justice. They have written a very nice letter complimenting the changes we made about concerns they expressed. We have accommodated many of their concerns. We talked to law professors; we talked to victims groups; we talked to lots of different people. As a result of all of these conversations, we have continued to modify the amendment to take into account their wonderful suggestions, to take into account concerns they have raised. 
   We are rather proud of the fact that we have been careful; we haven't just tried to slide this through. For 4 years we have been working on this through 63 different drafts. We now have a very carefully crafted, honed constitutional amendment. Frankly, we have written more drafts here than the Bill of Rights. People think that is a pretty good document. Of course, I would never hope to compete with our Founding Fathers. Understanding how much thought they put into their amendments, we have tried to be as careful in what we have written. 
   I daresay arguments can be made against our proposed constitutional amendment. There are some legitimate points to make. However, it is not legitimate to say we have tried to hurry this through, or we have not given it enough thought, or we have not had enough input, or we have not been willing to make changes. I think the fact we have gone through this number of changes illustrates the fact that we have been very open in the process. 
   That is why the amendment passed through the Senate Judiciary Committee with a very strong bipartisan vote of 12-5. Getting anything through this Judiciary Committee in the form of a constitutional amendment, I think all of my colleagues would agree, is a pretty sound testament to the care with which we have crafted this particular provision. 
   While there are arguments that can be made about the constitutional amendment, it is not fair to say we shouldn't do it because of the number of words in the amendment or we shouldn't do it because we have taken the pains to go through 63 drafts. We have tried to be very careful in what we have done. Those were two of the arguments raised against this yesterday. 
   A third argument was that we ought to give some time to allow a statutory alternative to work. With all due respect, it 
   was in 1982, when President Reagan convened a group that was concerned with protecting victims' rights, that the proposal for a constitutional amendment was first made. It was in 1996 when President Clinton held a ceremony in the Rose Garden with the Attorney General and many others expressing his strong support for a Federal constitutional amendment to protect the rights of victims of crime. He said: We have experimented with State statutes, Federal statutes, and State constitutional provisions long enough. They just don't work to secure the rights of victims. Well meaning prosecutors and judges have tried hard. In fact, the cause of victims' rights has gained a lot of support over the years. Victims are much better treated in the process now than they were many years ago. 
   I read yesterday statement after statement by President Clinton, by Attorney General Reno, by associate attorneys general, by law professors, by Laurence Tribe, a respected professor from Harvard, district attorneys and judges, all of whom say, unfortunately, when a right is not expressed as a fundamental right in the U.S. Constitution, it just isn't protected with the same degree of care and consideration and energy as those rights that are protected in the U.S. Constitution. 
   That is why, according to a recent study, 60 percent of the victims who are supposed to get notice of their rights don't receive notice. One cannot exercise a constitutional right if one is not aware of it. 
   With respect to defendants, we have made it the Holy Grail that they will be advised of their rights. This is what the Miranda warning is all about. Defendants have a right not to speak and a right to an attorney. 
   Victims ought to at least get some reasonable notice of their rights. It does not mean you have to track them all down and stick a statement right in front of their faces and tell them orally, but it does mean you at least have to keep them on a mailing list or phone list. Computerized telephone messages now can be sent. 
   We have had testimony. For example, the county attorney in the sixth largest county in the country by population has testified it is just no problem to notify victims of their rights. He says the entire cost of taking care of the victims' rights is about $15, from beginning to end. It just is not a valid argument that it is going to be a real problem for prosecutors or the court system to provide this notice and to provide these rights to victims. 
   I have one final comment, since I think Senator FEINSTEIN is now ready, and I have given the introduction for her comments, I say to Senator FEINSTEIN, so our colleagues will be prepared to hear what she has to say. But I have a final comment about these rights. 
   There is a culture in the legal community that has built up over the years that bends over backwards to protect the rights of defendants. We have no quarrel with that. Law school courses,  Law Review articles, everything is oriented toward that. When you go to law school and you are a second- or third-year law student, you can participate in a legal clinic representing indigent defendants and so on, but there is no similar culture to protect the rights of victims. That is one reason why you have people reflexively saying: We have to make sure we protect the right of defendants. If we are going to protect the right of victims, we just do not feel real good 
   about that because it might hurt defendants. 
   As we pointed out yesterday and as I think Senator FEINSTEIN is about to point out today, nothing in our proposal takes away a constitutional right of a person standing accused of a crime. We would not permit that and we are willing to include language that makes it clear that the rights we enumerate here for victims do not in any way abridge the rights of the defendants. That should be clear. So this culture that has grown up in support of defendants' rights should not be an argument against the protection of victims' rights, which, after all, involve people whom society has failed to protect in the first instance. If there is anyone we want to help through the criminal justice process it is these people, these victims of violent crimes. 
   I think that is a shorthand summary of the arguments against some of the things that were said yesterday. I am very pleased, though, that Senator FEINSTEIN is here, as I said, to present information that specifically responds to an argument that was made yesterday with respect to the Oklahoma City bombing case. There is a great deal of misunderstanding about that. 
   If she is prepared at this time, I ask her now to supplement what I have said in the presentation of her remarks in that regard.

   At the conclusion of that, I am fully prepared to allow the Senator from Vermont and the Senator from West Virginia to proceed. I know they both have statements they want to make.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I know Senator LEAHY and Senator BYRD want to make a presentation. I would certainly be prepared to yield to them as soon as they are ready to make their remarks. In the meantime, I thought perhaps I could engage Senator FEINSTEIN in some conversation and maybe make a couple points myself. But as soon as Senator LEAHY or Senator BYRD arrive, I will be happy to relinquish the floor to them. 
   One of the arguments that has been raised by some opponents of the amendment, including a prominent columnist whom I respect greatly, George Will, derives from a superficial reading of our amendment. It is said that this kind of an amendment, which grants rights to victims of crime, would be discordant with the general purpose of the Constitution, which is not to grant entitlements to people that the Government would provide but, rather, protects people's natural rights, some of which are enumerated in the Bill of Rights, some of which are assumed to exist outside the Constitution and are more expressed in terms of prohibitions on bad government conduct. 
   I want to make clear--and seek Senator FEINSTEIN's view on this--that in both cases the Constitution has prevented deleterious Government action. In neither case does the Constitution grant rights. In our case, for example, the right to attend the trial that we talk about in the Oklahoma City bombing case is really not expressed as the right to attend the trial. There is no right to Government access to the trial. We express this as a prohibition on the Government denying access to the trial so if a victim or victim's family is able to get to the courtroom, nobody has to bring them there, but if they are able to get there and they want to attend the trial, the Government may not deny them that right. 
   In this regard, it is the same as the right to free speech. We all talk about the right to free speech. We really don't have an entitlement to free speech in the Constitution. We believe that is a natural right. As the Constitution says, the Government shall not abridge our right to free speech. It cannot constitutionally enact any laws that would inhibit the free exercise of speech. 
   I urge my colleagues and wise people, such as George Will, to read this carefully. It is just as the existing Constitution. We speak in common terms of protecting the right of free speech, the right to attend the trial about which Senator FEINSTEIN has been talking. But in reality, both constitutional provisions are prohibitions on the Government infringing upon this right. 
   Is that a distinction the Senator finds important in describing the Oklahoma City case?

   Mr. KYL. Yes. I thank Senator FEINSTEIN for that statement. It is a confirmation that scholars of law, not only 
   she and I, have reached this conclusion. 
   I was just reminded of another place in which this conclusion is found. The U.S. Department of Justice volume ``New Directions from the Field, Victims Rights and Services for the 21st Century.'' Among the statements in this report is the following:  
   Granting victims of crime the ability to participate in the justice system is exactly the type of participatory right the Constitution is designed to protect and has been amended to permanently ensure. Such rights include the right to vote on an equal basis and the right to be heard when the government deprives one of life, liberty or property.  
   What we have provided here is a set of rights, some expressed in terms of ``not to be excluded from,'' some expressed as a right such as a right to vote, as has been noted. In each case, the fundamental basis is that the Government cannot deprive one of their ability to participate in the criminal justice process to the extent we have defined it here. I think that is a very important distinction. As the Senator pointed out, without the standing to assert the right, it would be hollow. It would be merely an oratory statement. That is precisely why the people in the Oklahoma City bombing case couldn't vindicate their rights. The court said they didn't have any standing.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, before she arrived at noon, I had shared some specific comments that go directly to Senator SCHUMER's questions. I thought I would repeat what I said here in brief. 
   The first objection is that this is too wordy. It is not 15 pages. It is about 2 1/5 pages. But the total number of words that describe victims' rights is 179. The total number of words in the amendment, except for the technical provisions regarding the effective date, is 307. If you add them all up, it is 394 words. Again, 179 of those words describe the victims' rights. The defendants' rights consume 348 words in the U.S. Constitution. The Bill of Rights is 462 words. If you add it up word for word, we win, as I said this morning. But that, obviously, is hardly a way to evaluate.

   Mr. KYL. That is the second point. We are criticized on two accounts. We literally can't win. On one hand, the Senator from New York and others have said it is subject to interpretation. What does ``reasonable'' mean? On the other hand, we have written too much. We ought to just say ``reasonable rights'' and then flesh it out in statute. We can't win, if that is the argument. 
   What we have done, I submit, is the compromise that the Founding Fathers did. They expressed general terminology in order to keep it short and succinct, understanding that it would have to be fleshed out. But what we have done is to describe in enough additional detail to ensure that there could never be a contention that we are infringing on a defendant's rights and to be sure there would never be a criticism that we weren't specific enough about what these rights were. So we have 
   actually enumerated these eight specific rights. But I think we have struck the right compromise in that regard. 
   Two other quick points, if I may: The Senator correctly pointed out that it appears one of the reasons for the judge's decision in the Oklahoma City bombing case was that he just ignored it. I think it is hard to figure out exactly why he didn't apply it. He couldn't ignore a U.S. constitutional provision as he could ignore a Federal statute, which is precisely why we need a Federal constitutional amendment. It may also be that the Oklahoma City statute was not well enough drafted. I think that is exactly correct as well. It is no answer to say that a statute would be the way to go here, that it is better than a constitutional provision. 
   The bottom line is this: In words somewhat similar to those words that protect the rights of the accused, we have identified eight specific rights. I have yet to see anybody say those eight specific rights should not be guaranteed. Rather, the argument is that they should be put in statute. Senator SCHUMER has just pointed out why putting it in statute doesn't work.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I think the Senator from New York has made an excellent presentation. As a matter of fact, that is the presentation I made about 4 years ago when a very fine attorney in Arizona came to me and said these State constitution provisions in statute are not working, we need a Federal constitutional amendment. I made essentially the same argument, probably not as eloquently as the Senator from New York. 
   I share with the Senator both the concern for victims' rights and a concern for the U.S. Constitution not being unduly tampered with. We all acknowledge that it can and sometimes should be amended. However, it should be done only when necessary. In that we all agree. 
   He made the case to ask the question, Why not a statute? I respond to that in three quick ways. 
   First, let's get one thing out of the way. We do not want to amend the Constitution only when there has been a finding by the U.S. Supreme Court that some action we want to take is unconstitutional. Of course, there are not findings that State constitutional provisions or statutes are unconstitutional. There would be no reason for that. None of them conflicts with defendants' rights. That is the only basis on which I can think they would be declared unconstitutional. No one wants to conflict with or hurt defendants' rights.  
   There is no reason to expect any provision will be declared unconstitutional. There is a problem with respect to precedent, and that is, the Tenth Circuit has held there is no standing to enforce a Federal statute that the Senator from New York helped to draft. That is a problem. 
   Now I believe in seven different States victims do not have the standing to assert rights we provided in a Federal statute. 
    That is bad. That is a precedent we need to overturn and can overturn with a constitutional amendment. 
   The third point in this respect is that the problem is not that there has been or ever would be a finding of unconstitutionality with respect to these statutes or provisions. It is, rather, that they are just not enforced. As somebody said, they are enforced more in the breach than in the observance. That is the problem. Not that there is unconstitutionality. 
   Let me do the other two things I wanted to do. I see the Senator from Vermont is standing.

   Mr. KYL. As soon as I conclude these two points, again I am happy to allow the Senator from Vermont to speak. I was waiting for this last hour or so and thought we would take up the time, and Senator SCHUMER has provided a very important challenge. Why not a statute? I provided the first answer. 
   Second, let me provide the answer from a piece Paul Cassell wrote, offered earlier by Senator FEINSTEIN. He said:  
   In theory victims' rights could be safeguarded without a constitutional amendment. It would only be necessary for actors within the criminal justice system--judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys, and others--to suddenly begin respecting victims' interests. The real world question, however, is how to actually trigger such a shift in the Zeitgeist. For nearly two decades, victims have obtained a variety of measures to protect their rights. Yet, the prevailing view from those who work in the field [including the Justice Department in this fine volume, New Directions from the Field] is that these efforts ``have all too often been ineffective.'' Rules to assist victims ``frequently fail to provide meaningful protection whenever they come into conflict with bureaucratic habit, traditional indifference, or sheer inertia ......'' The view that state victims provisions have been and will continue to be disregarded is widely shared, as some of the strongest opponents of the Amendment seem to concede the point. For example, Ellen Greenlee, President of the National Legal Aid and Defender Association, bluntly and revealingly told Congress that the State victims' amendments ``so far have been treated as mere statements of principle that victims ought to be included and consulted more by prosecutors and courts. A state constitution is far ..... easier to ignore than the federal one.''  
   A fortiori, as we lawyers say, a statute is far easier to ignore than the Federal Constitution. 
   Just citing a couple of more points in Paul Cassell's piece, he quotes from the Department of Justice, the Attorney General herself. The Department finding that these various efforts--the State and Federal and statutory and constitutional provisions:  
   ..... have failed to fully safeguard victims' rights. These significant state efforts simply are not sufficiently consistent, comprehensive, or authoritative to safeguard victims' rights. 
   I would intersperse that a Federal statute, of course, is in the same category. In fact, it is of a slightly lower category than a State constitutional amendment in the State courts. In any event, with respect to the number of crimes of violence in the Federal system, you are only talking about approximately 1 percent of the crimes. So clearly a Federal statute does not give you anything that these State statutes do not. 
   But here is the point, and I continue to quote here:  
   Hard statistical evidence on non-compliance with victims' rights confirms these general conclusions about inadequate protection.  
   In other words, now let's go to the tape. Let's look at the numbers, not just the conclusions reached by scholars.  
   ..... the National Institute of Justice found that many crime victims are denied their rights and concluded that ``enactment of State laws and State constitutional amendments alone appears to be insufficient to guarantee the full provision of victims' rights in practice.''  
   Here are the statistics. For example:  
   ..... even in several States identified as giving ``strong protection'' to victim's rights [like my State of Arizona and Senator FEINSTEIN's State of California] fewer than 60 percent of the victims were notified of the sentencing hearing and fewer than 40 percent were notified of the pretrial release of the defendant.  
   Fewer than 40 percent. Would we consider that a good enough job in notifying defendants of their right to counsel? Would we consider, if the police in 40 percent of the cases remembered to give the Miranda warnings, that that would be OK? Absolutely not. That is the fundamental difference between a constitutional right and a statute, or a State constitutional provision. They just are not enforced with the same degree of vigor and consistency and care as the U.S. Constitution must be and is. So we find that 40 percent of the people who ought to be notified that their assailant is about to be released from prison never get the notice. That is in the good States. That is not good enough. After 18 years of experience with this, we ought to appreciate that statutes and State constitutional provisions just have not done the job. 
   That is the second reason. I will get to the third one. But that is the second key reason why the Senator's question, Why not a State statute or State constitutional amendment or Federal statute? just has not worked. I will be happy to yield to the Senator from New York.

   Mr. KYL. First of all, the Federal statute applies to Federal crimes which constitute about 1 percent of what we are talking about. Even if you could put good teeth in the Federal statute, you would be dealing with 1 percent of the cases. That leaves, what, 59 percent to go, by my calculation. 
   Second, these State constitutional provisions are very well written. The one that we have in Arizona was adopted with between 70 and 80 percent of the vote, the one that has been adopted in California and these other States--they are very good. It is not that they are not well written. The question is, Why should you have to have a penalty for somebody, for a judge who fails to provide the notice, for example? Why should we deny Federal law enforcement support when everybody knows that is really needed? It is not a good enforcement mechanism. The best enforcement mechanism, of that which we consider to be fundamental rights, is the recognition that they are embodied in the U.S. Constitution and nobody wants to deny those. If 40 percent of the people who should get notice under State constitutional provisions get notice, something is drastically wrong. Until you put that in the U.S. Constitution, it is not going to change.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, this is a historic time because we are about to commence a debate on an amendment that has passed through the Senate Judiciary Committee but has not yet come to the floor of the Senate; that is, an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to protect the rights of victims of violent crime. 
   I am very pleased this morning, along with Senator DIANNE FEINSTEIN of California, to be making the primary case in support of this amendment. 
   I would like to make some opening remarks and then turn our opening time over to Senator FEINSTEIN for a discussion of the history of this amendment and much of the articulation of the need for it. But let me make a few preliminary comments. 
   First of all, we have heard a little bit about passion on a related matter. I can tell you there is nothing about which I am more passionate these days than supporting the rights of victims of violent crime. 
   According to the Department of Justice, there are over 8 million victims of violent crime in our society every year. Not enough is being done to protect the rights of these victims. They have no constitutional rights, unlike the defendants. Those accused of crime have more than a dozen rights which have been largely secured by amendments to the U.S. Constitution. 
   They, of course, trump any rights that States, either by statute or State constitutional provision, grant to the victims of crime. 
   It is time to level the playing field, to balance the scales of justice, and provide some rights for victims of crime. These are very basic and simple rights, as Senator FEINSTEIN will articulate in just a moment. 
   To secure basic rights to be informed and to be present and to be heard at critical stages throughout the judicial process is the least that our society owes people it has failed to protect. 
   Thirty-two State constitutional amendments have been passed by an average popular vote of nearly 80 percent. Clearly, the American people have developed a consensus that the rights of crime victims deserve protection. 
   Unfortunately, these State provisions have not been applied with sufficient seriousness to ensure the protection of these victims of crime. 
   Let me note some quotations, first from the Attorney General of the United States, and then from attorneys general--these are the law enforcement officials of our country--and the Governors, who, of course, are the chief executives of the various States. 
   Attorney General Reno explained, in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee:  
   Efforts to secure victims' rights through means other than a constitutional amendment have proved less than fully adequate. Victims' rights advocates have sought reforms at the State level for the past 20 years. However, these efforts have failed to fully safeguard victims' rights. These significant State efforts simply are not sufficiently consistent, comprehensive, or authoritative to safeguard victims' rights.  
   Legal commentators have reached the same conclusion. 
   For example, Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe has explained that the existing statutes and State amendments ``are likely, as experience to date sadly shows, to provide too little real protection whenever they come into conflict with bureaucratic habit, traditional indifference, sheer inertia, or any mention of an accused's rights regardless of whether those rights are genuinely threatened.''  
   According to a December 1998 report from the National Institute of Justice, the victims are denied their rights. The report concluded that:  
   Enactment of state laws and state constitutional amendments alone appear to be insufficient to guarantee the full provision of victims' rights in practice.  
   The report went on to note numerous examples of how victims were not given rights they were already supposed to be given under State provisions. 
   For example, even in several States identified as giving strong protection to victims' rights, fewer than 60 percent of the victims were notified of the sentencing hearing, and fewer than 40 percent were notified of the pretrial release of the defendant. That can be a serious matter to a victim of crime. A followup analysis of the same data found that racial minorities are less likely to be afforded their rights under the patchwork of existing statutes. 
   According to a letter, dated April 21 of this year, signed by 39 of the State attorneys general:  
   We are convinced that statutory protections are not enough; only a federal constitutional amendment will be sufficient to change the culture of our legal system.  
   A 400-page report by the Department of Justice on victims' rights and services concluded that:  
   [t]he U.S. Constitution should be amended to guarantee fundamental rights for victims of crime.  
   The report continued:  
   A victims' rights constitutional amendment is the only legal measure strong enough to rectify the current inconsistencies in victims' rights laws that vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction on the state and federal levels.  
   For those who are concerned that somehow a Federal constitutional amendment would impinge upon States rights other than noticing, of course, that 75 percent of the States would have to approve such a constitutional amendment for it to go into effect, let me refer to a resolution of the National Governors' Association, which passed by a vote of 49-1, strongly supporting a constitutional amendment. 
   It stated:  
   Despite ..... widespread state initiatives, the rights of victims do not receive the same consideration or protection as the rights of the accused. These rights exist on different judicial levels. Victims are relegated to a position of secondary importance in the judicial process.  
   The resolution also stated:  
   The rights of victims have always received secondary consideration within the U.S. Judicial process, even though states and the American people by a wide plurality consider victims' rights to be fundamental. Protection of these basic rights is essential and can only come from a fundamental change in our basic law: the U.S. Constitution.  
   That is it. Despite the well-meaning intention of judges, prosecutors, and others who fundamentally agree that victims need these rights of basic fairness in our criminal justice system, as the evidence has overwhelmingly demonstrated, they are just not getting that kind of fair treatment, despite the best efforts of all these people. That is why, after 18 years, the conclusion has been reached by so many that the only way to guarantee these rights is by placing them in the U.S. Constitution where defendants' rights have also been amended into existence. 
   We all know it shouldn't be easy to amend the Constitution, but we have been very careful to communicate with prosecutors and others who are familiar with the issues. After 63 drafts, we think we have it right. We think we have a very tightly drawn amendment, which Senator FEINSTEIN will explain in just a moment, that protects these rights without denigrating whatsoever the rights of the defendants or those accused of crime. 
   Our amendment has 42 cosponsors in this body, a bipartisan group of Democrats and Republicans. We have 39 State attorneys general who have signed a strong letter in support. Our Presidential candidates, both current and past, have strongly supported a crime victims' rights amendment, as have groups such as Parents of Murdered Children, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, the National Organization for Victim Assistance, and others. 
   I thought it would be appropriate to recognize the President of the United States, who said in a very strong statement before a number of crime victims' rights groups:  
   I strongly believe that victims should be central participants in the criminal justice system, and that it will take a constitutional amendment to give the rights of victims the same status as the rights of the accused.  
   He also said the following, which I think represents the views of all of us in this body:  
   I do not support amending the Constitution lightly; it is sacred. It should be changed only with great caution and after much consideration. But I reject the idea that it should never be changed. Change it lightly and you risk its distinction. But never change it and you risk its vitality. 
   But this is different. This is not an attempt to put legislative responsibilities in the Constitution or to guarantee a right that is already guaranteed. Amending the Constitution here is simply the only way to guarantee the victims' rights are weighed equally with defendants' rights in every courtroom in America.  
   Mr. President, that is all we ask. 
   I ask unanimous consent to print in the RECORD three pages of groups that strongly support our amendment.

   Mr. KYL. In terms of specific letters of support and so on, we will hear about that at a later time. 
   I conclude my statement by saying it has been a great pleasure for me to work on a bipartisan basis with Senator DIANNE FEINSTEIN who, as have I, has spent the better part of 4 years honing and crafting this amendment, working with victims' rights groups, visiting with fellow Senators, Members of the House of Representatives, representatives of the White House, the Department of Justice, and many others in an effort to ensure that the amendment we present to the Senate today is the very best possible product we could present. 
   We are always open to more suggestions. We have never closed the door to additional suggestions by people who in good faith wish to make sure this amendment will do what we want it to do, without, of course, taking away the rights of defendants. We remain committed to that proposition. 
   Over the next several days, obviously, we will hear from opponents. We are delighted to hear their comments and to visit with them about suggestions they may have. At the end of the day, as all of the statements I have read suggest, there is no alternative. There is only one way to protect the victims of violent crime; that is, through adoption of a Federal constitutional amendment.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me take a few minutes to respond to the distinguished ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, Senator LEAHY. 
   He is absolutely correct that constitutional amendments should not be rushed. We have taken a long time to get to this point--4 years. As a matter of fact, in the Judiciary Committee alone we have heard from 34 witnesses and have had 802 pages of testimony and submissions. In the House, there have been hearings. They have had 32 witnesses and about 575 pages of testimony and submissions. In other words, there have been about 66 witnesses and nearly 1,400 pages of testimony. 
   I commend the report of the Judiciary Committee to anyone who would like a really good read on this entire subject and the reasons why we need a Federal constitutional amendment. 
   The bill passed out of the Judiciary Committee 12-5. We took our time getting it to the Senate floor to make sure everybody had their say. The distinguished ranking minority member needed additional time to file his comments to the report. That was granted. He did so. 
   We agree there should be adequate time for the debate of this constitutional amendment, but we disagree that there should be a filibuster to use unnecessary time of the Senate. 
   Senator LEAHY talked about a lot of things. He talked about abortion, gun control, a balanced budget amendment and Ronald Reagan, the juvenile crime bill, nursing home fraud, and term limits. I would suggest that we ought to stick to the subject. 
   We all know one good way to defeat a good idea is to talk it to death and threaten to delay other business of the Senate. 
   I would suggest we stick to the exact question before us, and that is whether there should be a constitutional amendment protecting victims of crime. 
   Senator FEINSTEIN and I have laid out the case for this. 
   As I heard Senator LEAHY, there was only one fleeting reference to an argument in opposition. That was that the Senate had acted with alacrity in dealing with the problems that the victims of the Oklahoma City bombing case were suffering because the judge there did not permit the victims to attend the trial. Basically, he gave them a choice, over a lunch hour one day, saying: You can either attend the trial or be present at the time of sentencing and speak to that issue, but you cannot do both. Take your pick. What a Hobson's choice. The prosecutor really could not help advise the victims.  Some of them chose not to attend the trial. Others chose to attend. 
   Senator LEAHY is correct about one thing. The Congress did act quickly to pass a law basically telling the Federal judge that they did have a right to attend the trial and the right to attend the sentencing and to speak at that time and that he should not deny them that right. 
   We passed that. The day after the Senate passed it, the President signed it into law. We were so concerned that these victims of that horrible tragedy have their rights protected that we passed a Federal statute--exactly what Senator LEAHY is suggesting as an alternative to the Federal constitutional amendment that Senator FEINSTEIN and I have presented. 
   What has happened? What has happened is that we are worse off than we were before we passed the statute. The judge did not apply the statute to protect the victims of crime. In effect, what happened was that the defendant's right to exclude them, based in the U.S. Constitution, trumped the Federal statute which, of course, is subservient to the Federal Constitution. If that was the basis on which the court ruled, it would have been a correct basis. If he really felt the defendant's rights required that the victims not be present in the courtroom, and that those rights are in the U.S. Constitution, then he would be correct that that would trump a Federal statute--the one that the Congress passed. 
   Clearly, the Oklahoma City bombing litigation leaves no doubt about the difficulties that victims face with mere statutory protection of their rights. 
   For a number of the victims, the rights afforded in the act Congress passed in 1997 and the earlier victims' rights bill were not protected. They did not observe the trial of the defendant in that case, Timothy McVeigh, because of lingering doubts about the constitutional status of the statutes. 
   The interesting thing is that because that case was later taken up on appeal, the case of these victims, and the Tenth Circuit ruled in that case denying the victims the rights notwithstanding the Federal statute, you literally have a situation in which it would have been better if Congress had not acted by statute because there is now a precedent on the books. This was the first time victims sought Federal appellate review of their rights since the Victims Bill of Rights was passed in 1990, the underlying statute on which the 1997 statute was based. 
   Quoting now from Professor Paul Cassell:  
   The undeniable, and unfortunate, result of that litigation has been to establish--as the only reported federal appellate ruling--a precedent that will make effective enforcement of the federal victims rights statutes quite difficult. It is now the law of the 10th circuit that victims lack ``standing'' to be heard on issues surrounding the Victims' Bill of Rights and, for good measure, that the Department of Justice may not take an appeal for the victims under either of those statutes. For all practical purposes, the treatment of crime victims' rights in federal court in Utah, Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Wyoming have been remitted to the unreviewable discretion of individual federal district court judges.  
   Professor Paul Cassell of the University of Utah Law School concludes:  
   The fate of the Oklahoma City victims does not inspire confidence that all victims rights will be fully enforced in the future. 
   ......the Oklahoma City case provides a compelling illustration of why a constitutional amendment is necessary to fully protect victims' rights in this country.  
   The sad truth is that Congress's efforts to protect the rights in a very specific case by Federal statute not only didn't protect their rights but made matters worse. The statutory alternative Senators KENNEDY and LEAHY have proposed is not the answer. There has been no refutation of the point I tried to make in my original 10-minute statement that authority after authority after authority--the Attorney General, the Governors, the attorneys general--have all said that despite their best efforts, the statutory and State constitutional remedies simply have not worked to provide protections to victims of violent crime. After 18 years of experimenting, of trying, of doing their best, it is obviously now necessary to move forward with the next step, which is to elevate these rights to the same Constitution that protects the rights of the defendants. Nothing less is going to work. 
   I submit the arguments that Senator FEINSTEIN and I made have not been refuted. If the only response is that we are going to have to take a long time talking about extraneous matters, then my suggestion is that there is no real argument by those who oppose this amendment. There is no real substance to the notion that we shouldn't move forward. 
   I reiterate, I am pleased that Senator LEAHY will encourage all of his colleagues, as I certainly will encourage mine, on both sides of the aisle to support the motion to proceed. We do need to proceed. When we proceed, we can have that debate. Senator FEINSTEIN and I will renew our offer to continue to meet with the Department of Justice to get more suggestions from them. We have, in fact, incorporated many of their suggestions into the current text of the amendment. But it is time to move on. We can't keep putting it off. That is why we filed the cloture motion. That is why we want to proceed. 
   I appreciate what Senator LEAHY said, but I suggest that we need to move on with the debate on this amendment. Senator FEINSTEIN and I are prepared to do so.

   Mr. KYL. I thank the Senator. I am pleased to do so. 
   I think she makes three very important points. One very important point she made is that if you have a Federal statute, you are only dealing with 1 to 2 percent of the victims of violent crime--those 8 million victims each year. Of course, that is the number of Federal crimes. There aren't very many serious Federal crimes that would carry the penalties necessary to invoke this constitutional provision. A Federal statute would be very small and of no comfort to the millions of victims of crime involved in State court proceedings. 
   Secondly, there are occasions when, as in the Oklahoma City bombing case, a defendant's rights are asserted based on an amendment to the Constitution. Sometimes, for example, the judge will say: Well, I am going to exclude witnesses. I will exclude victims from the courtroom because the defendant thinks it will create undue emotion, that it will jeopardize his right to a fair trial if the jury sees the victim or the family of the victim. That was the case in the Oklahoma City bombing case and in scores of others Senator FEINSTEIN has brought to the attention of the Senate. 
   Of course, the defendant and his family are permitted to sit there all dressed up and supportive of the defendant at the time of sentencing and to stand up and say what a fine fellow he is. The judge takes that into consideration. We are simply saying the victims ought to be able to stand before the judge and recount the horror, the tragedy, the weakness, the loss they have suffered for the judge to take into account as well at the time of sentencing. If the defendant's constitutional rights are deemed always to be superior because they are embodied in the U.S. Constitution and the victim's rights are always secondary, then the victim's rights will be honored in the breach rather than the observance, to quote one of the people I quoted earlier. 
   That is why the third point is so important. Even when there isn't a direct conflict--and there will rarely be a direct conflict--the primary situation will be presence in the courtroom at  the time of trial. But in most situations there won't be the direct conflict between the defendant's right and the victim's right. It simply is a matter of inertia. 
   Perhaps Senator FEINSTEIN can find the quotation she read before. I think it was Professor Tribe whom the Senator quoted, who talked about judicial indifference, inertia. Well-meaning judges and prosecutors don't mean to deny victims the notice of the proceedings and the right to be present, but it becomes a secondary matter. We give the Miranda warning to the defendant. We make sure the defendant has legal counsel that people hire on his behalf, and we make absolutely certain that none of the defendant's rights are intruded upon, 
   because if they are, the case will be overturned on appeal. And that is as it should be. But because of that attention to the constitutional rights of the defendant, we forget the victim. It is in that sense that the victims' rights are simply not being honored, why 60 percent--even in the States with good provisions--of the victims do not even get notice. That is a horrible statistic. What if we said 60 percent of the defendants didn't get their court-appointed lawyer, that it was too inconvenient or too costly? Sixty percent is a pretty good percentage. Clearly, we would find that inadequate. Fundamental rights are fundamental rights and they need to be protected. 
   So I think the Senator from California is correct that even though we don't mean to deny these rights, either because of the attention paid to the defendants or simply because of the fact there are other things more important to do than make sure victims have notice of these proceedings, they are denied their rights and the ability to participate. 
   A final point. There has been the contention that somehow it is going to become very expensive if--as we do with defendants--society has to pay for their rights. We do that for defendants; we pay for their attorneys, for their transcripts, and everything they need for their appeals. What we did here was not guarantee that victims have the right to attend the trial. For example, as are most of the provisions of the Constitution, we have said that the Government may not deny them the right to participate. They have to get there. They have to get there on their own. It is just that the Government can't deny them the right to sit on the bench in the courtroom if they show up.

   Mr. KYL. I thank the Senator for that question because people not familiar with the process inside a courtroom may wonder if this amendment would permit a victim to cause a big scene in court, thus disrupting the trial and working to the disadvantage of the defendant. Of course, as the Senator knows, a judge has total control of the courtroom and has the ability to set whatever rules are necessary to maintain decorum and dignity within the courtroom and certainly to ensure the protection of the fair trial rights of the defendant. That is why a judge can always say--and we have seen it on TV hundreds of times--``order in the court,'' in effect saying, if you can't sit there quietly and unemotionally watching what is occurring, then you have to leave. Because in the court we cannot have undue displays of emotion. So the judge has within his total authority the ability to control either the defendant from his or her outbursts or any emotional outbursts of anybody else in the courtroom, including victims.

   Mr. KYL. I agree it is perplexing how one could conclude a defendant's rights would be trampled on in any way by our proposal. It does not do that. 
   The article in the Los Angeles Times, quoting Professors Tribe and Cassell, makes the point that ``a victims' rights amendment must, of course, be drafted so the rights of victims will not furnish excuses for roughshod treatment of the accused. The Senate Resolution is such a carefully crafted measure, adding victims' rights that can exist side by side with defendants'.'' 
   Precisely the point. There is only one conceivable circumstance I know of in which there could actually be an assertion of two constitutional rights, one by the defendant and one by the victim, which could theoretically come in conflict, and that is the right to be present at the trial. Courts deal with that today. They would balance the interests tomorrow. We have the same thing existing with respect to the press. We have the right of free press. Say victims want to attend the trial. Sometimes, as we know, judges don't permit that, but it is in the Constitution. That is right. But the defendant has a right to a fair trial as well. 
   The courts will balance those two interests and generally come to an accommodation that enforces both rights.

   Mr. KYL. I think the two distinguished law professors make a very important point. They point out the example of paralleling a defendant's constitutionally protected right to a speedy trial. Our amendment confers on victims the right to consideration of their interest in a trial, free from unreasonable delay. 
   By definition, the professors note, these rights could not collide since they are both designed to bring matters to a close within a reasonable time. If any conflict were to emerge, courts retain ultimate responsibility for harmonizing the rights at stake. 
   We have also gone one other step. That is, whereas the defendant had an absolute right to a speedy trial--and frequently, also, courts determine he has a right to delay things--we have provided for victims merely that the judge must ``consider'' their desire to bring the trial to a speedy conclusion. 
   In this case, we have created a right of victims which, indeed, is subservient to the right of the defendants. Theirs is absolute. The victims have a right to have their views considered. We have been very careful to ensure we don't trample on defendants' rights. 
   I make one more point because the Senator reminded me of something that is very important. In the statement by Professor Mosteller, he makes a relative point that relates to this. ``In theory, victims' rights could be safeguarded without a constitutional amendment. It would only be necessary for actors within the criminal justice system--judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys, and others--to suddenly begin fully respecting victims' rights. The real world question, however, is how to actually trigger such a shift in the Zeitgeist. For nearly two decades, victims have obtained a variety of measures to protect their rights. Yet, the prevailing view from those 
   who work in the field is that these efforts have `all too often been ineffective.' Rules to assist victims `frequently fail to provide meaningful protection whenever they come into conflict with'''--and here I break the quotation--not the defendant's rights. They are not conflicting with defendant's rights. That is not why they are denied, but rather ``whenever they come into conflict with bureaucratic habit, traditional indifference, or sheer inertia.'' 
   That is what is preventing these rights from being fully affected--not that they conflict with the defendant's rights. 
   Here is the conclusion: The view that State victims provisions have been and will continue to often be disregarded is widely shared, as some of the strongest opponents of the amendment seem to concede the point. For example, Ellen Greenlee, president of the National Legal Aid and Defenders Association, bluntly and revealingly told Congress that the State victims amendments, ``so far have been treated as mere statements of principle that victims ought to be included and consulted more by prosecutors and courts. A State constitution is far ..... easier to ignore than the Federal one.'' 
   That is the bottom line point. 
   State constitutions, even Federal statutes, as we found in the Oklahoma City bombing case, are far easier to ignore than the U.S. Constitution. That is something no judge and no prosecutor can ignore. That is why we want to elevate these rights--not because they conflict with the defendant's rights, not because they take anything away from any accused in the courtroom, but rather because these elemental rights of fairness are not currently being enforced by the judges and prosecutors because they just don't have the stature of the U.S. Constitution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KYL. If I could put an exclamation point on that. 
   The point Senator FEINSTEIN makes is this: During the pendency of the proceedings, the victim has the right to assert these rights. For example, if you have a week-long trial and the victim finds out about the trial after the second day, the victim can't go back and say you have to start the trial all over again. All the victim can do is say, hey, I have a right to be there for the rest of the trial. 
   That is unlike the defendant's rights. Here is the exact language we included: ``Nothing in this article shall provide grounds to stay or continue any trial, reopen any proceeding, or invalidate any ruling''--and there are only two exceptions--``except with respect to conditional release or restitution or to provide rights guaranteed by this article in future proceedings without staying or continuing a trial. Nothing in this article shall give rise to or authorize the creation of a claim for damages .....'' 
   There are only two exceptions. One is prospective, so long as it does not continue or delay the proceedings. In other words, you have the right to say: Judge, this trial is starting, and I have a right to be there. And the other one is with respect to a conditional release. 
   I close with this point: You need the right to enforce it with respect to a conditional release.  
   Here is a true story. Here is how it would work. Patricia Pollard of Flagstaff, AZ, was picked up one night by a man and his wife, ironically, and the man brutally raped her, sliced her up with an open beer can, and left her to die. She lived. He was eventually prosecuted. After the Arizona legislature passed the provision which enabled victims to be notified, the parole board held a hearing on his conditional release. 
   They decided to conditionally release her assailant from the Arizona State Penitentiary, but they did not give her notice. 
   The Governor's office found out about this, located Patricia Pollard in California, brought her back, and arranged for another meeting of the parole board after they had already made their decision. They agreed to hear her. She spoke about what he had done to her and what she feared he would do to others. The parole board reversed its decision. 
   I asked Patricia Pollard whether she did that because she feared for her life, that he would come after her again. She said: Well, he might have tried to track me down. But in truth, his crime against me was a random kind of crime. I was available for him to victimize. I simply could not have lived with myself if I had not gone there and told these people what he could do to someone else because I know that had he gotten out, he would have done it to somebody else. 
   That is why we provide this limited exception, the only situation, really, where something can be done retroactively--where a person was not given notice to attend the parole or conditional release proceedings and the individual has not yet been released, you can go back in and tell your story and just maybe it will make a difference. That is what this amendment is all about, protecting the rights not only of the victims of crime but of the rest of society as well.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the proponents of the crime victims' constitutional rights amendment, as I understand it, have about 6 minutes remaining. Senator FEINSTEIN has asked that I conclude our portion of this opening debate. 
   People who are viewing this might wonder what the last 35, 40 minutes have been about. This wasn't supposed to be about abortion. How did that get involved in the crime victims' rights amendment? Perhaps Senator LEAHY began this trend when he first spoke this morning about the possibility of gun control, abortion, and the balanced budget amendment. 
   I think the point is that people who are not motivated to adopt a constitutional set of rights for crime victims are willing to try to use our hard work, our efforts, and our energy to bring this proposed constitutional amendment to the Senate--which is very difficult to do--as a means of trying to tack on their favorite proposal, or to delay the Senate action on the crime victims' rights amendment to the point that we will have to move on to other pressing business. Either of those possibilities, I think, would be very sad. 
   Let me recount what has happened here. For almost 4 years, Senator FEINSTEIN and I have worked very patiently to bring forward a crime victims' constitutional rights amendment. It is very difficult to get a constitutional amendment to the floor of the Senate. We have had 66 witnesses appear at hearings, with I think something like 15 pages of testimony transcript. We have had hearing after hearing. We have gone through 63 different drafts to make this as perfect as we could. We have gotten it out of the Judiciary Committee on a strong, bipartisan vote. Then we got the majority leader to give us some floor time, which is very precious. 
   In other words, we put a lot of work into this in support of victims of violent crime in our society. Throughout this building, and in others, there are scores of victims and victims' rights organizations around television sets watching these proceedings, having finally gotten what they hope to be their ``day in court''--an argument about the crime victims' rights amendment and a vote on that. 
   What is beginning to emerge is a very disturbing tactic by those who oppose us, and that is either to try to delay this to the point that the majority leader will have to move on to something else, by offering all kinds of extraneous amendments, or by seeking to achieve what they have never been able to achieve through the normal legislative process, by using our proposal as a vehicle to attach their idea onto--in this case, perhaps, abortion. What better way to kill ours while getting some time to discuss their proposal. 
   Some of these same proponents are those who argue most vigorously against so-called riders to appropriations bills. They say, well, you should not have an extraneous amendment on an appropriation bill. If you are going to bring something to the floor, you should not debate something else. You should not amend it with something extraneous. We are willing to allow germane amendments to victims' rights in an effort to resolve how to best protect victims' rights. But what I fear I have seen here is a tactic either to defeat what we are trying to do or to use what we are trying to do to advance an entirely different agenda. That would be wrong. 
   The people watching this debate must be saying: There they 
   go again. What are these Senators doing? They had a proposal to bring forth a crime victims' rights amendment to the floor, and, by procedural legerdemain, is that going to be prevented, overcome by an abortion amendment or something of that sort? We hope not. The bottom line is that there is a reason all of the people who support this amendment have said it is now time for a Federal constitutional rights amendment. 
   As we have seen this morning, States have been unable to protect the rights of crime victims with State statutes and their own State constitutional amendments. Attorneys general and prosecutors support this. Law enforcement supports it. The Attorney General of Wisconsin, Jim Doyle--a very respected Democratic attorney general--said this before the Judiciary Committee:  
   I believe that most prosecutors strongly support victims' rights.  
   He notes some of the concerns of prosecutors. He said:  
   I believe these concerns are more than adequately addressed in S.J. Res. 3.  
   The bottom line is that we have support from victims' rights groups, prosecutors, attorneys general, and Governors, and it is time now to decide whether we want to protect crime victims or not. We have an opportunity by bringing this matter to the floor. At 2:15, we will have a vote on what is called a cloture motion on a motion to proceed. If 60 colleagues agree, we will be able to go forward and debate the motion to proceed, which I assume will be adopted later today. Then we can proceed with debate on the constitutional amendment itself. We look forward to that. If people want to bring forward relevant amendments to that, so be it. That is what the process is about. But I fear what will happen if, instead, we get a series of nongermane amendments or attempts to delay this, to the point that we run out of time and, in effect, a filibuster has killed any hope these crime victims have of protecting their rights in our courts. 
   We have waited too long. Eighteen years ago President Reagan's Commission on Crime Victims recommended the constitutional amendment to address these rights. Eighteen years is long enough to wait. I hope when we finally have an opportunity on the Senate floor, that opportunity is not snatched away by people who want to pursue other agendas.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of S. 2285, the Federal Fuels Tax Holiday Act of 2000. Our country is in dire need of a comprehensive energy policy, including a strategy to reduce fuel prices. Immediately suspending the 4.3 cent per gallon Clinton/Gore gas tax is one thing we can do in the short-term to provide some relief from the high fuel prices we have been experiencing.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I appreciate the members of the minority allowing me to speak for a moment on this important piece of legislation. It is legislation I cosponsored when Congress convened earlier last year. It was KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON's bill to repeal the marriage tax penalty. Since that time, the legislation has been adopted to provide for an essential repeal for most Americans. That is the pending business before us. I have supported similar measures ever since I came to the Senate in 1995, and I am very pleased the majority leader has attempted to schedule a vote on this prior to tax day. 
   As we have just seen, it may not be possible for the Senate to actually vote on repealing the marriage tax penalty prior to tax day, but it would certainly be our hope that that could be accomplished immediately thereafter, if not before. 
   This will be the third time in 5 years we have acted to mitigate the marriage tax penalty. In 1995, Congress passed legislation that would have provided a tax credit to married couples to partially offset this penalty. President Clinton vetoed that bill. In 1999, Congress again approved a measure to provide married couples with some relief.  Last year's bill would have set the standard deduction for couples at twice the deduction allowed for singles. It also would have set the lowest income tax bracket for married couples at twice that allowed for single taxpayers. Again, President Clinton vetoed that last September. 
   According to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, the total tax burden borne by American taxpayers dipped slightly in 1998. That is the good news. The bad news is Americans still spent more on Federal taxes than on any of the other major items in their household budget. For the median-income two-earner family, for example, Federal taxes still amounted to 39 percent of the family budget, more than what they spent on food, housing, and medical care combined. One of the reasons why they paid so much is the continuation of the marriage tax penalty that exists in the Nation's Tax Code. 
   According to the Congressional Budget Office, nearly half of all married taxpayers--about 21 million couples--filing a joint return paid a higher tax than they would have if each spouse had been allowed to file as a single taxpayer. 
   The marriage tax penalty hits the working poor particularly hard. Two-earner families making less than $20,000 often must devote a full 8 percent of their income to pay the marriage tax penalty. Eight percent is an extraordinary amount for couples who count on every dollar to make ends meet. 
   I will give an example of the marriage tax penalty at work. In this example, the penalty comes about because workers filing as single taxpayers get a higher standard deduction and because income tax bracket thresholds for married couples are lower than the thresholds for singles. Consider a married couple with each spouse earning about $30,000 a year. They would have paid $7,655 in Federal income taxes last year. By comparison, two individuals earning the same amount but filing a joint return would have paid $6,892 between the two of them. That is a marriage tax penalty of $763, about a 10-percent penalty simply for being married. 
   The average penalty paid by couples is even higher than that--about $1,400 a year, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Think what families could do with an extra $1,400. They could pay for 3 or 4 months of day care if they chose to send a child outside the home, or make it easier for one parent to stay at home and take care of the children if that is what they decide is best for them. They could make four or five payments on a car or minivan. They could pay their utility bill for 9 months. 
   The bill reported by the Finance Committee is the most comprehensive effort yet to eliminate the marriage penalty. It will increase the standard for couples filing jointly to twice the deduction allowed for single taxpayers. It will widen the 15-percent and 28-percent tax brackets. It will allow more low-income married couples to qualify for the earned-income credit and preserve the family tax credits that are currently phased out by the alternative minimum tax. 
   Unlike President Clinton's so-called relief bill, the plan Chairman ROTH brings to us today does not neglect married 
   couples who choose to have one parent stay at home to raise their children. It gives them relief and, in so doing, it let's them know we value the choice they have made to stay home and raise a family. 
   Unlike the Clinton plan, which would preserve the penalty for many couples, our plan would eliminate the marriage tax penalty in its entirety. Sure, that means revenue loss associated with this legislation is greater than the President proposed, but the smaller cost of providing relief under the Clinton plan is also indicative of just how little it would do to solve the problem. We should not be stingy when attempting to ensure fairness in the Tax Code. 
   Passage of this legislation will continue the good progress we have made this year in making the Tax Code fairer. First, we passed the measure to repeal the Social Security earnings limitation, a tax that has unfairly penalized seniors for more than 60 years simply because they wanted to earn extra income to supplement their monthly retirement checks. The measure is now law. 
   Hopefully, the marriage tax penalty repeal bill will pass with a strong bipartisan majority, and President Clinton will rethink his opposition and sign it when it reaches his desk. 
   Another thing we can do to make the Tax Code fairer is eliminate the death tax. Although most Americans will probably never pay the death tax, overwhelming majorities still sense there is something terribly wrong with a system that allows Washington to seize more than half of whatever is left after someone dies--a system that prevents hard-working Americans from passing the bulk of their nest eggs to their children or grandchildren. 
   We can debate the merits of any number of changes in the Tax Code--whether a flat tax is preferable to a sales tax; whether tax rates should be reduced across the board; or whether we should make the Tax Code more conducive to savings and investment. There are legitimate points to be made on all sides. But when it comes to fairness, we need to do what is right. The marriage tax penalty, as the earnings limit and the death tax, is wrong; it is unfair; and it is time to put it to rest. 
   I thank Senator KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON from Texas for her hard work. I thank Chairman ROTH for bringing it forward. I appreciate the work of the majority leader in getting this matter before the Senate for a vote so we can finally end the marriage tax penalty. 
   I again thank Senator HUTCHISON for deferring to me for my remarks.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will comment briefly on the budget resolution generally, but I also recognize Senator HUTCHISON, primarily, and many others who have been working a long time for the repeal of the marriage penalty which this budget accommodates. 
   We will have a historic vote in the Senate tomorrow morning. I think our leadership--the Senator in the Chair, the Senator from Texas, and many others--deserves a lot of credit for bringing to fruition our efforts to eliminate this marriage tax penalty. I think tomorrow, as a result, will be a historic day. 
   The budget resolution that we began considering will result in a balanced Federal budget now for the third year in a row. As in the budgets of the past 2 years, it will also balance the budget without relying on one dime of the Social Security surplus. The last time Congress balanced the budget 3 years in a row without raiding the Social Security trust fund was in the period of 1947 to 1949. Again, I think this will be a historic year. 
   It is worth recalling where we were only 5 short years ago, to put this in perspective. At that time, President Clinton, after shepherding through the largest tax increase in the history of our country, sent Congress a budget in 1995 that would have spent every penny of the Social Security surplus and still left annual deficits stuck at about $200 billion for the foreseeable future. That includes this year. In other words, the Clinton tax increase of 1993 only paid for new spending. According to the President's own budget in 1995, it did not bring and never would bring the budget even close to balance. 
   The Clinton budget of five years ago projected a deficit that would have amounted to roughly $289 billion this year alone. not counting Social Security. I recall that the Senate unanimously rejected this proposal on May 19, 1995. Congress then went on to chart a different course, and, as a result, we managed to balance the budget, protect the Social Security surplus, begin paying down the public debt, provide modest tax relief, and free up additional resources to devote to other national priorities, like health care, education, and defense. Balance was even achieved four years earlier than initially anticipated under the alternative budget we adopted in 1995. 
   But there is still much to do. The resolution reported by the Budget Committee builds upon past progress by ensuring that we will protect the entire $976 billion surplus that is expected to accrue to the Social Security trust fund over the next five years. Setting this precedent against using the Social Security surplus for other things is perhaps Congress' greatest accomplishment during the last two years. 
   The FY2001 budget would cut the public debt by an additional $184 billion in fiscal year 2001, and by nearly $1 trillion over the five-year period. It would accommodate a modest amount of tax relief--$13 billion next year--still leaving over $2 trillion flowing to the Treasury. After accounting for the proposed tax relief, non-Social Security surpluses would still amount to $8 billion next year and $20 billion over the next five years. 
   Let me stop for a moment to discuss taxes more fully. According to the non-partisan Tax Foundation, the total tax burden dipped slightly in 1998. That's the good news. The bad news is that Americans still spent more on federal taxes than on any of the other major items in their household budgets. For the median-income, two-earner family, federal taxes amounted to 39 percent of the family budget--more than what they spent on food, housing, and medical care combined. 
   According to the Tax Foundation, the total tax burden is still very high in historical terms. In 1955, the total tax burden was about 17.9 percent compared to the 39 percent it totalled in  1998. The largest growth occurred in payroll taxes, and state and local taxes. Adjusting for inflation, the total of all taxes paid by the two-earner family in 1998 was 4.9 times greater than in 1955. 
   These year-to-year comparisons provide a useful gauge, but ultimately, the goal should be to set tax rates as low as possible after the federal government has met its obligations. The substantial surpluses that are projected alone suggest that we can and should provide additional tax relief. 
   Another observation: According to Census Bureau data, the labor-force participation of married women, as a proportion of all married women, has nearly tripled from 23 percent in 1951 to 62 percent in 1997. Some of that increase, no doubt, can be attributed to women pursuing their career goals, and that is a good thing. We want our mothers, wives, and daughters to pursue their dreams and fulfill themselves in the workplace. But I suspect that a good part of the increase can also be attributed to the need for many families to earn extra income to pay their bills, including their tax bill. 
   More people in the labor force means that tax rates do not have to rise substantially to produce more revenue for the government. But when more families have to have two wage earners because they cannot make ends meet, no one is left home with the kids. That is not such a good thing. providing tax relief will give more families the choice and opportunity to have one parent stay home to raise the children. 
   As for defense, the increase allowed in the Committee budget is certainly not enough to repair the harm done by the Clinton Administration's underfunding in previous years, but it builds upon the start we made last year. 
   Since the fall of the Berlin Wall 10 years ago, the strength of our nation's military forces has shrunk from 2.1 million to slightly under 1.4 million active-duty troops. Spending on the military has declined 29 percent since 1989, while spending on 
   almost all other areas of government has gone up. Defense spending has shrunk at the same time that our military has increasingly been called upon to carry out global peacekeeping, domestic disaster relief, the war on drugs, and other less traditional missions. 
   While many of these objectives are important, they are often pursued without regard to the wear and tear they inflict on our troops and equipment. If we continue to simultaneously increase demand on our forces and cut their budget, we will leave our country vulnerable to potential aggressors. Indeed, according to a review conducted last year by the Pentagon, the U.S. could not today muster a force equal to that which won the 1991 Persian Gulf War so rapidly and decisively. 
   Last year, Congress reversed this trend by approving an $18 billion increase in defense spending to: improve the pay and benefits necessary to attract and keep qualified people in uniform; purchase badly needed new equipment, spare parts, and maintenance; improve training; and defend the United States from the growing threat of ballistic missile attack. Yet even this increase merely kept defense spending on pace with inflation. 
   So the Budget Committee's recommendation to put more money toward defense in this next budget represents a step in the right direction and a good effort to set priorities. 
   The Committee identified other high priorities, as well, and recommended allocating significant increases toward them. For example, the Committee budget would fund education at a level that is $13 billion higher than last year--$600 million more than the President requested. It would increase spending on veterans health by $1.1 billion, and provide a like increase for the National Institutes of Health for medical research. It would reserve $40 billion over five years for a new Medicare prescription drug benefit. These are things the American people are telling us are most important to them and they want funded. We do that, in this budget. 
   Of course, providing these increases in high priority areas will mean that spending on other, less important activities will have to be restrained. But unless we want to return to the days when Congress raided Social Security to pay for other programs, or to the days of big budget deficits, prioritizing spending is key. We have come too far to abandon the discipline that has finally restored some order to the budget process. 
   I will conclude by talking just briefly about one other aspect of this resolution. To ensure that we ultimately do what we say is intended here, the budget includes some important enforcement provisions. It would establish a 60-vote point order--that is, it would effectively require a supermajority vote to run an on-budget deficit and thus make it harder to raid Social Security in the future. It would similarly require a supermajority vote to declare spending as an emergency that is exempt from spending limits. It would establish a firewall to ensure that we abide by spending limits for defense and non-defense activities. And finally, it would make it much harder to shift appropriations into future years in order to avoid current-year spending limits. 
   I commend the Chairman and members of the Budget Committee for their work on this resolution, and particularly acknowledge the work of Senators GRAMM, NICKLES, GREGG, and GRAMS, who helped hold the line on spending and ensure that many of the budget gimmicks employed by Congress and the President in recent years were not employed again. As a result of their efforts, I think we have a much better budget. 
   I urge support for this spending plan.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise in support of S.J. Res. 14, the flag protection constitutional amendment, and to explain, quite briefly, my opposition to Senator MCCONNELL's statutory substitute. 
   The McConnell amendment (No. 2889) would amend the U.S. Code to establish jail terms and fines for (1) damaging a flag ``with the primary purpose and intent to incite or produce imminent violence or a breach of the peace,'' (2) damaging a flag that belongs to the United States, or (3) damaging a flag that belongs to a third party if the damage occurs within the ``exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction of the United States.'' See Section 3, proposed 18 U.S.C. 700. 
   I oppose the McConnell amendment for three reasons. First, the narrow strictures of the amendment would provide little protection for the flag. For example, the McConnell amendment would not apply to the very case (Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397 (1989)) in which the Supreme Court struck down flag protection statutes. In that case, Gregory Johnson burned a flag that had been stolen from a bank. He did not burn the flag on Federal property; be burned it in front of city hall as a political protest. Thus, the second and third restrictions of the McConnell amendment (a ban on destroying flags stolen from the United States, and a ban on destroying stolen flags on Federal property) would not have applied. As for the first restriction (a ban on burning a flag when such action could cause imminent violence or a breach of the peace), it is important to note that the Court in Texas v. Johnson found that unless there was evidence that a riot ensued or threatened to ensue one could not protect the flag under the breach of the peace doctrine. 
   Second, it seems unlikely that the amendment would survive scrutiny by the U.S. Supreme Court. In response to Texas v. Johnson, Congress quickly enacted a facially content-neutral, flag-protection statute that it hoped would pass constitutional muster. See Public Law 101-131. On June 11, 1990, in United States v. Eichman (496 U.S. 310 (1990)), the Supreme Court struck down that law. The Court found the following: ``Although the Flag Protection Act contains no explicit content-based limitation on the scope of prohibited conduct, it is nevertheless clear that the government's asserted interest is `related to the suppression of free expression,' and concerned with the content of such expression. The Government's interest in protecting the `physical integrity' of a privately owned flag rests upon a perceived need to preserve the flag's status as a symbol of our Nation and certain national ideas.'' Id. at 315-16. If precedent is an accurate guide, it is likely that the Court would reach a similar conclusion if it considered the McConnell amendment. 
   Finally, as one of the 58 Senate sponsors of S.J. Res. 14, I want to see that resolution receive an up-or-down vote. The sponsors of the amendment and the numerous veterans, patriotic, civic, and religious groups have worked hard to bring the constitutional amendment to a vote. 
   In closing, I would like to reaffirm my support for S.J. Res. 14. I cannot believe that our Founding Fathers intended ``freedom of expression'' to encompass the willful destruction of our national symbol--the symbol of America that so many of our sons and daughters have given their lives to defend.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me express my appreciation to Senators ROTH and MOYNIHAN, and especially to Senators BOB KERREY and JUDD GREGG for their efforts. This is clearly an idea where the time has come. My colleagues are correct to emphasize that saving Social Security for the future will require us to put aside the prospect of partisan gain for the good of the country and of our senior citizens. I respect the point they have made. 
   I hope the step we are taking today, which could not be taken without a bipartisan consensus, bodes well for future reform of Social Security. I am quite pleased to see that the Senate is on the verge of taking this momentous action of eliminating the earnings test for those between the ages of 65 and 69. It is a step that is long overdue. 
   Many of us have been calling for the repeal of this test for many years. In fact, the occupant of the Chair and I were part of the 100th class of Republicans in the House of Representatives who made repealing this earnings test one of our projects. We have been at this for a long time. When I came to the Senate, I joined Senator JOHN MCCAIN, who has been a champion for this cause, in introducing the Senior Citizens' Freedom to Work Act in the opening days of the 106th Congress. When we did that, I wondered whether it would fare any better than when we had offered it in the past. Now, at long 
   last, we have forged a bipartisan consensus for taking action which even includes the President, and relief is finally in sight for working seniors. 
   I have always believed it just wasn't right to impose steep taxes on people who tried to work after reaching retirement age. It isn't right that under current law seniors between the ages of 65 and 69 lose a dollar for every $3 they earn above the threshold of $17,000. In fact, last year, 800,000 seniors lost a portion of their benefit because of this unfair tax. It isn't right that, combined with regular income taxes, and the taxation of Social Security benefits, the earnings test subjects some working seniors to an effective marginal tax rate of more than 100 percent. That is not right. 
   We all know this earnings test was created during the Depression era when policymakers felt an urgent need to give opportunities to young workers by encouraging seniors to leave the workforce. Today, America faces an extraordinarily tight labor market and seniors are living longer, more productive lives. 
   In that context, a policy that penalizes our most experienced citizens for their hard work is not just unfair, it is counterproductive. America needs the skills and knowledge senior citizens have acquired, especially in today's competitive global marketplace. 
   I believe repealing the earnings test also affirms our commitment to the values of self-help and personal responsibility. 
   After working to accomplish this repeal throughout my entire time in the Congress, I am very pleased to note that we are so close to completing the job today. Again, my compliments to all those people who have worked so hard to make this a reality.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the nominations of Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. I intend to vote against Judge Paez and for Marsha Berzon. Because these nominations have received a great deal of attention, I would like to briefly explain the reasons for my votes. 
   I want to begin by briefly discussing the ninth circuit. As a Senator from  Arizona (the state which generates more appeals than any other ninth circuit state except California), as a member of the Judiciary Committee, and as someone who practiced law in the ninth circuit for nearly 20 years, I have a keen interest in matters affecting the ninth circuit. 
   Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon are, of course, nominees to the ninth circuit. I agree with many of my colleagues that nominees to the ninth circuit should be given special scrutiny because of the problems with the circuit. 
   The ninth circuit has received a great deal of criticism--so much, in fact, that Congress passed bipartisan legislation to require a blue-ribbon commission to study the circuit. See Public Law No. 105-119, section 305(a)(1)(B) and (a)(6). Before both the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, I have testified in detail as to my concerns with the circuit, so I will not go into detail here. I would like to just mention one statistic that speaks volumes: In the past 6 years, the Supreme Court has reversed (often unanimously) the ninth circuit in 86 percent (85 of 99) of the cases it has reviewed. The average reversal rate for courts other than the ninth circuit is about 57 percent. As Justice Scalia commented in a September 9, 1998, letter to Justice White, the chair of the Commission on Structural Alternatives, the Ninth Circuit's ``reversal rate has appreciably--sometimes drastically--exceeded the national average.'' 
   This is but one small piece in a mountain of evidence that indicates that the ninth circuit is out of the mainstream of American jurisprudence. See, for example, letters to the Commission on Structural Alternatives by Justice Scalia (August 21, 1998), Justice Kennedy (August 17, 1998), and Justice O'Connor (June 23, 1998); Commission on Structural Alternatives, Final Report, December 18, 1998; Review of the Report by the Commission on Structural Alternatives regarding the Ninth Circuit and S. 253, the Ninth Circuit Reorganization Act, hearing before the House Committee on the Judiciary, 106th Congress, 1st Session (July 16, 1999) (statements of ninth circuit Judges Pamela Ann Rymer (member of commission) and Diarmund F. O'Scannlain). It seems clear that the ninth circuit has problems. Even those who oppose dividing or splitting the circuit concede this point. Thus, in my opinion, nominees to this circuit--which is effectively the court of last resort for more than 52 million people--should be given special scrutiny. 
   The Constitution imposes an important role upon the Senate. In exercising its advice and consent power, the Senate must be vigilant in ensuring that, at a minimum, nominees are of top legal caliber, possess good judgment, have the proper judicial temperament, are of unquestioned integrity and impartiality, and would not abuse the great power of their office--an office they will hold for life. 
   In this regard, I would like to reiterate the comments that I made before this body 3 years ago, on March 12, 1997.  
   Some have attributed the Ninth Circuit reversal rate to the unwieldy size of the bench. Others point to a history of judicial activism, sometimes in pursuit of political results. I suspect there is more than one reason for the problem. Whatever the case, the Senate will need to be especially sensitive to this problem when it provides its advice and consent on nominations to fill court vacancies. The nominees will need to demonstrate exceptional ability and objectivity. The Senate will obviously have an easier time evaluating candidates who have a record on a lower court bench. Such records are often good indications of whether a judge is--or is likely to be--a judicial activist, and whether he or she is frequently reversed. Nominees who do not have a judicial background or who have a more political background may be more difficult to evaluate........[T]he Senate has as much responsibility as the President for those who end up being confirmed. We need to take that responsibility seriously--among other things, to begin the process of reducing the reversal rate of our largest circuit.  
   I remain quite concerned about the ninth circuit. In the October 1999 term, the U.S. Supreme Court has so far reviewed seven ninth circuit cases and in all seven cases the ninth circuit has been reversed--four times unanimously, twice by a 7-2 margin, and once by a 5-4 vote. If the ninth circuit continues to remain out of step, it will be very hard to continue to give ninth circuit nominees the benefit of the doubt. The risk is too great. The ninth circuit covers nine states and two territories. To have so many subject to a circuit that so often errs should concern us all. 
   Within this context, the general rule that a President should be given deference in making nominations to the federal judiciary is less relevant to today's nominations. 
   While Judge Paez is academically qualified, I have reservations about him for a variety of reasons. First, he made what many consider to be inappropriate comments while he was a federal district court judge. In an April 6, 1995 speech at Boalt Hall School of Law in Berkeley, California, Judge Paez said the following:  
   The Latino community has, for some time now, faced heightened discrimination and hostility, which came to a head with the passage of proposition 187. The proposed anti-civil rights initiative [Proposition 209] will inflame the issues all over again, without contributing to any serious discussion of our differences and similarities or ways to ensure equal opportunity for all.  
   Judge Paez was, as I noted above, a sitting federal district court judge when he made this remark, and litigation was pending in Judge Paez' own court, the Central District of California, regarding the constitutionality of Proposition 187. The court had granted a temporary restraining order and had before it a request for a preliminary injunction, which the district court did not rule on until November 1995, 7 months after Judge Paez' speech. As Senator SPENCE ABRAHAM pointed out in a detailed statement before the Senate, Judge Paez' remark seems inconsistent with Canon 4(A)(1) of the Model Code of Judicial Conduct which governs judges' extra-judicial activities. Under that canon, ``a judge shall conduct all of the judge's extra-judicial activities so that they do not cast reasonable doubt on the judge's capacity to act impartially as a judge.'' In discussing Judge Paez' comments in an October 29, 1999, editorial, the Washington Post stated that ``[f]or a sitting judge to disparage ballot initiatives that were likely subjects to litigation was inappropriate.'' And, indeed, the judge appears to have, at least privately, acknowledged this error. 
   Judge Paez made another troubling comment. On March 26, 1982, in the Los Angeles Daily Journal, he is quoted as making the following statement.  
   I appreciate *.*.* the need of the courts to act when they must, when the issue has been generated as a result of the failure of the political process to resolve a certain political question *.*.* There's no choice but for the courts to resolve the question that perhaps ideally and preferably should be resolved through the legislative process.  
   At the time of this statement, Paez was a municipal court judge. In the same article, he commented that ``you could characterize my background as liberal.'' 
   Judge Paez' supporters have made comments that raise concerns. For example, in an August 13, 1993 Los Angeles Times article, Romana Ripstein, the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California, made the following statement in discussing Paez's nomination to the federal district court: ``It's been a while since we've had these kinds of appointments to the federal court. I think it's a welcome change after all the pro-law enforcement people we've seen appointed to the state and federal courts.'' If this is an accurate portrayal of his predilections, Ms. Ripstein's characterization is troubling. Similarly, in a November 17, 1995, Los Angeles Daily Journal article, trial attorney Steven Yagman commented that ``Judge Paez embodies the ideal of the '60's. The Judge is an intelligent, moral person who got power and uses it to do good.'' Judges are not supposed to use power to do good (especially since that is a subjective term). Judges are supposed to apply the law. That's why we say we are a nation of laws. 
   Judge Paez also has been criticized for giving--without explaining how he arrived at the sentence--what many consider to be a light sentence to former Representative Jay Kim following Kim's guilty plea for having accepted more than $250,000 in illegal campaign contributions, the largest acknowledge receipt of illegal contributions in congressional history. In the March 10, 1998, Los Angeles Times, Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephen Mansfield said, ``The sentence ..... must not  be a `slap on the wrist.' It must not approximate a penalty for `jaywalking'.'' The Los Angeles Times also reported that ``[o]utside the federal courthouse, prosecutors made it clear that they were disappointed but not stunned by Paez' sentence.'' On March 12, 1998, Roll Call wrote, ``All the evidence--and the fact that Kim received a lighter sentence than his former campaign treasurer--makes Judge Paez' sentence a mere slap on the wrist and makes us think that the Senate Judiciary Committee ought to question whether Paez isn't too soft on criminals to be an appellate judge.'' 
   None of these factors would by itself necessarily disqualify a nominee, but taken as a whole they are troubling and lead me to conclude that, on balance, Judge Paez is apt to be an activist rather than a neutral arbiter. As a result, I reluctantly conclude that I cannot support his nomination. 
   I have concerns about Marsha Berzon. Almost her entire legal experience has been in one narrow field--labor law. According to her Senate Judiciary questionnaire, ``more than 95 percent'' of her work has been civil. Additionally, she stated that ``I have not personally examined or cross-examined a witness in any trial'' and that ``I have not tried any cases myself, jury or non-jury.'' 
   Concerns have been expressed by the National Right to Work Committee and the Chamber of Commerce because of her narrow labor-oriented background. While I share these concerns, I am unaware of credible evidence suggesting that she fails to possess the requisite capability or temperament to serve on the bench. As a result, although I have serious concerns about her nomination, I will support it.

    Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and say farewell to an outstanding Naval Officer and fellow Arizonian, Lieutenant Michael Sullivan, who has served with distinction for the past year and a half years in the Navy's Senate Liaison Office on Capitol Hill. It is a privilege for me to recognize his many outstanding achievements and to commend him for the superb service he has provided this legislative body, the Navy, and our great Nation. 
   Lieutenant Sullivan comes from a patriotic family. His grandfather was a submariner during World War II and his father is a Navy veteran of the Riverine Force in Vietnam. The Sullivan Family lived in the Bronx, New York before moving to the great state of Arizona. Lieutenant Sullivan attended elementary and middle public schools in Scottsdale and ultimately graduated from Saguaro High School. He was attending the University of Arizona, and I was still a Member of the House of Representatives, when he applied for the most privileged of responsibilities I have as a Member of Congress--making a nomination for appointments to the U.S. Service Academies. It was with great pride that I had submitted his name to attend the United States Naval Academy where he graduated and earned his commission in 1993. 
   Lieutenant Sullivan joined the Navy's Senate Liaison team in July 1998, following successful sea tours on board the U.S.S. Fife (DD-991) and the U.S.S. Antietam (CG-54). During his service as a Navy Liaison Officer he provided members of the Senate and our personal staffs with timely support and accurate information on Navy plans, programs, and constituent casework. He has helped us maintain the best trained, best equipped, and best prepared Navy in the world. 
   Mr. President, Lieutenant Sullivan has served proudly with a dedication and enthusiasm that only comes from our Nation's best and brightest. Lieutenant Sullivan is a great credit to both our Navy and our country. As he now departs for Department Head School and his next sea tour, I call upon my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to wish him the best for a continued brilliant Navy career.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I compliment Senator HATCH for the great way in which he explained this amendment which Senators COVERDELL, COLLINS, HATCH, and myself have cosponsored. 
   He points out that we have goals for excellence in teaching, and this is a way to help foster those goals. We ask our teachers to do a great deal. This is one small step we can take to help those who are most willing to help their students. 
   I thank Senator HATCH for an excellent statement. 
   I also thank Senator COLLINS for the kind remarks she made last evening. It has been a pleasure to work with her. She is a real leader in education. To be able to join my amendment with her amendment as one approach which provides some relief to the teachers who are willing to take that extra step to help their students is certainly an honor for me. 
   To recapitulate for our colleagues because I think we are going to be voting soon, I leave it to Senator COLLINS to close the debate unless there is anyone else who would like to speak to it. The old saying of taking an apple to the teacher at school has caused us to stop and think a little bit. It is fine to take an apple to the teacher, but there is a way we can be a little bit more helpful to those teachers who go the extra mile. There may not be a direct relationship between excellence in teaching and providing some assistance to those teachers who will go out of their way to take extra supplies to their students, but I suspect there, in fact, is a connection because these are the most dedicated of all--those teachers who realize their local schools have not been able to provide quite enough in instructional materials for their kids, and out of their own family budget they are willing to make a contribution for their students' education. As I pointed out last night, the NEA estimates, according to a study, that each teacher annually spends $408 out of his or her pocket to help kids in school by taking these instructional materials to them. 
   These two amendments, in a small way but an important way, recognize that dedication and that contribution. In the case of my half of the amendment, it provides dollar for dollar in relief and $100 in the case of Senator COLLINS' amendment. It relieves 2 percent of the burden for itemizing it, which Senator HATCH just spoke about. 
   Is this going to solve all of our woes in education? No. But is it an important recognition of the job teachers do, particularly those teachers who are willing to go the extra mile? We think it is. To the degree they are willing to supplement what their schools provide for students, and it comes out of their own pockets, we think we should at least cause them no harm in that process. 
   That is why we provide these two elements of tax relief basically to encourage them to continue to work with their students in this way. 
   I conclude again by thanking Senator COVERDELL for his leadership, Senator COLLINS, and Senator HATCH. I hope my colleagues will give this amendment their overwhelming support.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada. I appreciate his willingness to allow me to move forward. 
   Also, what Senator LOTT told us is extremely important. His point is this is an act that is not going to be opposed by very many Senators once we can get it to the floor for a vote. It is the procedural maneuvering that is going on right now by some who want to gain an advantage in this debate to propose some of their own extracurricular ideas that have nothing to do with the bill that is holding us up from considering the bill. 
   I hope, along with the majority leader, we can get quickly to the consideration of this important legislation because, as he correctly noted, once we begin debate on this bill and have an opportunity to vote on it, it is going to receive overwhelming support from Members on both sides of the aisle in the Senate. 
   I want to speak for a moment on an amendment which I intend to offer, but before I do that, I commend the Senator from Georgia, Mr. COVERDELL, for his work on S. 1134. He has made a valiant effort, over a long period of time, to bring reform to our educational system. 
   He particularly wants to give all parents more choice in deciding where to send their children and to give them more of their own money with which to do so, or perhaps I should say to allow them to keep more of their own money in order to have those choices. 
   The number of Americans and, as I said, Senators of both parties who agree with Senator COVERDELL is growing every day. 
   His education IRA legislation, which was vetoed in 1998, is now a vital component of S. 1134. As noted by the majority 
   leader, it will allow parents, grandparents, labor unions, churches, synagogues, employers, or others to contribute to tax-free savings accounts to provide for a child's education from kindergarten through high school. 
   According to a 1998 report from Congress' Joint Committee on Taxation, 14 million families--a majority of them low and middle income--are currently denied these benefits because of the Clinton veto of this bill in 1998. These are the families who will benefit from this legislation. 
   As one cosponsor of the vetoed bill, Democratic Senator TORRICELLI, lamented in an op-ed in the New York Times:  
   With one stroke of a pen.....an effort to begin a vast reform of American education has ended.  
   The Coverdell education IRA would extend a provision which I supported in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 which allowed parents to save $500 per year tax free for their children's college education. 
   However, all levels of education, not just college, need the incentives to improve that market-oriented reforms such as parental school choice supply. 
   The real crisis in education, as former Education Secretary Bill Bennett has observed, ``is at the primary and secondary levels.'' 
   As the majority leader said a moment ago, all of the help we provide for college students goes for nought if our students are not prepared by the time they get to the college level. So we need to be focusing now on the primary and secondary levels. 
   This resurrected Coverdell-Torricelli education IRA will allow families to  save up to $2,000 a year in a special education savings account for each of their children. 
   The contributions will be in after-tax dollars, but the interest generated will be tax free, as long as any deductions from the account are used to pay for school expenses. 
   The President may resist it, but we have to develop a unified student assistance funding system that guarantees choice to struggling parents of all income levels with children in all grade levels, from kindergarten through college. 
   Again, as Senator TORRICELLI said,  
   For real reform to take place, both Democrats and Republicans, liberals and conservatives, must look beyond their narrow agendas and partisan political interests and seek out new proposals. Our schoolchildren deserve nothing less.  
   I could not say it better. 
   With that background, let me discuss the amendment which I will be offering to S. 1134. As the whole theory of this is to put resources where they will help the most, I have prepared an amendment which in a very narrow but important way will do precisely that. We call our amendment the Apples for Three Million Teachers Tax Credit Relief Act of 2000, first introduced on January 24 of this year, with Senator BUNNING and Senator FRED THOMPSON as cosponsors. 
   In the House, Representative MATT SALMON introduced companion legislation, H.R. 1710, which currently has 38 cosponsors, including the majority leader, DICK ARMEY. 
   What will this amendment do? It will provide an annual tax credit of up to $100 for public and private teachers' unreimbursed classroom expenditures that are qualified under the Internal Revenue Code. 
   What does that mean? We know that teachers routinely every year pay for a lot of their supplies for their classrooms to help instruct their children, things they know will be useful in their instruction but which are not provided by their local school districts. There is currently a tax deduction allowed--which I will talk more about in the future--but it does not work as well for these particular taxpayers. 
   Our amendment provides a $100 tax credit right off the top for these school supplies which these teachers are taking to their classrooms. 
   Thomas Jefferson once said ``an educated citizenry is essential for the preservation of democracy.'' 
   As the son and brother of teachers devoted to their students, I know firsthand of the public spiritedness and commitment of these professionals to their students. 
   It falls to our teachers to inculcate the academic values and analytic skills that make good citizenship possible, of which Thomas Jefferson spoke. 
   In talking with teachers, both public and private, I have come to learn that a lot of them use their own money to cover the cost of classroom materials that are not supplied by their schools. Some have used money from the family budget to purchase these needed classroom supplies, and they would do it again. It seems to me we should not expect them to pay for these things out of their own pockets, or at least to give some Federal financial assistance when they do, particularly those who are on a teacher's rather modest income. 
   To put this in perspective, in 1996, according to a study by the National Education Association, the average K-12 teacher spent $408 annually on those classroom materials which they thought they needed for their classroom instruction but which were not supplied by the schools. They spend $408 on average per year. That includes everything from books, workbooks, erasers, pens, pencils, paper, and other equipment. 
   Under current law, a tax deduction is allowed for such expenses but only if the teacher itemizes and only if expenses exceed 2 percent of the teacher's adjusted gross income. 
   I commend Senator SUSAN COLLINS for her successful amendment to the Taxpayer Relief Act which eliminates this 2-percent threshold. I look forward to working with her to give our teachers needed relief from their out-of-pocket cost for classroom expenditures. 
   A deduction reduces taxable income. A credit will give teachers relief dollar for dollar spent, 
   in the case of my amendment, up to the $100 annual limit. 
   This isn't the solution, but it is a small first step which I think would be very much appreciated by our hard-working and sacrificing teachers. 
   There is no absolute linkage between these personal contributions to school supplies and the quality of the teaching. However, there likely is some correlation, given the degree of commitment evidenced by these teachers who are spending their own money on their students. 
   We will be helping the best teachers. I believe this will promote high-quality instruction. 
   A similar provision enacted by the Arizona legislature in 1997 has been very well received by our teachers. Incidentally, it was recently upheld in terms of its constitutionality by the Arizona Supreme Court. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill and in supporting the amendment I will be offering. I think it is important that our teachers at least be partially reimbursed for some of the financial sacrifices they made to educate our Nation's children. If we are serious about getting dollars to the classrooms that need it, this is really an excellent way to do it. 
   Again, I commend my colleague, Senator COVERDELL, for all his efforts in this regard and look forward to working with him in the future as we get this legislation up for debate and, importantly, for a vote in the Senate. 
   Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to bring to the attention of the Senate a serious problem facing many thousands of Medicare beneficiaries in Arizona. On November 16, 1999, Premier Health Care of Arizona went into receivership. The health care of more than 20,000 Medicare beneficiaries who were enrolled in Premier has been affected by this solvency. 
   Since Premier Medicare HMO was placed in receivership, I have been advised that some non-contract providers--providers outside of the HMO network--have asserted that Medicare beneficiaries are personally liable for unpaid claims and have referred the outstanding claims to collection agencies. 
   These unpaid claims--some of which may date back more than six months and amount to significant sums of money--have made it difficult for many contract and non-contract providers to continue to provide care to Medicare beneficiaries. Because Premier operated in a largely rural area where few alternative providers were accessible, this has created a dire health-care delivery situation for Medicare beneficiaries. 
   Mr. President, today I introduce legislation that addresses the Arizona situation, as well as future  Medicare+Choice insolvencies, wherever they may occur. This legislation mandates that, after a Medicare+Choice goes into receivership, the receiver--in this case, the state insurance commissioner--may apply to the Secretary of HHS for payment of all valid, unpaid provider claims for items or services furnished to Medicare enrollees before the date the receiver was appointed. 
   Contract providers will be paid at their contract rate, while non-contract providers will be paid for the ``reasonable cost'' of the covered item or service. Amounts needed to make these payments will be paid out of the Part A or Part B trust fund, as is appropriate based on which fund would have paid the claim on a fee-for-services basis. 
   To recover these amounts paid to providers, the bill establishes that HCFA will become a creditor of the receivership estate and assumes the priority position of the respective providers it has paid. 
   The bill also mandates that Medicare+Choice enrollees may not be held liable to contract or non-contract providers for any claims that are unpaid by the Medicare+Choice organization. 
   While the regulation of state-licensed Medicare+Choice organizations is primarily a state responsibility, the Medicare law makes clear that the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the administrator of HCFA have an ongoing ``responsibility to ensure that it (HCFA) contracts only with fiscally-sound Medicare+Choice organizations.'' 
   To this end, Section 1857(d) gives the Secretary the right to audit and inspect any books and records that pertain either to the ability of the Medicare HMO to bear the risk of potential financial loss, or to the quality and timeliness of services provided for Medicare beneficiaries. See 42 CFR 422.502, 516 and 552. 
   My bill strengthens current law and regulation by requiring that, once HCFA determines that a Medicare+Choice organization may not be able to bear the risk of financial losses, the Secretary must promptly notify the appropriate state officials and provide those officials with the information on which that determination is based. 
   The bill also strengthens current law by requiring that, when Medicare+Choice organizations fail to provide prompt payments to providers, the Secretary must pay providers directly. Under my bill, if the Medicare+Choice plan fails to provide prompt payment of 10 percent of claims submitted for services and supplies furnished to enrollees within 60 days of the date on which the claim was submitted, the Secretary must pay contract and non-contract providers directly--there is no discretion as there is in current law. 
   To avoid a repeat of this problem with other carriers in the future, the bill requires that Medicare+Choice organizations post a surety bond of no less than $500,000, as well as meet any additional requirements related to bonding or escrow accounts that the Secretary deems necessary. The bond requirement may be waived if a comparable surety bond is required under state law. 
   Mr. President, this legislation will enable the government to fulfill its promise to those seniors who have chosen to receive their Medicare coverage through a Medicare+Choice organization. It will prevent seniors from being billed for covered services and providers from losing large sums in unpaid bills. 
   If providers aren't paid, many may be unwilling--or unable--to continue providing care. If quality care is not available through experienced providers, or if seniors are the subject of legal action for the bills of insolvent Medicare+Choice organizations, beneficiaries will lose confidence in the Medicare+Choice programs, and ultimately, in Medicare fee-for-service as well. We simply can't let that happen. 
   The Congress must ensure that providers are paid and Medicare beneficiaries are protected. This is a commitment we have made to seniors--it is a commitment we must fulfill.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Iran Nonproliferation Act. For the past few years, I have been concerned about Iran's efforts to acquire the technology for ballistic missiles and nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons from Russia and China. 
   When reports began to surface in 1997 about Russian missile assistance to Iran, I met twice with Russia's Ambassador to the U.S. and the administration's special envoy on this issue to express my concern about this dangerous trade and to urge the Russian government and the Clinton Administration to take steps to stop it. 
   I also gathered together a group of 99 Members of the House and Senate, who wrote to the President to urge him to invoke sanctions to halt this trade. The President refused. 
   Along with a bipartisan group of House and Senate Members, I went to the White House to meet with Vice President GORE to urge the administration to take concrete actions to end Russian transfers to Iran. Again the administration refused, citing the need to let diplomacy work. 
   That summer, I successfully offered an amendment that was adopted by unanimous consent to the fiscal year 1998 Foreign Operations Appropriations bill barring U.S. aid to Russia if missile assistance to Iran continued. In conference, the amendment was changed to give the President the ability to waive this prohibition on aid to Russia, which he subsequently did. 
   In November 1997, the Senate unanimously passed a concurrent resolution that I sponsored, expressing the sense of the Congress that the President should sanction the Russian organizations involved in selling missile technology to Iran. The House also passed this resolution overwhelmingly by a vote of 414 to 8. Again the President refused to impose sanctions. 
   The Congress tried again to spur the administration to action 6 months later when we passed the Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act mandating sanctions on any organization involved in assisting Iran's missile or weapons of mass destruction programs. This bill passed the Senate by a vote of 90 to 4. Yet, when it reached the President's desk, he vetoed it. 
   Instead of voting to override this veto, the Congress acceded to the President's request for more time to  let diplomacy work. The verdict is in on that decision. Transfers of nuclear, biological, chemical, and ballistic missile technology to Iran persist demonstrating the Congress erred in deciding not to override the veto. While the administration has imposed so-called administrative sanctions against a handful of Russian entities, it cooperated with the Russian government to identify the target organizations such that the sanctions would have no meaningful effect, completely undermining the value of the action. 
   While I will not go into the same detail here, let me simply say the administration has a similar record on Chinese proliferation to Iran, where it has failed to enforce U.S. laws calling for sanctions, again noting the need to let diplomacy work. 
   Since the administration would not take steps to halt proliferation to Iran, I offered an amendment to a supplemental appropriations bill that the President signed into law in May 1998. The amendment appropriated $179 million to accelerate the development of U.S. theater missile defenses, including $45 million for Israel to begin purchasing equipment for a third battery of its Arrow missile defense system in order to counter the increased Iranian missile threat. 
   As these examples show, the Clinton Administration is simply not willing to take the tough actions necessary to prevent proliferation. As a result, intelligence assessments indicate the problem is growing worse all the time. In an unclassified report to Congress last month, CIA Director George Tenet stated;  
   Iran remains one of the most active countries seeking to acquire weapons of mass destruction and advanced conventional weapons technology from abroad. ..... For the first half of 1999, entities in Russia and China continued to supply a considerable amount and a wide variety of ballistic missile-related goods and technology to Iran. ..... Iran already is producing Scud short-range ballistic missiles and has built and publicly displayed prototypes for the [1,300 kilometer-range] Shahab-3 medium-range ballistic missile, which had its initial flight test in July 1998 and probably achieved ``emergency operational capability''--i.e., Tehran could deploy a limited number of the Shahab-3 prototype missiles in an operational mode during a perceived crisis situation. In addition, Iran's Defense Minister last year publicly acknowledged the development of the [2,000 kilometer range] Shahab-4 ..... [and] publicly mentioned plans for a ``Shahab-5.''  
   In the report, Director Tenet went on to note that Iran continues to seek biological warfare technology from Russia and Europe and despite being a party to the Chemical Weapons Convention has ``already has manufactured and stockpiled chemical weapons ..... and the bombs and artillery shells for delivering them.'' He also said that ``Tehran continues to seek production technology, expertise, and chemicals that could be used as precursor agents in its chemical warfare program from entities in Russia and China.'' 
   Finally, the report indicated that despite promising never to acquire nuclear weapons, 
   when it ratified the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), Iran has a nuclear weapons program, stating:  
   Iran is attempting to establish a complete nuclear fuel cycle for its civilian energy program. In that guise, it seeks to obtain whole facilities ..... that in fact could be used in any number of ways in support of efforts to produce fissile material needed for a nuclear weapon. Despite international efforts to curtail the flow of critical technologies and equipment, Tehran continues to seek fissile material and technology for weapons development and has set up an elaborate system of military and civilian organization to support its effort.  
   In fact, according to the Washington Post, the CIA recently concluded that it could no longer rule out the possibility that Iran is already capable of producing a nuclear weapon. This is terribly troubling in light of the progress Iran has made in its missile program. Earlier this month, Director Tenet testified to the Intelligence Committee that:  
   Most [intelligence] analysts believe that Iran, following the North Korean pattern, could test an ICBM capable of delivering a light payload to the United States in the next few years. ..... As alarming as the long-range missile threat is, it should not overshadow the immediacy and seriousness of the threat that U.S. forces, interests, and allies already face overseas from short and medium range missiles. The proliferation of medium-range ballistic missiles [to nations like Iran] is significantly altering strategic balances in the Middle East and Asia.  
   Finally, Director Tenet outlined a new type of proliferation threat from Iran in his testimony, warning that:  
   ..... long-standing recipients--such as Iran--might become suppliers in their own right as they develop domestic production capabilities. ..... Iran in the next few years may be able to supply not only complete Scuds, but also Shahab-3s and related technology, and perhaps more advanced technologies if Tehran continues to receive assistance from Russia, China, and North Korea.  
   It is clear that meaningful measures, and not simply another round of feckless diplomacy or a flawed international treaty such as the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty CTBT, is needed to combat this growing threat. Last Fall, the Administration accused the Congress of undermining U.S. nonproliferation efforts in rejecting the CTBT. But that treaty was unverifiable, would have undermined America's nuclear deterrent, and would have done nothing meaningful to combat proliferation. 
   As I mentioned earlier, Iran along with 191 other nations has ratified the NPT, and thereby promised never to acquire nuclear weapons. It is violating this treaty. It is also violating the Chemical Weapons Convention and is acquiring missile technology. All of these actions should trigger U.S. sanctions, but the Clinton Administration has refused to take action. 
   If arms control treaties like the NPT and other nonproliferation efforts are to be useful, they must be enforced. I urge the administration to finally get serious about this matter and for my colleagues to vote for the Iran Nonproliferation Act. Iran's possession of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons, and the missiles used to deliver them poses a clear and present danger to the United States and our forces and friends in the region. It is long past time that we address this threat.

    Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Teacher Tax Credit Relief Act of 2000. The act would provide an annual tax credit of up to $100 for teachers' un-reimbursed classroom expenditures that are qualified under the Internal Revenue Code. 
   Thomas Jefferson once said that ``an educated citizenry is essential for the preservation of democracy.'' It falls to our teachers--through their hard work and lifetime of commitment to young people--to inculcate the academic values and analytical skills that make good citizenship possible. 
   In my discussions with teachers--public and private--I have been amazed to learn that many use their own money to cover the cost of classroom materials that are not supplied by their schools or school districts. These expenditures enhance our childrens' education but are paid for out-of-pocket. 
   In fact, in 1996, according to a study by the National Education Association, the average K-12 teacher spent $408 annually on classroom materials needed for education but not supplied by the schools. These materials include everything from books, workbooks, erasers, paper, pens, equipment related to classroom instruction, and professional enrichment programs. 
   Under current law, a tax deduction is allowed for such expenses, but only if the teacher itemizes, and only if the expenses exceed two percent of the teacher's AGI. Of course, a deduction just reduces taxable income. A credit would give teachers relief dollar-for-dollar spent, up to the $100 annual limit. 
   On a modest income, teachers provide an incalculable service to our country. Surely, we should not expect them to pay for school supplies out of their salary, when they have already committed their lives to the education of our young. 
   A similar provision enacted by the Arizona legislature in 1995 has been extremely well-received by teachers. The provision was recently upheld as constitutional by the Arizona Supreme Court. 
   Please join me in supporting this bill. Our teachers deserve to be at least partially reimbursed for financial sacrifices they make to educate our nation's children.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, today we are considering the District of Columbia appropriations bill, which includes not only funding for the nation's capital, but also regular appropriations for seven cabinet-level departments--the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, State, Justice, Commerce, and Interior. 
   The package also includes four major authorization bills covering Medicare, foreign operations, satellite television, dairy programs, and scrap-metal recycling. 
   Mr. President, under ordinary circumstances, legislation should not be packaged this way. If I were to base my vote merely upon the process that led us to combine these measures into one huge bill, I would vote no, as I have on the other omnibus bills that have come before the Senate during the last few years. However, I think there are some important distinctions between the package before us this year and what we have seen in the past. 
   Unlike last year, for example, when free-for-all negotiations resulted in an orgy of new spending and wholesale concessions to the White House, this year the individual parts of the bill were negotiated separately, in a largely orderly process. Unlike last year, any additional spending won by the White House was required to be offset so that net spending would not increase. 
   With the exception of the dairy provisions, which I oppose, I have concluded that I would vote for each of the measures included here if we had the opportunity to vote on them separately. For this reason and, because on balance, I believe the good in the rest of the package outweighs the bad, I will vote aye. 
   Mr. President, when we look back on this legislation five or 10 years from now, I think we will see one aspect of it as truly historic. 
   The legislation, despite its shortcomings, establishes a historic new precedent against ever again raiding the Social Security trust fund for other purposes--a precedent that future Presidents and Congresses will deviate from only at their own peril. 
   The package has been designed to avoid intentionally spending a dime of the Social Security surplus. And if our estimates turn out to be right, it will be the first time since 1960--the first time in nearly 40 years--that Congress did not tap the Social Security surplus to pay for other programs. It also means that we will be able to pay down publicly held debt by another $130 billion or so this year. 
   Mr. President, I think everyone needs to recognize that estimates of spending and revenues can be affected by even the slightest changes in the economy, and so we will need to be prepared to adjust spending levels early next year if it appears that that is necessary to take further action to safeguard the Social Security surplus. We should even consider putting an automatic mechanism in place, as proposed in legislation I cosponsored with Senator ROD GRAMS, to make sure Social Security is never again tapped. 
   In any event, it is important to recognize just how far we have come since 1995. That was the year Bill Clinton sent Congress a budget that would have spent every penny of the Social Security surplus every year for the foreseeable future, and still run $200 billion annual deficits on top of that. The President's FY96 budget submission would have resulted in actual deficits rising from about $259 billion in 1995 to roughly $289 billion this year. 
   We did not follow the President's recommendations. We charted an entirely different course. The result: We now have a budget that sets aside the entire Social Security surplus and even runs an estimated $1 billion surplus in the government's operating budget. That is progress. 
   Because we do not raid Social Security, we had to do a better job of setting priorities so that we could take care of those things the American people care most about, and to a large degree, I think we succeeded. This bill provides a substantial increase in funds for medical research at the National Institutes of Health. We provide even more resources for education than the President asked for, and we take a modest first step in the direction of public school choice and providing local school districts with increased flexibility in how they will use federal funds to meet the particular needs of their students. We restore funding for hospitals and nursing homes that care for Medicare patients. 
   We also include additional resources for law enforcement, including funding for 1,000 new Border Patrol agents, and funds to combat the scourge of methamphetamine in our communities. We are able to provide more money than the President sought for the Violence  Against Women Act. And we provide money to make sure federal agencies can be better stewards of our national parks, forests, and wildlife refuges. 
   We require that international family-planning money be used for just that--family planning, not abortion or lobbying to liberalize the abortion laws of other countries. Although the compromise provisions would allow the President to waive the limitations and provide about $15 million to groups that engage in such activity, about 96 percent of the dollars would still remain subject to the restrictions. 
   Of course, funding these various priorities means we had to limit spending in other areas in order to keep our promise not to raid Social Security. For example, the National Endowment for the Arts does not get the increase it sought. There will not be as much foreign aid as President Clinton wanted. We cut the President's Advanced Technology Program. To make doubly sure we keep our pledge to stay out of Social Security, we include a small across-the-board spending cut to force agencies to ferret out waste and abuse. 
   It is hard for me to conceal my disappointment in several regards. First, I regret that Congress did not protect the projected surplus in the non-Social Security part of the budget. This bill, combined with the other appropriations bills that have already been signed into law, will spend the entire $14 billion surplus that was projected in the government's operating budget --excluding Social Security--and it will bust the spending caps Congress and the President agreed to only two years ago. 
   Second, there is still far too much wasteful spending in the budget. 
   And third, there is so much advance funding in the bill for FY2001 that it will be difficult for us to stay within our spending targets for next year. 
   On balance, though, it strikes me that the short-term cost of exceeding the caps and spending the relatively small non-Social Security surplus for this year is more than outweighed by the long-term discipline that will be imposed by the precedent we have set with regard to protecting Social Security. 
   Mr. President, with that in mind, I intend to vote for this bill.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 1887, a bill by Representative GALLEGLY which would prohibit, and set penalties for, knowingly creating, selling, or possessing a depiction of animal cruelty with the intention of placing that depiction in interstate or foreign commerce for commercial gain. 
   I would first like to thank the advocacy groups and individuals who testified at the House Subcommittee on Crime hearing and helped publicize the need for legislation to combat this form of animal cruelty. I would also like to thank Senator HATCH, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, for his help in the passage of H.R. 1887. 
   I recently was informed by Representative GALLEGLY of a growing problem in California involving ``crush'' videos. Much of the material graphically features women stepping on and killing a variety of small animals. The animals are bound to the floor or other materials and are slowly tortured and crushed. When this deplorable practice came to light, Representative GALLEGLY introduced H.R. 1887, which targets the market for these disturbing videos. 
   While the acts of animal cruelty featured in these videos may violate many state animal cruelty laws, they can be difficult to prosecute. For example, prosecutors often cannot prove the date when the acts were performed or the identity of the individual committing the act of cruelty because the person's face is concealed or not filmed. 
   The purpose of H.R. 1887 is to prohibit individuals from profiting from videos depicting animal cruelty if the act depicted is illegal under federal or state law. This bill provides federal law-enforcement officials with a tool to prosecute the individuals making profits from these videos, which can be sold via the Internet and through catalogs for $30 to $100 a piece. Eliminating the videos' commercial incentive will hopefully stem the creation of ``crush'' videos. 
   This bill is important because many studies have shown that abusing animals is often a prosecutor for committing violence against other people. H.R. 1887 may not solve that problem, but it will at least eliminate the market for a truly reprehensible product.

    Mr. KYL. Mr. President, on November 17, 1776 a small American warship, the Andrew Doria, sailed into the harbor of the island of Saint Eustatius in the West Indies. Only 4 months before, the United States had declared its independence from Great Britain. The American crew was delighted when the Governor of the island, Johannes de Graaf, ordered that his fort's cannons be fired in a friendly salute. The first ever given by a foreign power to the flag of the United States, it was a risky and courageous act. The British seized the island a few years later. De Graff's welcoming salute was a sign of respect, and today it continues to symbolize the deep ties of friendship that exist between the United States and the Netherlands. 
   After more than 200 years, the bonds between the United States and the Netherlands remain strong. Our diplomatic ties, in fact, constitute one of the longest unbroken diplomatic relationships with any foreign country. 
   Fifty years ago, during the second world war, American and Dutch men and women fought side by side to defend the cause of freedom and democracy. As NATO allies, we have continued to stand together to keep the transatlantic partnership strong and to maintain the peace and security of Europe. In the Persian Gulf we joined as coalition partners to repel aggression and to uphold the rule of law. 
   While the ties between the United States and the Netherlands have been tested by time and by the crucible of armed conflict, Dutch American Heritage is even older than our official relationship. It dates back to the early seventeenth century, when the Dutch West India Company founded New Netherland and its main settlements, New Amsterdam and Fort Orange--today known as New York City and Albany. 
   From the earliest days of our Republic, men and women of Dutch ancestry have made important contributions to American history and culture. The influence of our Dutch ancestors can still be seen not only in New York's Hudson River Valley but also in communities like Holland, Michigan and Pella, Iowa where many people trace their roots to settlers from the Netherlands. 
   Generations of Dutch immigrants have enriched the United States with the unique customs and traditions of their ancestral homeland--a country that has given the world great artists and celebrated philosophers. 
   On this occasion, we also remember many celebrated American leaders of Dutch descent. Three presidents, Martin Van Buren, Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin D. Roosevelt, came from Dutch stock. 
   Our Dutch heritage is seen not only in our people but also in our experience as a Nation. Our traditions of religious freedom and tolerance, for example, have spiritual and legal roots among such early settlers as the English Pilgrims and the French Huguenots, who first found refuge from persecution in Holland. The Dutch Republic was among those systems of government that inspired our Nation's Founders as they shaped our Constitution. 
   In celebration of the long-standing friendship that exists between the United States and the Netherlands, and in recognition of the many contributions that Dutch Americans have made to our country, we observe Dutch American Heritage Day on November 16. 
   I salute the over eight million Dutch Americans and the sixteen million people of the Netherlands in the celebration of this joyous occasion.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President. I rise in support of the Republican crime amendment (#2771) to the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1999. This amendment takes a multi-faceted approach to combating the problem of drugs. However, I am particularly pleased with the methamphetamine component of the amendment, which will help my own state of Arizona combat a veritable meth epidemic. 
   Arizona law enforcement continues to seize a record number of meth labs. Meth lab seizures are up to 30 percent over last year, with over 400 labs projected to be dismantled by the end of this fiscal year. An average of 26 labs per month are seized--that's almost one lab per day. 
   Meth usage is up, I am sad to report. Phoenix has the second highest rate for meth emergency-room admissions in the United States, according to the Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN). Phoenix also has the second highest percent of arrestees testing positive for meth in the U.S. according to the Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring program (ADAM). 
   Meth prosecutions are up, as well. The number of meth cases prosecuted by the Maricopa County Attorney's office in the first five months of this year was equal to all of the cases prosecuted during 1990. 
   This amendment provides a well-balanced approach to tackling meth by not only increasing penalties for certain meth-related crimes but also providing money to law enforcement (DEA and HIDTAs) for training, personnel, and meth lab cleanups, and providing money for prevention. The amendment also pays special attention to the anti-meth needs of rural communities by providing funding so the DEA can assist rural law enforcement in meth investigations. Many rural counties in my state cannot afford the latest and safest equipment, so they use old and unsafe equipment. Limited personnel and expansive terrain hinder meth-lab seizures. For example, Mohave County law enforcement seized about one lab per week last year and could have seized double that if they had the resources. 
   Because of Arizona's meth problem, I have fought for additional funding for Arizona law enforcement. Last year, I secured $1 million for Arizona law enforcement to use for equipment, personnel, and training in order to combat meth. This was in direct response to a field hearing I held in Phoenix highlighting the problem of meth and meth labs. During the hearing I heard from urban and rural law enforcement on the dangers posed by meth labs as well as their drain on resources. 
   I support this amendment because it will give law enforcement the resources needed to combat the problem of meth in my state.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, as we work through the final days of the legislation session, we are apt to become mired in the details of our work. We can lose sight of the special opportunity we have, as legislators, to represent our fellow citizens and to conduct the business of a democratic society in the Nation's Capital. 
   In this spirit, I wish to draw the Senate's attention to a very special anniversary one that I hope can inspire us to bring our efforts renewed appreciation for our blessings--and our duties--as legislators in the greatest democracy in human history. 
   Ten years ago yesterday, the starkest symbol of human bondage in this century--the Berlin Wall--shook, cracked, and then collapsed. To be sure, it took time for all of it to by physically dismantled. Sections of it still stand, left as symbols all at once of man's capacity for evil and his insatiable drive to be free. But in one magnificent moment 10 years ago, without a shot being fired, people who had only known cold war captivity crossed the line and became free. 
   They were helped across by many hands: by the American people who  served by the millions in uniform and who put up trillions--trillions--of dollars to fight the cold war; by the citizens of NATO and other allied nations who made similar sacrifices of blood and treasure; by many of their fellow countrymen who over many years kept small fires of freedom burning in their hearts for the day when the wall would come down; and, at critical moments, by great leaders. 
   Joseph Shattan, a former White House speech writer and, now, a Bradley Fellow at the Heritage Foundation, has chronicled this leadership in his book ``Architects of Victory: Six Heroes of Cold War,'' published by Heritage, and excerpted recently in essay form in the Washington Times. He describes how six remarkable individuals--Winston Churchill, Harry Truman, Knorad Adenauer, Alexander Solzhenitsyn, Pope John Paul II, and Ronald Reagan--seized their own moment in the cause of freedom. 
   Mr. President, as Americans, we should on this day take special note of the two American Presidents--one Democrat, one Republican, who played such vital roles in bringing about the fall of the Berlin Wall ten years ago. Here is Shattan on Harry Truman:  
   Underlying Truman's policies was the conviction that Soviet totalitarianism was no different than Nazi totalitarianism. In his view, both the Nazis and the communists violated human rights at home and sought to expand their empires abroad. To secure a world where democratic values might flourish, Truman believed the United States had to contain Soviet expansionism--through economic and military aid if possible, through force of arms if necessary. Over the long run, a successful policy of containment would cause Soviet leaders to lose their faith in the inevitability of a global communist triumph. Only then could negotiations with Moscow contribute to a safer, more peaceful world. 
   Because the Truman administration's policy of containment set the course for U.S. foreign policy over the next 35 years, it seems in retrospect to have been a natural, even inevitable, response to Soviet aggressiveness. But it was nothing of the sort. Truman's predecessor, Franklin Roosevelt, had taken a markedly different approach toward Moscow--one aimed at cementing an enduring U.S.-Soviet friendship--and when Truman became president, he was determined to follow in FDR's footsteps, even if it meant ignoring his own instincts. But Truman gradually worked his way out from under FDR's long shadow and placed his own indelible stamp on U.S. foreign policy. 
   Truman's decisive break with FDR's foreign policy came in a historic speech delivered before a joint session of Congress on March 12, 1947. ``I believe it must be the policy of the United States,'' he declared, ``to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures.'' Alonzo Hamby, one of Truman's biographers, rightly called this speech ``the decisive step in what would soon be called the Cold War.''  
   Harry Truman's steadfast commitment to ``free peoples'' assured that the Iron Curtain would encroach no further on freedom. But it took another President to push the Wall over. Here again is Shattan on Ronald Reagan:  
   But while liberals frequently disparaged Mr. Reagan's intellect, the fact was that he subscribed wholeheartedly to one major truth that many of his intellectually sophisticated critics either never knew or had forgotten: Societies that encourage freedom and creativity tend to flourish, while societies that suppress liberty tend to stagnate. This was the central truth around which Ronald Reagan fashioned his political career. This was the crucial insight that he articulated with passion and eloquence and pursued with iron resolve. And this was the basis of his Soviet strategy. 
   Underlying Mr. Reagan's approach to the Soviet Union was his profound (his critics would say ``childlike'' or ``simplistic'') faith in freedom. Mr. Reagan simply knew that there was no way a closed society like the Soviet Union could prevail against an open society like the United States once the open society made up its mind to win. And Mr. Reagan, years before he became president, decided that the United States would win the Cold War ..... The military buildup, the support of anti-communist movements worldwide (better known as the ``Reagan Doctrine''), the Strategic Defense Initiative, the covert assistance to the Polish trade union Solidarity, the economic sanctions against Moscow--all were meant to force an already shaky Soviet system to embark on a course of radical reform. These reforms (perestroika, glasnost) soon acquired a momentum of their own, and eventually brought down the Soviet Union. 
   Mr. Reagan's approach to foreign policy was unprecedented. The traditional U.S. strategy was to seek to contain Soviet power and hope that, at some unspecified point in the future, containment would convince the communist ruling class to abandon its expansionist course. By contrast, Mr. Reagan sought not merely to contain the Soviets but to overwhelm them with demonstrations of U.S. power and resolve that left them with no alternative but to accept the choice he offered them: Change or face defeat. 
   His success proved that great leadership does not depend on intellectual or historical sophistication. What is needed, above all, is the right set of convictions and the courage to stand by them. Mr. Reagan's beliefs about freedom and tyranny were uniquely rooted in the American experience, and his courage reflected the quiet self-confidence of the American heartland. His was truly a U.S. presidency that changed the world.  
   Much has changed in 10 years. Yes, we still have walls to tear down--on the Demilitarized Zone in Korea, around the island of Cuba, and everywhere that people around the globe still struggle for peace and freedom. But the Cold War is over. Freedom won. As we watch the many celebrations underway today--in Berlin, all over Europe, and elsewhere in the world--let us honor Cold War heroes, and rededicate ourselves to the cause of freedom they championed. And, my colleagues, as we conduct the people's business, let us seek to renew an abiding reverence for the freedom that brings us here.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts released a report in August that included some good news and some bad. On the one hand, the report indicated that bankruptcy filings for the 12-month period ending June 30, 1999 were down, albeit slightly--about 0.3 percent. On the other hand, it noted that the number of petitions filed still represented a 62.2 percent increase over the same period ending in 1995. 
   Extraordinary circumstances can strike anyone, which is why it is important to preserve access to bankruptcy relief. No one disputes that there should be an opportunity to seek relief and a fresh start when someone is struck by terrible circumstances beyond his or her control--for example, when families are torn apart by divorce or ill health. I suspect that creditors would be more than willing to work with someone when such tragedy strikes to help him or her through tough times. 
   But there is a good deal of evidence that too many people who file for relief under Chapter 7 actually have the ability to pay back some, or even all, of what they owe. Inappropriate use of Chapter 7, or straight bankruptcy, imposes higher costs on the vast majority of consumers who make good on their obligations. The Justice Department estimates these costs at about $3.2 billion annually. This phenomenon of bankruptcy for the sake of convenience--bankruptcy as a financial planning tool--is what led to the drafting of the bill before us today. 
   The Bankruptcy Reform Act, S. 625, is the product of a number of hearings, and months and months of deliberations. This bill has been in the legislative process for several years now. It enjoys broad bipartisan support, having been approved overwhelmingly by the Senate Judiciary Committee on a vote of 14 to 4. In fact, similar bipartisan legislation in the House of Representatives passed on May 5, by a lopsided vote of 313 to 108--an even greater margin than last year. 
   The bill would establish a presumption that a chapter 7 bankruptcy filing--what is generally known as straight bankruptcy--should be dismissed or should be converted to Chapter 13 if, after taking into account secured debts and priority debts like child support and living expenses, the debtor could repay 25 percent or more of his or her general unsecured debt, or $15,000, over a five-year period. The debtor could rebut the presumption by demonstrating special circumstances to show that he or she does not have a meaningful ability to repay his or her debts. 
   I suspect that most Americans would be surprised to find that this is not already the norm. At the moment, bankruptcy judges do not necessarily consider whether a debtor has a demonstrable capacity to repay his or her debts before granting Chapter 7 relief. 
   Studies suggest that this means test we propose here would force between three percent and 15 percent of debtors to pay more to creditors. This represents a relatively small number of debtors, but they are the ones who have the means to repay, and fairness dictates that they do so. 
   In short, the bill would steer individuals with the ability to repay some or all of their debts into Chapter 13 repayment plans, while preserving access to Chapter 7 for those who truly need its protection and the fresh start it would provide. This is a reasonable and balanced approach. 
   Remember, when people run up debts they have no intention of paying, they shift a greater financial burden onto honest, hard-working families in America. Estimates are that bankruptcy costs every American family more than $400 a year. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers acknowledged as much during a recent hearing before the Finance Committee. When asked whether debt discharged in bankruptcy results in higher prices for goods and services as businesses have to offset losses, here is what he said:  
   Certainly there is a strong tendency in that direction, and also towards higher interest rates for other borrowers who are going to pay back their debt.  
   So when we hear opponents of the bill talk of their concern for consumers, let us remember the cost that the abuse of bankruptcy law imposes on the vast majority of consumers who responsibly abide by their obligations and pay back their debts. What we have here is really the most pro-consumer bill we will consider this year.

   Mr. KYL. I want to stop at this point and single out a few provisions of the bill for comment. These are provisions that I believe illustrate the deficiencies in current law--provisions that demonstrate why this legislation represents common sense reform of the bankruptcy system. 
   The first provision appears in Section 314 of the bill and provides that debts that are fraudulently incurred could no longer be discharged in Chapter 13--the same as in Chapter 7. Again, I think most Americans would be surprised to find out that this is not already the law. 
   Currently, at the conclusion of a Chapter 13 plan, a debtor is eligible for a broader discharge than is available in Chapter 7, and this superdischarge can result in several types of debts, including those for fraud and intentional torts, being discharged whereas they could not be discharged in Chapter 7. The language of the bill tracks an amendment I offered last year, and would simply add fraudulent debts to the list of debts that are nondischargeable under Chapter 13. It is as simple as that. 
   Here is what the Deputy Associate Attorney General, Francis M. Allegra, said about the dichargeability of fraudulent debts in a letter dated June 19, 1997:  
   We are unconvinced that providing a (fresh start) under Chapter 13 superdischarge to those who commit fraud or whose debts result from other forms of misconduct is desirable as a policy matter.  
   Here is what Judge Edith Jones of Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals said in a dissenting opinion to the report of the Bankruptcy Review Commission:  
   The superdischarge satisfies no justifiable social policy and only encourages the use of Chapter 13 by embezzlers, felons, and tax dodgers.  
   Judith Starr, the Assistant Chief of the Litigation Counsel Division of Enforcement of the Securities and Exchange Commission, testified before the House Judiciary Committee on March 18, 1998. Speaking about the fraud issue, she said:  
   We believe that, in enacting the Bankruptcy Code, Congress never intended to extend the privilege of the ``fresh start'' to those who lie, cheat, and steal from the public.  
   She goes on to say:  
   A fair consumer bankruptcy system should help honest but unfortunate debtors get their financial affairs back in order by providing benefits and protections that will help the honest to the exclusion of the dishonest, and not vice versa. It is an anomaly of the current system that bankruptcy is often more attractive to persons who commit fraud than to their innocent victims. Bankruptcy should not be a refuge for those who have committed intentional wrongs, nor should it encourage gamesmanship by failing to provide real consequences for abuse of its protections.  
   And she concludes:  
   We support [the provision of the House bill] which makes fraud debts nondischargeable in Chapter 13 cases. Inducements to file under Chapter 13 rather than Chapter 7 should be aimed at honest debtors, not at those who have committed fraud.  
   A final quotation: The Honorable Heidi Heitkamp, the Attorney General of North Dakota, testified to the following before the House Committee last year:  
   When a true ``bad actor'' is in the picture--a scam artist, a fraudulent telemarketer, a polluter who stubbornly refuses to clean up the mess he has created there is a real potential for bankruptcy to become a serious impediment to protecting our citizenry.  
   Furthermore, she says:  
   We must all be concerned because bankruptcy is, in many ways, a challenge to the normal structure of a civilized society. The economy functions based on the assumption that debts will be paid, that laws will be obeyed, that order to incur costs to comply with statutory obligations will be complied with, and that monetary penalties for failure to comply will apply and will ``sting.'' If those norms can be ignored with impunity, and with little or no future consequences for the debtor, this bodes poorly for the ability of society to continue to enforce those requirements.  
   Mr. President, I hope there will be no dissent to these anti-fraud provisions. Certainly, there should not be. Bankruptcy relief should be available to people who work hard and play by rules, yet fall unexpectedly upon hard times. Perpetrators of fraud should not be allowed to find safe haven in the bankruptcy code. 
   The second amendment I offered, which was included in last year's bill, and which is again in this year's bill, is also found in Section 314. It says that debts that are incurred to pay non-dischargeable debts are themselves non-dischargeable. In other words, if someone borrows money to pay a debt that cannot be erased in bankruptcy, that new debt could not be erased either. The idea is to prevent individuals from gaming the system and obtaining a discharge of debt that would otherwise be non-dischargeable. 
   I want to emphasize that we have taken special care to ensure that debts incurred to pay non-dischargeable debts will not compete with non-dischargeable child- or family-support in a post-bankruptcy environment. 
   The third amendment of mine is reflected in Section 310 of the bill, and it is intended to discourage people from running up large debts on the eve of bankruptcy, particularly when 
   they have no ability or intention of making good on their obligations. 
   Current law effectively gives unscrupulous debtors a green light to run up their credit cards just before filing for bankruptcy, knowing they will never be liable for the charges they are incurring. That is wrong, and it has got to stop. 
   The provision would establish a presumption that consumer debt run up on the eve of bankruptcy is non-dischargeable. The provision is not self-executing. In other words, it would still require that a lawsuit be brought by the creditor against the debtor so that a bankruptcy judge could consider the circumstances and assess the claim. But if this provision achieves the intended purpose, debtors will not only minimize the run-up of additional debt, they will have more money available after bankruptcy to pay priority obligations, including alimony and child support. 
   Again, special care has been taken to ensure that we are only talking about  consumer debts incurred within 90 days of bankruptcy for goods or services that are not necessary for the maintenance or support of the debtor or dependent child. We want to be sure that family obligations are met. 
   I will discuss one other aspect of the bill before closing, and that relates to the many provisions that Senators HATCH, GRASSLEY, and I crafted last year--and which have been improved on in this year's bill--to protect the interests of women and children. 
   Nothing in the earlier versions of the bill reduced the priority of, or any of the protections that are accorded to, child-support and alimony under current law. Nevertheless, concerns were expressed that provisions of the legislation might indirectly or even inadvertently affect ex-spouses and children of divorce. Assuming that critics were operating in good faith--and because our intent was always to ensure that family obligations were met first--Senators HATCH, GRASSLEY, and I crafted an amendment last year to remove any doubt whatsoever about whether women and children come first. 
   As now written, the bill elevates the priority of child-support from its current number seven on the priority list for purposes of payment to number one. Our amendment mandates that all child support and alimony be paid before all other obligations in a Chapter 13 plan. It conditions both confirmation and discharge of a Chapter 13 plan upon complete payment of all child support and alimony that is due before and after the bankruptcy petition is filed. It helps women and children reach exempt property and collect support payments notwithstanding contrary federal or state law. And it extends the protection accorded an ex-spouse by making almost all obligations one ex-spouse owes to the other non-dischargeable. 
   Many of us have heard the argument by opponents of this bill that women and children will be forced to compete with credit-card companies to collect resources from debtors, particularly once they emerge from bankruptcy. The provisions I just described answer that concern. Moreover, I think it is important to point out that the post-discharge debtor generally does not have the option to pay a credit-card company before his or her former spouse anyway. More and more child support is withheld from wages by the state. In other words, child support obligations are paid before the non-custodial parent or former spouse ever receives his or her paycheck. If withholding is not in place when the bankruptcy is filed, it can be put in place quickly under other provisions of the pending bill. 
   If any of these provisions can be improved on further, I know that Senators HATCH and GRASSLEY, and myself would be more than willing to modify them. My concern is that we do not allow concern for women and children to become an excuse for opposing the broader bill and letting other debtors off the hook for debts they are able to repay. That would only hurt women and children in need by forcing them to bear the higher costs associated with such bankruptcy abuse. 
   Mr. President, this is a good bill--a bill that protects debtors who truly need relief, while also protecting the interests of consumers who meet their obligations to creditors by repaying their debts. It protects the interests of women and children through a series of new provisions. I hope my colleagues will join me in voting for this fair and balanced piece of legislation. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.

    Mr. KYL. Mr. President, Friday's Washington Post contained an excellent op-ed piece by columnist Charles Krathammer arguing that, contrary to claims now being made by senior Clinton Administration officials, the recent defeat of the Comprehensive Test Bank Treaty is not evidence of an emerging isolationist trend in the Republican party. I ask that the column be printed in the RECORD.

   Mr. KYL. John Chafee was a gentleman with every quality that term connotes. He always treated everyone with the utmost respect. He was unfailingly courteous to everyone. I never heard him utter a bad word  about anyone. He took his job very seriously, but he did not take himself seriously. He always evaluated proposals, first asking what his constituents would think about them. He always sought to accommodate me, personally. I recall the last request I made of him to break some precedents and quickly get a bill through to name a U.S. courthouse in Phoenix for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor because we did have to break some precedents in order to accomplish that. He did it with no problem whatever. 
   Others have detailed his considerable service to this country, and I will not repeat that. However, it runs the gamut from military service to service in the Senate and much, much more. 
   I simply want to recall John Chafee, the marine, the gentleman. If every one of us in this Chamber comported ourselves as Senator Chafee did, the Senate would be a much better place. That is a legacy that any person, I believe, would be proud to have. It is John Chafee's legacy. He will be missed. But he will be remembered. 
   God bless John Chafee and his family.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the arguments against the Partial-Birth Abortion Act keep changing. During previous consideration, for example, we heard from proponents of the procedure that it was used in only rare and tragic cases, so it would be wrong to ban it. Here is how the Planned Parenthood Federation of America characterized partial-birth abortion in a November 1, 1995 news release: ``The procedure, dilation and extraction (D&X), is extremely rare and done only in cases when the woman's life is in danger or in cases of extreme fetal abnormality.'' Planned Parenthood was not the only group to make such sweeping statements at the time. 
   But it did not take long for the story to unravel. On February 26, 1997, the New York Times reported that Ron Fitzsimmons, executive director of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers, admitted he ``lied in earlier statements when he said [partial-birth abortion] is rare and performed primarily to save the lives or fertility of women bearing severely malformed babies.'' According to the Times, ``He  now says the procedure is performed far more often than his colleagues have acknowledged, and on healthy women bearing healthy fetuses.'' 
   Mr. Fitzsimmons told American Medical News the same thing--that is, the vast majority of these abortions are performed in the 20-plus week range on healthy fetuses and healthy mothers. He said, ``The abortion rights folks know it, the anti-abortion folks know it, and so, probably, does everyone else.'' 
   We heard about the frequency of the procedure from doctors who performed it. The Record of Bergen County, New Jersey, published an investigative report revealing that far more of these abortions were performed in New Jersey and across the country than the abortion lobby wanted Americans to believe. 
   Now, after the truth is exposed, we see an advertising campaign by a group called the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy, claiming that it is the legislation that is deceptive and extreme. The claim is that the bill would prohibit ``some of the safest and most commonly used medical procedures and risk the health and well-being of women.'' Apparently out of convenience, opponents have now flipped their argument and claim the procedure is common, not rare at all--which is what supporters of the legislation contended all along. 
   On the issue of safety, they have been more consistent. They claim the procedure is safe, but here is what the former Surgeon General of the United States, Dr. C. Everett Koop, had to say on the subject. According to Dr. Koop, ``partial-birth abortion is never medically necessary to protect a mother's health or future fertility. On the contrary, this procedure can pose a significant threat to both.'' A threat to health and fertility. 
   We heard the same thing from other medical experts during hearings in the Judiciary Committee a few years ago. Dr. Nancy Romer, a practicing Ob-Gyn from Ohio, testified that in her 13 years of experience, she never felt compelled to recommend this procedure to save a woman's life. ``In fact,'' she said, ``if a woman has a serious, life threatening, medical condition this procedure has a significant disadvantage in that it takes three days.'' 
   Even Dr. Warren Hern, the author of the nation's most widely used textbook on abortion standards and procedures, is quoted in the November 20, 1995 edition of American Medical News as saying that he would ``dispute any statement that this is the safest procedure to use.'' He called it ``potentially dangerous'' to a woman to turn a fetus to a breech position, as occurs during a partial-birth abortion. Dangerous, Mr. President. 
   The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists was quoted by Charles Krauthammer in a March 14, 1997 column as indicating that there are ``no circumstances under which this procedure would be the only option to save the life of the mother and preserve the health of the woman.'' 
   And of course, the American Medical Association (AMA), on the eve of the Senate vote during the 105th Congress, endorsed the bill to ban the technique. According to the chairman of the AMA's board of trustees, ``it is a procedure which is never the only appropriate procedure and has no history in peer reviewed medical literature or in accepted medical practice development.'' 
   To those who call the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act extreme, I ask: Is it extreme to want to ban a procedure that medical experts tell us is dangerous and threatening to women? Or are the extremists those who are so radically pro-abortion that they defend even a such a dangerous and threatening procedure? 
   What about those rarest of instances when it might be necessary to use this dangerous procedure to save a woman's life? Those are provided for, despite what President Clinton said when he vetoed the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act on October 13, 1997. He said he did so because the bill did not contain an exception that ``will adequately protect the lives and health of the small group of women in tragic circumstances who need an abortion performed 
   at a late stage of pregnancy to avert death or serious injury.'' 
   Let me read the language of the bill that was vetoed. This is language from the bill's proposed section 1531. The ban, and I am quoting, ``shall not apply to a partial-birth abortion that is necessary to save the life of a mother whose life is endangered by a physical disorder, illness, or injury.'' Identical language providing a life-of-the-mother exception appears in this year's version of the bill, S. 1629, as well. I do not know how the language can be any clearer. 
   Mr. President, another charge now being made against this bill is that it is unconstitutional. Of course, we all can speculate about how the U.S. Supreme Court might rule on the matter. The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals recently struck down partial-birth abortion bans in Nebraska, Iowa, and Arkansas, but a three-judge panel from the Fourth Circuit stayed an injunction against a similar Virginia law, pending review by the full court. The Fourth Circuit has yet to rule, but observers expect it to uphold the Virginia ban. 
   Ultimately, the U.S. Supreme Court is going to have to rule on the question, given the differing Circuit Court decisions. And as Harvard Law School Professor Lawrence Tribe noted in a November 6, 1995 letter to Senator BOXER, there are various reasons ``why one cannot predict with confidence how the Supreme Court as currently composed would rule if confronted with [the bill].'' He noted that the Court has not had any such law before it. And he noted that ``although the Court did grapple in 1986 with the question of a state's power to put the health and survival of a viable fetus above the medical needs of the mother, it has never directly addressed a law quite like [the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act].'' 
   Mr. President, neither Roe v. Wade nor any subsequent Supreme Court case has ever held that taking the life of a child during the birth process is a constitutionally protected practice. In fact, the Court specifically noted in Roe that a Texas statute--one which made the killing of a child during the birth process a felony--had not been challenged. That portion of the law is still on the books in Texas today. 
   Remember what we are talking about here: ``an abortion in which the person performing the abortion partially vaginally delivers a living fetus before killing the fetus and completing the delivery.'' That is the definition of a partial-birth abortion in the pending legislation. 
   So we are talking about a child whose body, save for his or her head, has been delivered from the mother--that is, only the head remains unborn. No matter what legal issues are involved, I hope no one will forget that we are talking about a live child who is already in the birth canal and indeed has been partially delivered. 
   I dare say that, even if the Court were somehow to find that a partially delivered child is not constitutionally protected, the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act could still be upheld under Roe and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey. Under both Roe and Casey, the government may prohibit abortion after viability, except when necessary to protect the life or health of the mother. But the exception would never arise here because, as the experts tell us, this procedure is never medically necessary. 
   Although I believe the law would be upheld by the Court, I will concede that no one can say with certainty how the Supreme Court will rule until it has ruled. Until then, I suggest that we not use that as an excuse to avoid doing what we believe is right. 
   The facts are on the table. The bill includes a life-of-the-mother exception--an exception that would probably never be invoked given that medical experts tell us a partial-birth abortion is never necessary to protect the life or health of a woman, and indeed may even pose a danger to life and health. Let us do what is right and put a stop to what our colleague, Senator DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN, has appropriately characterized as infanticide. Let us pass this bill.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, Congress has no greater responsibility than to ensure that our Armed Forces--the guardians of the freedoms which all Americans cherish so dearly--are given the resources they need to carry out their mission. Consequently, the Defense Appropriations bill is one of the most important pieces of legislation that we pass each year. 
   As others have expressed, this is by no means a perfect piece of legislation. There are a number of items contained in this bill that do not meet the most urgent needs of the Armed Forces. At a time when the men and women who serve in uniform are being called upon to serve the interests of the United States in a growing number of places--Bosnia, Kosovo, Haiti, Iraq, and the list goes on--Congress must ensure that the most critical needs of the Armed Forces are met first. 
   However, I believe that the strengths of this conference report outweigh its faults. The report does contain funding to address a growing number of readiness and quality-of-life issues currently challenging our military. Our men and women in uniform need to know that their Congress supports them, and voting for this conference report is one way to demonstrate that support. 
   So, Mr. President, although I believe that Congress can always do a better job of directing defense dollars where they are most needed, I also I believe that there is much in this conference report that addresses critical needs of the military, and that is why I voted in favor of the report.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes today to correct some misconceptions about the reasons why the Senate voted to reject the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Wednesday, and the impact its rejection will have on efforts to control the spread of nuclear weapons. 
   Some have asserted that the Senate acted to reject the treaty for partisan political reasons. At the same time, they threatened grave political consequences for those who opposed the treaty. Obviously, there is a lot more politics in the aftermath of the treaty's rejection (by supporters) than in its not popular, but principled rejection. Simply put, Senators voted to defeat the treaty because it jeopardized our nation's security by undermining the U.S. nuclear deterrent that has served our country so well for the past 50 years. 
   Nor was this evidence that Republicans are isolationist, as the President charged. It is Republicans who support free trade agreements (rather than the President's party, which is dominated by labor union isolationism). And Republicans strongly supported NATO expansion. 
   Our distinguished colleague, Senator LUGAR, summed up the case against the CTBT quite well stating,  
   I do not believe that the CTBT is of the same caliber as the arms control treaties that have come before the Senate in recent decades. Its usefulness to the goal of non-proliferation is highly questionable. Its likely ineffectuality will risk undermining support and confidence in the concept of multi-lateral arms control. Even as a symbolic statement of our desire for a safer world, it is problematic because it would exacerbate risks and uncertainties related to the safety of our nuclear stockpile.  
   The majority leader and other opponents of this treaty never asked Members to vote against it for reasons of party loyalty. Rather, Senators were persuaded to reject the treaty by the facts about its effect on our security. In fact, Republican Senators were on both sides of this issue, while Democrats paradoxically, voted lockstep, except for Senator BYRD, who voted present. 
   Unfortunately, the President and the Democratic leader have asserted that the process for consideration of the treaty was unfair, and have implied they were forced to vote on the treaty. With all due respect, these assertions strike me as nothing more than sour grapes. Let's review the history that brought us to the vote yesterday. 
   For 2 years, the President and other supporters of the CTBT called on the Senate to take up the treaty. 
   In his State of the Union Address in 1998, President Clinton called for it to be taken up ``this year.''  
   In June 1998, President Clinton said it was ``important that the Senate debate and vote on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty without delay.'' 
   On August 9 of this year, the President asked ``the full Senate to vote for ratification as soon as possible.'' 
   On April 1 of this year, Secretary of State Albright gave a speech calling for action on the CTBT, ``this year, this session, now.'' 
   And some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle were quite outspoken in calling for a vote on the treaty. In 1998, the Democratic leader, Senator DASCHLE said on the Senate floor that ``We believe that it's important for us to move this very important treaty this year.'' And just over 2 weeks ago, he stood on the Senate floor and said, ``I still think, one way or the other, we ought to get to this treaty, get it on the floor, debate it, and vote on it.'' 
   And as we all know, it was the threat to bring the business of the Senate to a halt that led the majority leader to offer a unanimous consent agreement on the CTBT. On September 8--with 22 days remaining in the fiscal year to dispose of the remaining appropriations bills--Senator DORGAN said the following:  
   When [the majority leader] comes to the floor, I intend to come to the floor and ask him when he intends to bring this treaty to the floor. If he and others decide it will not come to the floor, I intend to plant myself on the floor like a potted plant and object. I intend to object to other routine business of the Senate until this country decides to accept the moral leadership that is its obligation and bring this treaty to the floor for a debate and a vote.  
   Supporters of the CTBT clearly wanted a vote on the treaty; it now turns out they actually only wanted a vote if they could win. Well, that's not the way it works. 
   I have also been surprised that some Senators have complained that the time for consideration of the treaty was too short. Let's remember that the time-frame for consideration of the treaty was established by unanimous consent. In fact, the majority leader first offered a unanimous-consent agreement on September 30. The Democratic leader objected to that first request, asking for it to be modified to add more time--4 more hours of general debate, and up to 8 hours for amendments (in addition to the 10 hours already allocated). The majority leader accommodated the Democratic request, and on October 1, a modified version of the unanimous-consent request was again offered, and not a single Senator objected either to the time or to the date. The latter is also important, because setting the date for the vote on October 12 or 13 (it occurred on the 13th) meant there were almost 2 weeks for ``education'' of Senators who had not already become educated on the treaty. (Presumably those who were fomenting consideration of the treaty had taken the time to familiarize themselves with it. They can hardly argue they needed more time in view of their insistence.) 
   In any event, we all agreed on a time-table to take up the treaty. This is why I am disappointed that some have charged that the majority leader scheduled the vote out of some sense of partisanship. If Members had a concern about the time frame for the treaty's consideration, any single Senator could have objected--but none did. And the week after the agreement, three Senate committees held hours of hearings. Responsible Senators had plenty of time to learn enough to make an informed decision, witness the early expression of support by those who said others needed more time (i.e., those who didn't agree with them). 
   I am also disappointed by assertions that, by rejecting the CTBT, the United States Senate has diminished America's moral authority in the fight against nuclear proliferation. I deeply regret that this sentiment has been echoed, and to some degree instigated, by Members of this body and the administration who find 
   themselves on the losing side of the debate. 
   Nothing could be further from the truth. By rejecting this deeply flawed accord, the Senate has anchored the United States firmly on the moral high ground. 
   My vote against this treaty rested on three premises: 
   First, we must be able to test if we are to maintain safe and reliable nuclear weapons because they help to secure peace for American citizens and for the rest of the world. 
   Second, this unenforceable, unverifiable treaty would have little if any impact on the problem of proliferation. In fact, it might actually cause more nations to seek nuclear weapons if they became unsure of the reliability of the U.S. nuclear umbrella. 
   It is vitally important that our Nation pursue efforts to combat nuclear proliferation. But we should pursue meaningful efforts with real effects. Unfortunately, while criticizing treaty opponents of not being serious about proliferation, it is the Clinton administration that has not been willing to take serious actions to combat proliferation. For example, in 1997, when reports began to surface about Russian missile assistance to Iran, I led a group of 99 Members of the House and Senate, in writing to the President to urge him to invoke sanctions to halt this trade. The President refused. In November 1997, the Senate unanimously passed a concurrent resolution that I sponsored, expressing the sense of the Congress that the President should sanction the Russian organizations involved in selling missile technology to Iran. The House also passed this resolution overwhelmingly by a vote of 414 to 8. Again the President refused to impose sanctions. 
   The Congress tried again to spur the administration to action 6 months later, when we passed the Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act mandating sanctions on any organization involved in assisting Iran's missile program. This bill passed the Senate by a vote of 90 to 4. Yet when it reached the President's desk, he vetoed the bill. As these examples show, this administration is simply not willing to take the tough actions necessary to prevent proliferation. It is these meaningful measures that will reduce proliferation, not an unenforceable, unverifiable treaty. 
   The third and final reason I voted against the CTBT is that the Constitution establishes the Senate as co-equal with the President in committing this country to treaties. I take this responsibility seriously, and will not simply rubber-stamp any arms control agreement that does not meet at least minimum standards--and this one does not. Rejection will help future negotiators insist on meaningful provisions that are verifiable and enforceable. 
   Each of these premises is morally sound; in my view they are morally superior than a vote for this flawed pact, no matter how well-intentioned. 
   Because this treaty would have harmed our security, its ratification would have been an abdication of our moral responsibility to maintain peace through strength. In 1780, President George Washington said, ``There is nothing so likely to produce peace as to be well prepared to meet an enemy.'' Two hundred years later, President Ronald Reagan called this doctrine ``Peace Through Strength.'' History has redeemed the judgment of Ronald Reagan in first adopting this stance with the Soviet Union; I believe that history will redeem the rejection of the CTBT as well.

   Mr. KYL. If I could complete my answer to the Senator, which is that this treaty, pursuant to a request by the minority, had 14 hours associated with it, plus 4 hours per amendment, if there were amendments offered. There was an amendment offered on the Democratic side. The Democratic side used 2 hours allotted to them for that. The Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty had 6 hours, compared to 14 for the CTBT. The START Treaty had 9 1/2 hours, about 6 hours less. The START II Treaty had 6 hours, and the CFE Flank Agreement, 2 hours. So every one of these treaties ended up having less time than the CTBT allotted for debate on the floor. 
   All of last week was consumed by hearings in the Intelligence Committee, the Foreign Relations Committee, and the Senate Armed Services Committee; I don't know how many hours total. Prior to that time, the Government Operations Committee had three separate hearings. That is the specific answer to the Senator's question.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to discuss a matter that will severely affect milk producers and processors in my state of Arizona and impede their ability to compete effectively in the state of Nevada. Under the Secretary's final rule, Arizona and Clark County, Nevada, make up one of the 11 consolidated Federal Milk Marketing Order Areas. During consideration of the Agriculture Appropriations bill, a provision was agreed to in the Senate by voice vote that attempted to remove Clark County, Nevada from this proposed order. I say attempted because the drafting of this language was fatally flawed. It would not have achieved its intended goal of allowing Nevada to remove itself from the system. Of course, the Nevada Senators realized this mistake and moved to amend the language in conference. I notified the committee, both in writing and orally, that I objected to any attempt to amend or modify the Senate-passed language. Unfortunately, the language change sought by the Nevada Senators was approved, and is now found in Section 760 of the Agriculture Appropriations bill of FY 2000. 
   Section 760 creates, for the first time in nearly 75 years of federal milk-price  regulation, a category of milk handler which is statutorily exempt from milk-price regulation. Anderson Dairy--the sole processor in Clark County--will gain a tremendous competitive advantage from this exemption at the expense of the Arizona dairy industry. Allowing Anderson to be removed from the Arizona/Nevada order will make it the only milk processor with sales in Clark County that enjoys a regulatory exemption. But its competitors--such as the Arizona processors--will continue to be regulated on all Clark County sales, which make up approximately 20 percent of their market. In other words, Anderson will be able to price its milk well below that of the Arizona processors who remain subject to the pricing structure of the milk-order system. 
   Moreover, this statutory exemption will extend to Anderson Dairy sales outside of Clark County. Anderson Dairy would, therefore, enjoy a commercial advantage in its sales in Arizona while its competitors would continue to be regulated on all such sales. 
   A good argument can be made in support of a milk industry that is free from pricing regulations; however, that is not the case today. Competitive equity has been the foundation of Federal Milk Orders for over one-half century. Under 7 U.S.C. 608(c)(5)(A), handlers are subject to the same uniform classified prices as their competitors, and under  608(c)(5)(B)(ii), revenue from handlers is pooled and blended so that producers may benefit from ``uniform prices'' irrespective of handler use of milk. 
   Section 760 of the FY 2000 Agriculture Appropriations bill strikes at the heart of each component of regulatory equity by exempting the Clark County handler from the uniform price and economic standards applicable to competitors within the order, and by excluding from the producer-revenue pool all revenue from milk sales to the plant. For the plant operators in Arizona who continue to operate under price regulation, competing against an exempt plant such as Anderson is like fencing with your sword arm tied behind your back. Anderson can exploit its commercial advantage by expanding sales to current or prospective customers of nonexempt handlers. Such expansion would, in the end, severely harm Arizona producers. 
   Mr. President, legislative exemption for Clark County plants should greatly enhance Anderson's asset value for acquisition purposes. Several national and international dairy companies have aggressively expanded their operations in the United States during the past few years. These include Dean, Suiza, and Parmalat. A price-exempt plant in the nation's fastest growing major metropolitan area would be very attractive to any expanding dairy enterprise. Should this occur, the producers and processors in Arizona would be negatively impacted. 
   Having one state subject to the pricing structure of the milk-order system and another, contiguous state free to set its own price creates an uneven playing field. When Anderson is granted the right of removal from a system created to maintain stability and equity within that region, we have effectively undermined the intent of that system. 
   Some 56 years ago, U.S. Appellate Judge Frank lamented that ``the domestication of milk has not been accompanied by a successful domestication of some of the meaner impulses in all those engaged in the milk industry.'' Queensboro v. Wickard, 137 F. 2d 969 (1943). Regional preferences and exemptions will only fuel these cynical impulses. I hope we can find a way to rectify this egregious situation and maintain a level playing field for the Arizona milk industry.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, earlier today, the Senator from Illinois claimed that President Bush supported a moratorium on nuclear testing. This assertion is inaccurate.

   Mr. KYL. I emphasize the following excerpt from President Bush's statement:  
   Despite the dramatic reductions in nuclear arsenals, the United States continues to rely on nuclear deterrence as an essential element of our national security. We must ensure that our forces are as safe and reliable as possible. To do so, we must continue to conduct a minimal number of underground nuclear tests, regardless of the actions of other countries.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to explain why I intend to vote against the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). I think that the words of President Ronald Reagan serve as the most appropriate and powerful way to begin this discussion. President Reagan frequently reminded us, ``We must always remain strong, so that we will always be free.'' The first question we must ask ourselves as we consider this vote is whether the CTBT jeopardizes the strength that the American people have relied upon for 50 years to ensure that this Nation remains free and at peace. Unfortunately, after careful consideration, I have concluded that the CTBT does jeopardize our strength by causing real harm to the very backbone of America's security--its safe, reliable, and credible, nuclear deterrent. 
   Some of my colleagues have argued that the Senate should postpone final action on the CTBT, that defeating the treaty today sends the wrong message to the world, that somehow the Senate would be signaling to rogue states and others that the United States thinks it is acceptable to develop nuclear weapons. I could not disagree more. The Senate will reject this treaty because it harms America's nuclear deterrent and because it does nothing meaningful to ensure that the spread of nuclear weapons is halted. Regardless of the outcome of the CTBT vote, the world should know that this Senate remains committed to preventing the spread of nuclear weapons, and that we will continue to support the strongest possible actions against proliferant states. 
   Nor should the rest of the world misinterpret another aspect of the Senate's rejection of the CTBT. The main message of the Senate's action today is that our constitutional democracy, with its cherished checks and balances, is alive and well. Through the wisdom of our Founding Fathers, the Constitution makes the treaty-making power a shared power. The Senate, through its obligation to provide advice and consent to treaties, acts as the ``quality control mechanism'' to ensure that the President does not bind the Nation to an international commitment that is not in its best interests. Before the United States is bound by the terms of an international agreement such as the CTBT, the President and the Senate must both agree to its terms. In rejecting the CTBT, the Senate is sending an explicit message that the United States does not have an international legal obligation to adhere to the provisions of the treaty. If the President were to determine that the United States must conduct tests to ensure the safety or reliability of our nuclear arsenal, the United States would be entitled to do so. 
   Perhaps most importantly, the Senate's rejection of the CTBT will send a clear message that the United States will not sign up to flawed treaties that are not in the nation's interest. And the men and women who represent the United States in international negotiations will know that when they stand up to negotiating partners in order to protect America's interests in future treaty negotiations, the Senate will not only support them, it will expect them to forcefully advocate a position that protects those interests. 
   Supporters of the CTBT would have the American people believe that to cast a vote against the treaty is merely a political act designed to embarrass the President. I do not see how anyone who has actually watched the Senate's careful deliberations--both in its committees and the floor--in recent weeks can honestly reach such a conclusion. I think that what the Senate had done through its thorough hearings and floor debate is to demonstrate beyond any reasonable doubt that this treaty faces certain defeat because of the substantive arguments against it that have been persuasively been presented to this body. The 
   inescapable fact about the CTBT is that it is a fatally flawed treaty--it jeopardizes this Nation's nuclear deterrent, it will not contribute to the cause of nonproliferation, and it is unverifiable and unenforceable. 
   Although these arguments have already been made in depth here on the floor, they bear reinforcement as Senators prepare to cast their votes. 
   First, the CTBT threatens the Nation's nuclear deterrent--the very backbone of America's security for the past 50 years. To have an effective nuclear deterrent, we must have absolute confidence in the safety and reliability of our nuclear weapons. This requires periodic nuclear tests to ensure that we understand, for example, the effects of aging on our weapons and the best way to mitigate those effects. Again, as with the maintenance of any complex weapon, we must be able to test, to detect technical or safety problems that arise in our nuclear stockpile. 
   The administration's Stockpile Stewardship Program may well help the United States to better understand our nuclear arsenal, but it is unproven, it may never be an adequate substitute for actual tests, and it is already behind schedule. 
   A week's worth of expert testimony bears this out. As C. Paul Robinson, the current Director of Sandia National Laboratory, testified before the Armed Services Committee last week:  
   I and others who are, or have been, responsible for the safety and reliability of the U.S. stockpile of nuclear weapons have testified to this obvious conclusion [that testing is the preferred methodology] many times in the past. To forego that validation through testing is, in short, to live with uncertainty.  
   Second, the CTBT will not contribute to the cause of nonproliferation. Countries will make decisions about whether to pursue nuclear weapons based on hard-headed calculations of their security interests. This fact has been demonstrated time and again. The existence of an ``international norm'' against the pursuit of nuclear weapons, created by the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), has not stopped a number of states, including Iran, Iraq, and North Korea from attempting to develop nuclear weapons. Furthermore, the United States has not tested in 8 years, yet in that same timeframe, five other nations have tested. 
   Third, the CTBT is unverifiable, meaning that states who choose to violate the CTBT may never be caught, and it is unenforceable, meaning that violators who are caught will likely go unpunished. As the October 3 Washington Post pointed out, a recent assessment by the Central Intelligence Agency concluded that the CIA ``cannot monitor low-level tests by Russia precisely enough to ensure compliance with the CTBT.'' 
   And as C. Paul Robinson, the Director of Sandia National Laboratory, said in testimony before the Armed Services Committee on October 7:  
   ..... [c]ompliance with a strict zero-yield requirement is unverifiable. The limitations of verifiability introduce the possibility of inconsistent observance of the ban under the threshold of detectability.  
   Speaking to the issue of lack of enforceability, our colleague RICHARD LUGAR recently noted:   
   This treaty simply has no teeth ....... The CTBT's answer to illegal nuclear testing is the possible implementation of sanctions. It is clear that this will not prove particularly compelling in the decisionmaking processes of foreign states intent on building nuclear weapons. For those countries seeking nuclear weapons, the perceived benefits in international stature and deterrence generally far outweigh the concern about sanctions that could be brought to bear by the international community.  
   Mr. President, for all the reasons my colleagues and I have cited throughout this debate, I believe the only prudent course is for the Senate to demonstrate strength and good sense worthy of Ronald Reagan by rejecting this flawed CTBT.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will read excerpts from the letter. It is instructive that Henry Kissinger has written the following:  
   As a former Secretary of State, I find the prospect that major treaty might fail to be ratified extremely painful. But the subject of this treaty concerns the future security of the United States and involves risks that make it impossible for me to recommend voting for the treaty as it now stands.  
   He then went on to talk about the experts who believe the treaty to be unverifiable, and then the concerns expressed by the CIA about recent ambiguous activities with respect to Russia; the impossibility, on his part, to ignore the concerns expressed by people such as the former Secretaries of Defense, CIA Directors, and National Security Advisers; and the weakness of the enforcement mechanism of the treaty. 
   He concludes in the following fashion:  
   I am not persuaded that the proposed treaty would inhibit nuclear proliferation. Restraint by the major powers has never been a significant factor in the decisions of other nuclear aspirants, which are driven by local rivalries and security needs. Nor is the behavior of the rogue states such as Iraq, Iran, or North Korea likely to be affected by this treaty. They either will not sign or, if they sign, will cheat. And countries relying on our nuclear umbrella might be induced by declining confidence in our arsenal--and the general impression of denuclearization--to accelerate their own efforts. 
   For all these reasons, I cannot recommend a vote for a comprehensive test ban of unlimited duration.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, deterrence has long been a primary component of U.S. security policy. In the cold war, nuclear weapons were the backbone of our national deterrent. The threat of unacceptable damage in response to aggression was central to inhibiting the Soviet Union's expansionist aims. Moreover, the credibility of the U.S. nuclear guarantee provided for ``extended deterrence'' against attacks on our friends and allies. 
   While the conditions today are much different from the past, our nuclear weapons continue to serve as an essential hedge against a very uncertain future with both Russia and China, two states that highly value their own nuclear forces. Equally important, deterrence--backed by credible nuclear forces--remains the first line of defense against an even broader range of threats than in the past, including rogue states armed with weapons of mass destruction. 
   The nuclear balance of terror that once defined our relationship with the Soviet Union is no longer central in our relations with Russia. Yet, even as we work to achieve a more democratic and open Russia, nuclear weapons appear to play a growing role in Moscow's security strategy, including declaratory policy and defense planning. Whether to overcome conventional weakness or as a means to retain one of its last vestiges of superpower status, Russia is continuing to modernize its nuclear forces. The retention of thousands of theater nuclear weapons, the deployment of the new mobile SS-27 ICBM, and the continuing investment in its massive nuclear weapons infrastructure demonstrate how important these weapons are to Moscow and lend credence to the concerns that Russia may have recently tested new nuclear weapons to provide the foundation for its future security strategy. 
   There are many fundamental questions about Russia's political and economic future that today can not be answered with certainty. What is clear, however, is that Russia will continue to possess formidable, modern nuclear forces no matter how these questions are answered over time. For this reason, it remains imperative for us to retain a credible nuclear deterrent capability to guard against the reversal of our relations with a potentially hostile and nuclear-armed Russia. 
   The strategic uncertainties associated with China are even greater than those with Russia. There are clear indications of qualitative improvements and quantitative increases to the Chinese nuclear arsenal. The Cox committee found that China is actively pursuing miniaturized nuclear warheads and MIRV technology, developing more accurate and ballistic missiles, and building a larger arsenal. Recent Chinese tests of a new medium-range ballistic missile, the DF-31 and public declarations of its development of enhanced radiological weapons serve to reinforce these findings. Similarly, a recent National Intelligence Estimate forecasts increases in the Chinese strategic arsenal and investment in technologies, such as penetration aids, designed to defeat any United States missile defense. 
   Perhaps most disturbing, the strategic intentions of both Russia and China appear increasingly antagonistic toward the United States. This past August they jointly announced a strategic partnership as a counterweight to what they termed U.S. ``hegemonic ambitions.'' As he met with Chinese President Jiang Zemin, President Yeltsin declared himself ``in fighting form, ready for battle, especially with Westerners,'' and complained that ``some  nations are trying to build a world order that would be convenient only for them, ignoring that the world is multi-polar.'' Given the uncertainties surrounding the future political and military developments in these two states, experience and prudence suggest the need for a hedge that only credible nuclear forces can provide. 
   While deterrence of rogue states armed with weapons of mass destruction is very different than deterrence as we understood it in the cold war, an overwhelming retaliatory capability--and the fear of a possible nuclear repsonse--remains critical to countering this new set of ever more dangerous threats. Despite sustained and determined efforts to de-legitimize our nuclear weapons, and assertions that their utility ended with the cold war, our nuclear weapons are essential in this context. Conventional superiority alone is not sufficient. Looking at the only real world experience we have in deterring the use of chemical and biological by rogue leaders--the Desert Storm case--it appears that the threat of a nuclear response was a major factor in the Iraqi decision to forego the use of their weapons of mass destruction. 
   An in-depth study of United States security policy in the 21st century, conducted last year by the National Defense University and Livermore National Laboratory, concluded that nuclear weapons would remain critical both to hedge against Russia and China, as well as to deter rogue states that will seek to challenge us in regions of vital interest. This same study concluded that: ``Retaining the safety, reliability, security, and performance of the nuclear weapons stockpile in the absence of underground nuclear testing is the highest-risk component of the U.S. strategy for sustaining deterrence.'' For over 40 years, testing was seen as essential to the credibility of our deterrent forces and our commitments to friends and allies. The CTBT, if ratified by the United States, would call into question the effectiveness and reliability of this essential component of our national security strategy. 
   In the annual statement of U.S. National Strategy, President Clinton has affirmed the view of his predecessors for more than half a century--nuclear weapons are vital to the security interests of the United States. It is not surprising then that one of the safeguards offered by the White House to diminish the risk inherent in accepting a permanent ban on nuclear weapons testing through the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty CTBT is to attempt to sustain the existing inventory of nuclear weapons through what is known as the Stockpile Stewardship Program, SSP. The aim of the SSP is to utilize the data from more than 1,000 U.S. atmospheric and underground nuclear tests legacy code combined with advanced diagnostic and experimental facilities now under development in the SSP to assess the aging properties of nuclear weapons. It is hoped that the SSP will enable U.S. nuclear weapon scientists and engineers to model and simulate nuclear phenomena with sufficient fidelity and reliability to permit judgements to be made about whether or not a particular weapon or class of weapons will continue to be safe and reliable. In short, whether or not U.S. nuclear weapons will remain a credible deterrent. 
   The administration's approach is an extraordinarily risky one--far more so than can be discerned from administration statements on the subject. This is so because the way risks are multiplied in the program. First, the CTBT prevents the United States from using the technique for assuring the reliability of stockpile--the detonation of the nuclear weapon to be confident that the aging of the nuclear components have not diminished confidence in its safety and reliability. Second, the CTBT prevents the United States from testing new weapon designs--the approach we have taken over the past half century to make sure our nuclear weapon stockpile kept pace with what was required to deter. Third, the CTBT offers as an alternative to testing, the SSP. Let's examine each of these elements of risk in turn. 
   First, the design of nuclear weapons is a highly empirical process. Vast computer networks and theoretical physicists notwithstanding, testing has been an indispensable dimension of nuclear weapon development, production, and deployment. This is so because the environment within a nuclear weapon is unlike anything in nature. Materials exposed to decades of nuclear radiation behave in ways scientists do not know how to predict. Gold, for example, corrodes in a nuclear environment--a property not evident in nature. We do know know what will happen over time to the nuclear components of a weapon and how the aging process will affect the weapon. This has been addressed in the past by detonating weapons after a fix has been installed in a weapon that appears to be adversely affected by age. Because there is no theoretical basis that has been validated through testing to certify weapon safety and reliability, testing has been indispensable. The United States ceased its nuclear weapon testing program in 1992, but had never undertaken an effort to ascertain whether or not it could model and simulate the aging properties of nuclear weapons with sufficient reliability to permit the certification of the weapons in the stockpile. 
   Nuclear weapons now in the stockpile--eight types plus one additional type in reserve--means that we have concentrated our deterrent in relatively few weapon designs. In the mid-1980s, we had 32 types of nuclear weapons in the stockpile. The average age of the weapons in the stockpile is 15 years--more than has ever been the case in the past, and well beyond U.S. experience. We simply do not know what the long-term implications of aging are on nuclear weapons. We do know that there are consequences from the aging process, because problems resulting from aging have been identified in the past. However, as we were able to conduct underground tests, the aging process did not degrade the safety and reliability of the stockpile. If the CTBT is ratified, we may not have an opportunity to do this in the future because the process for utilizing the supreme national interest provisions of the treaty to withdraw are themselves an impediment to sustaining deterrence. 
   Second, the CTBT will prevent the United States from testing new nuclear weapon designs should the need to sustain deterrence call for new designs. Many new designs were required during the cold war to sustain deterrence. Identifying some circumstances that could give rise to a requirement for new weapon designs is not difficult. The weapons retained in the U.S. inventory after the cold war are primarily designed to strike urban-industrial targets (reflecting the policy of mutual assured destruction) and hardened targets on or near the earth's surface. The change in the technology of underground construction has fundamentally changed the economics of locating military targets in deep underground locations. In Russia, for example, despite its severely depressed economic circumstances, has invested $6 billion since 1991 in a deep underground military facility in the southern end of the Ural Mountains. The underground facility at the site is located under nearly 1,000 feet of granite--one of scores of deep underground sites--that could not be held at risk with the current nuclear weapon stockpile. Similar underground facilities exist in other declared or undeclared nuclear weapon states. It is possible that some future President may decide that new weapon design(s) are needed to sustain deterrence. He will be prevented from doing so if the CTBT is ratified. 
   Third, the alternative to testing, the SSP, is an extraordinarily risky approach to sustaining deterrence. The United States has not conducted a testing program to verify that the modeling and simulation of the existing stockpile or new designs can be maintained or implemented using the experimental and diagnostic facilities of the SSP. No testing has taken place since 1992, but the SSP will not be fully operational until 2010 or beyond. One of the most important of these facilities--the National Ignition Facility, NIF--has proven to be both a technical and cost challenge. Last month the Congress was confronted by a one-third jump in the cost of this program. The entire SSP--budgeted at $4.5 billion--is certainly underfunded, as the NIF experience demonstrates. For the SSP to be successful, all of its numerous experimental and diagnostic facilities have to work perfectly to assure that the safety and reliability of the stockpile can be certified indefinitely. It is one  thing to take such a technical and financial risk in an environment where testing is unconstrained. It is quite another to bet on the enduring success of a program--the SSP--that has already been shown to have unforeseen cost, technical, and schedule difficulties. The extent of these difficulties has not yet even been ascertained by the executive branch--much less an independent determination by the Congress. The risks to the ability to sustain deterrence under the CTBT are simply too large for the Congress to accept. The CTBT should not be ratified. 
   CTBT proponents claim that the treaty is an important tool in the fight against nuclear proliferation. This is simply inaccurate. 
   A test ban will provide no obstacle to a proliferator who seeks a first-generation-or even a second-generation-nuclear weapon. One of the two bombs the United States dropped on Japan to end WWII was an untested design. South African built and deployed six nuclear weapons without testing the design. Pakistan obtained a workable design from China, and thus needed no nuclear tests of its own. 
   Faced with these facts, treaty proponents often resort to the claim that the CTBT will establish an international norm against nuclear proliferation. Again, history teaches us differently. There is already an international norm against proliferation embodied in the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty--the NPT. Over 130 nations have signed the NPT and, by doing so, have forsworn nuclear weapons development. As an aside here, I guess we can say the CTBT is to get nations to promise not to test the weapons that they promised not to develop under the NPT. 
   The international norm of nuclear nonproliferation-the one supposedly established by the NPTB was broken by Iraq, which tried to develop nuclear weapons clandestinely. And, the norm is violated even today by North Korea, which remains in noncompliance with the NPT. Two nations not party to the NPT, India and Pakistan, also broke the international norm. 
   Other arms control norms are readily and repeatedly broken as well. There are too many examples to cite here today, but let me give you one. The United States forswore biological weapons and led the world in signing the Biological Weapons ban. The Soviet Union signed too, but secretly kept inventing and manufacturing ever more potent biological weapons. Other nations, including Iraq, have also made such weapons. 
   The point here is that norms do nothing to prevent development of heinous weapons by nations that view it in their security interests to do so. They are driven by their own perceptions of threat, not by a desire to adhere to a norm established by the United States or the international community. 
   Ironically, the CTBT might actually promote nuclear proliferation. I say this for two reasons. 
   First, it my promote proliferation by damaging the U.S. nuclear umbrella. United States allies such as Japan, South Korea, Germany, and Italy have long depended on United States nuclear strength to provide them the ultimate protection. Indeed, the United States persuaded South Korea and Taiwan to give up their own nuclear weapons programs by promising them protection. 
   U.S. nuclear testing has signaled to allies, and to potential enemies, that the United States nuclear arsenal is effective and that the United States is committed to using such weapons if absolutely necessary. Without nuclear testing, there is no question that United States confidence in the stockpile will decline. Our enemies and allies alike will read this silent signal as a local of commitment to maintaining-and using, if necessary-the nuclear deterrent. 
   As U.S. confidence in the stockpile declines over time, it is likely that our allies confidence in the nuclear umbrella will similarly decline. This could head to allies reevaluating their own security needs. (If the U.S. umbrella appears insufficient, might they not consider developing their own nuclear deterrents? 
   The second reason that I say that the CTBT may promote proliferation is that it will result in significantly increased interactions between the U.S. weapons design community and the international academic community. This could, and probably will, result in the transfer of weapons-relevant data. Let me explain.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, today the Senate will resume consideration of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty, with approximately 6 hours of debate time remaining. As a reminder, the two amendments in order to the treaty must be filed at the desk by 9:45 a.m. today. 
   By previous consent, at 4:30 p.m. the Senate will resume debate on the conference report to accompany the Agriculture appropriations bill. Following 1 hour of debate, the Senate will proceed to a cloture vote on the conference report. Therefore, the first rollcall vote of the day will occur at approximately 5:30 p.m. 
   For the information of all Senators, this week will be extremely busy so that action on the CTBT and the Agriculture appropriations conference report can be completed. The Senate will also begin consideration of the campaign finance reform legislation and take up any conference reports available for action. Senators may expect votes throughout the day and into the evening.

   Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   Mr. President, a number of us have concluded that we cannot support ratification of the CTBT, that it will be defeated. But some have urged that we put the vote off out of concern that rejection would send an undesirable message to the world. 
   I believe, however, that we should vote precisely because the world would get a desirable message that the Senate took a stand that treaties such as this must meet at least minimum standards for sensible arms control. The CTBT fails that test. It is a sloppy, altogether substandard piece of work, and it deserves rejection. 
   Our colleague, DICK LUGAR, opposes the CTBT ratification, as he has explained, because he does not believe the treaty is of the same caliber as arms control agreements that have come before the Senate in recent decades. He cites two of the CTBT's many deficiencies: ``an ineffective verification regime and a practically nonexistent enforcement process.'' 
   Contrary to what treaty supporters have argued, the CTBT's rejection would strengthen the hands of U.S. diplomats on such matters in future negotiations. When they insist on more effective provisions, citing the need to satisfy a rigorous U.S. Senate, their warnings would become credible and influential. Such warnings would help free the United States from having to go along with wrong-headed treaty terms dictated by countries that lack U.S. responsibilities around the world. 
   I note that as a good example of our negotiators changing their position from that originally supported by the administration to go directly to the heart of key objections to this particular treaty. As you know, no President had ever sought a zero-yield test ban treaty in perpetuity. In this case, the Joint Chiefs of Staff argued that we should not have such a treaty. 
   The original position of the administration in the negotiations was to grant the United States an option without having to invoke the supreme national interest clause to retire from the treaty after 10 years and not to insist upon a zero-yield but, rather, to permit low-yield, what are called hydronuclear tests. Over time, our negotiators' position was undercut, and in the end, according to the very people who negotiated the treaty, in order to reach an agreement with other countries, the United States conceded on those and other important points. Those are two of the critical deficiencies in this treaty. 
   By rejecting the treaty now, the Senate would strengthen the hands of our future diplomats who negotiate these arms control agreements to enable them to make the point to their counterparts that the United States is serious about treaties at least achieving minimal standards; we consider these to be the kinds of minimal standards that are necessary to bind the American people; and those negotiators would know that Senate ratification would not occur unless the terms were as proposed by the United States. 
   As I said, no other President ever supported a zero-yield treaty, let alone one that would bind the United States forever, and neither should the Senate. 
   If we proceed today to reject the CTBT, future U.S. negotiators will be more inclined to seek the Senate's advice before the deal is finalized and the administration demands our consent. This will serve the U.S. national interests in various ways. 
   First, the Senate was never intended to be a rubber stamp, approving any ill-advised treaty negotiated by an administration. Our constitutional duty in treaty-making is to perform the equivalent of quality control. Under the Constitution, the Senate's role is of equal stature with the President's. We in the Senate are entitled--indeed, we are obliged--to second guess the President's national interest calculations regarding treaties. 
   There would inevitably be complaints from abroad, including from friends, if we upset the CTBT apple cart. But that unpleasantness would be minor and transitory, especially in light of the permanent harm the CTBT would do to our national security. The embarrassment of the President for buying into such a flawed treaty in the first place is not desirable, but the Senate cannot avert it at any price. 
   Consider again Senator LUGAR's words:  
   [The CTBT] is problematic because it would exacerbate risks and uncertainties related to the safety of our nuclear stockpile.  
   Those are the stakes, and they are serious. That crucial observation should put into perspective the issue of likely complaints from foreign foes and friends. 
   The Senate must fulfill its constitutional duty to ensure that treaties meet at least minimum standards. We do the Presidency no favors by shirking, and we do the Senate and the Nation harm if we accede to the President's diplomatic recklessness simply to spare him the chore of mollifying the other states that forged the flawed treaty. 
   A query to my colleagues who are interested in delaying this vote to avoid the embarrassment of rejecting a treaty negotiated by the administration: Will the Senate defer to the President on the Kyoto Global Warming Treaty or the ABM 
   multilateralization or demarcation treaties? 
   Some administration spokesmen have used the offensive argument that Senate rejection of the CTBT would be a message to the world that we are not serious about arms control. To the contrary, rejecting this treaty will help establish that we demand real arms control--not the show, not the empty symbols, not the flimflam treaties that cannot accomplish their purposes. In rejecting the CTBT, we will be asking the world to join in real antiproliferation measures, such as enforcement of the nonproliferation treaty which Russia, China, and North Korea violate every time they spread nuclear weapons technology. 
   I quote again from Senator LUGAR:  
   If a country breaks the international norm embodied in the CTBT, the country has already broken the norm associated with the nonproliferation treaty.  
   Mr. President, that is because 185-some nations have agreed not to possess these nuclear weapons, except for the nuclear powers. The testing is simply a redundant violation of the possession in the first place, which is already a violation of the NPT. So this treaty won't accomplish its minimal objective. 
   Second, enforcement of the United States resolutions requiring inspection of Iraq: It would be very helpful if our allies would help in this very meaningful and important activity rather than undercutting the United States at every turn. 
   Again, Senator LUGAR hit the point squarely:  
   The CTBT verification regime seems to be the embodiment of everything the United States is fighting against in the UNSCOM inspection process in Iraq ..... [which is] best not repeated under the CTBT.  
   Third, perhaps we could get their support in our efforts to free U.S. policy from the dead hand of the ABM Treaty and to deploy missile defenses. 
   These are real, meaningful actions against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction rather than empty symbolic gestures. 
   In asking the Senate to postpone the vote on this treaty until he has the votes, the President is asking, first, to spare him personal embarrassment; and, second, to give him a chance to bind the United States to a treaty that most do not think should ever go into force. The CTBT will not improve with age. 
   Most Senators would have been content never to have voted on the treaty. But the President has now denied the Senate that option. He will not agree to forbear demanding consideration of the treaty next year when he hopes to have the votes to pass it. Republicans have not politicized this debate, but it is clear that unless we defeat this treaty now, it will be a political issue next year when allegedly changed circumstances--created, for example, by a new test by India or Pakistan--will give the President the pretext to revive the debate. 
   It has become clear that the assurances we may now get from the President and our Democratic colleagues will not be the ironclad commitments we recently agreed were necessary to induce the Senate to defer this vote.  Therefore, to avoid the President politicizing the issue next year, we should vote now. 
   Sometimes it is necessary to say or do the right thing and just let the chips fall where they may. Ronald Reagan knew he would ruffle lots of foreign feathers--including some of our respected allies--when he called the Soviet Union an evil empire and when he stood his ground against Gorbachev in Reykjavik in favor of strategic defense. These messages he sent were criticized by many as disruptive. They were sound. They served our national interests and the interests of decent people around the world, and history has judged them favorably. 
   The Senate now has a chance to demonstrate strength and the good sense worthy of Ronald Reagan. If we do it, we will be flouting much conventional thinking, but we will, in fact, enhance our Nation's diplomatic strength, protecting our national security and vindicating the wisdom of America's founding fathers who assigned to the Senate the duty to protect the country from ill-conceived international obligations. 
   Let the Senate vote to reject the CTBT.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I want 30 seconds to respond to the challenge of my friend from Delaware with respect to unilateral disarmament. I think the point the Senator from Kentucky was making was that the United States will consider itself bound to the zero-yield standard. We will abide. But we know that certain other countries don't see the treaty that way, don't interpret the language that way. We suspect they have reason to and probably will be conducting so-called hybrid nuclear tests and, second, couldn't verify whether those kinds of tests are conducted. As a result, the United States would not be conducting any kind of nuclear tests, whereas other countries would have the capability and, indeed, the motivation to do so. 
   I believe that is what the Senator was talking about when he talked about the concept of unilateral disarmament.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I know that earlier the Democratic side proposed an amendment which was accepted by this side. I did want to speak to that for just a moment because I don't believe anyone should suffer any illusions that the so-called safeguards that are part of this amendment are going to in any way enhance the treaty and make it more palatable. We accepted it because it is what is being done anyway. It wouldn't have to be added to the treaty. The President theoretically is pursuing these things. He should pursue them. But they are not going to make the treaty any better or worse. 
   For example, the first item is the Stockpile Stewardship Program. It has been assumed all along that there would be a Stockpile Stewardship Program. We don't have to amend this in order to achieve that. 
   The problem is, the Stockpile Stewardship Program is very troublesome even if you assume there would be assurance at the end of the day that it could do the job it was designed to do because some people are assuming that design is a total replacement of testing. It was never designed to totally replace testing but merely to give us a greater degree of confidence in the reliability and safety of our nuclear weapons, not that it could totally replace testing. 
   But even if you laid that aside, the notion was that the Stockpile Stewardship Program would be ready in a decade. This was announced about 3 years ago. Now we are being told it will be ready by the year 2010. 
   There are slips along the way that suggest problems with the Stockpile Stewardship Program. It is behind budget. We haven't been budgeting the amount of money that was indicated as necessary to maintain it--the $4.5 billion a year. We have also not indexed for inflation. So each year that we supply the $4 billion or so, we are getting further behind because we are not indexing that to inflation. 
   We have also included other programs within the Stockpile Stewardship Program that were never intended to be funded out of it, such as the tritium production facility for our nuclear weapons. That was to be a separate area of funding. This administration has folded that into the Stockpile Stewardship Program, with the result that even more of the money necessary for the ASCI Program and other key parts of the Stockpile Stewardship Program will be shorted if we have to spend that money for tritium. 
   In addition to that, let me quote a letter I received from the former Director of one of our National Laboratories. This is a letter sent to me in September of this year from John Nuckolls who is the former Director at Livermore. Here is what he said:  
   A post-CTBT or other funding reduction would increase the uncertainty in long-term stockpile reliability. Current and projected funding is inadequate. Substantial additional funding is needed for SSP experimental efforts including construction of an advanced hydro facility.  
   I also note that the so-called ignition facility, which is planned as a part of this, is also behind schedule and over budget. 
   As Mr. Nuckolls pointed out, we are already behind. We are getting further behind, and I don't think anyone should put that much reliance as a result in the Stockpile Stewardship Program. 
   Another safeguard is the nuclear laboratory facilities and 
   programs. Of course, we are going to maintain our nuclear laboratories and facilities. I don't think anybody would ever assume we were not going to do that. So this adds nothing to the treaty. The question is, Can you maintain these without nuclear testing? It turns out it is much more difficult to do so. 
   Again, quoting from Mr. Nuckolls' letter to me, I will quote the first part of his answer:  
   In an extended duration nuclear test ban, confidence in the stockpile would be adversely affected by loss of all nuclear test trained and validated expert personnel, major gaps in our scientific understanding of nuclear explosives, nuclear and chemical decay of warheads, accidents and inadequate funding of the Stockpile Stewardship Program. 
   All nuclear test trained/validated expert personnel would eventually be lost. Training of the replacement workforce would be seriously handicapped without nuclear testing, and expert judgment could not be fully validated. A serious degradation of U.S. capabilities to find and fix stockpile problems, and to design and build new nuclear weapons would be unavoidable.  
   In other words, what is perceived as a good thing--these nuclear laboratory facilities and programs--is actually being allowed to deteriorate without testing. We simply won't have the people available in order to maintain those facilities and to be prepared to do the things he says are necessary to be done. A serious degradation of U.S. capabilities would be unavoidable.  
   We are not talking about something hypothetical and unimportant. We are talking about the U.S. nuclear stockpile. This is the person who used to run this National Laboratory. He is telling us we had better be careful putting our reliance on that program. 
   The third of the so-called safeguards is the maintenance of nuclear testing capability. That is fine, except that we are not doing it. This President should be doing it. He claims to be doing it. But it is not being done. We now know it would take 2 or 3 years to get back to the point where we could test. 
   I again quote from Mr. Nuckolls' letter:  
   In an extended duration nuclear test ban, the nuclear test site infrastructure is likely to decay or become obsolete. Nuclear test experienced personnel would be lost. A series of nuclear tests to diagnose complex reliability problems and to certify a fix, or to develop new weapons could take several years. ..... 
   Nuclear testing has been essential to the discovery and resolution of many problems in the stockpile.  
   The point he is making is that you can't just say you are going to be able to resume testing unless you take active and take serious steps to maintain that readiness. We are not doing it. And he says in a test ban of this kind, we would not be able to do it. 
   The fourth item is the continued comprehensive research and development program. Of course, we are going to be doing that. Intelligence gatherings, analytical capabilities--we will do the best we can on that, although, as has been pointed out, it is inadequate. 
   Senator RICHARD LUGAR, an arms control advocate and an expert in this body, has concluded reluctantly that this treaty is not verifiable and enforceable and, as a matter of fact, it cannot be made so. 
   Let me quote from the Washington Times of today because it talks about how we negotiated this treaty and how we negotiated the provisions for verification and enforcement. Let me read from the story which is headlined, ``Moscow, Beijing balk at monitors. Testing sites not included in nuke treaty.'' I am quoting now: 
   Russia and China refused to permit seismic monitoring near their nuclear weapons test sites that could have resolved some verification problems now troubling the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, according to U.S. government officials. 
   Clinton administration officials and congressional aides said the failure of U.S. negotiators to win the cooperation of Moscow and Beijing was a ``negotiating failure'' that undermined the treaty. It also is a key reason U.S. intelligence agencies said both nations could conduct hidden nuclear tests without detection.  
   Before I finish this quotation, let me point out why this is important.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the Senate has a solemn obligation under our Constitution to be a backstop. We are not supposed to be a rubber stamp to treaties. If we were simply to rubber stamp whatever the President sent to us, our founding fathers wouldn't have provided a separate advice and consent responsibility for the Senate. As a matter of fact, we would be doing the Office of the Presidency a big favor by exercising that responsibility in a responsible way, saying that when we find  treaties that lack even minimal standards, then we need to say no, so that our negotiators in the future will be able to negotiate stronger provisions--provisions that we seek because we understand their importance and necessity for sensible arms control. 
   If we simply ratify what is acknowledged to be a flawed treaty, then our negotiators are never going to be able to say no to bad terms and we are always going to have to then go to the lowest common denominator in these treaties--treaties which then become bad for the United States; treaties which are unverifiable and unenforceable. Those are concepts that used to cause the Senate to say no, to say we won't approve a treaty that doesn't have good verification or enforcement provisions. Those are minimally necessary for sensible treaties. 
   Our negotiators tried to avoid a zero-yield basis in this treaty but they couldn't so they gave up. They tried to have a 10-year limit rather than having this treaty be in effect in perpetuity, but they couldn't get it done. So in order to make a deal, they said: All right, we will agree to something less. If they knew and if their counterparts understood that the Senate at that point would say: No, we are not going to ratify such a treaty, they would more likely have stood firm and been able to hold their ground. 
   The same thing is true with respect to these monitors. Administration officials have tried to suggest that actually we will have a better chance of monitoring in the future than we do today, while many of the experts have debunked that. The fact that the treaty calls for monitoring sites around the world is irrelevant if the sites are not placed in the positions that are best for detection of nuclear weapon explosions. What this article is pointing out is that when the United States tried to interpose that requirement on Russia and China, the Russians and Chinese said no, and we backed down. So now we don't have monitoring stations in key locations in the world near the Chinese and Russian test sites that would enable the United States to understand whether or not they have violated the treaty by engaging in nuclear tests. 
   Let me quote further from the article, while it points out that Russia and China will have some seismic stations:  
   None of these stations, however, is located close enough to the main Russian and Chinese testing facilities to be able to detect tests conducted covertly inside underground caves, or tests of very small nuclear blasts, the official said. 
   By contrast, the United States has five primary seismic monitoring facilities under the treaty, including one in Nevada, where the main U.S. nuclear testing site is located. It will also have 11 secondary sites. 
   Michael Pillsbury, a former acting director of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, said China would have agreed to better seismic monitoring if Beijing were pushed into it. 
   ``Chinese officials have told me that if the Clinton administration had pushed harder they would have agreed to a primary site near the test site,'' said Mr. Pillsbury, who also took part in a recent Defense Science Task Force study on nuclear weapons, ``but the Chinese had the impression the Clinton administration didn't place as high a priority on treaty verification as they did on maintaining good trade relations.''

   Mr. KYL. I think that is a very important distinction. I thank my colleague for making it because, clearly, North Korea is not going to be persuaded to eschew nuclear weapons by the United States ratifying the CTBT. North Korea will do whatever it wants to do regardless of what we do. That is pretty clear. To suggest that we need to ratify this treaty in order to satisfy North Korea is absurd. 
   North Korea is a member of the nonproliferation treaty right now. By definition, North Korea is in violation of that treaty if it ever decides to test a nuclear weapon because it would be affirming the fact that it possesses a nuclear weapon which is in violation of the NPT. North Korea is not a country the behavior of which we can affect one way or the other by virtue of a moratorium on testing. If that were the case, then North Korea would have long ago decided to forego the development of nuclear weapons because the United States hasn't tested for 8 years. 
   Clearly, our actions have had no influence on North Korea, except to cause North Korea to blackmail the United States by threatening to develop nuclear weapons and by threatening to develop missiles unless we will pay them tribute. I don't think North Korea is a very good example to be citing as a reason for the United States to affirm the CTBT. 
   Moreover, I remember this argument a couple of years ago when the chemical weapons treaty was being brought before the body. They said this was the only way to get North Korea to sign up to the CWC, and we certainly wanted North Korea to be a signatory to that treaty because they might use chemical weapons someday. We ratified it. They still haven't signed up--2 years later. I don't think North Korea is going to care one way or the other whether the United States ratifies the CTBT. 
   To my friend's other point on the comparison between nuclear weapons and missile defense, I think it makes our point. Missile defenses can work.  They are not easy to develop. We have seen several tests that failed with the THAAD system. What it demonstrated to us was that testing is required to know that missile defense will work, just as the experts have all indicated testing is the preferred method of knowing whether our nuclear weapons will work. 
   So I think it makes the point that either for missile defense or for nuclear weapons testing it is the best way to know whether it will work. That is why we need to test both the missile defense systems that we have in development right now, and that is why we need the option of being able to test our nuclear weapons as well.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask my colleague from New Hampshire to delay his remarks for a moment so I can make a point and perhaps ask Senator BIDEN, if he could answer a question regarding something he has said. 
   I think it is, first of all, dangerous to suggest that the Senate cannot do its business with respect to a treaty because a coup is occurring in another country. I fail to see, if the coup is occurring today and tomorrow, and we reject the CTBT, how anyone could argue our action precipitated this coup. Or somehow by failing to approve this treaty we caused unrest in Pakistan. 
   I ask the Senator to answer that question on his own time. First, I make another point. I wasn't trying to make a debater's point but trying to be absolutely conservative in what I said a moment ago.

   Mr. KYL. And I appreciate that more than you know. 
   When I say that testing was the preferred method, what the lab Directors and former officials who have had responsibility for this have said with these highly complex weapons is that testing is the preferred method. 
   They have also said in contradiction to the Senator from Delaware that there is no certainty with respect to the other method, which is the Stockpile Stewardship Program, which is not complete and has not gone into effect and cannot provide certainty, in any event. 
   Dr. John Foster, who chairs the congressional committee to assess the efficacy of the Stockpile Stewardship Program, said this in his testimony last week:  
   I oppose ratification of the CTBT because without the ability to perform nuclear weapons tests the reliability and safety of our Stockpile Stewardship Program will degrade.  
   There is nobody who is more respected in this field than Dr. John Foster. 
   He further said the testing, which has been performed over the years, ``has clearly shown our ability to calculate and simulate their operation is incomplete. Our understanding of their basic physics is seriously deficient. Hence, I can only answer that a ban on testing of our nuclear weapons can only have a negative impact on the reliability of the stockpile.''  
   Dr. Robert Barker, former assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Atomic Energy, who reported the certification of the stockpile to three Secretaries of Defense, said:  
   Sustained nuclear testing is the only demonstrated way of maintaining a safe and reliable deterrent. Our confidence in the safety and reliability of nuclear weapons has already declined since 1992, the year we deprived ourselves of the nuclear testing tool. It should be of grave concern to us that this degradation in confidence cannot be quantified.  
   The point is that the reason testing is preferred is because it is the only demonstrable way of assuring ourselves of the safety and reliability of our nuclear stockpile. There could be, may be, in a decade or so, some additional confidence or assurance through a successful Stockpile Stewardship Program but we won't know that until the time. Until then, that is why testing is the preferred method. It is the only way to assure the safety and reliability of our stockpile. 
   To respond to that and to respond to the first question I asked, I am happy to yield to the Senator.

   Mr. KYL. Madam President, let me make a couple comments and then I will yield to the Senator from New Hampshire. 
   I appreciate the Senator from Delaware making a slight concession, and asking for one in return. His concession, of course, is that it is better to test. I think we would all agree it is better to test. The question is whether or not there is an adequate substitute if we do not test. And upon that the jury is still out. 
   He also asked the question: Isn't it also better not to test if we can persuade others not to do so by our own willingness to forego testing? I think that question has actually been answered because for 8 years we have had a moratorium seeking to persuade others not to test. During that time, we know of at least five countries that have tested: France, China, Russia, Pakistan, and India. So it is clear that our foregoing testing has not created the norm against testing that proponents of the treaty would like to see. 
   It is also not better to forego testing in an effort to get others to do so as well if, in fact, our own stockpile would be unduly jeopardized as a result. On that, there has been a variety of expert opinion testifying this past week suggesting that the reason it is better to test is precisely because we cannot confirm the safety and reliability of our stockpile to an adequate degree of certainty without that. 
   To the question of whether or not it is a fallacy of logic to quote experts, I would simply suggest that while it may not be the most persuasive argument in the world to quote experts in support of your position, it is at least some weight of evidence. Both sides have engaged in that. It is true that on many of these issues there are opinions on both sides of the issue. 
   Dr. Edward Teller certainly is an expert in nuclear weapons design and on many other matters that relate to it. But let's assume he does not know what he is talking about here and go to people whose job it was to verify a compliance with arms control treaties.

   Other nations will be able to conduct militarily significant nuclear tests well below the verification threshold of the Treaty's monitoring system, and our own unilateral capability.  
   In other words, the treaty is not verifiable. 
   Testifying last week, one of the experts acknowledged by Senator BIDEN, Dr. Paul Robinson, who is the Director of the Sandia National Laboratories, said:  
   The treaty bans any ``nuclear explosion,'' but unfortunately, compliance with the strict zero-yield requirement is unverifiable.

   Mr. KYL. Let me quote three or four lines from it. 
   He said:  
   If we are to put our faith in a program other than testing to ensure the safety and reliability of our nuclear deterrent and thus our security, we must have complete faith in its efficacy. The Stockpile Stewardship Program falls well short of that standard. ..... 
   At present, I am not convinced the Stockpile Stewardship Program will permit our experts to maintain a credible deterrent in the absence of testing.  
   He goes on the say:  
   Unfortunately, the CTBT's verification regime will not be up to that task even if it is ever fully deployed.  
   He concludes his statement with this paragraph:  
   The Senate is being asked to rely on an unfinished and unproven Stockpile Stewardship Program. This program might meet our needs in the future, but as yet, it is not close to doing so. The treaty is flawed with an ineffective verification regime and a practically nonexistent enforcement process. 
   For these reasons, I will vote against ratification of the CTBT.  
   So spoke Senator RICHARD LUGAR. I do not suggest that any of us here in the Senate are as expert as other people I have quoted, but certainly Senator LUGAR has a reputation for being a very serious and well-informed student of arms control issues, a proponent of arms control treaties. When he says, as he did with respect to this treaty, that it is simply not of the same caliber as other arms control treaties for the variety of reasons he expresses in his release, I think all of us should pay serious attention to that. 
   Madam President, it is now my pleasure, at long last, to turn to the Senator from New Hampshire, who has been very patient in waiting for Senator BIDEN and me to conclude.

   Mr. KYL. With the understanding that Senator BIDEN and I just reached, and the Senator just articulated, I withdraw the request, and I assume we can proceed in that fashion. 
    Mr. President, I rise today to explain why I strongly oppose the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty that has been submitted to the Senate for its advice and consent. 
   I think the words of six distinguished Americans who formerly bore the responsibility for safeguarding our nation's security as Secretary of Defense frame the issue before the Senate quite well. In a letter to the majority leader this week, James Schlesinger, Dick Cheney, Frank Carlucci, Caspar Weinberger, Donald Rumsfeld, and Melvin Laird who served as Secretaries of Defense in the Reagan, Bush, Ford, and Nixon administrations, stated:  
   As the Senate weighs whether to approve the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), we believe Senators will be obliged to focus on one dominant, inescapable result were it to be ratified: over the decades ahead, confidence in the reliability of our nuclear weapons stockpile would inevitably decline, thereby reducing the credibility of America's nuclear deterrent.  
   For this reason, these former Secretaries of Defense conclude that the CTBT is ``incompatible with the Nation's international commitments and vital security interests ..... Accordingly, we respectfully urge you and your colleagues to preserve the right of this nation to conduct nuclear tests necessary to the future viability of our nuclear deterrent by rejecting approval of the present CTBT.'' 
   I couldn't agree more with the considered judgment of these distinguished Americans who have had the awesome responsibility of maintaining the U.S. nuclear deterrent throughout the cold war and beyond. 
   Before discussing some of the flaws of the CTBT and how it will undermine the credibility of our nuclear deterrent, a few words on the importance of nuclear deterrence, and the limits of arms control I think are in order. 
   As my colleagues recall, during the cold war, the Soviet Union enjoyed a tremendous advantage in conventional military forces in Europe. The United States was able to offset this advantage in conventional forces, and to guarantee the security of Western Europe until the cold war ended peacefully, through the maintenance of a credible nuclear deterrent. Our nuclear ``umbrella,'' as it is called, was extended to our allies in other parts of the world as well. 
   Since the end of the cold war, some have argued that nuclear deterrence is an outdated concept, and the U.S. no longer needs to retain a substantial nuclear weapons capability. However, deterrence is not a product of the cold war and has been around since the beginning of diplomacy and war. Over 2,500 years ago, the Chinese philosopher Sun Tzu wrote about the value of deterrence stating, ``To win one hundred victories in one hundred battles is not the acme of skill. To subdue the enemy without fighting is the acme of skill.'' 
   Furthermore, the end of the cold war does not mean national security threats to the United States have evaporated. James Woolsey, President Clinton's first Director of Central Intelligence, aptly described the current security environment when he said, ``We have slain a large dragon [the Soviet Union]. But we live now in a jungle filled with a bewildering variety of poisonous snakes.'' 
   Rogue nations like North Korea, Iran, and Iraq have weapons of mass destruction programs and are hostile to the United States. China is an emerging power whose relationship with the United States has been rocky at best. And Russia retains significant military capabilities, including over 6,000 strategic nuclear warheads. 
   The gulf war is an excellent case study of the continuing importance of nuclear deterrence in the post-cold-war world. In that conflict, the maintenance of a credible nuclear weapons capability, coupled with the understanding that it was possible that the United States would respond with nuclear weapons if attacked with other weapons of mass destruction, saved lives by deterring such an attack. 
   As my colleagues recall, Iraq possessed a large arsenal of chemical weapons that it had used against its Kurdish population, and against Iranian troops during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s. It is widely acknowledged that Iraq did not use chemical weapons against the United States-led coalition during the gulf war because we possessed a credible nuclear deterrent. 
   Prior to the start of the gulf war, U.S. leaders practiced the art of deterrence by issuing clear warnings to Saddam Hussein. Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney stated:  
   He [Saddam Hussein] needs to be made aware that the President will have available the full spectrum of capabilities. And were Saddam Hussein foolish enough to use weapons of mass destruction, the U.S. response would be absolutely overwhelming and it would be devastating. He has to take that into consideration, it seems to me, before he embarks upon a course of using those kinds of capabilities.  
   President Bush also sent a strongly worded message to Saddam Hussein which said:  
   Let me state, too, that the United States will not tolerate the use of chemical or biological weapons....... The American people would demand the strongest possible response. You and your country will pay a terrible price if you order unconscionable acts of this sort.  
   Iraqi officials have confirmed that these statements deterred Baghdad from using chemical and biological weapons. In 1995, Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz reported to Rolf Ekeus, chairman of the U.N. commission charged with inspecting Iraqi weapons of mass destruction facilities, that Iraq was deterred from using its arsenal of chemical and biological weapons because the Iraqi leadership had interpreted Washington's threats of devastating retaliation as meaning nuclear retaliation. 
   Aziz's explanation is corroborated by a senior defector, General Wafic Al Sammarai, former head of Iraqi military intelligence, who stated:  
   Some of the Scud missiles were loaded with chemical warheads, but they were not used. We didn't use them because the other side had a deterrent force. I do not think Saddam was capable of taking a decision to use chemical weapons or biological weapons, or any other type of weapons against the allied troops, because the warning was quite severe, and quite effective. The allied troops were certain to use nuclear arms and the price will be too dear and too high.  
   Mr. President, as these statements show, a credible nuclear deterrent remains vitally important to our nation. I would hope that we could begin this debate on the CTBT by agreeing that a strong U.S. nuclear deterrent remains essential and that the Senate should reject any actions that would undermine the credibility of this deterrent. 
   To the second preliminary point, the fallacy of arms control: 
   Unfortunately, the CTBT negotiated by the Clinton administration would do just that. This is not surprising since the Clinton administration has sought to protect our national security with a fixation on arms control that columnist Charles Krauthammer aptly calls ``Peace through Paper.'' 
   Of course, arms control is not a new idea. After all, in the year 1139, the Roman Catholic Church tried to ban the crossbow. Like so many other well-intentioned arms control measures, this one was doomed to failure from the start. 
   And who can forget the Kellog-Briand treaty, ratified by the United States in 1929, that outlawed war as an instrument of national policy. This agreement and others spawned in its wake left the United States and Britain unprepared to fight and unable to deter World War II.  
   Yet despite these and many other notable failures, the Clinton administration still looks to arms control as the best way to safeguard our security. Under Secretary of State John Holum explained this philosophy during a speech in 1994, stating.  
   The Clinton Administration's policy aims to protect us first and foremost through arms control--by working hard to prevent new threats--and second, by legally pursuing the development of theater defenses for those cases where arms control is not yet successful.  
   The administration continues to cling tenaciously to the ABM Treaty, 
   which prevents us from defending ourselves against missile attack, and numerous other arms control measures have been proposed by senior officials like Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, such as bans of shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles, laser weapons, anti-satellite weapons, landmines, and even a proposal to limit the availability of assault rifles. 
   As George Will has said of the administration's arms control philosophy, ``The designation `superstition' fits because the faith of believers in arms control is more than impervious to evidence, their faith is strengthened even by evidence that actually refutes it.'' 
   There is enduring wisdom in President Reagan's statement of ``Peace through strength.'' 
   In 1780, our Nation's first President, George Washington said, ``There is nothing so likely to produce peace as to be well prepared to meet an enemy.'' Two hundred years later another President, Ronald Reagan, called this doctrine ``Peace Through Strength.'' 
   I urge Senators to think about the enduring wisdom of these statements in the coming days as we debate the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the negative effects its ratification would have on our Nation's security. 
   Let me turn now to a discussion of the CTBT's many flaws. 
   America's nuclear weapons are the most sophisticated in the world. This was the point of the letter of the former Secretaries of Defense. They pointed out that each one typically has thousands of parts, and over time in nuclear materials and high-explosive triggers in our weapons deteriorate, and we lack the experience predicting the effect of these changes. 
   Some of the materials used in our weapons, like plutonium, enriched uranium, and tritium, are radioactive materials that decay, and as they decay they also change the properties of other materials within the weapon. We lack experience predicting the effects of such aging on the safety and reliability of our weapons. 
   We did not design our weapons to last forever. The shelf life of our weapons was expected to be about 20 years. In the past, we did not encounter problems with aging weapons, because we were fielding new designs and older designs were retired. But under the CTBT, we could not field new designs to replace older weapons, because testing would be required to develop new designs. 
   Remanufacturing components of existing weapons that have deteriorated also poses significant problems. Over time, manufacturing processes will change, some chemicals previously used in the production of our weapons have been banned by environmental regulations, and our documentation of the technical characteristics of older weapons, in some cases, is incomplete. Furthermore, as James Schlesinger--who formerly served as Secretary of defense and Secretary of Energy--has testified to the Senate, the plutonium pits in some of our weapons are approaching the end of this life-span. According to Dr. Schlesinger, one of our national laboratories estimates the pits used in some of our weapons will last 35 years. Since many of the pits used in the current arsenal are about 30 years old, this means that we will soon need to replace these pits. But without testing, we will never know if these replacement parts will work as their predecessors did. 
   As the former Director of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Dr. John Nuckolls said last month in a letter to me:  
   Key components of nuclear warheads are ``aging'' by radioactive decay and chemical decomposition and corrosion. Periodic remanufacture is necessary, but may copy existing defects and introduce additional defects. Some of the remanufactured parts may differ significantly from the original parts--due to loss of nuclear test validated personnel who manufactured the original parts, the use of new material and fabrication processes, and inadequate specification of original parts. There are significant risks of reducing stockpile reliability when remanufactured parts are involved in warhead processes where there are major gaps in our scientific understanding.  
   The fact is that, despite our technical expertise, there is much we still do not understand about our own nuclear weapons. As C. Paul Robinson, Director of the Sandia National Laboratory has aid, ``some aspects of nuclear explosive design are still not understood at the level of physical principles.'' 
   These gaps in our knowledge do not merely present a theoretical problem. As President Bush noted in a report to Congress in January 1993, ``Of all U.S. nuclear weapons designs fielded since 1958, approximately one-third have required nuclear testing to resolve problems arising after deployment.'' 
   Furthermore, in 1987, Lawrence Livermore Lab produced a report titled ``Report to Congress on Stockpile Reliability, Weapon Remanufacture, and the Role of Nuclear Testing'' in which it extolled the importance of testing, noting that ``..... there is no such thing as a `thoroughly tested' nuclear weapon.'' The report also goes on to state that of the one-third of weapons designs introduced into the stockpile since 1958 that have required testing to fix, ``In three-fourths of these cases, the problems were discovered only because of the ongoing nuclear testing.'' This report went on to say that ``Because we frequently have difficulty understanding fully the effects of changes particularly seemingly small changes on the nuclear performance, nuclear testing has been required to maintain the proper functioning of our nation's deterrent.'' 
   Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger summed this point up nicely in 1986 when he said:  
   The irreducible fact is that nuclear testing is essential to providing for the safety and security of our warheads and weapons systems. It also is essential if we are to maintain their reliability. This is not a matter of conjecture, but a lesson learned through hard experience. For example, in the case of one nuclear system--the warhead for the Polaris [SLBM]--testing allowed us to fix defects that were suddenly discovered. Until corrected, these defects could have rendered the vast majority of weapons in our sea-based deterrent completely inoperable.  
   The importance of testing to the maintenance of any complex weapon or machine cannot be underestimated. As the six former Secretaries of Defense noted in this letter opposing the CTBT,  
   The history of maintaining complex military hardware without testing demonstrates the pitfalls of such an approach. Prior to World War II, the Navy's torpedoes had not been adequately tested because of insufficient funds. It took nearly two years of war before we fully solved the problems that caused our torpedoes to routinely pass harmlessly under the target or to fail to explode on contact. For example, at the Battle of Midway, the U.S. launched 47 torpedo aircraft, without damaging a single Japanese ship. If not for our dive bombers, the U.S. would have lost the crucial naval battle of the Pacific war.  
   The Clinton administration has proposed a program that it hopes will replace actual nuclear tests with computer simulations and a much greater emphasis on science-based experiments. It is called the Stockpile Stewardship Program. According to the Fiscal Year 2000 Stockpile Stewardship Plan Executive Overview, released by the Department of Energy in March this year:  
   The overall goal of the Stockpile Stewardship program is to have in place by 2010 ..... the capabilities that are necessary to provide continuing high confidence in the annual certification of the stockpile without the necessity for nuclear testing.  
   I support the Stockpile Stewardship Program because it will improve our knowledge about our nuclear weapons. But as former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, former National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft, and former CIA Director John Deutch said in a letter this week, ``the fact is that the scientific case simply has not been made that, over the long term, the United States can ensure the nuclear stockpile without nuclear testing.'' 
   First, the Stockpile Stewardship Program faces tremendous technical challenges. As the Director of Sandia National Laboratories, Dr. Robinson has said, ``the commercially available and  laboratory technologies of today are inadequate for the stockpile stewardship tasks we will face in the future. Another hundred-to-thousand-fold increase in capability from hardware and software combined will be required.'' 
   Dr. Victor Reis, the architect of the stewardship program, said this about it during a speech in Albuquerque:  
   Think about it--we are asked to maintain forever, an incredibly complex device, no larger than this podium, filed with exotic, radioactive materials, that must create, albeit briefly, temperatures and pressures only seen in nature at the center of stars; do it without an integrating nuclear test, and without any reduction in extraordinarily high standards of safety and reliability. And, while you're at it downsize the industrial complex that supports this enterprise by a factor of two, and stand up critical new manufacturing processes. 
   This within an industrial system that was structured to turn over new designs every fifteen years, and for which nuclear explosive testing was the major tool for demonstrating success.  
   Senior officials at the Department of Energy and our nuclear labs are generally careful in how they couch their remarks about the Stockpile Stewardship Program. They typically state that the stewardship program is the best approach to maintaining our weapons in the absence of testing. But they are also careful not to guarantee that, despite the unquestioned brilliance of the scientists, the Stockpile Stewardship Program will succeed in replacing testing. 
   In fact, the Stockpile Stewardship Program has already experienced setbacks. For example, the National Ignition Facility, which is the linchpin of the program, has recently fallen behind schedule and is over budget. It still faces a critical technical uncertainty about a major goal of its design: will it be able to achieve thermonuclear ignition? 
   Another problem with relying on computer simulation to replace testing is the increased risk of espionage. Former Lawrence Livermore National Lab Director John Nuckolls made this point in his letter to me as well: ``Espionage is facilitated when U.S. progress is frozen, and classified information is being concentrated and organized in electronic systems.'' In short, in order to achieve the vast increases in computing power required for the stewardship program, much of the computer code required for the program will be written by hundreds of people at participating universities and colleges--in many cases by people who are not even American citizens. 
   Mr. President, the bottom line is that a credible nuclear deterrent is just too important to put all our eggs in the stewardship basket. 
   In addition to impairing the reliability of our nuclear arsenal, the CTBT will prevent us from making our nuclear weapons as safe as they can be. This is extraordinarily important. 
   Nuclear weapon safety has always been a paramount concern of the United States. Throughout the history of our nuclear weapons program, we have made every effort to ensure that even in the most violent of accidents there would be the minimum chance of a nuclear explosion or radioactive contamination. The results of such an accident would be catastrophic. 
   That's why President Clinton's Secretary of Defense, Bill Cohen, opposed a test moratorium when he was a Senator. During debate on an amendment imposing a moratorium on testing, August 3, 1993, then-Senator Cohen said,  
   A vote to halt nuclear testing today is a vote to condemn the American people to live with unsafe nuclear weapons in their midst for years and years--indeed until nuclear weapons are eliminated. Not just a few unsafe nuclear weapons, but a nuclear stockpile in which most of the weapons do not have critical safety features.  
   I digress a moment to note when he was asked about this statement this week, now-Secretary Cohen said, we have replaced those weapons with weapons in our inventory now that are safe. 
   I know defense Secretary Cohen would agree, that is not a correct statement. All of the weapons in our current inventory lack one or more of the essential safety features that we have been talking about here. 
   As the Director of Los Alamos National Lab, Dr. Sig Hecker, indicated in a letter to me in 1997, ``with a CTBT it will not be possible to make some of the potential safety improvements for greater intrinsic warhead safety that we considered during the 1990 time frame.'' The reason is that nuclear tests must be done in many cases to confirm that once new safety features are incorporated, the weapons are reliable and still operate as intended. The CTBT makes it pointless to try to invent new, improved safety features because they could not be adopted without nuclear testing. Even worse, the CTBT eliminates the possibility of improving the safety of current weapons through the incorporation of existing, well understood safety features. 
   Safety features include items such as insensitive high explosive and fire resistant pits. Insensitive high explosive in the primary of a nuclear weapon is intended to prevent the premature detonation of the high explosive trigger, resulting in a potential nuclear explosion should the weapon be subjected to unexpected stress, like being dropped or penetrated by shrapnel or a bullet. Fire resistant pits are intended to prevent the dispersal of plutonium resulting in radioactive contamination of an area should the weapon be exposed to a fire, such as an accidental blaze during loading of a weapon on an aircraft. 
   Unfortunately, few people know that many of our current weapons do not contain all the safety features that already have been invented by our National Laboratories. Only one of the nine weapons in the current stockpile incorporates all six available safety features. In fact, three of the weapons in the stockpile--the W78 warhead, which is used on the Minuteman III ICBM, and the W76 and W88 warheads, which sit atop missiles carried aboard Trident submarines--incorporate only one of the six safety features. Another weapon, the W62 warhead, does not have any of the six safety features incorporated into its design. 
   The bottom line is that a ban on nuclear testing prevents us from making our weapons as safe as we know how to make them and creates a disincentive to making such safety improvements. 
   Mr. President, another point I think is extraordinarily important as we debate this CTBT is that the purpose of the treaty cannot be achieved by its ratification. In addition to undermining our nuclear deterrent, as I have just spoken to, the treaty will not achieve its goal of halting nuclear proliferation. 
   Supporters of the treaty say the United States must lead by example, and that by halting nuclear tests ourselves, we will persuade others to follow our example. Yet the history of the last eight years shows this theory is false. Since the United States halted testing in 1992, India, Pakistan, Russia, China, and France have all conducted tests. 
   Furthermore, the CTBT will not establish a new international norm against nuclear weapons testing or possession. The Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, the NPT ratified by 185 countries has already established such a norm. The NPT calls for parties to the treaty, other than the five declared nuclear powers--the United States, the United Kingdom, Russia, China, and France--to pledge not to pursue nuclear weapons programs. 
   Yet North Korea and Iraq, to name two who are parties to the NPT, have, of course, violated it. They have pursued nuclear weapons programs despite their solemn international pledge never to do so. The CTBT will not add anything useful to the international nonproliferation regime since these nations, in effect, would be pledging not to test the nuclear weapons they have already promised never to have under the NPT. So much for the international norm. 
   Nor will the CTBT pose a significant impediment to the acquisition of nuclear weapons by rogue nations since, although nuclear testing is essential to maintaining the sophisticated nuclear weapons in the U.S. arsenal today, it is not required to develop relatively simple first-generation nuclear devices, like those needed or being developed by Iran and Iraq. For example, the United States bomb dropped on Hiroshima was never tested, and the Israeli nuclear arsenal has been constructed without testing. 
   Incidentally, the Clinton administration does not dispute this point. In Senate testimony in 1997, CIA Director George Tenet stated:  
   Nuclear testing is not required for the acquisition of a basic nuclear weapons capability (i.e. a bulky, first-generation device  with high reliability but low efficiency.) Tests using high-explosive detonations only ([with] no nuclear yield) would provide reasonable confidence in the performance of a first generation device. Nuclear testing becomes critical only when a program moves beyond basic designs to incorporate more advanced concepts.  
   I believe Director Tenet is absolutely correct, based on the letter of the Secretary of Defense that I quoted earlier. We can't afford to underestimate the weapon described by Director Tenet--a ``bulky, first generation device with high reliability but low efficiency'' is a lot like the bomb we dropped on Hiroshima to change world history. It is a strategic weapon--if North Korea or Iran were able to deploy such a weapon, they could--to put it mildly--severely reduce our ability to protect our interests in East Asia or the Persian Gulf. These are weapons that would be designed to intimidate and kill large numbers of people in cities, not destroy purely military targets, as the United States weapons are designed to do. 
   Another problem with the CTBT is that it is totally unverifiable. It cannot be verified despite the vast array of expensive sensors and detection technology being established under the treaty, so it will be possible for other nations to conduct militarily significant nuclear testing with little or no risk of detection. Effective verification requires high confidence that militarily significant cheating will be detected in a timely manner. The United States cannot now, and will not in the near future, be able to confidently detect and identify militarily significant nuclear tests of one kiloton or less by the way, that is roughly 500 times larger than the blast which destroyed the Murrah Building in Oklahoma City. We cannot detect a test of that magnitude. 
   What is ``militarily significant'' nuclear testing? Definitions of the term might vary, but I think we'd all agree that any nuclear test that gives a nation information to maintain its weapons or to develop newer, more effective weaponry is militarily significant. 
   In the course of U.S. weapons development, nuclear tests with yields between 1 kiloton and 10 kilotons have generally been large enough to provide ``proof'' data on new weapons designs. Other nations might have weaponry that could be assessed at even lower yields. As we know, crude but strategically significant weapons, like the bomb we dropped on Hiroshima, don't need to be tested at all. But for the sake of argument, let's be conservative and assume that other nations would also need to conduct tests at a level above 1 kiloton to develop a new nuclear weapon design. 
   The verification system of the CTBT is supposed to detect nuclear blasts above 1 kiloton, so it would seem at first glance that it will be likely that most cheaters would be caught. But look at the Treaty's fine print--the CTBT's International Monitoring System will be able to detect tests of 1 kilotons or more if they are nonevasive. This means that the cheater will be caught only if he does not try to hide his nuclear test. 
   But what if he does want to hide it? What if he conducts his test evasively? 
   It is a very simple task for Russia, China, or others to hide their nuclear tests. One of the best known means of evasion is detonating the nuclear device in a cavity such as a salt dome or a room mined below ground. Because it surrounds the explosion with empty space, this technique--called decoupling--reduces the noise, or the seismic signal, of the nuclear detonation. 
   The signal of a decoupled test is so diminished--by as much as a factor of 70--that it will not be possible to reliably detect it. For example, a 1,000-ton hidden test would have a signal of a 14-ton open test. This puts the signal of the illicit test well below the threshold of detection. 
   Decoupling is a well-known technique and is technologically simple to achieve. In fact, it is quite possible that Russia and China have continued to conduct nuclear testing during the past 7 years, while the United States has refrained from doing so. They could have done so by decoupling. 
   There are also other means of cheating that can circumvent verification. One is open-ocean testing. A nation could put a device on a small boat or barge, tow it into the ocean, and detonate it anonymously. It would be virtually impossible to link the test to the cheater. 
   While evasive techniques are expensive and complex, the costs are relatively low compared to the expense of a nuclear weapons program, and no more complicated than weapons design. Further, established nuclear powers are well positioned to conduct clandestine testing to assure the reliability and undertake at least modest upgrades of their arsenals. Russia and China do not have good records on compliance with arms control and nonproliferation commitments. In addition, according to the Washington Times, United States intelligence agencies believe China conducted a small underground nuclear test in June and Russia is believed to have conducted a nuclear test earlier this month. While neither country has ratified the CTBT, both have signed the treaty and have promised to adhere to a testing moratorium. Again, so much for the norm. 
   The bottom line is that a determined country has several means to conceal its weapons tests and the CTBT is not effectively verifiable. 
   Let me stress here that my assessment is not based on opinions. Our inability to verify a whole range of nuclear testing is well-known and has been affirmed by the U.S. Intelligence Community. As the Washington Post reported earlier this week, our intelligence agencies lack the ability to confidently detect low-yield tests. We would be irresponsible in the extreme to ratify an unverifiable arms control treaty--especially when that treaty will inevitably reduce our confidence in our own nuclear deterrent. 
   President Clinton's first Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, James Woolsey, summed up the problems with verification of the treaty stating in Senate testimony that,  
   I believe that a zero-yield Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is extraordinarily difficult, to the point of near impossibility--and possibly to the point of impossibility--to verify from afar.  
   In addition to the negative consequences that would result from treaty ratification, I would also point out that this accord is very poorly crafted. The CTBT is weakest at its very foundation--it actually fails to say what it bans. Nowhere in its 17 articles and 2 annexes are the terms ``nuclear weapon test explosion'' or ``nuclear explosion'' defined or quantified and these are the terms used in the treaty's basic obligations. 
   Acting Under Secretary of State John Holum admitted this point in responses to questions for the record on June 29 of this year stating:

<TEXT>
   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am going to take just a couple of minutes until Senator COVERDELL arrives, at which point I will suspend my remarks so that he can make some comments. 
   I want to talk a little bit about a common thread of the remarks of many of the people who are in opposition to the treaty; that is, that it is difficult for the United States to sustain our position as the world leader, that many in the international community would find it objectionable if the United States rejected the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and that this would hurt our ability to lead with respect to proliferation of nuclear weapons in the world. 
   Let me quote from a newspaper story today in the Washington Post, the headline of which is, ``U.S. Allies Urge Senate To Ratify Test Ban.'' 
   It is certainly true that they have done that. There are a variety of them that made comments hoping we would adopt the treaty, not defeat it. Let me quote a couple of things.  
   International anxiety also has been compounded by new worries over U.S. efforts to escape constraints imposed by the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty, which limits the ability of the United States to build systems to defend against missile attack. 
   Russia and China say it would destabilize the strategic balance if the United States built a missile defense system, because Washington could be tempted to attack others if it felt invulnerable to retaliation. 
   Jayantha Dhanapala, the U.N. under secretary for disarmament affairs, said many countries agree to a permanent inspection regime four years ago only on the basis of a written guarantee by the nuclear powers to negotiate and ratify a worldwide test ban as one of several key steps toward nuclear disarmament.  
   I read two parts of the Washington Post story to suggest the world community, which does not want the United States to develop a ballistic missile defense, which doesn't want the United States to do anything that requires an amendment to the ABM Treaty, and some of which is very much in favor of total nuclear disarmament and has agreed to participate in this treaty only after leaders promised them this Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty would be one of several key steps toward nuclear disarmament, all of those people in the world, I submit, are not people who we want to make U.S. national defense policy. Their goals are not the same as our goals. 
   We have an obligation as the leader of the free world to ensure our nuclear deterrent is safe and reliable; they don't. We may have to do things they could never dream of doing, including nuclear testing to ensure the safety and reliability of our nuclear stockpile. They don't have to worry about that, but we do. While they can lament the fact that the United States is not willing to sign onto the treaty, they don't have the same responsibility as we do, just as they can call for us not to amend the ABM Treaty or to build a national missile defense or even theater missile defenses without the obligations that The United States has. 
   The United States has to defend our troops around the world--which most of these countries don't have to do--to defend allies around the world and, of course, even to defend the United States. I, frankly, don't care much if people around the world who don't want the United States to defend itself against ballistic missile attack are going to criticize the Senate for rejecting a flawed unverifiable ineffective CTBT. 
   Finally, quoting from the last two paragraphs of this article:  
   I don't like to talk about any country exercising world leadership, but in this case we see that the United States must play a special role, Sha Zukang, China's top arms control official, said in an interview. Sha added that China is even more alarmed by U.S. efforts to develop a regional missile defense system than by the Senate's reluctance to approve a test ban treaty.  
   So I presume that next, in order to assuage the concerns of the Chinese, we will forego the development of a regional missile defense system because it would upset them if we proceeded with that. Why would it upset them? Because, of course, they wouldn't be able to threaten Taiwan. We have obligations that other countries don't have. If we are to be the great leader that people on this side of the aisle have urged the United States to be, then we have to exercise leadership. Sometimes that means doing things other people in the world are uncomfortable with.  
   Boris Kvok, Russia's deputy chief of disarmament issues, said the U.S. decision on the test ban treaty would not affect the deliberations of Russia's parliament on the pact or alter his country's test moratorium. ``But if the U.S. moves ahead with ballistic missile defense, it would be a disaster ..... and we would have to start developing new weapons. .....''  
   He is saying we don't really care about the CTBT in terms of what we are going to do, but if the United States moves ahead with ballistic missiles, that would be a disaster. I presume next we hear people come to the Senate floor and say international opinion says we should not develop a missile defense to protect the people of the United States so we should not move forward with that. 
   My point is this: The United States cannot be held hostage to world opinion. We have obligations they don't have, and if they don't care about building a defense for their people, we need to because we can be a target of rogue nations whereas other countries may not be. They are not making the decisions and actions in the world that may cause these terrorists or rogue states to want to retaliate against them. However, the United States, by taking a world leadership role, has put itself in that position. 
   It is not a political issue; it is a physics issue. We have to have confidence in our nuclear stockpile. 
   The whole world thought Ronald Reagan was wrong, that he had left his senses when he said no to Mikhail Gorbachev at Reykjavik. They both talked about trying to rid the world of nuclear weapons. When Gorbachev said the price of that agreement was that the United States would have to forego the development of the Strategic Defense Initiative, Reagan said no. All of the world leaders gasped--except Margaret Thatcher. But the rest of the world leaders gasped and said: Mr. President, you should reconsider that. 
   All of the arms control advocates said it was a bad mistake for President Reagan to have said no. Of course, it later transpires that George Shultz mentioned the fact that Mikhail Gorbachev told him that was the turning point of the cold war. That is when Gorbachev concluded that he could not win the cold war and called it the turning point. 
   Ronald Reagan, in calling the Soviet Union the evil empire, upset a lot of the world leaders, but he stood his ground and history has proven him correct. I submit that history will 
   prove us correct if we return this flawed treaty and say let's go back to the drawing board. 
   We can do better. We can persuade world leaders it is in the best interest of long-term peace that we do better than this flawed treaty.

   Mr. KYL. Since the Senator says I know certain things, may I simply interject to make this point: As Senator BIDEN is well aware, it is important for Senators to quote only open-source material, such as newspapers, and never to refer to matters in the Intelligence Committee which are classified. So this Senator will refrain from quoting classified material and will be bound by our rules only to refer to articles and newspapers, such as the Washington Times.

   Mr. KYL. In this letter, the two former Secretaries of Energy urge the Senate to reject the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. 
   I also note, part of my submission for the RECORD earlier was letters from various former public officials who urged rejection of the treaty. Behind me is a chart detailing who some of these people are. I thought it important, since I didn't read the entire list to Senator BIDEN earlier, to acknowledge who some of these people are. 
   These are people who believe it would be a bad idea for this treaty to be ratified and who speak from experience based upon their positions in the U.S. Government. I mentioned earlier the  six former Secretaries of Defense. Secretary Schlesinger testified, and his testimony was just cited by Senator BYRD as important testimony in opposition to the treaty. People such as Dick Cheney and others are in that list of six. Secretary Weinberger testified, as well. 
   In addition to that, four former National Security Advisers; in addition to that, four former Directors of the Central Intelligence Agency. In addition to that, four former Directors of the National Laboratories--this is important because once an individual is no longer in the position of the lab Director, accountable to the Congress, to the Secretary of Energy, and to the President, that person is free to speak his mind--have been very clear about the reasons the National Laboratory Stockpile Stewardship Program cannot be an adequate substitute for testing, in addition to the former Secretaries of Energy I mentioned, former Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the former Commanders of the U.S. Strategic Command. 
   Let me also make a point I think the majority leader tried to make a few minutes ago but several people have reiterated a contrary view; that is, we have not had enough time to learn about this treaty. The message from the President of the United States transmitting this treaty was dated September 23, 1997, but the treaty was open for signature and signed by the United States a year before that, September 24, 1996. So the President waited over a year to send this treaty to the Senate for its action. Not long after that, however, the President began urging us to take it up, in two State of the Union Messages and in a variety of comments thereafter. 
   I took the President at his word, and I began studying the treaty, and I began talking to experts. I daresay there are not very many people in this body who know more about the treaty, as Senators, than I do. I know people such as Senator BIDEN and Senator LEVIN have done the same thing. They went to school and they became experts on this treaty. I recognize them as having an enormous quantity of information about it. I did, too, for a couple of years. All Senators had that opportunity. If they listened to the President, he was asking them to understand it and to bring it up. 
   There have been a variety of hearings, not just in the Foreign Relations Committee but in other committees as well. I have committee reports here. Let's see; this is from the Committee on Governmental Affairs. I have three different reports here, I believe: March 18, 1998; October 27, 1997; February 12, 1997; the Armed Services Committee hearings that have been specifically held, and so on. Of course, our knowledge does not need to exclusively come from hearings; we do have the ability to read and to talk to experts. 
   The point is, we have had ample opportunity to learn about this treaty. The problem is, there are many in this body who for months demanded a vote, but what they really want is to only have a vote when they think they can win. They do not want a vote when they are going to lose. That is why you had this cacophony of voices calling for a vote and all of a sudden, when the majority leader accommodated them and they realized they did not have the votes to win, they began saying: Oh, we need more time. We need to put this off. We need to study it more. 
   There was ample opportunity to study it. I spent a lot of time studying this treaty. I suppose I could have been doing something else, but I spent the time studying it. And every one of my colleagues could have done the same. 
   Finally, there is this notion, the President says: This is the longest-sought, hardest-fought prize in arms control history. Every President has sought this. That is simply not true. Let's go through the record. 
   President Eisenhower, who imposed a testing moratorium for 3 years, supported the idea of a test ban treaty. But his test ban treaty would have been of limited duration, 4 to 5 years, 
   and would have allowed for low-yield testing. As Senator BYRD noted a moment ago, two of the most salient points of former Secretary Schlesinger's testimony were to impress upon us the fact that this is a treaty in perpetuity that the President is asking us to sign. President Clinton's test ban treaty is for a zero yield, and everyone acknowledges you cannot verify a zero-yield treaty. That was not the treaty President Eisenhower wanted, so let's not say this all started with President Eisenhower and this is a treaty he wanted. 
   During the Kennedy administration, the Limited Test Ban Treaty which banned nuclear testing in the atmosphere, space, or underwater, was negotiated. But there was no serious effort to negotiate a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty as of the kind President Clinton submitted. Incidentally, the Johnson administration took the same position as the Kennedy administration. 
   President Nixon's administration negotiated the Threshold Test Ban Treaty but also did not make any attempt to negotiate a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty of the kind President Clinton has submitted. 
   There was no activity on the subject during the Ford administration. 
   During the Carter administration--and Secretary Schlesinger has presented some very interesting comments on this--the Peaceful Nuclear Explosion Treaty was signed and consideration was given to a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, though the United States at that time was seeking a 10-year treaty where yields of up to 2 kilotons would have been permissible. 
   Neither President Reagan nor President Bush pursued a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. In fact, responding to the Hatfield-Exon-Mitchell prohibition on testing in the 1993 Energy and Water Appropriations Act, here is what President Bush said to the Congress:  
   The administration has concluded that it is not possible to develop a test program within the constraints of Public Law 102-377 that would be fiscally, militarily and technically responsible. The requirement to maintain and improve the safety of our nuclear stockpile, and to evaluate and maintain the reliability of U.S. forces, necessitates continued nuclear testing for those purposes, albeit at a modest level, for the foreseeable future. The administration strongly urges the Congress to modify this legislation urgently in order to permit the minimum number and kind of underground nuclear tests that the United States requires, regardless of the action of other states, to retain safe, reliable, although dramatically reduced deterrent forces.  
   So much for the proposition that all of the Presidents from Eisenhower through Bush support the notion of the Clinton forever zero yield Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. It is simply not true. 
   There is another important point that President Kennedy made. President Kennedy was asked to comment on his experience with the 1958-1961 test moratorium. The reason this is important is, of course, we are looking at an 8-year moratorium on testing already here in the United States. This treaty would impose upon us a moratorium in perpetuity, with only one possible way out, and that is, it would be at least theoretically possible for the United States, if it believed, in its supreme national interest, it was required to do so--for the President to, in effect, step out of the treaty for the 
   purpose of conducting one or more tests. 
   Here is what President Kennedy had to say about the difficulty of doing that. He said:  
   Some may urge us to try a moratorium again, keeping our preparations to test in a constant state of readiness. But in actual practice, particularly in a society of free choice, we cannot keep top-flight scientists concentrating on the preparation of an experiment which may or may not take place or on an uncertain date in the future, nor can large technical laboratories be kept fully alert on a standby basis, waiting for some other nation to break an agreement. This is not merely difficult or inconvenient; we have explored this alternative thoroughly and found it impossible of execution.  
   That is what scientists tell me would be the result of a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. We already know it would take at least 2 years to regenerate the support for a nuclear test at the Nevada Test Site. There is already significant testimony on the record that it would be exceedingly difficult to get the scientific expertise concentrated for the development of such a test. There is also significant comment on the fact that, obviously, this would send a very dangerous signal to our potential adversaries because there is only one reason to conduct such a test. Under the terms of the safeguard President Clinton has offered up here, it would be in the event of concern about the safety or reliability of our stockpile. So the whole world would know, if  the United States began preparations to conduct a test, we had a problem. That would be a problem. 
   One of my friends at one of the National Laboratories has in fact said, regardless of our need to do so--although we can always gain significant scientific knowledge from a test--we ought to remain capable of conducting a test and have at least one a year, just so we avoid the problem of nations believing we have problems with our stockpile. That way, we would not only have the benefit of a test but we would never signal to anyone in the outside world we were testing because we had a problem. 
   There is another reason to have a test. When the United States began thinking about this moratorium, there was a request of the laboratories to design a way to substitute for testing, and the Stockpile Stewardship Program came from that request. But as part of that, the Directors of the laboratories recommended that a series of 10 tests a year for 10 years be conducted to validate the Stockpile Stewardship Program. Those tests have never been held. 
   One of the reasons there is great discomfort with the notion that the Stockpile Stewardship Program could actually be a substitute for testing is that it has never been validated. I note that some of our allies, countries Senator BIDEN referred to earlier such as France, that conducted tests within the last 3 years, as well as some that perhaps would not be categorized as allies, such as China, that also conducted tests within the last 3 years, as well as other countries, could well have concluded--and part of this would have to get into classified information--could well have concluded that it was in their national interests to conduct tests in order to validate scientific experiments, in order to prepare for a long period of time in which they could not test, in order to develop warheads of the kind the Russians have developed, which are very robust and which can be reproduced every several years without the necessity of testing, something which the United States never did. 
   Our moratorium was imposed, in effect, in the middle of our nuclear development program. Our weapons have all been designed to be replaced with new designs on the assumption that there would always be testing. 
   We never did this testing to get us to the point where we 
   could prepare for a moratorium, let alone an absolute ban on any testing in perpetuity. That is why the argument is absolutely false some make that we need to freeze in our advantage before others acquire the weapon; exactly the opposite is the case. 
   Some countries have developed what they believe will hold them for a long period of time in the future based on testing, while the United States rather abruptly stopped its program with President Bush and others suggesting we should go forward with testing for a variety of reasons, but we did not do so. 
   We are now caught in the position where we have aging stockpiles with several of our warheads exceeding their shelf life, with all the problems attendant with that, and a moratorium in which we have not tested for 8 years and a prospect we would have a treaty to bind us, never to test again, never having validated the substitute program. 
   This is a reason why I think those who heard testimony from lab Directors, from people such as Johnny Foster and Robert Barker and other experts who have been involved in this area for years, have been rather shocked at what they have heard and why many of them have suggested they think they need to hear more about this. 
   There is, indeed, a great body of scientific evidence that suggests it could be a very bad thing for the United States to adopt this zero-yield test in perpetuity, and no amount of more time is going to change that result. That is why, again, there is no reason to extend the time of this treaty in order to refute these scientific facts. These scientists are not going to change their views. The science does not change. Plutonium and uranium radioactively decay. That is a scientific principle, so there is some constant here and nothing, including the passage of time, is going to change that. 
   Mr. President, I ask Senator WARNER if he wants to make a comment.

<DOCNO>106-kyl-az-19-19991008</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KYL. I certainly do not want to do that. 
   There is one thing Senator BIDEN said with which I must take a little bit of issue. He noted we have some 6,000 warheads in our inventory, that this was a lot of warheads and certainly they would not all atrophy; in any event, we would always have enough, even if they were not all good. 
   I think it important to understand what our stockpile consists of right now, again, without getting into classified material. There are nine types of nuclear weapons in our arsenal. We used to have many more than that. We used to have redundant systems. Now, however, we have nine types, each of which are different. They have a different mission, and they are delivered on different delivery vehicles or by means of different platforms. 
   The total number of warheads can be divided, in effect, by nine. If any one or two or three of those classes of warheads have defects in them, it is a matter that affects all of the warheads of that category. It is not as if you have one car that is a lemon. Instead, it is as if you have a car that has to be recalled because every one of that make and model has the same problem. That is the way we have found our weapon defects to have existed in the past. 
   Let's say one-third of the weapon types have some defect. Roughly, that means about one-third of the weapons. What that means is that about one-third of the ability of the United 
   States to respond with respect to certain targets would be inhibited, but more than that, there may be many targets that are unique to that particular kind of warhead against which we have no capability. It is not as if these warheads are fungible and we can throw any of them at any target with any delivery system. Each one has a specific purpose, and it is delivered on a specific platform. That is why we should not be so cavalier about concluding that since we have a lot of warheads we, in effect, can roll the dice. 
   I have a final point, since Senator WARNER is about ready, on a comment made by my friend, Senator SPECTER, who talked about the chain reaction if India and Pakistan should begin to detonate these devices and how can we ask them to sign on to this treaty if we are not willing to set the norm, set the standard of signing. 
   I remind my colleagues, for 8 years we have been setting the norm. We have had a moratorium; we are not testing. Did that stop India? Did it stop Pakistan? Has it stopped any other number of countries that believe in their national interest they want to acquire these weapons? No. Are many of these countries signatories to the NPT? Yes. They have already forsworn these weapons. We would be asking them to also forswear the testing of weapons that we now know they already have. 
   I believe we ought to do what is in the best interest of the United States for our own security and not get into this business of questioning what other people in the world will think of us if we do not go along with what they think is a great idea. Internationally, there are a lot of great ideas in the United Nations among countries, some of whom are not friendly and some are, but the United States has tried to be a leader in the world. I suggest we lead best if we go back to the drawing board and try to do this right, perhaps along the lines of some previous Presidents, rather than the unique way President Clinton proposes to do it with the zero-yield testing in perpetuity.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program II and Local Medical Emergency Reimbursement Act. Senators MCCAIN, HUTCHISON, DOMENICI, BINGAMAN, and FEINSTEIN join me. 
   Border counties and other jurisdictions throughout the Southwest are incurring overwhelming costs to process and incarcerate illegal immigrants who commit crimes. Hospitals are also bearing steep costs to treat illegal immigrants for medical emergencies. 
   Regarding the first issue, it should be pointed out that, when states and localities do not have the resources to deal with criminal illegal immigrants, disasters can happen. Just last week, it was discovered that illegal immigrants who, in some cases, had committed serious crimes in Maricopa County, Arizona--including first degree murder in one of the cases--were permitted to post bond to the county, were then released to the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and were then allowed to return to their home country. Needless to say, those cases did not go to trial. Because the alleged criminal aliens never returned for their court date, justice was not served. 
   I continue to work toward better cooperation between the INS and local criminal justice systems, to make sure that illegal immigrants who are charged with crimes prosecuted under state law--and murder is prosecuted under state law--are held in Arizona. That means before, during, and after trial. It means, if the person is convicted, serving out his time in Arizona. 
   I will continue to work toward full funding for the federal program Congress created in 1995 to reimburse states and localities for the costs of incarcerating criminal illegal immigrants, the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP). Incarceration of criminal illegal immigrants costs state and local governments over $1 billion a year. Last year's Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations bill provided $585 million for the program, and reimbursed states approximately 39 cents on the dollar for such costs. I will work to increase federal funding for SCAAP, and will work to ensure that the FY 2000 C-J-S funding bill maintains, at the very least, the FY 1999 funding level of $585 million. 
   It is my hope that the bill I am introducing today will further enhance the ability of states and localities to prevent the release of criminal illegal immigrants by giving them the resources they need, not only to incarcerate but to process and sentence such individuals. My bill creates SCAAP II and provides an additional authorization of $200 million per year between 2001 and 2004 to states and localities for such expenditures. When illegal immigrants commit crimes and are then caught, they drain the budgets of a locality's sheriff, justice court, county attorney, clerk of the court, superior and juvenile court, and juvenile detention departments, as well as using up a county's indigent defense budget. And, even though illegal immigration is a federal responsibility, states and local jurisdictions all along the southwestern border have incurred 100 percent of specifically processing-related costs to date. This bill will change that. 
   Unfortunately, we do not yet know the full financial burden the states and localities are bearing. I am hopeful that the FY 2000 Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations bill conference report will include funding for a study that will lay out realistic estimates of these costs. 
   What is known is that such expenditures comprise approximately 39 percent of the aforementioned budgets of just one Arizona county, Santa Cruz, with a population of just 36,000 residents. As a recent report conducted by the University of Arizona detailed, ``such illegal entry pressures place inequitable demands on the resources and taxpayers of Santa Cruz County.'' 
   Other counties throughout the Southwest are in the same boat. Maricopa County, Arizona, for example, incurs costs of $9 million to incarcerate illegal criminal immigrants. It is unclear what its costs are to process and sentence such aliens. Cochise County incurs costs of approximately $406,000 per year to incarcerate criminal illegal immigrants and, therefore, must also incur significant costs to process and sentence these individuals. Providing resources to states and localities with such burdens will help prevent the release of criminals onto our nation's streets, and is clearly the financial responsibility of the federal government. 
   The second issue addressed by this bill is the burden borne by hospitals in southwestern states. The federal government is obligated to fully reimburse states, localities, and hospitals for the emergency medical treatment of illegal immigrants. 
   According to a preliminary Congressional Budget Office estimate provided two years ago, the total annual cost to treat illegal immigrants for medical emergencies is roughly $2.8 billion a  year. It is roughly estimated that the federal government reimburses states for approximately half of those costs. That means states must pay the remaining $1.4 billion. The state of Arizona estimates that it incurs unreimbursed costs of $20 million annually to treat undocumented immigrants on an emergency basis. 
   This legislation will provide states, localities, and hospitals an additional $200 million per year to help absorb the costs of adherence to federal law, under which all individuals, regardless of immigration status or ability to pay, must be provided with medical treatment in a medical emergency. I have heard from individual doctors in Arizona, and hospitals as well, conveying their frustration in the face of these daunting costs. 
   Mr. President, I hope we can address these very pressing issues in the coming months, and that Members will consider joining my cosponsors and me in support of this bill.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, we should step back from the rhetoric for a moment and calmly ask the question: What is this debate all about? It is about two simple ideas. They are competing ideas, and neither one is necessarily a bad idea. The question is which one is better. 
   On the one hand, we have an idea that comes from Washington, DC. It is not a bad idea. It comes from very smart people. The idea is that a lot of school districts in this country could benefit by having the money to hire more teachers. There is nothing wrong with that. Washington, DC, has a lot of bright people, and sometimes some good ideas come from them. 
   But every school district in this country is different. What the Kennedy-Murray amendment will provide for is only one program, only one idea, and that is that Federal money would be available for one purpose and one purpose only: the hiring of more teachers. 
   As I said, it is a fine idea; it is good for many but not all. That is where the other idea comes into play. The other idea is that the same amount of money should be made available to the local school districts to be used not just to hire more teachers but for any other legitimate purpose which they believe would best meet the needs of their students based upon their circumstances. 
   It is a matter of choice. A school district may well decide that what they need more than anything else is to get new books for their library or new computers for the kids or to develop a new reading program; maybe, in view of what is happening to some schools around the country today, to make sure their schools are safer, to provide new antidrug or drug education programs in the schools. 
   We believe strongly that every parent and child in this country should be guaranteed a safe and drug-free, quality education for themselves or their children. What that means in a school district in Brooklyn, NY, may be very different from what it means in a school district in rural Arizona, for example. 
   So what the amendment propounded by Senator GORTON says is: Let's let the local school districts decide what to do with this money. The people in Washington may well be right that it ought to be used to hire teachers, but maybe the local folks have a better idea for their school district as to what they think that money should be used for. 
   I ask my colleagues on the other side, what is the matter with choice? Why wouldn't you want to give the local school districts the choice over how to use that money? I think the answer is: Well, because that is not our idea. We in Washington have a better idea. We know what's best. 
   The presumption is, we know what is best for every school district in the country. But that isn't true. It is the folks who know the kids' names, who are right there in the local community, who understand what they need most. If they could use that money for purposes other than hiring a new teacher or to better the education of their kids--because maybe they have 
   enough teachers--then why shouldn't we give them that choice? It is a very simple proposition--two competing ideas: Washington knows best or letting the school district decide. 
   There is another potential problem with the Murray amendment. Perhaps those more familiar with the funding could speak to this issue, but I think there is a significant likelihood that with $200 million more in money under the Murray amendment, the forward funding concept being proposed here would result in that money coming from the Social Security trust fund. If there is any chance of that happening, I must say, we should be firmly and unequivocally in opposition. 
   We should not be here today making decisions which--maybe not next year but the year after--could result in taking money from the Social Security trust fund, even to fund something as beneficial as education. There is plenty of room in the non-Social Security budget for all of the things we need to do. Remember, this year we have a surplus. The President just announced the size of that surplus--well over $100 billion. Much of that is in the non-Social Security side of the budget. 
   A surplus, by definition, means that after we have paid for everything else we need, we have money left over. So we are not talking about not being able to fund what we need to fund.

   Mr. KYL. Fine. I will take just another minute and a half of the 2 minutes of which I asked. 
   Just to summarize the point here, there are a lot of good ideas that come out of Washington, DC. We provide money for them. But we should not presume that everything we come up with here fits every single school district in the country. There may be needs in one area that are not shared in another area; whereas one school district may need teachers, another school district may say, down the road we may need to hire more teachers, but what is more needed is a better math program or a better history program or whatever it might be. 
   We ought to give them that chance--that is all the Gorton amendment says--instead of saying they can only spend the money on one thing. The Gorton amendment provides that they can spend the money on a variety of things. The application is simple. They simply set their goals, and a year later they demonstrate whether they have met their goals. If they have, they can re-up for the money. If they have not, they cannot. So it is a very goal-oriented program, and they are the ones who set the goals. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the Gorton amendment to the Murray amendment.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, Sandra Day O'Connor was born on March 26, 1930, the first of three children of Harry A. Day and Ada Mae Wilkey Day. After attending secondary school in El Paso, she pursued her undergraduate education at Stanford University. 
   Justice O'Connor initially studied economics at Stanford with the ultimate goal of running her family ranch. She was uninterested in the law until she took a business law class her junior year. She fell in love with law. Justice O'Connor enrolled in Stanford law school, and was able to graduate with her undergraduate and law degrees in 6 years. She excelled in law school, becoming a member of the Stanford Law Review's board of editors and graduating third in her class. While in Stanford Law School, she met her future husband, John Jay O'Connor III, as well as future Chief Justice William Rehnquist. 
   Upon graduating, the only job offer she received was for a position as a legal secretary. Unable as a female attorney to find employment with a private firm, she became a deputy county attorney in California. Soon after, her husband joined the Judge Advocate General's office for the U.S. Army and was stationed in Germany. Justice O'Connor joined her husband oversees as a civilian lawyer for the Quartermaster Corps. 
   The young couple returned to the United States in 1957, settling in Phoenix, Arizona. Within 6 years, the O'Connor's had three sons: Scott, Brian, and Jay. In 1958, after the birth of her first child, Justice O'Connor and a friend started their own law firm. Two years later, after the birth of her second child, Justice O'Connor became a full-time mother and immersed herself in volunteer work. She was a volunteer juvenile-court referee, chair of a juvenile home visiting board, and she organized a lawyer-referral service. In 1965, she returned to public service as an assistant state attorney general for Arizona. 
   In 1969, Justice O'Connor was appointed to a vacated seat in the Arizona Senate by the County Board of Supervisors. She won reelection to the Senate for two successive terms. Not surprisingly, she excelled as a state senator, and in 1972 she was elected majority leader. As would become standard for her, she was the first woman to hold such a senior legislative office anywhere in the United States. 
   In 1974, Justice O'Connor was elected to the Maricopa County Superior Court, where she served for 5 years. She was later encouraged to run for Governor, but declined. In 1979, Governor Bruce Babbitt's first appointee to the Arizona Court of Appeals was Sandra Day O'Connor. 
   On August 19, 1981, President Reagan nominated Justice O'Connor to become the 102nd Supreme Court Justice, replacing the retiring Justice Potter Stewart. She was the first woman nominee to the Supreme Court. She was confirmed by a vote of 99 to 0, and took the oath of office on September 25, 1981. 
   Justice O'Connor's tenure on the Court has been marked by her defense  of states' rights, equal protection, and religious liberty. Justice O'Connor is known as a restrained jurist, a strong supporter of federalism, and a cautious interpreter of the Constitution. 
   She has been described not only as committed and intense, but also as warm and down-to-earth, and a loving mother and grandmother. 
   Last Wednesday, September 22nd was the 18th anniversary of their confirmation as Justice of the United States Supreme Court, and last Saturday was the 18th anniversary of the day she took the oath of office. To honor her service to this nation and to the law, Senator MCCAIN and I have introduced a bill to name the new Phoenix courthouse in her honor as the ``Sandra Day O'Connor United States Courthouse.'' 
   Obviously Justice O'Connor, being extremely modest, has repeatedly declined my overtures to have the courthouse named after her. However, in the face of my continued campaign and my obvious determination to see that she is given the recognition she has earned--and because the timeline of the courthouse's construction and dedication next spring require immediate action on the Senate's schedule--the Justice finally relented and allowed me to go forward with this legislation. 
   Justice O'Connor's place in history is set: she has been a trailblazer for women in the law--rising to the top in every area in which she has worked. Justice O'Connor is one of the most important jurists in our nation's history, It is fitting that a beautiful, yet very functional new Federal courthouse in Phoenix, Arizona, be dedicated in her honor.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved a bipartisan bankruptcy-reform bill on May 5 by a vote of 313 to 108. The Senate Judiciary Committee reported a similar initiative in April by a vote of 14 to 4, and my hope is that the full Senate will follow suit before the year is out. 
   Mr. President, most Americans carefully manage their finances, pay their bills, and never face the prospect of bankruptcy, yet we rarely hear about them when bankruptcy reform is debated. These are the people who ultimately bear the cost when others seek bankruptcy protection. They pay in terms of higher interest rates and higher prices on goods and services. This bankruptcy tax costs the average household more than $400 a year. 
   There will always be a limited number of people who unexpectedly experience some catastrophe in their lives--maybe a death or divorce, or a serious illness--that throws their finances into chaos. That is why we accept as a given that society will bear some of the cost of bankruptcy, and why we maintain access to bankruptcy relief for those who truly need it. No one suggests closing off bankruptcy as an option for those who are in truly dire straits. 
   A line does need to be drawn, however, when people, particularly those with above-average incomes who have the means and ability to repay their debts, nevertheless seek to have those debts erased in bankruptcy. This is happening more and more often, and unless we get the problem in check, it is going to wreak havoc. 
   Mr. President, there is nothing fair about forcing a single mother, who is already struggling to pay her own family's bills, to pay more merely because someone who can repay his or her debts prefers to escape them in bankruptcy. There is nothing fair about forcing young families or seniors on fixed incomes to pay more so that someone can walk away from his or her debts as a matter of convenience or financial planning. 
   Few bills so clearly protect the interests of consumers, yet the bankruptcy-reform bill does have its critics. Much of the criticism, I think, misses the mark. Two professors of law, Todd Zywicki and James White, wrote to the Judiciary Committee recently about some of the claims that have been made, and what they had to say is worthy of the consideration of every member of this body.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Defense authorization conference report. The debate on this bill comes at time when our nation faces a host of new national security challenges, like the growing missile threat, the spread of weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, potential information warfare attacks on our critical infrastructure, and aggressive espionage directed at our nuclear laboratories. 
   It also comes at a time when our armed forces are facing critical shortfalls in readiness and recruitment and retention. Our men and women in uniform are stretched to the limit, with deployments around the globe to places such as Kosovo, Bosnia, East Timor, the Persian Gulf, the Sinai Peninsula, South Korea, and the list goes on and on. 
   Senator WARNER and his colleagues on the Armed Services Committee have produced a good bill that begins to address some of these problems. 
   First, the bill authorizes a total of $288.8 billion for DoD and the national security programs at the Energy Department--$8.3 billion more than the President's request. It also increases funding for readiness by $1.5 billion and procurement by $3 billion above the President's request. 
   The bill provides a 4.8% pay raise for our men and women in uniform, reforms the military pay tables, and improves the retirement system, which should help with recruitment and retention problems. 
   It authorizes $403 million over the President's request for missile defense, $150 million more than requested for the protection of DoD's computer networks, and authorizes and fully funds 17 new National Guard rapid response teams to respond to terrorist attacks in the U.S.--12 more than requested by the Administration. 
   And finally, this bill contains a series of provisions to reorganize the Department of Energy in order to improve security and counterintelligence. Over the past few months, we have all heard the sobering news about how our nation's security has been damaged by China's theft of America's most sensitive secrets. Earlier this year, the declassified version of the bipartisan Cox Committee report was released, which unanimously concluded that China stole classified information on every nuclear warhead currently in the U.S. arsenal, as well as the neutron bomb--literally, the crown jewels of our nuclear stockpile. 
   An interagency group established by CIA Director Tenet, with representatives from each of the U.S. intelligence agencies, also prepared a damage assessment, which unanimously concluded that ``China obtained through espionage classified U.S. nuclear weapons information,'' including ``design information on several modern U.S. nuclear reentry vehicles,'' and ``information on a variety of U.S. weapon design concepts and weaponization features.'' 
   After the effects of China's espionage came to light, the President asked his Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, led by former Senator Rudman, to look into the matter. The board released its findings in June, calling for sweeping organizational reform of DOE to address what it described as ``the worst security record on secrecy'' that the panel members ``have ever encountered.'' 
   The bipartisan panel cited as the root cause of DOE's poor security record ``organizational disarray, managerial neglect, and a culture of arrogance..... [which] conspired to create an espionage scandal waiting to happen.'' Terrible problems were uncovered during the panel's investigation. For example, employees at nuclear facilities compared their computer systems to automatic teller machines allowing top secret withdrawals at our nation's expense. 
   The Rudman report pulled no punches, noting that, ``The Department of Energy is a dysfunctional bureaucracy that has proven it is incapable of reforming itself..... The long traditional and effective method of entrenched DOE and lab bureaucrats is to defeat security reform initiatives by waiting them out.'' 
   Although Energy Secretary Richardson announced several new initiatives to change management and procedures at DOE, the Presidential panel's report states, ``we seriously doubt that his initiatives will achieve lasting success,'' and notes, ``moreover, the Richardson initiatives simply do not go far enough.'' It is because of these problems that the Presidential panel recommended that Congress act to reorganize the Department by statute, so that the bureaucracy could not simply wait out another Secretary of Energy. 
   In response to the reports of security problems at our nuclear facilities, Senator DOMENICI, Senator MURKOWSKI, and I drafted legislation to implement the recommendations of the Rudman panel. Our legislation gathered all the parts of our nuclear weapons programs under one semi-autonomous agency within DOE, with clear lines of authority, responsibility, and accountability, with one person in charge, called the Administrator, who will continue to report to the Energy Secretary. Our legislation, which was offered as an amendment to the intelligence authorization bill, was passed by the Senate on July 21st by an overwhelming vote of 96 to 1. I want to thank Senator WARNER for working with us to include this legislation in the Defense Authorization Conference Report. 
   A semiautonomous agency, created by statute, is the only way we are going to solve the problems with DOE's management of the nuclear weapons complex, that are long-standing, systemic, and go to the very heart of the way the Department is managed, structured, and organized. To begin with, this semi-autonomous agency will establish a clear mission for the organization, by separating the management of the nuclear weapons programs at DOE from the rest of the Department that is responsible for a broad range of unrelated tasks like setting energy efficiency standards for refrigerators. The provisions of the Conference Report also establish a clear chain of command for our nuclear weapons programs and facilities to establish accountability--something that the Rudman report said was ``spread so thinly and erratically [at DOE] that it is now almost impossible to find.'' 
   Since the conference report was filed in August, some opponents of DOE reorganization have charged that this legislation would exempt the new semi-autonomous agency from environmental and safety laws and regulations--a charge which is simply false. Section 3261 of the bill, which I would note is identical to the language in the amendment passed by the Senate 96 to 1, states, ``The Administrator shall ensure that the Administration complies with all applicable environmental, safety, and health statutes and substantive requirements.'' Furthermore, section 3261 states, ``Nothing in this title shall diminish the authority of the Secretary of Energy to ascertain and ensure that such compliance occurs.'' 
   I would also note, that section 3211, which establishes the mission of the new agency clearly states, ``In carrying out the mission of the Administration,  the Administrator shall ensure that all operations and activities of the Administration are consistent with the principles of protecting the environment and safeguarding the safety and health of the public and of the workforce of the Administration.'' 
   Some critics have also falsely charged that this legislation would narrow or supercede existing waiver of sovereign immunity agreements with the states and undercut the Federal Facility and Compliance Act, which clarified that states have regulatory authority over hazardous waste management and clean-up. Mr. President, I would point out that Federal Facility Compliance Agreements are based on waivers of sovereign immunity established under applicable federal environmental statutes, which are not affected by this bill. As section 3296 makes clear, ``unless otherwise provided in this title, all provisions of law and regulations in effect immediately before the effective date of this title..... shall continue to apply to the corresponding functions of the Administration.'' 
   It is well past time to correct the chronic security problems at our nuclear facilities. Earlier this year, four committee's in the Senate held six hearings specifically on the legislation Senator DOMENICI, Senator MURKOWSKI, and I proposed. The time has come to act. Great harm to our nation's security has already been done, and if we want to prevent further damage, we must act to reform the way we manage our nuclear weapons programs and facilities to create accountability and responsibility. Our most fundamental duty as Senators is to protect the safety and security of the American people. They deserve no less than our best in this regard. I urge my colleagues to support the passage of this important bill.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I have had the pleasure of attending the subcommittee meeting this morning, and I heard witnesses who are victims of the terrorists who were given clemency. It was a heartbreaking experience, frankly, because at the conclusion of it one understands that we haven't closed a chapter by doing this. In fact, the President has probably opened a new chapter. I believe there will be additional terrorism as a result of the clemency that he ordered. I hope that will be addressed by this Senate, working together with the administration, so we can continue a policy which has been effective heretofore, and that is making certain that terrorists are hunted down, prosecuted, and incarcerated so they can't commit terrorist acts again. 
   To the extent the President's actions in this case were different from that past policy, they should be condemned, and we as a Senate should make sure it doesn't continue in the future. So I commend the chairman of the subcommittee for holding his hearing. I indicate again that the Judiciary Committee will have its hearing tomorrow and will have more to say about this.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I just want to talk for a brief bit of time on the Interior appropriations bill and on some matters that are very important to people throughout this country, particularly in the West. But let me begin by making a comment about what the Senator from North Dakota has just said. In fact, he has said that he is going to threaten to bring the business of the Senate to a halt unless he gets his way, and what he wants to do is have a debate on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. 
   There are a lot of important things facing this country. But to quote from the President of the United States, who very recently gave a talk about putting first things first, it seems to me that most of the American people would like to put first things first, and that would include matters such as the continuation of the running of the Government for the next year which would require us to pass appropriations bills to fund the various Departments of the Government, not the least of which is the Department of the Interior which is what we are going to be talking about next. There will be plenty of time to debate the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. 
   But in terms of the priority of this country, I think our colleagues need to understand that treaty can't even go into effect until 100 percent of the major countries of the world sign it. There are many countries that haven't signed it. It is going to be years before that treaty goes into effect. There is no rush for the United States to have to take up that treaty. 
   To be threatened with stopping all business of the Senate until it can debate the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, I hope my colleague will reconsider his position on that. We talk about what I consider to be first things first, and that would be to finish our business here, which is, first of all, to get the appropriations bills passed and sent to the President for his consideration.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, one of the appropriations bills we have yet to act upon is the Interior appropriations bill, as Senator THOMAS pointed out. He comes from the State of Wyoming. I come from the State of Arizona. Practically every State west of the Mississippi is significantly impacted by this bill because, as I am sure you are well aware, Mr. President, coming from the State of Montana, more than a third of this Nation's lands are owned by the Federal Government. Most of those are in the western United States. Many of those lands are under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Interior. 
   This is an extraordinarily important bill for the people of our States. I just want to discuss one aspect of it that is very important for my State of Arizona and other States in the western United States. 
   We have a very difficult condition in our national forests now. They have been probably--I think it is not too strong a term--``mismanaged'' over the years. It has been a combination of things. It has been the combination of the Forest Service, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of the Interior, the grazing on public lands, the way that fire suppression has taken off, and some other things which have resulted in the condition where, instead of healthy forests of large trees that have great environmental value and value to the other flora and fauna in the forest and which present a relatively safe situation in terms of forest fires, we now have a situation in the West where our forests are literally becoming overgrown. 
   They are becoming so thick and dense with small-growth trees that:

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I begin by commending the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator ROTH, and our leadership, Senators LOTT and NICKLES, for their tremendous work on this bill. Members have heard Senator NICKLES discuss the details of the bill, the many things that have been included in this bill. Through his leadership, a lot of the things that Members of the Republican Party and people I represent who have talked to me about tax policy wanted in this bill have gotten included in the bill. I think they did a tremendous job in ensuring that the tax relief for taxpayers became a part of this tax package. 
   I won't go over the details of the bill as Senator NICKLES has just done, but I want to note that this is, as he said, the largest middle-class tax cut since Ronald Reagan was President. It is based on the same kind of progrowth, broad-based policies that will let all taxpayers keep more of their hard-earned money.

   Mr. KYL. I thank the distinguished assistant majority leader. I agree that by including the repeal of the estate tax, sometimes called the death tax, in this legislation, we have laid down a marker and pretty well ensured that sooner or later it is going to be repealed. 
   Obviously, for the time being, we may have to pay it down a little bit and find it is repealed in maybe the ninth or tenth year. Hopefully, by virtue of the fact we have agreed that it has to go eventually, we will repeal it, and hopefully it will be sooner rather than later because some of my friends have kidded, saying: You know, it is fine you get this repealed 9 years from now, but that means I have to hang on for another 9 years. I am not sure that is possible. Besides that, I have to do the expensive estate planning in the meantime. 
   We prefer to get that eliminated sooner rather than later. I think it is a testament to the leadership of Senator NICKLES, majority leader Senator LOTT, and Senator ROTH, as well as our friends in the House who were in agreement that the death tax had to go. That important provision was included in this election. 
   Rather than describe the specifics of this program, let me note, when I turned on the television this morning I heard a report on CNN. Reporters had gone to Orange County in California. They found the average citizen on the street there really didn't like this tax relief that much. 
   They said: Why do we need to do it? After all, shouldn't we be saving the Social Security surplus for paying down the debt or for Social Security? 
   I say as plainly and clearly as I can: That is exactly what we do. We are not spending the Social Security surplus. Every dime of the Social Security surplus is set. It is not the subject of this tax bill. 
   There are two kinds of surplus. First, FICA taxes fund the Social Security payments to seniors. We collect more in FICA taxes than current beneficiaries require under Social Security. So there is a surplus. We don't use that for the tax cut. 
   Now, there are all of the other tax payment provisions of the code. We have to pay income tax, the estate tax, the capital gains tax, these other taxes. They, too, are producing more revenue than we need. We are not spending as much as we are collecting. That is the surplus we are talking about for tax relief. 
   As Senator NICKLES said a moment ago, out of the entire surplus, only 25 cents of it is going for tax relief. When some of our friends on the other side of the aisle or the President say we can't afford tax relief; we should be saving the Social Security surplus, they are fooling the American people. The truth is, the Social Security surplus is not being used for this tax relief--not a penny of it. 
   As a matter of fact, those people who say we should pay down the national debt should understand that both under the President's plan and under our plan, any amount of the Social Security surplus that isn't necessary for Social Security is used to do what? Pay down the national debt. That is what the Social Security surplus is being used for. 
   Let's not be confused. There are good reasons for a tax cut. The money for the tax cut is not coming out of the money for Social Security or for paying off our national debt. That is the fundamental point I wanted to reiterate. 
   Different provisions of the bill stress the point that Senator NICKLES made, which is that finally we have achieved in law--we will by the time we vote for this--that the death tax is going to be repealed. I think that sends a very important message as we continue to craft tax legislation. Should the President veto this bill, that will permit us  to include that principle in whatever eventually is sent to the President and, hopefully, signed into law. 
   The Taxpayer Refund and Relief Act, which is really the largest middle-class tax cut since Ronald Reagan was President, is based upon the kind of broad-based, pro-growth policies that will help all taxpayers and keep our nation's economic expansion on track. 
   Mr. President, this measure really represents a departure from the kind of targeted tax cuts that we have seen in the past. Taxpayers will not have to jump through hoops, or behave exactly as Washington wants, to see relief. If you pay taxes, you get to keep more of what you earn. It is as simple as that. The marginal income-tax rate reductions in this bill refund to all taxpayers a share of the tax overpayment that has created our budget surpluses. Those in the lowest income-tax bracket will see a seven percent reduction in their taxes. Those in the highest tax bracket will see a reduction of about half that size. I would have preferred an across-the-board reduction that helped everyone more than this. But recognizing the constraints imposed on the Finance Committee by the budget resolution, I think this is a very good product. 
   In addition to marginal rate reductions, the bill would eliminate two of the most egregious taxes imposed on the American people: the marriage-tax penalty and the death tax. There is simply no reason that two of life's milestones should trigger a tax, let alone the steep taxes that are imposed on people when they get married and when they die. Eliminating them is the right thing to do. 
   To eliminate the marriage penalty for most taxpayers, the standard deduction for joint returns would be set at two times the single standard deduction, and the new 14 percent income-tax bracket would be adjusted to two times the single bracket, phased in over the life of the bill. This will solve the problem for most taxpayers, but we need to make clear that, although we have devoted fully 50 percent of the relief in this bill to broad-based and marriage-penalty relief, we will not have eliminated the marriage penalty entirely. We will still need to come back and address the problem for taxpayers who choose to itemize. 
   The bill also phases out the death tax over the next several years, so that by 2009 it is completely eliminated. I would ask Senators to carefully review the details of what is proposed here, because I believe they will find that the bill offers a way for those on both sides of the aisle to bridge our differences with respect to how transfers at death are taxed. 
   The beauty of the proposal is that it takes death out of the equation. Death would no longer be a taxable event. It would neither confer a benefit--the step-up in basis allowed under current law--nor a penalty--the punitive, confiscatory death tax. 
   The provisions are based upon the bipartisan, Kyl-Kerrey Estate Tax Elimination Act, S. 1128, which would treat inherited assets like any other asset for tax purposes. A tax on the capital gain would be paid, the same as if the decedent had sold the property during his or her lifetime, but the tax would be paid only if and when the property is sold. 
   If the beneficiaries of an estate hold onto an asset--for example, if they continue to run the family business or farm--there would be no tax at all. No death tax or capital-gains tax. It is only if they sell and realize income from the property that a tax would be due, and then it would be at the applicable capital-gains rate. 
   This simple and straightforward concept attracted a bipartisan group of cosponsors, including Democratic Senators KERREY, BREAUX, ROBB, LINCOLN, and WYDEN, and about a dozen Senators from the Republican side. If the President makes good on his threat to veto this tax-relief bill, our bipartisan initiative provides a blueprint for how we should deal with the death tax in future tax legislation. 
   Mr. President, another important feature of this tax bill is its capital-gains tax-rate reduction. It will reduce capital-gains tax rates another two percent, so that the top rate is only about two-thirds of where it was just a few years ago. 
   Why is another capital-gains reduction important? Let me quote President John F. Kennedy, who answered that very question: ``The present tax treatment of capital gains and losses is both inequitable and a barrier to economic growth.'' He proposed excluding 70 percent of capital gains from tax, which, if you applied the same concept today, would result in a top rate of about 11.88 percent. That is lower than the top rate of 18 percent proposed in the bill we have before us. 
   President Kennedy explained that ``[t]he tax on capital gains directly affects investment decisions, the mobility and flow of risk capital from static to more dynamic situations, the ease or difficulty experienced by new ventures in obtaining capital, and thereby the strength and potential for growth of the economy.'' 
   In other words, if we are concerned about whether new jobs are being created, whether new technology is developed, whether workers have the tools they need to do a more efficient 
   job, we should support measures that reduce the cost of capital to facilitate the achievement of all of these things. Remember, for every employee, there was an employer who took risks, made investments, and created jobs. But that employer needed capital to start. 
   President Kennedy recognized that. He recognized that our country is stronger and more prosperous when our people are united in support of a common goal--and that we are weaker and more vulnerable when punitive policies divide Americans, group against group, whether along racial lines or economic lines. 
   While some politicians may employ divisive class warfare to their political advantage, President Kennedy had the courage to put good policy ahead of demagogic politics. I am with him, and I support the capital-gains reduction in this bill. 
   There are several other provisions that I want to mention briefly, because they, too, will help keep the economic expansion going: the increase in the IRA contribution limit, the alternative minimum tax relief, and the increased expensing allowance. These are things that will encourage the capital formation needed to help keep the United States competitive in world markets, producing jobs and better pay for our citizens. 
   The bill addresses the critical issue of health care as well, providing an above-the-line deduction for prescription-drug insurance, and a 100 percent deduction, phased in over time, for health-insurance costs for people not covered by employer plans. 
   We encourage savings for education by increasing the amount that individuals can contribute to education savings accounts. Funds in these accounts could be used for elementary and secondary education expenses, in addition to higher education. The exclusion for employer-provided educational assistance would be extended, and the 60-month limit for deducting interest on student loans would be repealed. 
   Mr. President, a few final points before closing. Providing the tax relief in this bill will not require us to use any of the Social Security surplus in any year. In fact, all of the Social Security surplus will be reserved for Social Security. In all, about 75 percent of anticipated budget surpluses over the next decade would still be set aside for Social Security, Medicare, and other domestic priorities, including debt reduction. 
   It is only the remaining 25 percent of the available surplus that would be refunded to American taxpayers. In other words, we are proposing to refund just 25 cents of every surplus dollar back to the people who sent it to Washington. It is a sensible and a modest initiative. 
   Remember, the $792 billion in tax relief would be provided over a 10-year period. If you include enough years in the calculation, of course, the amount sounds large, but we are really only talking about an average of $80 billion a year. 
   To put that into perspective, the federal government will collect $1.8 trillion this year alone. It will collect $2.7 trillion by the end of the 10-year period, in 2009. The amount of tax relief we are considering is very modest--not risky, not irresponsible at all, as the President would have us believe. 
   Even accounting for the proposed tax cut, the debt would be reduced substantially. The Budget Committee chairman gave us the numbers last week. Publicly held debt would decline from  $3.8 trillion to $900 billion by 2009. Interest costs are forecast to decline from more than $200 billion annually to about $71 billion a year. In fact we reduce debt and debt-service costs more than the President would in his budget, because President Clinton would spend nearly $1 trillion on new initiatives. According to the Congressional Budget Office, part of the President's new spending would even be funded out of the Social Security surplus. 
   To the extent that there is any surplus in the non-Social Security part of the budget, it is because we will have already taken care of the core obligations of government--things like education, health care, the environment, and defense. It is true that we may not launch some new initiatives, or fund lower priority programs, but I believe it is appropriate to refund part of the tax overpayment to hard-working taxpayers before funding new endeavors. 
   Mr. President, if a corner business did what the federal government is doing, it would be accused of gouging. We are charging the taxpayers too much, taking more than the government needs to fund its obligations. We ought to return this overpayment to the people who earned it, instead of thinking up new ways to spend it in Washington. 
   Mr. President, again I commend the leaders who were able to put this package together. I intend to vote for it and encourage my colleagues to do so. 
   I yield whatever time is remaining to the Senator from Delaware.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would like to speak for just a moment to alert my fellow Senators and others about an important development this evening which I think we categorize as another piece of good news, in addition to the adoption of the conference report on the tax reform just concluded by the Senate. 
   Even though the conference report is in the process of being signed and has not yet been filed, I think I can advise my colleagues that later on this evening the House and Senate Armed Services Committees will have concluded their conference report, including the important revisions of the Department of Energy which follow generally along the lines of the so-called Rudman report recommendations and the amendment that Senators MURKOWSKI and DOMENICI and I filed earlier in this session to reorganize the Department of Energy. 
   The House and Senate had both passed versions of that reform of the Department of Energy. The matter was concluded today in the House-Senate conference report of the Armed Services bill, and that is the vehicle by which the reorganization of the Department of Energy will occur. 
   Just to recapitulate a little bit about how this came about, if you will recall, as a result of the espionage that resulted in the Chinese receiving significant secrets about nuclear weapons of the United States and the possibility that some of that information had come out of our National Laboratories, there was a great deal of study of the security at our National Labs and in the weapons program generally of the Department. 
   The President's own Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, the so-called PFIAB, headed by former Senator Warren Rudman, issued a report, really a scathing indictment of the Department of Energy, its past security policies or lack of security, and its inability to reorganize itself notwithstanding Secretary Richardson's efforts to begin to reorganize the Department. What it said was the Department of Energy was incapable of reorganizing itself. They reiterated a long list of things which the Department had failed to do, which it had failed to put into place, and described the whole situation at the Department as such that it was impossible to expect them to be able to do this on their own. 
   Therefore, the Rudman commission recommended strongly the Congress do this reorganization by legislation. That is when Senators DOMENICI, MURKOWSKI and I reoriented our amendment to follow closely the Rudman commission recommendations and introduced that as an amendment before this body. 
   It was originally introduced to the Armed Services bill. It was later put on the Intelligence bill instead. But the Armed Services Committee took the amendment and has worked it now in the conference committee, as I said. As a result of their agreement tonight, there will be a reorganization of the Department, assuming the President signs the Defense authorization bill, which I am sure he would want to do. 
   Reorganization was agreed to in principle by Secretary Richardson, although there were many things he wanted to change in the detail of it. But what it will do in a nutshell is to establish within the Department of Energy a semiautonomous agency that will have the accountability and the responsibility for managing our nuclear weapons and complex including the National Laboratories. It will be headed by a specific person, an Under Secretary, who will be responsible to the Secretary directly and to a Deputy Secretary if the Secretary so desires. 
   While, of course, the Secretary of Energy remains in general control of all of his Department, including the semiautonomous agency, on a day-to-day basis it is anticipated this agency will be operated by the Under Secretary, who is responsible for its functions. It will involve security, intelligence, counterintelligence, all of the different weapons, the Navy nuclear program and the other things at the laboratory that relate to our nuclear weapons. To a large extent it will remove the influences of other parts of the Department  of Energy over the nuclear weapons program. 
   One of the things the Rudman commission found was that there were too many people with their fingers in the pie; that the laboratories and the weapons program people were having to get too many sign-offs from too many other people around the Department to work efficiently and effectively. The input of the field offices made it very difficult to know who was responsible, and it was hard to find out in some cases who you even had to get sign-offs from in order to get anything done. They said, in effect, it was no wonder the left hand didn't know what the right hand was doing and that is why they recommended a very clear chain of command, a very clear line of authority with accountability and responsibility with one person at the top and a bunch of people answerable to him and only him--as well as the Secretary, of course. 
   The net result of that should be we will have a much tighter organization run much more efficiently. We will not have the influences of these other disparate people within the 
   Department. Security can be carefully monitored and controlled and, in fact, maintained and in some cases even established. Therefore, the security of the nuclear weapons program generally and the laboratory specifically can be enhanced and we will not have the kind of espionage problems we have had in the past. 
   That is a summary of the problem, the recommendation of the Rudman report, the recommendations Senators DOMENICI, MURKOWSKI, and I introduced, and the action of the House-Senate Armed Services Committee today in approving this particular plan. 
   I thank some people specifically involved in developing this. In addition, of course, to Senator DOMENICI, who was the primary mover behind this idea, and Senator Rudman and the members of his panel; Senator MURKOWSKI added a great deal as did Senator SHELBY, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, and Senator WARNER, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee in the House. 
   Specifically, I thank Senator WARNER for his patience for working with a lot of people who had different ideas about what ought to be done, bringing this to a near successful conclusion, from my point of view, and which will enable us to move forward very quickly with this reorganization. 
   There are also some special staff people who, as always, make these things happen. In the Senate, the staffs of Senators DOMENICI and MURKOWSKI; Alex Flint, Howard Useem, and John Rood did a great deal of work on this and should be complimented. Two Members of the House of Representatives, who were very active in making this work, Congressman DUNCAN HUNTER and Congressman MAC THORNBERRY were really the key movers and shakers on this. 
   So as we get ready to leave here this evening, I think it is important for us to acknowledge the work of these people and the leadership of Senator WARNER and the conclusion which I hope can soon be announced, as the successful completion of the conference, at least in this one important area, making a great stride toward ensuring the security of our weapons programs and our National Laboratories.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I think it is. I think the Senate passed a good bill almost unanimously. The House of Representatives had a somewhat different approach. I am sure they considered it an even stronger bill. As the chairman knows better than any of us, compromise is required in that kind of situation. I think each body moved somewhat toward the other. So inevitably I think the product, as good as it was out of the Senate, is even strengthened by some of the ideas that came out of the House of Representatives. 
   I might ask the chairman a question, if I could.

   Mr. KYL. One of the things that animated us in the Senate was the need to get on with this project, get the Department reorganized, and to begin dealing quickly with these security problems so we did not have any more problems. Reorganization 
   of a Department, obviously, will take a lot of work and some time. Of course, time will be required to appoint the various officials who will be running it. 
   But I ask the chairman this, just to get his ideas. There are different dates by which things are required to be done under the legislation. What is our intent with respect to moving this legislation forward and accomplishing its objectives as soon as is possible?

   Mr. KYL. If I may interrupt for one other comment, I thank the chairman of the Armed Services Committee for  his courtesies in allowing three Senators who are not members of the committee--Senators DOMENICI, MURKOWSKI, and myself--to be significantly involved in discussing this and proposing suggestions and passing on suggestions that came from the other body. That is a good example of how people in different committees--in my case, the Intelligence Committee--working across jurisdictional lines can help shape the legislation. I personally appreciate that very much. 
   I will add this with respect to our friends on the other side of the aisle. I do not know if I can assign a percentage to it, but it still seems to me that about 90 percent of this bill is the Senate bill we passed. I do not know of a single 
   concept that deviates from the concepts within the Senate bill, even though some of the language is different. 
   I think we protected the Senate legislative concepts very well, and I hope that in the end our Democratic colleagues will continue to work with us and certainly with Secretary Richardson to implement the legislation. 
   I know as we go forward there are going to be hearings in different committees. The chairman's committee will have primary jurisdiction, I understand, and we will be able to continue to work on this because something as significant as the reorganization of the Department is not going to be done in one fell swoop. It will have a lot of fits and starts and oversight and ways of working together. I am sure with the chairman's leadership we will all be able to make this work in the way we intend.

   Mr. KYL. May I add one more thing? I know it sounds like a recapitulation, but when the Senator mentioned Senator DOMENICI and the fine work our National Laboratories do, I was moved to think about how many times during these negotiations Senator DOMENICI, who represents two of those laboratories, Sandia and Los Alamos, made absolutely sure that the work of those laboratories was well understood by everyone and appreciated by everyone. He was very zealous in assuring that nothing in the legislation would ever detract from their operation or their success, that they could reach out and engage in new missions, that they would be protected in terms of environmental protection and funding. 
   He was a zealous advocate for those laboratories and all the great work they can do. His leadership in that regard is one of the reasons we were able to achieve such a balanced piece of legislation. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today along with my colleague Senator MCCAIN to introduce legislation creating a national conservation area on  the Shivwits Plateau/Parashant Canyon area of northwest Arizona. I am introducing this legislation to conserve, protect, and enhance for the benefit of present and future generations the existing landscapes, native wildlife and vegetation as well as the prehistoric, historic, scenic, and traditional human values of the area. This is a bill about the future, and I think it is important that we recognize the unique value of this land and its link to our past. 
   I have personally toured this area and was impressed with its vast landscapes and scenic vistas. I came away with the conviction that the area deserves additional protective status. The area is remote, yet it supports a few human activities, such as ranching, hunting, sightseeing, camping and hiking. I believe those uses can continue without threatening the natural environment or any historic or prehistoric artifacts that may be found in the area. 
   Designation of these lands as a national conservation area will serve these goals by increasing attention to and interest in the area by both the public and the federal government. By spotlighting this area, the Bureau of Land Management will be compelled, and empowered, to increase the monetary and personnel resources allocated to this area, and better focus its management on preserving and protecting the conservation area's unique values. 
   This bill also requires the BLM to develop and carry out forest-restoration projects on both ponderosa pine and pinon-juniper forests within the conservation area. The goal of these projects will be to restore our forests to their pre-settlement conditions. The forest-health crisis in our southwestern forests is acute, and efforts are currently underway by the BLM at Mount Trumbull to address this problem. This legislation builds on those efforts. 
   Designation as a national conservation area may also result in the limiting of some future human activities like mining. There are no current threats to the area, so existing traditional human uses can and should be allowed to continue. In this case, protecting the environment and continuing existing uses are not mutually exclusive. This bill preserves both the land and the traditional lifestyle of the area. 
   Proposals have been made to designate this area as a national monument. Such an action, however, would be done by presidential fiat under the Antiquities Act--that would subvert the public process. We do not want a repeat of the stealthy, election year political maneuver that resulted in the creation of the Escalante/Grand Staircase National Monument in 1996. The people of Arizona and Utah, and their elected representatives, deserve better. We must have a say in this process, including the ability to meaningfully review and comment upon any proposal to change the management of the area. It is only fair that the people who would be most affected by such a designation have that opportunity. I am addressing the need for local input into this process by introduction of this bill. The first step in seeking public input is through the legislative process itself. The legislative process will ensure that the public has a voice. The next step is the section of the bill creating an advisory committee of interested parties to assist the BLM in the land-planning process. 
   National monument status for this area would also forever preclude any type of mining activity. This would be a totally irresponsible action. Let me stress that at this time there are no active mining activities, nor does it appear that any are planned for the foreseeable future within the proposed conservation area. However, we do not know for certain what mineral deposits may be located in the area, or in what quantity. We do know that there are some uranium and copper deposits. The nation does not currently need these resources, but prudence would dictate that we not lock up these minerals with no possibility for future extraction. While we appear to have adequate uranium resources for current needs, policy or conditions may change and our national interest may be served by allowing them to be extracted in the future. 
   This legislation strikes a balance between the desire to preserve the land in its present state, and potential future national needs. Under the bill, the lands will be withdrawn from mineral entry under the 1872 mining law, but are subject to mineral leasing at the discretion of the Secretary of the Interior. This is consistent with the current status of other specially designated federal lands such as the Lake Mead and Glen Canyon National Recreation Areas. It is also consistent with the Secretary of the Interior's segregation of the area. Under the federal mineral leasing laws, the Secretary has broad discretion regarding whether to allow mining in a particular area; the amount of royalties to charge; the duration of the lease; environmental considerations; and reclamation. Thus, authorizing the Secretary to approve mineral leasing within the conservation area protects the national interest in these minerals while also preserving the environment.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I begin today by thanking Senator ROTH, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, for recognizing that there is a place for estate-tax relief in this bill. The measure reported by the Finance Committee includes a variety of changes: a one-time reduction in the top death-tax rate, converting the unified credit to a true exemption, and raising the annual gift exclusion. These are all steps in the right direction. The problem is, at the end of the day, the Roth bill leaves the death tax in place. 
   By contrast, the bill that the House of Representatives passed last week phases out the death tax over a 10-year period, and then implements a version of the bill I introduced back in May with Senator BOB KERREY and a bipartisan group of 19 other Senators. 
   The amendment I am offering today is based upon that bipartisan initiative. I would replace the death tax with a tax on the appreciated value of inherited assets to be paid when the assets are sold. In other words, the tax would be imposed when income is actually realized from inherited property. Death would no longer be a taxable event. 
   This amendment represents an effort to find bipartisan consensus about how to deal with the death tax, and I hope all Senators will consider it with an open mind. It is an approach that Senators MOYNIHAN and KERREY actually suggested to me during a hearing before the Finance Committee two years ago. Bill Beach of the Heritage Foundation discussed its merits at the same hearing. The more I looked into the idea since then, the more sense I thought it made. The essence of it is very simple: It takes death out of the equation. Whether an asset is sold by the decedent during his or her lifetime, or by someone who later inherits the property, the gain is taxed the same. Under this approach, death neither confers a benefit, nor results in a punitive, confiscatory tax. This is an approach that I believe both Republicans and Democrats should be able to accept. 
   We know that many Americans are troubled by the estate tax's complexity and high rates, and by the mere fact that it is triggered by a person's death rather than the realization of income. For a long time, I have advocated its repeal, because I believe death should not be a taxable event. 
   Others agree that the tax is problematic, but are concerned the appreciated value of certain assets might escape taxation forever if the death tax is repealed while the step-up in basis allowed by the Internal Revenue Code remains in effect. That is a legitimate concern. 
   We try to reconcile these positions in this amendment by eliminating both the death tax and the step-up in basis, and attributing a carryover basis to inherited property so that all gains are taxed at the time the property is sold and income is realized. 
   The concept of a carryover basis is not new. It exists in current law with respect to gifts, property transferred in cases of divorce, and in connection with involuntary conversions of property relating to theft, destruction, seizure, requisition, or condemnation. 
   In the latter case, when an owner receives compensation for involuntarily converted property, a taxable gain normally results to the extent that the value of the compensation exceeds the basis of the converted property. However, section 1033 of the Internal Revenue Code allows the taxpayer to defer the recognition of the gain until the property is sold. This amendment would treat the transfer of property at death--perhaps the most involuntary conversion of all--the same way, deferring recognition of any gain until the inherited property is sold. 
   Small estates, which currently pay no estate tax by virtue of the unified credit, and no capital-gains tax by virtue of the step up, would be unaffected by the basis changes being proposed here. The estate tax would be eliminated for them, and they would still get the benefit of the current law's step-up. The basis changes would apply only to estates valued at over $2 million. 
   There are four problems I see with the underlying bill's death-tax provisions. First, the bill tries to make palatable what is fundamentally indefensible. Taxing death is wrong. 
   Second, because it leaves the death tax in place, the need for expensive estate-tax planning also remains. Some people will have to divert money they would have spent on new equipment or new hires to insurance policies designed to cover death-tax costs. Still others will spend millions on lawyers, accountants, and other advisors for death-tax planning purposes. But that leaves fewer resources to invest, start up new businesses, hire additional people, or pay better wages. 
   Third, the higher exemption proposed in the committee bill provides some relief, but I believe it also serves as an artificial cap on small businesses' growth. To avoid the death tax, an entrepreneur merely needs to limit the growth of his or her business so it does not exceed the $1.5 million exemption amount. That means fewer jobs, and less output.  
   I believe it would be better to eliminate the tax and, if there is a need to impose a tax, impose it when income is actually realized--that is, when the assets are sold. That is what this amendment would do. 
   I want to stress to colleagues, particularly colleagues on the Democratic side of the aisle, that we do not allow appreciation in inherited assets to go untaxed, as other death-tax repeal proposals would do. We are merely saying that if a tax is imposed, it should be imposed when income is realized. Earnings from an asset should be taxed the same whether the asset is earned or inherited. 
   The question has been posed at various times during debate on this bill whether the American people want tax relief. Let me answer that question with respect to the issue at hand. Although most Americans will probably never pay a death tax, most people still sense that there is something terribly wrong with a system that allows Washington to seize more than half of whatever is left after someone dies--a system that prevents hard-working Americans from passing the bulk of their nest eggs to their children or grandchildren. 
   Seventy-seven percent of the people responding to a survey by the Polling Company last year indicated that they favor repeal of the death tax. When Californians had the chance to weigh in with a ballot proposition, they voted two-to-one to repeal their state's death tax. The legislatures of five other states have enacted legislation since 1997 that will either eliminate or significantly reduce the burden of their states' death taxes. 
   The 1995 White House Conference on Small Business identified the death tax as one of small business's top concerns, and delegates to the conference voted overwhelming to endorse its repeal. Outright repeal received the fourth highest number of votes among all resolutions approved at the conference. 
   A couple of other points to consider about the death tax. it is one of the most inefficient taxes that the government levies. Alicia Munnell, who was a member of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisors, estimated that the costs of complying with death-tax laws are of roughly the same magnitude as the revenue raised. In 1998, that was about $23 billion. In other words, for every dollar of tax revenue raised by the death tax, another dollar is squandered in the economy simply to comply with or avoid the tax. 
   The tax hurts the economy. A report issued by the Joint Economic Committee in December of 1998 concluded that the existence of the death tax this century has reduced the stock of capital in the economy by nearly half a trillion dollars. By repealing it and putting those resources to better use, the Joint Committee estimated that as many as 240,000 jobs could be created over seven years and Americans would have an additional $24.4 billion in disposable personal income. So much for the contention that this is a tax that touches only a few. 
   It appears that the chairman of the Finance Committee will raise a point of order against this amendment. I think that is regrettable. If there is a way to improve this amendment, I am willing to work with Chairman ROTH on any ideas he might have. But if the point of order is intended to preserve the death tax as a permanent part of the Tax Code, we have a very significant difference of opinion, and I think he should allow the Senate to work its will, rather than use a parliamentary point of order to block it. 
   This is a good amendment; the policy it proposes is sound, and fair. Its time has come. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. 
   As I say, this amendment would repeal the estate tax, the so-called death tax. According to the Joint Tax Committee, under scoring, it cannot occur until the eighth year or until 2007. But at that point it replaces the death tax with a tax on the sale of the assets, usually a capital gains tax, if and when the property is sold. In other words, it is a very fair compromise between those who believe there should be some tax on the sale of assets and those who believe that death itself should not be a taxable event. 
   I am advised that a point of order will be made that this amendment is not germane. If that is done, I believe that to be very unfortunate. But because Senator KERREY would prefer that we not proceed with a vote on the point of order, I will not contest the ruling of the Chair. 
   I believe that repeal of the death tax enjoys more than majority support and am confident that in the conference committee, we will be able to accept the House version or something close to it which repeals the death tax along the lines of the Kyl-Kerrey approach. 
   I urge my colleagues to support repeal of the death tax. If a point of order is made, I will not contest it.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I have heard the name of the Federal Reserve Board Chairman, Alan Greenspan, invoked in this debate as if the Chairman would oppose the tax-relief bill. That is not my understanding of where Mr. Greenspan stands on the issue. I want to include for the RECORD at the end of my remarks a copy of a Wall Street Journal editorial on the subject that ran on July 27, 1999. 
   When Chairman Greenspan testified before the Banking Committee last week, he said that he would delay tax cutting and apply the surplus to debt repayment--but here is the part of the quote that many in the media have failed to report. He said he would defer tax cuts:  
   ..... unless, as I've indicated many times, it appears that the surplus is going to become a lightening rod for major increases in outlays (emphasis added). That's the worst of all possible worlds, from a fiscal policy point of view, and that, under all conditions, should be avoided.  
   Mr. Greenspan went on to say, ``I have great sympathy for those who wish to cut taxes now to pre-empt that process, and indeed if it turns out that they are right, then I would say moving on the tax front makes a good deal of sense to me.'' 
   Mr. President, Chairman Greenspan's view is important because opponents of this tax relief bill claim that the Federal Reserve will respond to its enactment by raising interest rates to the cool economy. But Mr. Greenspan's remarks make it clear that the real threat to continue prosperity is bigger government, not tax relief. And if the tax overpayment is not returned to taxpayers, I think it is clear that it will be spent long before it can be applied to debt reduction. 
   Just consider that President Clinton is proposing new spending amounting to $826 billion--more than the 10-year cost of the tax-relief bill that is before us. Remember, too, that our tax bill accounts for only about 25 percent of the available surplus. In other words, we are only proposing to refund about 25 cents of every surplus dollar to the people who sent it to us--hardly a risky or irresponsible thing. Seventy five cents of every surplus dollar would be dedicated to preserving Social Security and Medicare, and funding other domestic priorities. 
   Remember, to the extent that there is a surplus, we will have taken care of our core obligations already--things like education and health care, running our national parks, and providing for the national defense. It may be true that refunding the overpayment will mean we cannot fund some low priority programs, but that is the point: taxpayers ought to be able to decide how to spend their own hard-earned money before Washington wastes it. 
   Critics of the tax-relief bill also claim that it cannot be justified because projected surpluses may never materialize, that Congress and the President will be unable to live within the spending limits we agreed to on a bipartisan basis only two years ago. In other words, they contend that spending the surplus is a preordained outcome. To me, that is not a reason to defer tax relief. It is the very reason we need to pass tax relief--before Washington can find new ways to spend the tax overpayment. 
   Mr. President, I think it is important to clarify that we are talking about what to do with the non-Social Security surplus. Our plan saves all of the Social Security surplus for Social Security. President Clinton says that it is his goal as well, but his budget would actually spend $158 billion of the Social Security surplus on other programs. If our colleagues on the other side of the aisle would end their filibuster against the Social Security lockbox bill, we could pass it and make sure the Social Security surplus is not spent. 
   Let me turn for a few moments to the specific provisions of the tax-relief bill that is before us today. I want to begin by commending the chairman of the Finance Committee for producing a bill that fully meets the instructions of the budget resolution we passed earlier this year and provides a full $792 billion in tax relief over the next decade. 
   But I must say that I would have written the bill very differently. It seems to me that there are too many provisions that are targeted too narrowly. For example, the bill includes a tax break for the renovation of historic homes. That is great if you intend to engage in such renovation. But if you do not have the means to own a historic home, or do not want one, you get no relief. 
   People with a foreign address would have their frequent flyer miles exempted from the 7.5 percent air passenger ticket tax. 
   Generation of electricity from chicken litter would earn a tax break. 
   And if you are fortunate enough to get certain scholarships, your award would be excluded from tax. 
   These four provisions alone--and each may have merit in its own right--have a combined revenue impact of about $4 billion over 10 years--money that I would prefer to put toward broad-based, growth-oriented tax relief that help all taxpayers. 
   While there are many worthwhile provisions in the Finance Committee bill, a better approach is embodied in an amendment that will be offered by Senator PHIL GRAMM of Texas. Whereas the committee bill attempts to spread  relief among some 130 parts of the Tax Code, the Gramm amendment would focus on just five areas, using the surplus to finally correct some of the most unfair and egregious provisions of the law. 
   The Gramm amendment would, for example, expand on the provisions of the underlying bill to completely eliminate the marriage-tax penalty. What rationale can there possibly be for imposing such a penalty? All of us say we are concerned that families do not have enough to make ends meet--that they do not have enough to pay for child care, college, or to buy their own homes. Yet we tolerate a system that overtaxes families. According to Tax Foundation estimates, the average American family pays almost 40 percent of its income in taxes to federal, state, and local governments. To put it another way, in families where both parents work, one of the parents is nearly working full time just to pay the family's tax bill. It is no wonder, then, that parents do not have enough to make ends meet when government is taking that much. It is just not right. 
   The marriage penalty alone is estimated to cost the average couple an extra $1,400 a year. About 21 million American couples are affected, and the cost is particularly high for the working poor. Two-earner families making less than $20,000 often must devote a full eight percent of their income to pay the marriage penalty. The highest percentage of couples hit by the marriage penalty earns between $20,000 and $30,000 per year. 
   Think what these families could do with an extra $1,400 in their pockets. They could pay for three to four months of day care if they choose to send a child outside the home--or make it easier for one parent to stay at home to take care of the children, if that is what they decide is best for them. They could make four to five payments on their car or minivan. They could pay their utility bill for nine months. 
   The Finance Committee bill goes a long way toward resolving the marriage-penalty problem, and I thank the chairman of the Finance Committee for that; but since we have the resources to solve it fully once and for all, we should. 
   The death tax is just as wrong, and we ought to do something about it, too. The Gramm amendment includes the provisions of the Kyl-Kerrey bill, as modified by the House, that would eliminate the death tax outright. 
   Although most Americans will probably never pay a death tax, most people still sense that there is something terribly wrong with a system that allows Washington to seize more than half of whatever is left after someone dies--a system that prevents hard-working Americans from passing the bulk of their next eggs to their children or grandchildren, or even their local charities. Liberal Professor of Law at the University of Southern California, Edward J. McCaffrey, put it this way: ``Polls and practices show that we like sin taxes, such as on alcohol and cigarettes.'' ``The estate tax,'' he went on to say, ``is an anti-sin, or a virtue, tax. It is a tax on work and savings without consumption, on thrift, on long term savings. There is no reason even a liberal populace need support it.'' 
   Economists Henry Aaron and Alicia Munnell reached similar conclusions, writing in a 1992 study that death taxes ``have failed to achieve their intended purposes. They raise little revenue. They impose large excess burdens. They are unfair.'' 
   In fact, 77 percent of the people responding to survey by the Polling Company last year indicated that they favor repeal of the death tax. When Californians had the chance to weigh in with a ballot proposition, they voted two-to-one to repeal their state's death tax. The legislatures of five other states have enacted legislation since 1997 that will either eliminate or significantly reduce the burden of their states' death taxes. 
   Talk to the men and women who run small businesses around the country and you will find that death taxes are a major concern to them. The 1995 White House Conference on Small Business identified the death tax as one of small business's top concerns, and delegates to the conference voted overwhelmingly to endorse its repeal. Remember, this is a tax that is imposed on a family business when it is least able to afford the payment--upon the death of the person with the greatest practical and institutional knowledge of that business's operations. 
   Although the death tax raises only about one percent of the federal government's annual revenue, it exerts a disproportionately large and negative impact on the economy. In fact, Alicia Munnell, a former member of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisors, estimates that the costs of complying with death-tax laws are roughly the same magnitude as the revenue raised. In 1998, for example that amounted to about $23 billion. In other words, for every dollar of tax revenue raised by the death tax, another dollar is squandered in the economy simply to comply with or avoid the tax. 
   Over time, the adverse consequences are compounded. A report issued by the Joint Economic Committee last December concluded that the existence of the death tax this century has reduced the stock of capital in the economy by nearly half a trillion dollars. 
   By repealing the death tax and putting those resources to better use, the Joint Committee estimates that as many as 240,000 jobs could be created over seven years and Americans would have an additional $24.4 billion in disposable personal income. 
   Unlike the Finance Committee bill, which leaves the death tax in place indefinitely, the Gramm amendment would repeal the tax--pull it out by its roots. The House has already passed similar provisions, and the Senate should, as well. Death-tax repeal is a must. 
   Mr. President, there are three other components of the Gramm amendment that I will touch on only briefly. First, it would reduce marginal income-tax rates by 10 percent across the board. In other words, all taxpayers would see their tax bills reduced, proportionate to how much they pay. This is probably the fairest way of returning the tax overpayment. 
   Second, the amendment would index capital gains for inflation, recognizing that the Treasury should not reap the benefit of inflationary policies. 
   Third, it would provide a full deduction for health insurance for the self employed. 
   Mr. President, the Gramm amendment would provide broad-based relief, and would do so in a way that is not only fair, but which would keep the economy growing and providing a better standard of living for all Americans. 
   I will vote for the Gramm amendment. If it is defeated, I will vote for the underlying bill in order to get it to conference where the bill could be improved. I will, however, reserve judgment about whether to support the conference report until I can see if it comes close to the Gramm amendment or the House bill.

   Mr. KYL. To reiterate, the bill includes a tax break for the renovation of historic homes. That is great, if you intend to engage in such a renovation and you have a historic home. But if you don't have that kind of a home, it is not going to do you much good. People with foreign addresses would have their frequent flier miles exempted from the 7.5-percent passenger ticket tax. 
   Generation of electricity from chicken litter would earn a tax break. If you are fortunate to get certain scholarship, you could be excluded from a tax. These four provisions alone, which may well have merit, have a combined revenue impact of about $4 billion over 10 years--money I would prefer to put toward the kind of relief Senator Gramm has been proposing. That is why I support his amendment. 
   Let's take one of the provisions of his amendment, whereas, the committee bill attempts to spread relief. Out of about 130 different parts of the Tax Code, the Gramm amendment focuses on just 5 particular areas, using the surplus to finally correct some of the most unfair and egregious provisions of the law. For example, it eliminates the marriage tax penalty. 
   The Finance Committee proposal goes a long way toward working on that marriage penalty, but it does not eliminate it. The Gramm proposal would do that. It is not fair that we overtax families just because they are married. The impact is estimated to cost the average couple an extra $1,400 a year. About 21 million American couples are affected. It is no wonder both spouses in the family are having to work. One, in effect, is working for the family, and the other is working to pay off the taxes. They are upset with this marriage tax penalty. I support that provision. 
   While we deal with the death tax in the Finance Committee proposal, we don't eliminate it. It ought to be eliminated. The Gramm proposal eliminates it along the lines of the Kyl-Kerrey bill. I appreciate Senator Gramm including our provision in his amendment. The death tax is the most unfair tax of all. Death should not be a taxable event. If you want to tax people because they make some economic decision to spend 
   money, to take money out of an account, to sell an asset, then tax that economic decision. They understand going in what the consequences are going to be. But nobody chooses to die. Why their heirs should have to pay a tax because of a death is beyond most of us. It brings in about 1 percent in revenue. It is not worth it. An awful lot of small businesses and farms, which have all of the assets tied up in equipment and the capital of the business itself, end up having to sell their assets in order to pay the taxes. The idea that it was to prevent the accumulation of wealth no longer works. In today's world, when you have to sell the business, you usually sell to some big conglomerate that then takes it over. 
   So the death tax is unfair. Our proposal, which in effect converts it to a capital gains tax on the sale of the assets if and when they are ever sold, is a much fairer proposal. It still permits the Government to recover some of the money, but it is not based upon the death of the individual, it is based upon the sale of the asset when the people want to sell it. 
   There are three other components I will touch on briefly. First, it reduces the marginal income tax by 10 percent across the board. In other words, all taxpayers would see their taxes reduced, proportionate to how much they pay, as the Senator pointed out. It is probably the fairest way of returning the tax overpayment. The amendment would index capital gains for inflation, recognizing that the Treasury should not reap the benefit of inflationary policy. Finally, it would provide a full deduction for health insurance for the self-employed, something I think everybody would like to see done. 
   We can afford to do those things, and we ought to do those things in this amendment. I will vote for the GRAMM amendment. If it is defeated, I will vote for the underlying bill in order to get it to conference where it can be improved. I will reserve judgment on whether to support the conference report until I see whether it comes closer to the approach Senator GRAMM has taken. 
   Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the Lugar amendment, which will restore funding for the National Endowment for Democracy (NED). Since its inception in 1983, NED has been a cost-effective means of ensuring that American democratic principles have the opportunity to flourish around the world. NED works on a bipartisan basis in over 80 countries in every region of the world to help build stable, peaceful democracies. This, in turn, furthers America's national security interests, since working to support secure, strong democracies is one of the most effective means of combating the spread of weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, and destabilizing refugee problems. 
   NED enjoys strong, bipartisan support, receiving the support of each administration and the bipartisan congressional leadership since its inception. In a recent editorial in the Wall Street Journal, former President Jimmy Carter and Ambassador Paul Wolfowitz, President Bush's Under Secretary of Defense, wrote: ``The creation of the NED in the 1980s reflected a bipartisan belief that the promotion of freedom is an enduring American interest and that nongovernmental representatives would best be able to help their counterparts build democracy in other countries.'' 
   NED has a strong track record, developed through involvement in virtually every critical struggle for democracy of the past decade-and-a-half. NED provided vital support to the movements that brought about peaceful transitions to democracy in Poland, Chile, and South Africa. Indeed, as a recent New York Times editorial noted: ``It is hard to think of a dictatorship whose opponents have not benefited from the endowment.'' 
   NED uses its funds efficiently and effectively. A recent audit conducted by the U.S. Information Agency's Inspector General looked at fiscal years 1994-1999 and did not question a single cost related to the management of NED's grants.  
   NED's independence is the key to its success. Without the restoration of NED's funding as a separate, congressionally mandated line item, NED will have to be funded through the State Department's foreign aid process. This would undermine NED's independence, and therefore its effectiveness. 
   If NED were to be too closely associated with the Department of State, then NED might be seen as merely a mouthpiece for whatever administration currently occupies the White House. This would dilute its effectiveness. 
   NED must be allowed to continue to make decisions about where to provide its vital assistance without having first to clear those decisions through the State Department bureaucracy, which may not always share NED's agenda. The United States carries out high-level diplomatic relations with a number of nondemocratic regimes, such as China. The State Department might be tempted to scale back NED's democracy-building activities in such countries if the Department viewed those activities as interfering with the Department's diplomatic agenda. This must not be allowed to happen, and keeping NED independent is the only way to ensure that it does not. 
   The Lugar amendment restores funding for this vital organization while ensuring its independence. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am proud that S. 1217, the Commerce, Justice, and State Appropriations Bill contains an amendment by Senator COVERDELL and me, securing $1.8 million for drug-free workplace programs. It has been a pleasure to have worked with Senator COVERDELL in obtaining funding for this critical program. 
   Our amendment is a victory for business and the fight against drugs. 
   Last year Senator COVERDELL and I authored the Drug-Free Workplace Act, which became law. It provided grants to organizations in order to assist small businesses in starting drug-free workplace programs. The Act was designed to encourage partnerships between small businesses and organizations that have experience in tackling the problem of drugs in the workplace. Many small business are reluctant to implement drug testing or employee-assistance programs, because they lack expertise in crafting such programs. 
   As we all know, sustaining a competent, able work force hinges on our ability to keep drugs out of the workplace. Funding was needed to continue this instrumental program. Securing $1.8 million for FY 2000 is a victory, considering the Administration chose to not fund this effort at all. 
   Statistics confirm that drug-free workplaces are more productive and efficient than those where some employees abuse drugs. For instance, 47 percent of workplace accidents are drug-related. Moreover, U.S. businesses lose $176 billion annually to substance abuse for costs due to accidents, absenteeism, and increased health care costs. Drug and alcohol abusers utilize 300 percent more medical benefits than non-abusers. 
   This amendment will enable small businesses to combat an evil that plagues their work forces, drug abuse.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wish to associate myself with the excellent comments of my good friend, the Senator from California, and also look forward to working with the chairman and ranking member of the subcommittee to resolve the funding disparity in the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP). 
   Before I begin my comments about this important program and the level of funding in the Senate Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations bill, I want to state my full support for what I have been told will be a $585 million funding level for SCAAP in the House FY 2000 bill. I would also like to insert for the record a copy of a letter from the U.S./Mexico Border Counties Coalition (which consists of 18 county governments located on the Southwestern border) that describes why an adequate funding level for SCAAP is so important to these border ares, many of which are facing very difficult fiscal situations. 
   Through the Crime Control Act of 1994, the Congress created SCAAP to reimburse states and localities for the costs they incur incarcerating criminal illegal aliens. Such costs, it has been made clear, are the responsibility of the federal government. SCAAP is authorized at $650 million, although total expenditures of the states exceed $2 billion per year. Though the financial burden of criminal illegal aliens overwhelms the criminal justice budget of many states and localities, SCAAP has never even been allocated its full authorization. In 1996 and 1997, SCAAP was allocated $500 million and last year, states and localities received a total of $585 million. 
   Frankly, the Congress would be fully justified in increasing the authorization level to $2 billion annually. In 1998, the taxpayers of Arizona spent $38 million incarcerating criminal illegal aliens, including $26.8 million in state facilities, $406,000 in Cochise County, $9 million in Maricopa County, $136,000 in Mohave County, $534,000 in Pinal 
   County, $450,000 in Santa Cruz County, and $401,000 in Yuma County. In turn, the state received a reimbursement of $15.1 million in SCAAP funds--less than half of what Arizona should have gotten, and that was when SCAAP was funded at $585 million overall. 
   To reduce the total 1999 SCAAP fund by more than 80 percent for fiscal year 2000, to $100 million, is absolutely unacceptable. Should funding be reduced to $100 million, all 50 states, D.C., and the 244 local jurisdictions, which currently receive 39 cents on the dollar, would be reimbursed a mere seven cents on the dollar, even though such costs are a clear federal responsibility. This situation is especially disturbing, considering incarceration is only one component of the overwhelming cost incurred by states and localities when processing criminal illegal aliens--and one for which the federal government promised to provide reimbursement in the Crime Control Act of 1994. 
   In Santa Cruz County, Arizona, the overall costs of both processing and incarcerating illegal criminal aliens takes up 39 percent of the county's criminal justice budget. And that is just one county in my state. The combined costs to jurisdictions all over the country are staggering, and the SCAAP program only reimburses states for the inca rceration portion of these onerous costs. Unless Congress appropriates sufficient funds for SCAAP, at the very least, Arizona and other state and local governments will continue to shoulder billions of dollars of the expense of incarcerating and processing criminal illegal aliens. 
   Mr. President, I very much hope that Senators GREGG, HOLLINGS, FEINSTEIN and I can work to resolve these issues before this bill is signed into law.

   Mr. KYL. I thank Senator GREGG for entering this colloquy with me about a program which is particularly vital to the law enforcement personnel in my own state of Arizona. As you know, the Byrne Grant is a key source of federal financial assistance for state and local drug law enforcement efforts. It funds a wide variety of activities ranging from task forces and drug education to apprehension and prosecution. In Arizona, numerous counties and agencies rely on Byrne Grant funds to pay the salaries of nearly 300 law enforcement and prosecution personnel; rural counties especially benefit from Bryne Grant funds for their law enforcement activities.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would like to return to the business of today, the Intelligence Committee authorization bill and the underlying Kyl-Domenici-Murkowski amendment to that authorization bill which provides for the reorganization of the Department of Energy with a semiautonomous agency responsible for our nuclear weapons programs. That is the business of the Senate since this time yesterday. 
   Americans who are watching the activities of the Senate might be a little confused. I would like to try to straighten out some of the confusion. I challenge my colleagues who have a different point of view to express that if, in fact, they care to do so. 
   We are well aware, over the last several years now, of espionage that has been occurring within our nuclear laboratories and other facilities in this country which has resulted in a significant number of very important secrets of this country being obtained by others who should not have them, including, we believe, the Government of China. This is not minor. The secrets that have been obtained, we believe, from our nuclear laboratories include the information necessary to build the most sophisticated weapons ever designed by man. They include the 
   designs for the most sophisticated weapons in our arsenal--the seven or eight nuclear warheads the United States now has on our existing weapons, as well as designs for a weapon that we never produced but which we understand because the Chinese have now said they have; the so-called neutron bomb that they have developed; as well as some other technology dealing with radar, for example, that can detect our submarines under the sea. 
   These are the most sophisticated technological developments of our country in recent years. Design information about these weapons has been obtained by others. So, naturally, one of the questions is: How did it happen, and how can we prevent it from happening in the future? 
   We don't know the answer to the question of how it happened exactly, because people involved in espionage don't come forward and say to you, well, here is what I did. But piecing the information together, we have concluded that it is likely that information was obtained from our nuclear weapons laboratories, and this information got into the wrong hands. 
   So part of the question of how to prevent this in the future is: What do we need to do, if anything, to ensure security at our nuclear laboratories? 
   Now, it turns out that over the years there have been numerous General Accounting Office studies, studies by other independent groups, and even studies of the Department of Energy itself, which has jurisdiction over these National Laboratories, which have highlighted the ongoing problems and have suggested that there have to be changes made in the organizational structure of the DOE if we are ever to stop this espionage. 
   Most recently, the President's own Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, chaired by former Senator Warren Rudman, issued a scathing report and made some very important recommendations about the reorganization of the Department of Energy. In this report, in effect, the Rudman panel said to the President that the Department of Energy will tell you that it can reorganize itself. It can't. It is the problem. 
   Many of the bureaucrats within the Department don't want to reorganize in a way that will solve these problems. They want to protect their turf. Therefore, it is going to have to be up to Congress to pass a new statute that literally reorganizes the Department of Energy to get this done. 
   Now, interestingly, just before that Presidential advisory panel made its recommendations, Senator DOMENICI of New Mexico, in whose State two of the three primary weapons labs are located, had come to the same conclusion, based upon a lot of these previous reports that I talked about, and had actually developed an idea of how to reorganize the Department of Energy to provide for greater accountability and responsibility. He discussed those ideas with me and with Senator MURKOWSKI, chairman of the Energy Committee. The three of us decided to introduce  legislation, which we attempted to attach to the Department of Defense authorization bill back in May, to accomplish this exact result. 
   At that time, for a variety of reasons, the leadership, including Senator WARNER and others, said: Don't attach that to this bill, do it later with the intelligence authorization bill--which we now have before us. For one thing, no hearings have been held, and we need time to work out the specific language. 
   So Senators DOMENICI and MURKOWSKI and I agreed to do that back in May. Since then, there have been, I believe, six different hearings by four different committees specifically on this legislation. Senator Rudman has testified, as has Secretary Richardson, and many others, about this specific legislation. 
   Since the time of our initial introduction of the amendment, the Rudman panel made its recommendations. It was so close to what Senator DOMENICI and the rest of us had originally proposed that we conformed our legislation to that recommendation so that we were in effect asking the Department to be reorganized exactly along the lines recommended by the President's own advisory panel. That was back in May. 
   A lot of time has now elapsed, obviously--almost 2 months--while we have been going over this. We have been meeting with Secretary Richardson. We have been talking to each other trying to come up with some compromise language where we thought it was appropriate. 
   But in the meantime, we have the question of whether our secrets are being protected at our National Laboratories. The Rudman report, and Senator Rudman's testimony before at least one of these committees in the interim, made it clear that we had not solved the problem. The Cox report made the point that espionage was still continuing. The Rudman report specifically said the recommendations of the Secretary of Energy and the implementation of what he was doing was in effect too little too late; it was not solving the problem; it didn't go far enough; and we had to get on with the urgent business of solving this problem. 
   The reason I point this out is that we agreed to delay even though that delay poses a risk to the people of the United States of America; that more secrets will fly out the window before we get this thing resolved. But we agreed to hold the hearings and to try to get the acquiescence of the Secretary of Energy. 
   He has now finally agreed with the proposition that was recommended to the President's advisory panel that we need a semiautonomous agency. 
   We are now arguing about a lot of the details. But in this matter the details matter. The details matter because it is possible for the bureaucrats within the Department of Energy to scuttle the reform if they can take enough pieces of it out and create the same kind of burdensome, multimanagement kind of structure that exists today which the Rudman report criticized as being so ineffective. 
   We fear that is what some of the amendments which will be proposed will do. 
   We have been trying over the last 48 hours literally to bring this bill before the Senate. We had to actually invoke cloture in order to begin debating the intelligence authorization bill. Democrats objected to the consideration of the intelligence authorization bill. 
   What does that mean? Without an intelligence authorization bill, the programs for fiscal year 2000 in our intelligence community cannot go forward. 
   Why would people object to even considering the bill, not voting on it, but even bringing it up when these kinds of threats to our national security exist? Why would they object to the consideration of the amendment for the reorganization of the Department of Energy along the lines recommended by the President's own panel of advisers, the concept of which has been signed off by his Secretary of Energy? 
   Why would we have this delay? Why now for the last 48 hours have the people who want to amend our proposal not come forward to present this amendment so we can get on with this? 
   We have had this bill pending for 24 hours. People 
   watching might say: Why have we heard speeches about everything under the Sun except the Department of Energy reorganization? 
   The answer is because people who object to our proposal have not come to the floor and have not been willing to offer their own amendments. 
   Senator DOMENICI has been laboring mightily in the back rooms trying to work out some language differences. We have been willing to meet others more than halfway in trying to resolve differences that we could resolve. We have agreed to accept a couple of amendments and make some modifications to language so we can work together in a bipartisan fashion. But I have yet to hear anybody say, who has proposed amendments that we have accepted, that they will agree with and support the legislation at the end of the day, even if we accept what they have offered. 
   I am not going to suggest a lack of good faith. But there is a matter of national security involved. Time is wasting. 
   I see nobody on the floor willing to debate with us or tell us where they think we are wrong or to offer amendments to what we are trying to propose. 
   Under the rules of the Senate, unless they come down and do that, we are stuck. 
   We don't want to spend all of the time just reiterating what Senators DOMENICI, MURKOWSKI, THOMPSON, BUNNING, and myself and others have already said on the floor. We could keep talking about this. 
   I sometimes wonder what the American people think. They hear there is a crisis with intelligence. They hear there is a problem with these National Laboratories. They hear there is a suggestion to fix it made to the President by his own advisory board, and we have amendments to implement those recommendations. Yet nothing happens. In fact, people actually object to bringing up the bill that would begin to fix the problem. 
   When we finally bring it up because we invoked cloture, we actually made them vote on that--they all agreed to bring it up at that point--and nobody comes down to offer amendments. 
   I urge my colleagues, even those who disagree with us, to come to the floor. Let's debate this. If you think you have a legitimate point of view, let's talk it out. Reasonable people can differ about these things. If you have an amendment, bring it to the floor so we can debate and vote on it. 
   But, sooner or later, the American people are going to reach a conclusion, which is that this matter is being delayed. 
   I find it unconscionable that anybody would delay efforts to secure the Nation's most important secrets and to delay our efforts to ensure the security of our National Laboratories. That is what we are all about here. 
   I just hope that sooner rather than later people will be willing to come down and work with us to bring this bill to a conclusion so that we can get on with the important business of this country in protecting our national security. 
   I see Senator DOMENICI is on the floor. I know he has been working mightily to try to work out some language. I think it would be appropriate now to call upon him for a report on the success of his efforts.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will take the first few minutes and reply to Senator LEVIN's amendment, and then Senator DOMENICI will add his thoughts. 
   I first note that this language was handed to us as this debate began, and so it has been a little difficult to correlate the provisions of this amendment with the provisions of our bill and with the recommendations of the Rudman report. I think it is fair to say the following four things about this amendment. 
   First of all, it is not necessary. I haven't really heard any explanation of why we need this different language. I believe that our bill, which tracks the report of the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, allows the Secretary of Energy to create policies that are applicable to the entire department and that the implementation of security and counterintelligence within this new Agency is the responsibility of the new Under Secretary that is responsible for nuclear stewardship, but that the Secretary of Energy will always have the ultimate say with respect to those security and counterintelligence policies. That is what our bill calls for. That is what the Rudman report recommends should be done. I don't see any need for this different way of saying it. 
   There are also at least two problems with the language itself. I am a little concerned because Senator LEVIN scores a debater point by saying one of the sentences of his three-sentence amendment comes right out of a letter that Senator Rudman wrote to us. It is not the Rudman report, but it is a letter that he sent to us. Since we have been saying that our legislation tracks the Rudman recommendation, therefore, we have to accept that sentence. 
   That is, of course, a dual standard. Senator LEVIN is perfectly willing to reject parts of the PFIAB report. Under his analysis, then he should accept everything the Rudman report recommends as well. 
   The truth of the matter is, we have tried to track it as closely as possible, and I think we have done a good job. We haven't included the sentence from the letter that Senator Rudman wrote. It is not necessary. 
   I think there is a dual standard being applied here. I think all of us can appreciate the fact that we are trying to track it as closely as we can, consistent with writing this legislation. 
   The two primary points of objection I have to the amendment are these: As a practical matter, this whole exercise is to do things differently within this new Agency than they are done departmentwide. That is the essence of the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board report. It says: You need to create a new semiautonomous agency that doesn't have to do things the way they are done all over the rest of the Department of Energy. That has been the problem--all these different people making rules and regulations and policies. It is impossible to protect the Nation's security and our foremost secrets when you have so many people, in effect, with their finger in the pie. You need to create a very specific semiautonomous agency that has control over those nuclear programs, and don't apply all of the other departmentwide policies, as good as they may be for the rest of the Department, to this new Agency. 
   Many of the departmentwide policies will be appropriate, but undoubtedly some of them will not be. The whole point is to do things differently than they have been done in the past and to have the flexibility to do them differently within this new 
   Agency. 
   For example, suppose the Secretary says to one of his staff assistants: I want you to develop a new departmentwide policy on polygraph tests. This person goes out and does the research, comes back and says: We shouldn't have any polygraph tests. The Secretary of Energy says: Okay, that is our departmentwide policy. 
   Under the Levin amendment, this new Agency, this new semiautonomous Agency that is responsible for control of our nuclear secrets, wouldn't have any choice but to implement that departmentwide policy. That is exactly what this language says. I will read it, Mr. President:  
   The director of the agency may establish agency-specific policies so long as they are fully consistent with the departmental policies established by the Secretary.  
   No flexibility to do anything different. That is the whole point. That is what the PFIAB report said: You have to do things differently. You cannot expect a different result if you keep doing them the same old way. You cannot require, for this very unique, highly technical business of making nuclear weapons, the application of all the same standards and policies that apply throughout the Agency. 
   The one example used frequently is the refrigerator standards. But there are so many differ examples you can point to. Agencywide policies may be fine agencywide, but they should not  necessarily be applicable to this new Agency. They may be, but they aren't necessarily. That is the approach our bill takes. It says the Secretary can develop these agencywide policies, but the Director of this new Agency has to have some flexibility to say some of the things that apply to other parts of the Department of Energy should not apply here; they are not applicable, and they may even be dangerous. 
   That it the whole point of what we are trying to accomplish. When the amendment says the Director of the Agency for Nuclear Stewardship is responsible for the implementation of the Secretary's security, counterintelligence, and intelligence policies within the new Agency--and he can only devise agency-specific policies as far as they are fully consistent with the departmentwide policies--you are tying his hands behind his back; he is set up for failure before he even starts. 
   This amendment is very dangerous. One reason it is dangerous is that the language seems to track fairly closely elements of the report. But again, what we are saying is the Secretary, of course, can develop agencywide policies. Some of those will be applicable to this new Agency, but they don't necessarily have to be. That is where we diverge. That is a critical difference here. It would be impossible for this new Agency Director to do his job if he were bound by this language. 
   Our whole point is to have accountability and responsibility of this person. Well, I would not take the job if I were given the responsibility to protect our Nation's nuclear secrets and then I was told: However, you cannot 
   establish any policy within your new Agency that is inconsistent with departmentwide policies. I would not undertake that job because I would not be able to do it the way I thought best. 
   Mr. President, with respect for the Senator from Michigan, I have to say this is the wrong approach and we will have to oppose this amendment.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will respond on my time, and if we need more time, we can utilize that. 
   Senator KERREY raises the exact right question. In many respects, we are not that far apart. I think this language creates one specific, big problem, however. In the bill, we provide the authority for the Secretary to establish not only departmentwide policies on security, counterintelligence, and other matters, but also he would have the residual authority to direct those issues within the new Agency itself if he really wanted. 
</TEXT>

<DOCNO>106-kyl-az-11-19990721</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KYL. I will have my staff find the pages. On page 2 of the bill, there is ``general authorities residual to the secretary.'' 
   I refer the Senator's attention to section 213(c):  
   The secretary shall be responsible for all policies of the agency.  
   So that is the overall general policy here. That is, of course, consistent with the recommendations of the Rudman report. It is what we have always said has to be--that ultimately the Secretary has the authority to impose his will on this new Agency in any way he should desire to do so, 
   whether it is agency specific, or with respect to a departmentwide policy. We provide for that. 
   The problem with this amendment and the problem with the last sentence is that it would remove from the Under Secretary in charge of the nuclear program the ability to have policies different from general DOE-wide policies because it says:  
   The director of the agency may establish agency-specific policies so long as they are fully consistent with the departmental policies established by the Secretary.  
   I can give an example of polygraphs. If you read the first sentence of this amendment, the Secretary may use his immediate staff to assist him in developing these departmentwide policies. 
   He asks a person not in this new semiautonomous Agency to go out and develop a policy regarding polygraphs. I am using this as a hypothetical. The person comes back and says we shouldn't have polygraphs. That is a departmentwide policy. And the new Under Secretary, in the second sentence, is directed to implement the Secretary's policies within the new Agency. 
   How might he do that? The third sentence:  
   The director of the agency may establish agency-specific policies so long as they are fully consistent with the departmental policies established by the Secretary.  
   We need to allow enough flexibility so there can be some differences. 
   The whole point of the Rudman recommendation is that this new Agency may have to do some things different from the rest of the Department. There may be personnel policies. There may  be contracting policies. There may even be policies of security and counterintelligence that would be different in this new entity. 
   But even if they are different--this, I know, goes right to the point of the Senator from Nebraska--even if the person in charge of this new semiautonomous Agency says, look, we have to do things differently with respect to security in our new Agency than you do them in the rest of the Departments, the Secretary of Energy still has the ultimate say as to whether he approves of that and agrees with that or not because he is ultimately in charge. 
   But the way this amendment is written, the new Director wouldn't have any options. He has to do it consistent with the departmentwide policy. He has no discretion to do it differently. He has to have this discretion to do it differently if he thinks it is necessary. Then if the Secretary says, no, I don't want you to, the Secretary still wins. He is still the boss. 
   That is my answer to the Senator from Nebraska.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the point is as long as they are consistent with departmental policies established by the Secretary. In other words, the policies the Secretary establishes for all of the other Departments would control. We don't want it to. 
   I might add that the language that I quoted before was specifically requested by the Senator: The Secretary shall be responsible for all policies of the Agency. 
   We think that is important to clarify--that in the end he always has the authority. If this language says something, it is not wise to try to fix that amendment during debate. But if the language in effect says that the Director of the Agency may establish agency-specific policies, it is obviously always subject to review by the Secretary--no problem. But when I say in the language that they have to be consistent with departmental policies, obviously that infers previously established. 
   Then you could have a problem.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, obviously that is in response to the amendment. But I think that is the general idea. 
   I also add one other point. In the second sentence of the amendment it provides that the Director of the Agency for Nuclear Stewardship is responsible for implementation of the Secretary's security counterintelligence and intelligence policies within the new Agency. 
   I think, while that is true, since it follows the Secretary, the sentence previous to it, which talks about departmentwide policies, there is an implication in the second sentence, again, that he has to implement all of the departmentwide policies without exception. 
   I think we have to make it clear that the second sentence is what we are talking about, and the third sentence as well.

   Mr. KYL. The Senator said it very well. 
   Obviously, the whole intention here is that there be a lot of things done differently in this new Agency than would otherwise be done within the Department. 
   Our problem with Senator LEVIN's amendment is it not only implies but in the last sentence actually directs that whatever is departmentwide also has to exist in this new Agency--no exceptions; ``fully consistent with.'' 
   That is just not what this whole reform is all about. There are going to be a lot of things with a new agency that are going to be different. 
   To the Senator's point, as I said before, I wouldn't take the job as the new Under Secretary in charge of this new Agency if I took the job knowing that I had to begin by complying with all departmentwide policies.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, it appears to me that we have achieved a meeting of the minds--almost--and therefore the language could be worked out. 
   Let me restate the two concerns I have, both of which I think we would have to satisfy. In the second sentence of the amendment, it says that the Director of the Agency is responsible for the implementation of the Secretary's policies within the new Agency. Obviously, that has to mean to the extent that they are applicable to this new Agency and not inconsistent with any agency-specific recommendations. 
   If the Senator has that language following the first sentence, it doesn't mean that it means whatever the departmentwide policies are this new Director has to implement them. That is not what we intend. 
   Secondly, to the final sentence, the Senator is correct, this head of this new Agency should have the ability to have agency-specific policies with respect to security and counterintelligence and virtually anything else. It is always subject to the Secretary's approval. 
   I don't think in this one unique situation we want to say that prior to the effectiveness of any policy, the head of this new Agency has to obtain the approval of the Secretary. But since he has to report to the Secretary, the Secretary, obviously, has the ability to say no. 
   Clearly, we want this Agency to be running not on its own but semiautonomously. If the new person has to go get approval from people before he does things--obviously, he would have to notify the Secretary--then I think that could diminish his ability to operate the new entity. 
   However, if the principle is agreed to that there can be, and indeed should be in some cases, different policies within this new Agency than departmentwide, and if we understand that the Secretary always has the ability to say no or to say do it differently, then I will say positively that I think we have a meeting of the minds and it is simply a matter of drafting the language in a way to achieve that. 
   I thought our bill did that. If the Senator thinks we need to modify it somewhat, clearly we can talk about it.

   I agree with Senator KERREY; the more bipartisan this is the better. I say the first goal is security. Frankly, I detect a flaw in the exact wording of this amendment. If we can eliminate that flaw and thereby achieve bipartisan consensus on this point, obviously, that is a twofer. It not only achieves our policy objective but the political objective of the bipartisan approach as well.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I want to report on the status, as I understand, of where we are on the Kyl amendment. When you turn on your television set and see what is happening in the Senate Chamber, you see that the pending business is the Kyl amendment. Since that is me, I thought I should explain we are about ready to bring this to a conclusion, I think a very successful conclusion. In fact, the bipartisanship we were seeking to attain earlier in the day, in fact, will be attained with respect to the adoption of the Kyl amendment. 
   I will back up a little bit and recapitulate where we are. The underlying bill is the intelligence authorization bill. There will be a little bit of business to transact on that after the adoption of the Kyl amendment. Then the intelligence authorization bill can be approved by the Senate and we can move on to other business. 
   In the meantime, the Kyl amendment is the pending amendment. That is the amendment cosponsored by Senator DOMENICI, Senator MURKOWSKI, and a host of others, that will reform the Department of Energy so it will be less likely in the future that there will be nuclear secrets walking out the door of our National Laboratories. That is an oversimplification, but that is the essence of what we are trying to do. 
   The reorganization involves the creation of a semiautonomous agency within the Department. We basically have followed the recommendations of the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board in establishing that new Agency. 
   There have been some amendments dealing with details of this reorganization that have been worked out between representatives of the Democratic side and supporters of our amendment. 
   With respect to the most perplexing of the difficulties, a matter on which an earlier vote was held, where the Levin amendment was defeated, we have gone back and rewritten the language of the bill and the Levin amendment and combined the two in a way in which we think both sides think we can make the legislation work. There have been some other concessions, as well, to Members on the Democratic side in order to achieve a broad bipartisan consensus for this legislation. 
   I am pleased to report that there is an agreement, A, to bring this Kyl amendment to a vote very soon, so I think Members should expect that in the very near term we will be able to have a final vote on it; and, B, that it will have the concurrence of many, if not most, of the Members on the other side of the aisle, as well as the Republican side of the aisle. That is because of the concessions that have been made in this intervening time. 
   So my hope is, if there is anyone else who wishes to discuss any aspect of the Kyl amendment, or to raise any questions about it, or about the other amendments that have been offered and to one degree or another worked out in the interim, that they would come and do that now because in just a matter of a few minutes we are going to propound a request to get on with the vote and then be able to move on.  I know that is the leader's desire, and we would like to be able to do that. 
   If there isn't anybody at this point who wants to weigh in, let me add one other point about the reason why the Senate is acting on this important matter. At the end of the day, for the Nation, there is nothing more important than our national security. We in the Senate and the House and the President understand that probably our first obligation is to protect the American people. 
   One of the stable elements of the peace that has prevailed over the last many decades has been the nuclear stockpile of the United States, the fact that we have nuclear weapons that provide a deterrent to any attack by an aggressor that would threaten the homeland of the United States. 
   It is a horrible thing to ever contemplate using those weapons, but it is undeniable that the threat of nuclear retaliation has enabled us to have a period of peace literally since World War II with our major adversaries. 
   It is important that the stability the world has seen because of the creation of those weapons not be disrupted by other nations acquiring the same weapons. Obviously, that could unbalance this stability that has been created over time because of the U.S. possession of those weapons. 
   We now know that the design information for all of the nuclear warheads that are currently in our useful arsenal are in the hands of people who could cause us harm if they were able to build weapons from that data, from those plans. That is a very distressing fact. 
   There are ways that we can hope to prevent the development of those weapons. It is going to require us to be very careful 
   about what we sell to other countries and what we permit by way of technology transfer because it is still difficult to build a nuclear weapon even if you have the designs. You have to have the materials; you have to have the computing capacity and the machining capacity, and all the rest of it. 
   So there may still be some ability on our part to have control over our own destiny. There is no question we have now been put at risk because of the theft of these secrets. The National Laboratories, which are responsible for developing those nuclear weapons, have begun to embark upon a very important project called the Stockpile Stewardship Program in which we will attempt to be able to certify the safety and reliability of our nuclear stockpile through computing which will simulate nuclear testing. 
   If that program is compromised, it would, in effect, be the compromise of everything we have, not just the design information but also our analysis of how all these things work. 
   If we cannot protect that, we cannot protect our national security. That is one of the reasons why it is important for us to ensure that nothing else happens in the way of security breaches at our National Labs. 
   The Rudman report made it very clear that under the existing organization of the Department of Energy, we could not guarantee that. There were too many people that had too much influence over things, and, in effect, everybody's responsibility became nobody's responsibility. As a result, that recommendation was: We have to reorganize the Department; and it cannot reorganize itself. 
   Congress needs to pass a statute that provides for that reorganization. That is why we brought forth the Kyl-Domenici-Murkowski amendment. That is why I am very proud of the fact that soon the Senate is going to vote to approve that amendment. By putting it on the intelligence authorization bill, we will enable it to become the law of the land and enable the Department of Energy to be reorganized with this semiautonomous agency having jurisdiction over the nuclear programs, including the National Laboratories. 
   That will be a very big step. No one should rest easy that this is the end of the issue, that we do not have to worry about spying, that this will stop the espionage or the release of secrets that other people should not have. But at least it is one thing we can do, and we believe it will have a significant impact in at least this one area. 
   I guess one of the things many of us were saying was: If we can't do this now, after all of this time, then we think it is fairly clear we can't protect the national security of the United States. 
   I am not saying this is easy. But if we cannot accomplish this reorganization, then, frankly, we are not up to the task. That is why I am so glad we are going to be able to effect this reorganization. After we pass this bill, I am very hopeful that our friends in the House will be willing to work with us. If they have additional ideas, obviously, we want to work with them. But we need to send to the President a bill that he can sign. After all, his own advisory board made the recommendations we are attempting to follow. 
   If I am correct that what we have done has resulted in a broad bipartisan consensus, we will be able to make it clear to the executive branch of the Government that it is the will of the Congress--not just one party, the majority party of the 
   Congress--and that should enable us to also then gain the support from the Secretary of Energy, who has acknowledged that he supports the basic concept of a semiautonomous agency but had some disagreements with us about specifics. By making some changes that go some distance toward meeting his objections, I hope we will not only have the support of both Democrats and Republicans in the Congress but also the Secretary of Energy because we have to get about this quickly. 
   There is no reason, after the Senate acts today, hopefully, that the process cannot begin in anticipation of the fact that this will be the law. No one has to wait until September or whatever date we might actually be able to get the President's signature on this law. This Secretary of Energy has a great opportunity; as the person who came into office about the time all of these revelations were made public and who himself began to make some changes in a positive way, he is in a unique position now to take advantage of the reorganization that we will present to him and actually institute the changes so that his successor, a year and a half from now, whoever that might be, presumably will have in place a very well-functioning Department of Energy with a semiautonomous agency in charge of our nuclear weapons programs. 
   That is something this Secretary will have the opportunity to do. But it is a real challenge for him. If he is able to accomplish that, he will certainly have earned his place in history. Meanwhile, it is up to us to earn our place in history by adopting this legislation and moving the process forward. 
   I am very hopeful we will not see any additional delays now. There have been some in the past. I had complained about that earlier in the day. I am hopeful we will not see any additional delays, that we will move this legislation forward, get it signed into law, and get it implemented. If we do that, we will be proud of the fact that we have helped the security of the people of the United States of America. 
   Mr. President, I will soon propound a request with respect to a vote on my amendment. I will check with a couple other people before I do that. But, again, I think Members should expect that pretty soon we will be having a vote on this amendment.

   Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   First, I thank Senator DOMENICI for his leadership on this issue. It was really his leadership that brought this entire matter of reorganization of the Department of Energy to the fore. I appreciate his ability to predict what the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board was going to be recommending to the President because indeed it was Senator DOMENICI's idea for the reorganization of the Department of Energy that eventually the Rudman board, the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board--it was really that same idea that was recommended by the President's board which we have embodied in legislation that we bring to the floor. 
   As the leader announced a few minutes ago, at 10:40 this morning we will vote on whether to invoke cloture on a motion to proceed to the intelligence authorization bill, which will include this reorganization of the Department of Energy amendment. 
   This is the amendment Senator DOMENICI, Senator MURKOWSKI, and I have drafted with the purpose to halt the ongoing losses of our Nation's most sensitive military secrets from our Nation's laboratories. 
   As I look back over the last few months, it seems as if every week brought more news about Chinese espionage at our National Laboratories, about how the Chinese have obtained our country's nuclear secrets. 
   In May, the declassified version of the Cox committee report was released. It painted a sobering picture of the increased danger the United States now faces as a result of the Chinese espionage at our nuclear labs. This bipartisan committee unanimously concluded that China stole classified information on every nuclear warhead currently in the U.S. arsenal, as well as the neutron bomb--literally the crown jewels of our nuclear stockpile. 
   Worst still, the Cox committee noted that China also acquired other advanced American technology, including missile guidance and reentry vehicle technology, the results of developmental work on electromagnetic weapons that could be used to attack satellites and missiles, and radar technology and techniques that may someday allow China to track U.S. Navy submarines while they are submerged beneath the ocean's surface. 
   Chinese acquisition of this technology is particularly troublesome because the majority of its roughly 20  long-range nuclear missiles are aimed at U.S. cities. As we all know, the United States currently has no defense against missile attack. 
   Although one individual at the Los Alamos Laboratory, Wen Ho Lee, has been fired, Chinese espionage at our nuclear labs is presumably ongoing today. As the Cox committee stated in its report, China has engaged in a ``sustained espionage effort targeted at United States nuclear weapons facilities.'' 
   Furthermore, the report notes: ``The successful penetration by [China] of our nuclear weapons laboratories has taken place over the last several decades, and almost certainly continues to the present.'' 
   After the effects of China's espionage came to light earlier this year, the President asked the Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, led by former Senator Warren Rudman, to examine why China was able to steal our nuclear secrets. The President's board released its findings in June, calling for sweeping organizational reform of the Energy Department to 
   address what it described as ``the worst security record on secrecy'' that the panel members ``have ever encountered.'' 
   The Presidential panel cited as the root cause of DOE's poor security record ``organizational disarray, managerial neglect, and a culture of arrogance.......[which] conspired to create an espionage scandal waiting to happen.'' Terrible problems were uncovered during the panel's investigation. For example, employees at nuclear facilities compared their computer systems to automatic teller machines, allowing top secret withdrawals at our Nation's expense. 
   As public pressure has grown, Energy Secretary Richardson has announced various reforms; but these steps have been criticized as too little too late. In fact, the President's own advisory panel said, ``We seriously doubt [Energy Secretary Richardson's] initiatives will achieve lasting success,'' and noted ``these initiatives simply do not go far enough.'' In fact, though the Energy Secretary says he and his Department are on top of the situation, the Presidential panel warned that ``the Department of Energy is a dysfunctional bureaucracy that has proven it is incapable of reforming itself.'' Instead, the panel recommended that Congress reorganize the Department. 
   That is what Senator DOMENICI, Senator MURKOWSKI, and I have written legislation to do, to implement this recommendation of the President's advisory group. Our proposal would gather all of the parts of the nuclear weapons program under one semiautonomous agency within the Energy Department. It would separate the nuclear weapons work at the Energy Department from the other things they do there, such as setting efficiency standards for refrigerators. 
   The new agency will have clear lines of authority, responsibility, and accountability, with one person in charge, who will continue to report to the Energy Secretary. This would replace the current tangled bureaucratic structure that has led to the situation where everyone is responsible so no one is responsible. This is the only way to ensure that new security and counterintelligence measures are implemented to prevent future espionage from occurring unchecked. 
   I am pleased that the legislation enjoys broad bipartisan support. In addition to Senator DOMENICI, who chairs the Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee, and Senator MURKOWSKI, who chairs the Energy Committee, it is cosponsored by the chairman and vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, Senators SHELBY and KERREY; the chairman of the Armed Services Committee and its subcommittee chairman on Strategic Forces, Senator WARNER and Senator SMITH; the chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, Senator THOMPSON; the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator HELMS; the former chairman of the Intelligence Committee, Senator SPECTER; as well as Senators FEINSTEIN, HUTCHINSON, GREGG, BUNNING, FITZGERALD, and the distinguished majority leader, Senator LOTT. 
   Despite Secretary Richardson's recent announcement that he is prepared to drop his opposition to the creation of a semiautonomous agency, the reality is that he continues to oppose the core concepts underlying such an agency. 
   Despite extensive discussions that the sponsors have had with the Secretary and his staff, he continues to oppose our legislation. 
   The time has clearly come for the Senate to debate and adopt strong measures to safeguard our Nation and its nuclear secrets. As my colleagues will recall, in May Senators DOMENICI and MURKOWSKI and I attempted to offer a similar amendment to the defense authorization bill which was met with a Democratic filibuster and a threat by the Energy Secretary that he would recommend the President veto the bill. In justifying his refusal to allow debate or even a vote on our amendment, the Democratic whip termed our proposal ``premature'' and urged the Senate to hold hearings on the measure. 
   Over the past 2 months, four committees of the Senate have held six hearings specifically on our amendment. Furthermore, in the time since we first offered our amendment to the defense authorization bill, the Presidential panel headed by former Senator Rudman has published its report vindicating the approach of our original amendment. It is well past time to fix the chronic problems at our nuclear weapons facilities. Failure to move forward will only further jeopardize our Nation's security. 
   I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to rise above partisan politics, not to vote for obstruction and vulnerability but instead to vote in favor of cloture so the Senate can debate this important amendment.

   Mr. KYL. So as not to be in an unproductive quorum call, perhaps we could yield back time so we could speak in morning business. 
   Mr. President, I echo one of the thoughts of Chairman DOMENICI; that is, as we consider amendments to the proposal for a semiautonomous agency that tracks the recommendations of the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, I think we need to be very careful to ensure that the spirit of the recommendation, the fundamental basis for the recommendation of the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board--the so-called Rudman panel--is not in any way degrading. 
   That spirit, that fundamental basis, was to go directly to the heart of the criticism of the Department of Energy to date that it is incapable of reorganizing itself; that there are too many disparate groups within the Department that want control of the nuclear weapons program, or at least their particular part of control; that what is really needed within the Department, the President's panel said, was a very clear direct line of responsibility from the Secretary right down through this entire nuclear weapons program so that no one else within the Department of Energy, in effect, could get their hands on it; and that there was only one line of responsibility, and it was the Under Secretary with his authority and his responsibility to make that program work. 
   The amendments we have received from Members on the other side--all to one degree or another--picked that apart. They said, well, the Secretary can designate other people outside this semiautonomous agency to be in charge of certain personnel matters, or things of that sort, or we could have the Secretary interspersed between the Secretary of Energy and the Under Secretary in charge of these nuclear weapons programs. 
   Those kinds of structural changes may not appear to be significant on the surface, but each one of them detracts from this concept of a semiautonomous agency, which is the fundamental basis of our amendment. 
   It is what the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, or panel, said was the critical component of any reform to ensure that there are not other areas of responsibility. 
   One of the proposals is that the Under Secretary would have to have field administrative staff administering this program. That is exactly what the Rudman panel said you didn't want. That was part of this bifurcation of responsibility that was creating the problem to date--too many people having to sign off on too many different things. 
   The point I want to make as we are prepared to vote on whether to proceed--I gather it will be a nearly unanimous vote--with the debate and potential amendment of this legislation, to echo what Senator DOMENICI said, is that whatever amendments we consider we have to remain true to the basic concept. You can't have a semiautonomous agency in name but have the same old disparate responsibility in practice. That is why we are not going to be agreeing to amendments that detract from the autonomy of this structure--this semiautonomous nature of the jurisdiction of the Under Secretary. 
   That is going to be a critical component of this reform. We are going to have to reject all amendments, as benign sounding as they may be, that detract from that central concept. 
   I hope, if Members are going to present amendments, that they will understand, at least from the sponsors of the legislation, they will be met with opposition if they detract from that central principle. We are going to be standing very firm to support the President's own advisory board recommendations to the President. We hope, obviously, that the President in the end will support those as well. 
   My hope is, if there is no one else on the Democratic side who wishes to address this, that we can get some time yielded so we can address it from our side.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me first compliment Senator SHELBY and Senator KERREY, the chairman and vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, for their work in presenting the intelligence authorization bill to the floor. This amendment to the Intelligence Authorization bill deals with the all-important question of how the Department of Energy will be reorganized to ensure the theft of our nuclear secrets, as has occurred in the past, will be a question of the past and will not occur in the future. 
   As we heard earlier today, over the past several months, there have been a lot of sobering stories about how our Nation's security has been damaged by China's theft of America's most sensitive secrets--literally the crown jewels of our nuclear arsenal. In searching for a solution to this problem and examining how best to safeguard our Nation and its nuclear secrets, it has become clear the only way this can be accomplished is through a complete overhaul of how the Department of Energy is organized and how it is managed. 
   I think everyone can agree the system is broken. As the bipartisan Cox committee report pointed out, security and counterintelligence at U.S. nuclear facilities has been grossly deficient for many years, enabling China to steal classified information on all of the nuclear warheads currently deployed by the United States, as well as the neutron bomb, and a variety of other military know-how, including missile guidance and reentry vehicle technology. 
   This is incredibly important when a nation has been able to steal the secrets on how to build the most sophisticated weapons ever devised by mankind, those most sophisticated nuclear weapons in our arsenal. 
   When reports of the Chinese espionage at our nuclear labs became public earlier this year, President Clinton asked his Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, led by former Senator Warren Rudman, to investigate the cause of these terrible security breaches. Over the course of several weeks, the Presidential panel reviewed more than 700 reports and studies, thousands of pages of classified and unclassified documents, conducted interviews with scores of senior Federal officials, and visited the Department of Energy sites at the heart of the inquiry. 
   At the end of this exhaustive investigation, the panel concluded that the root cause of the Energy Department's dismal security and counterintelligence report was ``organizational disarray, managerial neglect, and a culture of arrogance ..... [which] conspired to create an espionage scandal waiting to happen.'' 
   The Presidential board went on to note that the Department of Energy (DOE) ``represents the best of America's scientific talent and achievement, but it has also been responsible for the worst security record on secrecy that the members of this panel have ever encountered.'' 
   Senator Rudman and his colleagues pulled no punches in describing the problems that exist at DOE or in prescribing bold solutions stating,  
   Reorganization [of DOE] is clearly warranted to resolve the many specific problems with security and counterintelligence in the weapons laboratories, but also to address the lack of accountability that has become endemic throughout the entire Department.  
   The Rudman report noted that,  
   The Department of Energy is a dysfunctional bureaucracy that has proven it is incapable to reforming itself. Accountability at DOE has been spread so thinly and erratically that it is now almost impossible to find. The long traditional and effective method of entrenched DOE and lab bureaucrats is to defeat security reform initiatives by waiting them out.  
   That is from the Rudman report. 
   I ask that our colleagues keep that in mind when they consider amendments that may be offered a little bit later to this amendment--amendments that people at the Department of Energy  would very much like to see passed because it would leave them in control, the very situation that the Rudman report notes is unacceptable and must be changed. 
   Furthermore, the authors of the Rudman report go on to say,  
   We are stunned by the huge numbers of DOE employees involved in overseeing a weapons lab contract. We repeatedly heard from officials at various levels of DOE and the weapons labs how this convoluted and bloated management structure has constantly transmitted confusing and often contradictory mandates to the labs.  
   Although Energy Secretary Richardson has announced several new initiatives to change management and procedures at DOE, the Presidential panel's report states, ``we seriously doubt that his initiatives will achieve lasting success,'' and notes, ``moreover, the Richardson initiatives simply do not go far enough.'' 
   In their report, the Presidential board also described the record of problems with implementing organizational changes ordered by previous Energy Secretaries and Deputy Secretaries, since the entrenched bureaucracy has often reverted to its old tricks once these people left. For example, the report notes that in 1990, then-Secretary Watkins ordered a new series of initiatives on safeguards and security to be implemented. According to the Rudman panel, once Secretary Watkins left two years later, ``the initiatives all but evaporated.'' And furthermore, the panel's report notes, ``Deputy Secretary Charles Curtis in late 1996 investigated clear indications of serious security and counterintelligence problems and drew up a list of initiatives in response. Those initiatives were also dropped after he left office.'' 
   It is because of these problems that the Presidential panel recommended that Congress act to reorganize the Department by statute, so that the bureaucracy could not simple wait out another Secretary of Energy. Senator DOMENICI, Senator MURKOWSKI, and I have written legislation to implement the group's recommendations. Our proposal would gather all of the parts of our nation's nuclear weapons research, development, and production programs under one semi-autonomous agency within the Energy Department. 
   We need to create a specific separate organizational structure for the weapons programs at DOE, managed by one person who reports only to the Secretary of Energy. And furthermore, we need to separate the nuclear weapons programs at DOE from the rest of the Department that is responsible for energy conservation and environmental management issues. As the Rudman report concluded, semi-autonomous agency, created by statute, is the only way we are going to solve the problems with DOE's management of the nuclear weapons complex. 
   Before explaining the details of this amendment, let me first mention that while the Cox Committee and the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, led by Senator Rudman, have done a great service to the nation by producing high quality reports with excellent recommendations, they are by no means the first people to recommend such changes. Over the past 20 years, at least 29 GAO reports, 61 internal DOE studies, and more than a dozen reports by outside commissions have called for restructuring how the Department is managed. Let us not wait until another forest is consumed to print more studies before we act to correct the serious management problems at DOE.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KYL. I am happy to comply. 
   Mr. President, the point of referring to these 29 GAO reports, 61 internal DOE studies, and more than a dozen reports by outside commissions over the past 20 years is to make the point that now is the time for us to move forward and not to await important studies, and not to await more discussions about how this ought to be done. We have enough evidence of what needs to be done. It is now time to get on with the serious subject of fixing this broken management structure at DOE. 
   Here is the summary of the amendment. 
   This amendment would create a semi-autonomous agency within DOE called the Agency for Nuclear Stewardship. 
   The Agency will be headed by an Under Secretary who ``shall report solely and directly to the Secretary and shall be subject to the supervision and direction of the Secretary.'' 
   Let me digress for a moment to make this point. 
   There are some who would put additional layers of bureaucracy between the Secretary and this Agency for Nuclear Stewardship. That would be a grave mistake. As the Rudman report itself notes, the point is to streamline this agency's responsibility, starting with the Secretary at the top and everyone else reporting to the Deputy Secretary who reports strictly to the Secretary of Energy. If you insert other management layers, you are only getting back to the same kind of problem that the Rudman report has criticized in the past. 
   .The Under Secretary for Nuclear Stewardship will have authority over all programs at DOE related to ``nuclear weapons, non-proliferation and fissile material disposition.'' 
   .The agency's semi-autonomy (as recommended by the Rudman report) is created by making all employees of the agency accountable to the Secretary and Under Secretary of Energy but not to other officials at DOE outside the Agency. 
   The language reads:  
   All personnel of the Agency for Nuclear Stewardship, in carrying out any function of the Agency, shall be responsible to, and subject to the supervision and direction of, the Secretary and the Under Secretary for Nuclear Stewardship or his designee within the Agency, and shall not be responsible to, or subject to the supervision or direction of, any other officer, employee, or agent of any other part of the Department.  
   .The Secretary, however, ``may direct other officials of the Department who are not within the Agency for Nuclear Stewardship to review the Agency's programs and to make recommendations to the Secretary regarding the administration of such programs, including consistency with other similar programs and activities in the Department.'' 
   There is another proposed amendment which we will get to later which suggests that all of the programs and activities of this special new autonomous agency are to act in ways consistent with all other departmental rules and regulations promulgated for all of the other departments within the Department of Energy. 
   That would be a big mistake and get right back to the problem that the Rudman commission noted; that is, that this is a special, unique entity, and that you cannot have everybody else within the Department of Energy controlling what goes on within this particular group. 
   The Under Secretary for Nuclear Stewardship will have 3 Deputy Directors, who will manage programs in the following areas: 
   No. 1. Defense Programs. The national lab directors and heads of weapons production and test sites will report directly to this person, who will be responsible for managing the programs necessary to maintain the safety and reliability of our nuclear stockpile. 
   No. 2. Nonproliferation and fissile materials disposition. This person would manage the Energy Department's efforts to help Russia and other states of the former Soviet Union secure their nuclear weapons and fissile material, as well as plan for how to dispose of dozens of tons of excess plutonium in the United States and Russia; and 
   No. 3. Naval Reactors. This highly successful program which designs, constructs, operates, and disposes of the nuclear reactors used in the U.S. Navy's fleet will continue to operate as it does today, except the Admiral in charge will now report to the Under Secretary for Nuclear Stewardship as well as the Secretary of Energy. 
   As recommended by the Rudman panel, under our amendment, the Under Secretary for Nuclear Stewardship will appoint Chiefs of Counterintelligence, Security, and Intelligence. 
   The Chief of Counterintelligence will develop and implement the Agency's  programs to prevent the disclosure of loss of classified information and be responsible for personnel assurance programs, like background checks. 
   The Chief of Security will be responsible for the development and implementation of programs for the protection, control, and accounting of fissile material, and for the physical and cyber-security of all sites in the Agency. 
   And the Chief of Intelligence will manage the Agency's programs for the analysis of foreign nuclear weapons programs. 
   These 3 chiefs will report to the Under Secretary and shall have statutorily provided ``direct access to the Secretary and all other senior officials of the Department and its contractors'' concerning these matters. 
   The amendment calls on the Under Secretary for Nuclear Stewardship to report annually through the Secretary to Congress regarding: 
   No. 1. The adequacy of DOE procedures and policies for protecting national security information. 
   No. 2. Whether each DOE national laboratory and nuclear weapons production and test site is in full compliance with all Departmental security requirements, and if not what measures are being taken to bring a lab into compliance; and 
   No. 3. A description of the number and type of violations of security and counterintelligence laws and requirements at DOE nuclear weapons facilities. 
   Furthermore, the amendment calls for the Under Secretary to keep the Secretary and the Congress fully and currently informed about any potentially significant threat to, or loss of, national security information. 
   The amendment would require every employee of DOE, the national labs, or associated contractors to alert the Under Secretary whenever they believe there is a problem, abuse or violation of the law relating to the management of national security information. 
   And, in order to address concerns that DOE officials were blocked from notifying Congress of security and counterintelligence breaches, the amendment contains a provision stating that ``no officer or employee of the Department of Energy or any other Federal agency or department may delay, deny, obstruct, or otherwise interfere with the preparation'' of these reports to Congress. 
   Mr. President, the Senate should act with urgency to correct the serious problems that exist at our nuclear facilities to halt the flow of our precious nuclear secrets to countries like China. 
   Our amendment is a sound approach to rectifying the systematic problems that have been identified and that exist today, and I am disappointed that Secretary Richardson has not yet embraced the proposal we have submitted. Since as recently as April of 1999, the Secretary of Energy's own Management Review Report stated:  
   Significant problems exist [in DOE] in that roles and responsibilities are unclear; lines of authority and accountability are not well understood or followed; the distinction between headquarters, line and staff functions is unclear, and each is operating with autonomy.  
   Statistics support this view. According to the GAO, from 1980 to 1996, DOE terminated 9 of 18 major defense program projects after spending $1.9 billion and completed only two projects: One behind schedule and overbudget, with the other behind schedule and underbudget. Schedule slippages and cost overruns occurred on many of the remaining seven projects ongoing in 1996. 
   Finally, I note that management problems cannot be divorced from security concerns. As the GAO noted in testimony to the House, continuing management problems at DOE were ``key factors contributing to security problems at the laboratories'' and a ``major reason why DOE has been unable to develop long-term solutions to recurring problems reported by the advisory groups.'' 
   The amendment we offer enjoys broad bipartisan support. In addition to Senator DOMENICI who chairs the Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee, and Senator MURKOWSKI who chairs the Energy Committee, it is cosponsored by the chairman and vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, Senators SHELBY and KERREY; the chairman of the Armed Services Committee and its Subcommittee on Strategic Forces, Senators WARNER and SMITH; chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, Senator THOMPSON; chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator HELMS; former chairman of the Intelligence Committee, Senator SPECTER; as well as Senator FEINSTEIN, Senator HUTCHINSON, Senator GREGG, Senator BUNNING, Senator FITZGERALD, and the distinguished majority leader, Senator LOTT. 
   We cannot delay the implementation of important security and counterintelligence upgrades at our nuclear labs and facilities. Great harm to our Nation's security has already been done, and if we want to prevent further damage, we must act to reform the way we manage our nuclear weapons programs and facilities to create accountability and responsibility. Our most fundamental duty as Senators is to protect the security and the safety of the American people. They deserve no less than our best in this regard. I urge my colleagues to act now to halt the hemorrhage of America's nuclear secrets and to support the adoption of this important amendment.

   Mr. KYL. I ask the indulgence of the chairman for just a moment. I know he wants to proceed and make a brief comment or 
   two. I want to comment on a couple of things the Senator from Nebraska just said. 
   First of all, I compliment him. He is vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee and probably one of the most productive members of the committee in doing the hard work of protecting our Nation's security, which most people will never know about. 
   For his constituents and others in America who are concerned about these things, they need to know it is the day-in-and-day-out work of the chairman of the committee, Senator SHELBY, and Senator KERREY from Nebraska who make this effort work. 
   Second, I compliment Senator KERREY for working on this legislation and agreeing to support it at a time when his party's administration was not yet supportive. Secretary Richardson did not agree to the concept of a semiautonomous agency until relatively recently. But Senator KERREY agreed this was the best approach to take, I think even before Senator Rudman came out with his report. 
   Coming out early and saying it is important to reorganize and to pay attention to the national security concerns at the Department of Energy was something he was willing to do early on in a bipartisan way. His conduct throughout this whole matter is exemplary and should offer guidance to all of us on any issue we face. Party aside, when there is a problem to be addressed, we get in and try to address it. 
   I assure Senator KERREY and others on the Democratic side this is not something the Republicans look to as an issue but rather as something to get done. I hope before we finish with the amendments, we can continue to work on them and try to get as much of a bipartisan coalition in support of the legislation as is possible because there is nothing partisan about national security and there is nothing partisan when it comes to espionage at our National Laboratories. 
   I thank the Senator from Nebraska for the comments he made, and I compliment both Senator KERREY and Senator SHELBY for the great job they have done. 
   Senator WARNER is on the floor. He has been stalwart in his support of our efforts, each day asking: What is new; we will stick with you; we know this has to be done. That kind of support is encouraging. 
   We can get this done. If we get it done quickly, it is good for the American people.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me begin by complimenting Senator JEFFORDS, the chairman of the committee, for the work the committee has done, and all of the members of the committee, in bringing forth this legislation. I make a point to those who might be watching, this debate, frankly, is not quite as cut and dried, as black and white, as people on both sides of the aisle are attempting to make it. This is a complicated issue. I want to compliment some of my friends on the Democratic side for insisting the issue be brought before the Senate for debate. 
   There are, indeed, situations around this country in which some HMOs have abused their position. In order to cut costs--which we all would like to see--some HMOs have denied the highest-quality care to people under their care. That is something about which we all should be concerned. 
   Just as much, we need to be concerned about how much it will cost to fix the problem. If it costs too much, the cost of insurance escalates too high, too many people will no longer be able to buy the insurance that is offered. 
   We have to be very careful that in working out a solution to what is, in fact, a real problem, we don't go too far. That is where the differences of opinion are. They should be considered reasonable differences between reasonable people. But I fear that too much of the debate has been characterized by finger-pointing and by both sides characterizing the other side's ideas as absolutely off the wall, or that no one could possibly ever think such a thing could solve the problem, when, in reality, there are some common answers and there are some good ideas on both sides. 
   One of the problems Senator EDWARDS was referring to a moment ago was a problem during the external review process and what would be included in that external review process. There is going to be a change made by Senator ASHCROFT and myself that I am sure will be fully acceptable to the Senator from North Carolina. It accepts part of the definition he and others have offered with respect to what ought to be considered. Specifically, among the factors to be considered are not just what the HMO writes as its ``practice guidelines or definitions,'' but also ``recognized best practice'' and ``generally accepted medical practice.'' I know the Senator would be pleased with that. 
   The fact of the matter is if we continue to talk about this we are going to be able to come to some common agreement about what will make this work. We have to be careful it doesn't end up costing so much that it drives people off of insurance plans. 
   I will talk about that for a moment. David Broder, a respected columnist, wrote on April 7 in the Washington Post that the cold truth about health care raises this critical policy issue which is the irrefutable link between health care premium increases and the number of Americans without insurance. He said as we debate these various proposals, we have to keep this linkage in mind. 
   My colleagues on the other side are quick to point out their bill could improve health care, but they are not so quick to admit it will raise costs. That is the problem. If it raises costs too much, some employers will stop offering health insurance as a benefit. That will make insurance unaffordable for more Americans. Obviously, that means people are worse off, not better off. 
   Here are some statistics I think we should keep in mind. The Lewin Group, a very respected consulting group, said for each 1 percent of premium increase, an additional 300,000 citizens will lose their insurance; 300,000 people will lose their insurance for every 1 percent premium increase. 
   The Barents Group, another respected entity, projects a 5-percent premium increase would cause 1.6 million Americans to become uninsured. It further points out the increase would force employees who already have insurance to pay an additional average of $935 per household in out-of-pocket expenses. Most families are not going to be able to afford that. 
   The Congressional Budget Office has concluded the bill offered by our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, the Daschle-Kennedy Democratic proposal, would increase premiums by 6.1  percent. That is the Congressional Budget Office. That is not a biased insurance company study. By these projections of these specialty groups, this would result in almost 2 million more uninsured nationally. 
   In my own State of Arizona, over 34,000 people who are currently insured would be uninsured as a result of the increased premium costs, if the Democratic proposal were to pass. That is why some of the people on this side of the aisle are so concerned about what is being done. Yes, there is a problem, but the physician's first rule of thumb is to do no harm. We are concerned on this side that the proposal of the Democrats is so costly that it would, in effect, remove 3 million people from the insurance rolls. That is a worse result than is currently the case. 
   We believe, and David Broder concluded in his column, by correctly pointing out, that additional benefits for those with insurance are less vital than providing access to basic care for the uninsured. This is one of the reasons why we have provisions in our bill which would provide more of an opportunity for people to actually get insurance and why we think the Democratic version of this bill is just too expensive. 
   What does the Congressional Budget Office score the Republican bill as costing? Less than 1 percent. That is why we believe ours is a better approach. We would not preempt the laws of 50 States, as would the Democratic bill. 
   Here are some of the things the Republican bill would do: 
   First, we make health care more affordable for the self-employed by letting them deduct 100 percent of their health premiums in the year 2000, 3 years ahead of schedule. 
   We give more patients more control over their medical care and make it more affordable by expanding access to medical savings accounts. These MSAs can provide coverage for a lot of Americans who currently are not covered. 
   We require the health plans actually provide the benefits that have been promised. 
   We require the health plans provide care based on the best scientific information available. 
   We require the health plans provide patients with access to their medical records and ensure that the medical information will only be used to provide better care, not to increase their premiums. 
   We require the health plans provide reasonable access to specialists such as OB/GYNs and pediatricians without the need for referral. 
   We require them to remove so-called gag clauses. I worked on that with my colleague, RON WYDEN. 
   We require they be held accountable through the appeals process. This is where I refer back to the colloquy Senator JEFFORDS and Senator EDWARDS had a moment ago. It is true that HMOs write their contracts. They are the ones that write the contract. They can't force any employer to contract with them. This is a matter of bargaining. It is a matter of competition. It is a matter of what they cover. Once a contract has been written and an employer has bought that contract and provided coverage to his employees, the question then is in any given case whether or not a particular procedure may be medically necessary. 
   What we provide in our legislation is a two-step process by which this matter can be reviewed. It is by an independent party with the external review. Not by the HMO, not by somebody the HMO picks; rather, it is by an independent external medical reviewer, someone who has expertise in the area in which the diagnosis is involved. 
   This has to be done on an expedited basis so if there is a concern about time, the care can be provided in a timely way. 
   Senator ASHCROFT and I will be proposing two changes to the language which I think solves two big problems. The first is the problem Senator EDWARDS raised. We add to the factors that the external review specialist has to consider not only the party's records and the evidence submitted by the plan and the guidelines offered by the plan but also the external review expert would have to examine the recognized best practice and generally accepted medical practice as part of the consideration of what is appropriate in any particular case. It wouldn't be bound by any of these specifics but would have to consider these factors. 
   Another thing we have added, and I think it is very important, in the event for some reason the HMO would decide, even though it had been ordered by the external reviewer to provide a certain procedure or care, should it decide not to do so, then in that case we have provided a new process whereby the patient will be able to go to some other physician or some other provider and have that care provided by the other provider and bill the HMO that refused to follow the recommendation or the order of the external reviewer. So in no case should there be a situation where after the expert external review process takes place and a particular procedure has been ordered, in no case should the party be denied that care. 
   There is one final thing I want to say. There has been a lot of finger-pointing about HMOs, about doctors, and so on. I think it is important to recognize that HMOs have provided an important contribution to reducing costs and providing quality care to the citizens of our country. It is equally important to note that physicians have done a tremendous job in working under the conditions that were unfamiliar to them--the conditions of managed care--which require them in many cases to submit their diagnosis, plans, and care plans to someone else for review, something they are loath to do. 
   And in many cases they have been overruled with respect to the care they would like to provide. The physicians are not just out to put money in their pockets. They are guaranteed only a certain amount by these HMOs, and it is a less and less amount each year. They are concerned for the good of their patients. I do not think we ought to be constantly pointing our fingers at doctors as if they are somehow the problem. Physicians are fighting for their patients, for the kind of care they think their patients need. 
   When a group such as the American Medical Association, for example, lobbies legislation, they are trying to do what they think is right for the good of their patients. Even though I do not support the legislation they have been sponsoring primarily, I am going to be the first to defend the physicians of this country, and specifically the American Medical Association, for doing what it thinks is right. 
   So I urge my colleagues, as we trade charges back and forth, that we just lower the rhetoric a little bit, recognize there is a problem to be solved, recognize that both sides of the controversy have something important to contribute, and try to come together with an idea that will solve the problem at an affordable cost. 
   That is what I think the Republican bill does. I again commend Senator JEFFORDS and his committee for coming forth with this legislation.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, this is one of the amendments which was offered during the subcommittee markup but which we did not pursue because we had not identified offsets for the additional $50 million being requested, and we wanted an opportunity to try to work it out before the bill came before the Senate. 
   We have not really worked out all of the details of this. Therefore, I am informed by the chairman of the subcommittee he may not be able to support this amendment at this time. 
   It is my intention to at least begin the process on behalf of myself and Senator HUTCHISON, who hopefully will be present shortly, so we can begin the discussion as to how to find a way to fund some additional Customs inspectors, particularly to be deployed on the southwest border. 
   Before I describe the problem and the reason for this, I commend the chairman and the ranking member of the subcommittee for a really heroic effort to save existing Customs inspectors. 
   What had happened is, the way the administration's budget had been prepared, it was going to fund existing agents out of a fee structure that never had any chance of being passed by the Congress or implemented into law. Had not the chairman and ranking member acted quickly to find other sources of funding, we would have lost 617 existing Customs inspectors, but they were able to find that money elsewhere. 
   As a result, those positions have been saved at least for now. Where that leaves us is exactly even, with no increase in Customs officers, despite the huge increases in the number of people and the amount of commercial traffic crossing our border, particularly in the Southwest. 
   What that means is we are just literally dead in the water despite the efforts of the subcommittee chairman, Senator CAMPBELL. 
   That is why we wanted to find an additional $50 million to hire 500 agents--only 500 agents--for next year to help with this problem. 
   Let me describe a little bit the problem on the Southwest border. As you know, we passed NAFTA. NAFTA has enabled us to dramatically increase commercial traffic between Mexico and the border, our four border States of the United States. But even without NAFTA, we would still have an increase in commercial traffic as well as the daily traffic between the communities south of the border and the American cities on our side. 
   I was somewhat amused that my colleague from Michigan, Senator ABRAHAM, was very concerned about the situation on the Canadian border near Detroit. He was lamenting the fact we could end up with a situation where there was a 2-minute delay for every car going through the border checkpoint--a 2-minute delay. Just think what that would mean with the large number of people who wanted to cross into the United States from Canada each day. 
   The reason I had to chuckle a little bit is, if we are successful, if we do get some additional agents, and the chairman of the subcommittee is successful in protecting what we have, our goal, stated by the Finance Committee, is to get to the point where we will only have a 20-minute delay per car at the Arizona border or at the Mexican-United States border. 
   A 20-minute delay every time you want to cross the border becomes onerous, particularly to people who live in the border communities and who every day cross the border for business or for family or pleasure reasons. There are literally hundreds and thousands of people who do that every day. This does not speak of the commercial traffic, which I will talk about in just a moment. 
   The point is, we are trying to get to a point where it only takes you 20 minutes to come into the United States or to go into Mexico. But we are talking specifically about coming into the United States. That is a very onerous situation when you are trying to promote commerce as well as more tourists coming to the United States, as well as families. So this is not something that is a luxury but something I think everyone would recognize is very important. 
   I will talk about some of the numbers because I think it is very instructive. 
   The traffic congestion at any of our border crossing points into Mexico--you just have to be there to see it. The number of commercial trucks, for example, that cross the border annually in my State of Arizona increased from 287,000 in 1994 to 347,000 in 1998. We do not have the personnel to keep up with that congestion. 
   For example, in San Luis, AZ, which depends very heavily on cross-border trade, you can easily wait 3 hours to cross. That is not unheard of at all, to sit there for 3 hours waiting to cross into the United States. This is during times when it is very critical, particularly for produce. Much of the commercial traffic that comes from Mexico to the United States is produce. It does not do any good for that produce to be sitting out there for 3 hours in the very warm sun south of Yuma, AZ, waiting to come in through the border crossing. 
   I ask my colleagues, if they had to wait 3 hours every time they wanted to get someplace on Capitol Hill, how long they would stand for it. Obviously, not very long. 
   We just don't have enough Customs inspectors, however, to 
   staff that San Luis port even to stay open during some key hours. I point out, the commercial point is closed on Saturdays. So we are only talking about general business hours.  
   In effect, what ends up happening is, you get cancellations or reroutes hundreds of miles away to other ports when you have these kinds of long delays. The number of inspectors at this particular port of San Luis has increased. Do you want to know by how much it has increased? One inspector over the last 5 years. That is all. It went from 51 to 52. Obviously, we are not keeping up with the traffic. 
   The same is true of the port of Nogales, which is the largest port in Arizona. There the fresh produce industry is very big, both import and export. It is over $1.5 billion a year. It is now the fifth busiest port on our Southwest border. But the Nogales port does not have enough inspectors. The number of inspectors there actually decreased last year by seven. 
   According to the Fresh Produce Association of America, there have been occasions, even during the low-produce season, where 6-mile truck backups have occurred down in Mexico. Just think about that for a moment--6 miles of trucks waiting to clear Customs. It is not at all uncommon for the truckers to come to the border and literally have to wait overnight before they can find a slot the next day to cross into the United States. And we are trying to encourage trade? 
   We understand that trade benefits people on both sides of the border. Obviously, we are not doing our part when the produce from Mexico cannot come into the United States because we do not have enough inspectors. 
   The lack of personnel on our borders is also a very serious problem with respect to the interdiction of illegal drugs and other contraband. As we all know, the Customs inspectors are really our first line of defense there. I have been on the border where you have these huge, long lines of traffic. Everybody is anxious to get through, and you just have a few ports with a few inspectors there struggling mightily to determine whether or not there may be some illegal drugs or contraband. We have given them some good high-tech equipment they can use, but it still requires manpower. Every week, they are able to stop some kind of traffic in which smuggling is going on, but they do not begin to catch even a fairly significant percentage of it. 
   Just to give you an idea what they have been able to accomplish, between 1994 and 1998 heroin seizures have gone up by 2,078 percent, marijuana seizures up 80 percent. It is clear that more Customs inspectors are needed to keep up with these increasing percentages of attempts to smuggle drugs and other contraband into our country. 
   As I mentioned a moment ago, the Finance Committee marked up its version of the Customs reauthorization bill not too long ago. In it, they approved legislation that Senators DOMENICI, GRAMM, HUTCHISON, and MCCAIN, and I and other border Senators introduced, to increase the Customs personnel in order to reduce the wait times there to better fight the war on drugs and to enhance commerce to 20 minutes per vehicle. 
   When we can't even provide the funding to get the wait times down to 20 minutes per vehicle, we are derelict in our duty; we are failing in our responsibility; and the responsibility is on the Congress of the United States. 
   That is why Senator HUTCHISON and I have introduced this amendment to add $50 million for 500 inspectors. We may take one item out to make it $49 million so that the offsets we have provided would be more easily supportable by our colleagues, but this is an increase of merely 500 agents with this $50 million. That is what it costs to get the equipment and the training and get this number of Customs inspectors actually on line at one of our ports of entry. 
   The amendment, as I said, will actually permit the deployment of these agents during the next year to one of these points of entry where they are needed for the Southwest border. 
   Just to focus a little bit more on the specific need with respect to commerce there, should my colleagues be interested, the number of trucks crossing the U.S. border annually has increased from 7.5 million in 1994 to over 10 million in 1998. That is a 40-percent increase. More than 372 million people crossed either the United States-Mexico or United States-Canadian border in the last fiscal year. 
   But even with this huge increase in the crossings, of both individuals and commercial traffic, the number of Customs inspectors and the canine enforcement officers--that is an important part of this, too--has only increased by 540 people between 1994 and 1998. That is simply not enough to keep up with the commercial traffic, let alone the missing of opportunities to seize illegal drugs. 
   Of the 3,400-plus pounds of illegal heroin seized last year, Customs seized 2,700 pounds. Of the 1.76 million pounds of marijuana seized, Customs seized just under 1 million pounds. And of the roughly 265,000 pounds of cocaine seized last year, Customs seized 148,000 pounds. 
   Clearly, this is where the first line of defense is in our war on drugs. I know my colleagues and I love to stand here and talk about how we need to get tougher in the war on drugs. This is our chance. The first line of defense in the war on drugs in the United States is at the point of entry 
   where people attempt to bring this illegal contraband into our country and, because we are unwilling to fund the number of customs inspectors required, we don't have enough people on the border to check every vehicle and, therefore, to find and to stop these kinds of illegal drugs coming into our country. 
   I know the chairman of the subcommittee has talked a lot about the need to meet this need. I don't think there are any of us who don't appreciate what we have to try to do. It is very difficult in a tough budget environment to find the money to do it. 
   What I have tried to point out is that we have to set priorities. If you look at all of the other parts of the budget, I can't find hardly any area in this particular budget that, in my view, has a higher priority than protecting our kids from drugs, than protecting our border from people who are literally invading our country with illegal substances to do detriment to our citizens. What is more important in this budget than that? 
   I, literally, challenge my colleagues who will oppose our amendment, defending appropriations that are in this mark for their particular area of interest, because we have had to provide $50 million in offsets in order to fund this $50 million for increased Customs agents, I challenge my colleagues to come to the floor and be willing to explain why what they are trying to protect in this budget is of a higher priority than stopping drugs at our border. I will be very curious to see how many of our colleagues are willing to come and vote against our amendment because it is taking funding out of something that is important to them, to explain to us why that is more important than this. 
   I am sorry to present that challenge as directly as I am. I think if we are going to be serious about this problem, rather than just talk about it, we have to address this in a very serious way that makes tough choices, that prioritizes. We can't just say, well, it is hard to do, and, therefore, we will try to do it next year. That is why we are so insistent on trying to accomplish this now. 
   There is much more I could say about this particular problem at this time. Senator KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON is going to speak to this amendment as well. Perhaps the chairman of the subcommittee would like to address the issue now; I am not certain. Perhaps I could make that opportunity available, should the subcommittee chairman wish to avail himself of it. 
   If not, I am happy to speak to the issue more. 
   Let me stop at this point and see if Members might have any other conversation on this amendment.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I just wanted to address a comment to the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator CAMPBELL. I made the point when I first began to speak that without his efforts, we would not have been able to save existing Customs inspectors. I misspoke and understated the nature of the problem and, therefore, the significance of what Senator CAMPBELL was able to accomplish. I think in the way I stated it, I said there were 617 additional inspectors that were at risk. Actually, I think the number is closer to 5,000. 
   Had Senator CAMPBELL and the other leadership of the subcommittee not gotten to the problem to find an additional $312 million, as he pointed out, all 5,000 of those existing inspectors would have been at risk because they were being funded by a source which was not ever going to materialize and, in fact, which has not materialized. So in announcing the chairman's successes, I actually understated the nature of what he was able to accomplish. Senator HUTCHISON and I, therefore, take nothing away from the chairman of the committee, who has had to scramble very hard to try to help find a solution to this problem of Customs agents at our borders. 
   We have expressed, I think, in the strongest terms that we can, our appreciation for that. The chairman doesn't have to remind us of the hard work that he has put into that. We simply are of the view that we have to find a way to do more than tread water to stay even because, as both of us have pointed out, the traffic at the border is not staying even. The drug smugglers' efforts to bring more contraband into the country is not staying even. We have to try to keep up. The modest increase we are talking about is an effort to try to keep up with the nature of the problem that we have. 
   Point No. 1, the chairman is absolutely correct. They fought very hard to get additional money just to save the status quo. 
   But I think the second point we are making is also valid; that is, preserving the status quo isn't good enough. We need to try to find a source to at least find another $50 million for these additional Customs inspectors to at least try to keep pace with what is going on at our borders. 
   I ask the chairman, if there is no further discussion, we could simply defer a vote on this until afterwards. It is my understanding there will be a vote on the Lautenberg amendment in roughly 90 minutes or so. Perhaps we can simply conclude this conversation now and schedule any vote immediately after that.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to authorize the Bureau of Reclamation to produce commemorative items for sale at the Hoover Dam Visitor Center. 
   Mr. President, the Hoover Dam receives more than one million visitors a year. Many of those visitors have expressed an interest in purchasing books, maps, photos, and other memorabilia relating to the Colorado River and the design, construction, and operation of the Dam. This bill would authorize the production and sale of such items, including the minting of commemorative coins from scrap copper that came from electrical cabinets and boxes which were used when the Dam was manually operated. Four to five tons of copper are available for this purpose. 
   Mr. President, this bill not only responds to the public's demand for Hoover Dam-related items, it also creates a revenue source to help repay the cost of constructing the visitor center and of providing guided tours of the Dam and its power plant. Currently, purchasers of Hoover Dam power in Arizona, California, and Nevada are paying for the construction of the visitor center, which ended up costing approximately $125 million, nearly four times as much as the original estimate. This bill further authorizes the Bureau to select a private concessionaire to manage the gift shop selling these items, thereby creating a new business opportunity for a private or a non-profit entity. Thus, this bill would enhance the visitor experience at Hoover Dam in a taxpayer-friendly way.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I support S. 96, the Y2K Act of 1999. The subject of Y2K liability is an important and timely issue for the Senate to address. As you know, I serve on the Senate Special Committee on the Year 2000 Technology Problem. Earlier this year, the Committee held a hearing examining Y2K litigation and its potential effect on the courts. A study by the Gartner Group estimated that the cost of Y2K-related litigation could reach $1 trillion. 
   The issue of liability is especially important to me. Last Congress, I sponsored the Year 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act, which became law. That legislation encouraged companies to disclose and exchange information about computer processing problems, solutions, test practices, and test results that have to do with preparing for the year 2000. The goal of the bill was to encourage information sharing, which would in turn lead to remediation, which would in turn lead to greater Y2K compliance. Unfortunately, many companies still fear liability, and it is that fear of lawsuits that is inhibiting them from getting done what is needed--which is remediation. The goal of S. 96, like that of the Year 2000 Information and Readiness and Disclosure Act, is to ease the fear of lawsuits so businesses can focus on remediation rather than litigation.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, it is common for Members of the Senate to thank members of their staff, particularly after handling an important piece of legislation. I am sure our constituents realize much of what we do is in reliance on very capable members of our staff. I have never taken the opportunity to talk about a member of my staff before, but on this occasion I wish to do so very briefly, because tomorrow a member of my staff is leaving to go on to another wonderful opportunity. I think it is important to recognize her as someone who embodies really the qualifications and the qualities of staff that all of us would like to have work with us and represent our constituents' interests. 
   Her name is Jeanine Esperne. She began working with me about a dozen years ago when I was a Member of the House of Representatives and served on the House Armed Services Committee. She became my chief legislative assistant on defense matters. She came from the office of General Abramson, who at the time was head of the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization at the Pentagon, with rich experience in defense and national security matters. 
   She worked with me as staff person on my Defense Armed Services Committee matters throughout my career in the House. Then, when I came to the Senate, she remained on my staff responsible for all foreign policy and national security matters. 
   That was important, because I began serving immediately on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in an active capacity and had a significant need for someone of her qualifications and experience. 
   In addition to that, I chaired the Subcommittee on Technology, Terrorism, and Government Information of the Judiciary Committee, again requiring someone with her expertise to assist me in those matters. 
   Throughout her tenure on my staff, she has worked with Arizona companies and interests that have important defense-related concerns and with other people around the country who share a strong desire that we have a strong national defense, including contractors and other individuals with a direct interest in the government process. 
   During this time, the feedback I received from both my own constituents and others around the country was uniformly in praise of Jeanine Esperne for her willingness to listen, her professionalism, the fact she used time very economically. She didn't waste time; she understood that time was important to everyone. She got her job done  very quickly with a minimum of excess effort, almost always satisfying the interests of the constituent or the person with whom we were trying to work. 
   It is with mixed emotions that today I pay tribute to Jeanine Esperne on her next to last day on my staff as she moves on to another opportunity. I do so not only because she has worked for me in a way which exemplifies the way most Members would have their staffs work with them, but I think it is important for our constituency to know that we have very fine staff in the Congress, that our work could not be done without that staff, and that when we take the opportunity to praise the staff, it is really to praise their exceptional abilities and the way in which they have served our constituents. 
   In the case of Jeanine Esperne, I certainly express all of those sentiments, wish her very well in her new endeavors, and certainly suggest that occasionally those Members who are so busy doing jobs here take the time more often to thank those staff who, after all, are responsible for so much of our success. 
   Jeanine Esperne, good wishes and thank you for all of your services on behalf of the U.S. Government, and on my behalf specifically. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. KYL. Thank you. 
   Mr. President, let me briefly describe the purpose of this amendment. I will acknowledge right up front that Senator DOMENICI, from New Mexico, has been a primary motivating factor in addressing this subject, based upon his expertise with our National Laboratories and his concerns about national security. A lot of folks sat down to try to determine what the best course of action would be for us to begin to take steps to ensure the security of our National Laboratories. Certainly, Senator DOMENICI is the person one would first turn to for that kind of consideration. 
   Next, Senator MURKOWSKI, the chairman of the Energy Committee, is someone who has jurisdiction and who has held hearings and who has a great deal to offer with respect to the organization of the Department of Energy, in particular the weapons programs, so we can ensure that we have security over those programs.  
   Naturally, Senator SHELBY, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, has also had his input into this amendment, as have others. 
   It will be important that each of these key chairmen has an opportunity to discuss this bill. But I especially thank Senator DOMENICI for his efforts in doing literally hundreds of hours of research on the best possible approach to secure our National Laboratories. 
   That is what this amendment is all about. This amendment is, actually, the second step we will have 
   taken in this defense authorization bill to begin to rebuild the security of our National Laboratories. 
   In the Armed Services Committee, a provision that deals with this subject was included in the bill. We have incorporated that part of their bill into this amendment. In addition to that, the Secretary of Energy, Secretary Richardson, has some ideas about his organization. The centerpiece of his ideas we have also incorporated into this amendment. 
   What we are trying to do here is to get the best ideas that everybody has to offer, and thereby ensure that when we finally finish this legislative session, and finish discussing this with the administration, we will have the best possible approach to security at our National Laboratories. 
   The essence of this amendment is to establish, in the Department of Energy, a new Office of Counterintelligence which would be headed by a senior executive from the FBI. I will come back to that. But that office has been identified in the defense authorization bill. We simply flush out the provisions of that office in that bill and ensure that that officer will have total authority here to deal with issues of counterintelligence at our National Laboratories. 
   Then the second part of this amendment is to address the longstanding management problems of the Department of Energy, especially relating to the nuclear weapons complex and reorganizing the Department of Energy in such a way that there is a very clear line of authority over the nuclear weapons programs, with a person at the top of that, an administrator, who has the responsibility over all of these nuclear programs, and nothing else, within the Department. And, by the same token, nobody else in the Department, except those who are senior to him, including the Secretary of the Department of Energy, would have any authority over his programs. 
   In effect, what we are replacing in the Department of Energy is a situation in which all of the rules and regulations and management policies, and everything else that applies to everybody within the Department--including the weapons complex--have created a situation in which, literally, they have not been able to focus on the management of the nuclear weapons complexes, especially with regard to security. 
   So what this amendment does--in the intelligence community terminology--is to create a ``stovepipe'' within the Department of Energy. At the top, of course, is the Secretary of Energy. Below him is a person with the rank of Assistant Secretary, called the ``administrator,'' who would, within that stovepipe, have the total authority to operate the Department of Energy weapons programs, including the security functions of those programs. 
   He would be doing this, of course, in coordination with the office that would be created by the language put in the bill by the Armed Services Committee relating to counterintelligence, with the FBI presence here, and the two of them would coordinate the national security portions of this program. 
   In this way, you do not have people within the Department of Energy responsible for all kinds of other things. Somebody talked about refrigerator standards and powerplant issues and all of the rest of it. Those people would not have anything to do with this. This group would not have anything to do with them. This would be a discrete function within the Department that would have nothing to do except manage our nuclear weapons programs, including, first and foremost, the security of those programs. 
   We will have much more to say about the details of this after a bit. Certainly Senator DOMENICI can go into many of the reasons he has helped to craft this in the way that organizationally it will work. 
   Let me just make two concluding points. 
   First of all, I do not think we can emphasize enough the need to do something about security at the Laboratories now. One of the concerns that has been raised about the amendment we have offered here is that it is premature, that we should hold hearings, and we should take a long time so we can ``do this right.'' 
   We have since 1995. And this administration has not done it right. It is time for the Senate to get involved in this issue and begin the debate by putting this amendment out there. We will have plenty of time to deal with this before this bill ever goes to the President of the United States. 
   This is our approach to the best management for this weapons program. We believe that to delay anymore is to engage in the same obfuscation and delay and, frankly, dereliction of duty that has characterized this administration's approach to national security at our Nation's Laboratories, our nuclear weapons programs. We can't delay any longer. 
   If I were to go home over this Memorial Day recess, the first thing my constituents would talk to me about is, what about this Chinese espionage? What about security at the Laboratories? If I say to them, well, we were in such a hurry to get this Department of Defense authorization bill done that we didn't really do anything about security at our Nation's Laboratories, we are going to take our time and do that later, I think I would be pilloried, and so would all the rest of my colleagues. Our constituents expect us to act with alacrity. I don't see how we can complain about the Department of Energy and about the administration taking their sweet time to deal with this problem if we don't address it up front and right now. 
   The second point I make in closing is, with regard to a previous draft of this legislation, the Secretary of Energy is indicating that he doesn't approve of everything in here and might even recommend a veto of the legislation. I am sure by the time he is done hearing the debate and conferring with us and reading the actual language of the amendment, he will be willing to cooperate with us rather than threaten vetoes. We need to work together on this. 
   I commend Secretary Richardson because from the time he has come in, he has tried to do the job of making reforms at the Department of Energy. But it will not do to say that he is the only one who has any ideas that could work here and for the Congress to but out, thank you. 
   The Congress has held numerous hearings, both in the House and the Senate. We have a lot of good ideas. Frankly, this management proposal, which has gone through a great deal of thought process about how to provide security at our National Laboratories, is going to be part of that reorganization. I know my colleagues and I look forward to working with the Secretary of Energy to make this work. 
   As I conclude, might I ask how much time we have remaining?

   Mr. KYL. Within 1 minute, I will close. I will come back with more discussion of the rationale for the specific changes we have made in here. 
   I close by saying this: The only way we are going to be able to guarantee security for the nuclear programs at our National Laboratories in the future is to have somebody with laser-like focus, full responsibility over those programs in the Department of Energy, responsible for nothing else, and nobody else in the Department responsible for these programs. This person should be able to report directly to the Secretary of Energy and to the President of the United States, which is what our amendment calls for. Finally, he should be able to work very closely with the Office of Counterintelligence established in the other part of this bill. 
   That is the essence of what this does. It detracts nothing from what Secretary Richardson is trying to do. As a matter of fact, it fits very nicely with what the Secretary is trying to do. I believe that, working together, we can provide security at our Nation's Laboratories and, therefore, security for the people of the United States.  
   I thank the Chair, and I yield to Senator DOMENICI from New Mexico.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I suggest that the example of the FBI and the Department of Energy not knowing that this waiver existed that Senator  MURKOWSKI spoke about is the perfect case of the right hand not knowing what the left hand was doing, and it is precisely what this amendment seeks to correct. There is an old debate technique called the ``red herring.'' 
   If you can't meet the real argument of your opponent, throw something out there that you can defeat and pretend like that is the issue. 
   Members of the Democratic side have said, why, there are all kinds of security provisions in this bill. How dare the Republicans suggest that we haven't done anything about security in the bill. 
   The security provisions in the bill were put there by Republicans. We know full well that we have security provisions in the bill. Virtually every one of them were put there by Republicans. And I am informed that in the Armed Services Committee, Democrats fought many of them. Now they come to the floor very proud of what is in the bill--not having sponsored them, having opposed some of them, but now contend that we have solved the problems, because the Republicans on the Armed Services Committee put some provisions in the bill, and because the Republican majority leader, Senator Lott, brought a whole series of things to the floor. Much of what was quoted by the Democrats came from the Lott amendment. In fact, Senator LEVIN even put into the RECORD a summary of the Lott amendment. 
   I am glad. These are all very good provisions. Republicans are serious about our national security. 
   But to suggest that what was done there is the end of it, now we can go home, is to quit way before this problem has been solved. 
   The Kyl-Domenici-Murkowski amendment is an amendment that seeks to get to the core of the problem. As Senator BINGAMAN said, two-thirds of the Armed Services Committee amendments were incorporated into our amendment. That is true. We did that for stylistic purposes. 
   What is the problem? It is the remaining one-third. They don't want to get to the core of the problem, which is the organization of the Department of Energy. 
   Here is what it boils down to: Who do you trust? Do you trust the Clinton administration with the national security of the United States saying: Trust us; we will do the reorganization down here at the Department of Energy. We are going to get this figured out. 
   Is that who you trust? 
   I don't think the American people can afford to continue to put their trust in an administration which has known about this problem since 1995, and only in 1999 did it begin to do anything about it because of public pressure. From the management review report of the Department of Energy itself, as recently as last month, it recognized that, ``significant problems exist in that the roles and responsibilities are unclear.'' 
   That is precisely what we are trying to fix--to get these roles and responsibilities straight. 
   Only a month before, a congressionally created administration said, ``The Assistant Secretary of Defense programs should be given direct line management over all aspects of the nuclear weapons complex.'' That is our amendment. 
   The GAO report--a whole list of reports, all highly critical of the management at the Department of Energy and the defense weapons complex. 
   I finally conclude with this point: The GAO testified that the continuing management problems at the Department ``were a key factor contributing to security problems at the laboratories and a major reason why DOE has been unable to develop long-term solutions to the recurring problems reported by advisory 
   groups.'' 
   Is that who you want to trust to clean this up and fix it up, and make sure that we don't have any more problems? I think not. I think it is time for Congress to get involved. 
   What is so amazing to me tonight is that the Democrat minority would hold up the defense authorization bill at a time when we are at war in Kosovo, because they don't even want to debate our amendment. They called a quorum call and wouldn't take it off so that Republican Members couldn't even come to the floor. Senator DOMENICI asked to be allowed to speak on our amendment. He is a coauthor. The minority refused him the opportunity even to speak. 
   So not only will they not allow us to vote on our amendment, but they won't even allow it to be debated. Yet their ostensible reasoning for opposing it is not because they don't think it has some good ideas in it but because we have to have a lot more discussion and debate about this; we haven't had hearings; we need to talk about this. 
   We have offered them the opportunity to talk about it, but they don't want to talk about it. They don't want to talk about it because it gets right to the guts of the problem--the Department of Energy has to be reformed. This amendment does that. 
   The national security of the United States cannot be protected until we do that. And the suggestion of the distinguished minority whip that now is not the time, on the eve of the Memorial Day recess, is astounding. What is more important, that Members get to go home for the Memorial Day recess, or that we act with alacrity to fix the problems of national security at our laboratories? 
   I am astonished that the Democratic minority would take this kind of cavalier approach to the national security of the United States--we need to talk about it more, but we are not going to let you talk about it. We need to get out of town for the recess. So withdraw your amendment. 
   Only because the Department of Defense needs the authorization bill are the authors of this amendment willing to withdraw it at this time. 
   There is a war in Kosovo. It is irresponsible for the minority to threaten to filibuster this bill until kingdom come while that war is going on, because they don't even want to talk about an amendment that would guarantee the security at our National Laboratories. 
   This is a sad day for those who are opposing this amendment. It is a sad day when Members of this Senate won't let their colleagues talk about this amendment, won't allow a vote on it, and can't wait to get out of town to brag about whatever it is that they have done, but without doing the unfinished business of protecting the security of our National Laboratories. 
   I retain the remainder of my time.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me just clarify about three things that were said by Members of the minority a moment ago. 
   Senator BINGAMAN said we should not be playing politics with national security. We could not agree more with that. He, then, began discussing how these problems have been around a long time, under Republican administrations as well as Democrat administrations. That is true. It is not political; it is true. Of course, that is what the Cox Commission report said, but that has nothing to do with whether we should begin to solve those problems now. 
   Once this administration became aware of the espionage in about 1995, it was important to begin the work of cleaning up the mess at the Department of Energy. What we are saying is if that is not going to be done by the administration, we are prepared to help do that with the amendment we have offered. 
   Second, Senator BINGAMAN indicated that Democrats did not object to the Republican security amendments in the Armed Services Committee, which were then included in the bill and which Members of the Democratic side have been talking about as a good thing in this bill. 
   I just asked staff to note a couple of the specifics to which there was objection. The minority, for example, objected to the requirement that DOE employees who have access to nuclear weapons data have a full background investigation. They watered it down by delaying implementation and also requiring an analysis of costs. They weakened the restrictions on the lab-to-lab program, section 3156 or 3158, I have forgotten. 
   There were more. Not to quibble, but the point is the security provisions in this bill were put there by the Members of the Republican side, by and large. The primary section that was discussed was the section put in by Senator LOTT, the majority leader. 
   But there is one more important piece of unfinished business and that is the Kyl-Domenici-Murkowski amendment, and that is what the Democrats will not let each of us talk about let alone debate about, except for the unanimous consent to close the debate here this evening. 
   Senator REID concluded by saying he did not improperly hold up the bill. He, in fact, used the rules of the Senate to protect the prerogatives of one Senator and his side. That is certainly true. He knows the rules. He used the rules. He was able to use the rules to prevent us from speaking, from debating our amendment, and from voting on it. The only way we could bring the defense authorization bill to a close and conclude this very important piece of business for the American people was for us to withdraw this important amendment. 
   I hope all of our colleagues and the American people understand what happened here. Because we could not discuss or vote on the Kyl-Domenici-Murkowski amendment, and because it was important to conclude the work on the defense authorization bill, we were required to withdraw our amendment. That important piece of unfinished business to protect the security of the National Laboratories, therefore, remains unfinished business and will have to be taken up in the future. 
   I do not know of a higher priority for the Senate at this time than trying to ensure the security of our National Laboratories and our most sophisticated weapons. This amendment would go a long way toward doing that. It is not the total answer. I am just hopeful in the days and weeks to come we will not hear the continuing wails that it is not time, we do not have time to discuss this, we should have lots of hearings about it. 
   We are prepared to have all kinds of discussions. We need to have those discussions. If we are not able to have those discussions in future times here, then the next time it will not be withdrawn and we will have to deal with it one way or the other. 
   I urge my colleagues to work together, try to resolve these important security issues for the safety and defense of the United States of America.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I just spoke with Senator KERREY. I know he will want to say something in response to Senator SMITH and what I will have to say. I will take my 5 minutes right now, with his indulgence. 
   I appreciate the spirit of his amendment. In fact, I just advised Senator KERREY I regretted very much having to speak in opposition to his amendment because I admire him as vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee on which I sit. We agree on a great many things. In fact, we are introducing legislation as cosponsors today on another matter. 
   But on this matter, I do differ with his approach because it to me reflects the approach to defense preparedness, to national security, that has been characterized, as Charles Krauthammer has said, as ``peace through paper'' rather than peace through strength, which Ronald Reagan made popular and which we think helped to win the cold war--the notion, in other words, that treaties should define what the United States of America does to provide for its defense rather than the United States deciding what it must do to provide for its defense and then seek through treaties to limit what other countries might do and what we might do in the future as a part of that but following what our initial determination is with respect to necessities for our national security. 
   This is true with respect to the START I and START II levels of nuclear weaponry, our strategic deterrents. The START I levels are where we are right now, and historically the administration and the Congress have taken the view that we need to maintain our START I levels as long as that is the prevailing status of treaties, and that is precisely where we are today.

   Mr. KYL. Again, I fully respect the vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee and what he is attempting to accomplish. It is my view you first build your defense structure, and you stick with it until you see signs that the potential adversary has reduced his force structure in a competent way. Until you do that, you are better off keeping what you have in place rather than unilaterally giving it away.

   Mr. KYL. 
   Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues, Senators BOB KERREY, DON NICKLES, JOHN BREAUX, SCONNIE MACK, CHUCK ROBB, and PHIL GRAMM to introduce a bill that attempts to forge bipartisan consensus with regard to the future of the federal estate tax. The legislation we are offering today is titled the Estate Tax Elimination Act of 1999. 
   Mr. President, we know that many Americans are troubled by the estate tax's complexity and high rates, and by the mere fact that it is triggered by a person's death rather than the realization of income. For a long time, I have advocated its repeal, because I believe death should not be a taxable event. 
   Other people agree that the tax is problematic, but are concerned the appreciated value of certain assets might escape taxation forever if the estate tax is repealed while the step-up in basis allowed under Section 1014 of the Internal Revenue Code remains in effect. 
   The legislation we are introducing today attempts to reconcile these positions by eliminating both the estate tax and the step-up, and attributing a carryover basis to inherited property so that all gains are taxed at the time the property is sold and income is realized. This is an explicit trade-off: estate-tax repeal for implementation of a carryover basis. Both must occur, or this plan will not work. 
   The concept of a carryover basis is not new. It exists in current law with respect to gifts, Section 1015 of the Internal Revenue Code, and property transferred in cases of divorce, Section 1041, and in connection with involuntary conversions of property relating to theft, destruction, seizure, requisition, or condemnation. 
   In the latter case, when an owner receives compensation for involuntarily converted property, a taxable gain normally results to the extent that the value of the compensation exceeds the basis of the converted property. However, Section 1033 of the Internal Revenue Code allows the taxpayer to defer the recognition of the gain until the property is sold. The Kyl-Kerrey bill would treat the transfer of property at death--perhaps the most involuntary conversion of all--the same way, deferring recognition of any gain until the inherited property is sold. 
   Our bill would also establish a limited capital-gains exclusion for inherited property to ensure that small estates, which are currently exempt from tax by virtue of the unified credit and the step-up in basis, do not find themselves with a new tax liability when the proposed law takes effect. 
   Mr. President, I have asked the Joint Tax Committee to review the proposal and provide an official revenue estimate. We are awaiting the results of that review now. 
   I hope the members of the Finance Committee will take a serious and careful look at this bipartisan proposal. With it, we ought to be able to finally eliminate the estate tax--and do it this year.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I say to my colleagues that, as Senator LEVIN just pointed out, this is a totally unnecessary amendment, because the administration has already expressed a view that it has not gone beyond the Concepts this Senate voted for 90 to 9 when the new states were added to NATO. Those are the Strategic Concepts. 
   One might argue whether or not they are being applied correctly in the case of the war in Kosovo. That is another debate. But in terms of the Strategic Concepts themselves, this body voted on them, and I would hate for this body now to suggest to the other 18 countries in NATO that perhaps they should resubmit the Strategic Concepts to their legislative bodies as in the nature of a treaty so that the entire NATO agreement on Strategic Concepts would be subject to 19 separate votes of our parliamentary bodies. I don't think that would be a good idea given the fact that, as Senator LEVIN already noted, the President has already said the Strategic Concepts do not go beyond what the Senate voted for 90 to 9. 
   This an unnecessary amendment. I suggest my colleagues vote no.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the U.S. Forest Service is interested in exchanging or selling six unmanageable, undesirable and/or excess parcels of land in the Prescott, Tonto, Kaibab and Coconino National Forests. In addition, the Forest Service has agreed to sell land to the City of Sedona for use as an effluent disposal system. If the parcels are sold, the Forest Service wants to use the proceeds from five of these sales to either fund new construction or upgrade current administrative facilities at these national forests. Funds generated from the sale of the other parcels could be used to fund acquisition of sites, or construction of administrative facilities at any national forest in Arizona. Transfers of land completed under this bill will be done in accordance with all other applicable laws, including environmental laws. 
   Mr. President, this bill will enhance customer and administrative services by allowing the Forest Service to consolidate and update facilities and/or relocate facilities to more convenient locations. It offers a simple and common-sense way to enhance services for national forest users in Arizona, and to facilitate the disposal of unmanageable, undesirable and/or excess parcels of national forest lands. This bill will also facilitate the construction of a much needed wastewater treatment plant for the City of Sedona.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise for the purpose of entering into a colloquy with the Senator from Wisconsin, Senator KOHL, regarding his Safe Handgun Storage and Child Handgun Safety Amendment (#352) to S. 254, the juvenile crime bill. 
   The amendment makes it unlawful for any licensed manufacturer, importer or dealer to sell, deliver or transfer any handgun to any person (other than under certain exceptions) unless the transferee is provided with a secure gun storage or safety device. I am interested in clarifying the intent of the amendment with regard to gun safety devices. 
   Senator KOHL, as you know, a company in my home state of Arizona has developed a handgun safety device called Saf-T-Hammer. It is a removable hammer which can be incorporated into new guns or retrofit most handguns now in circulation. When the top of the hammer is removed, the gun cannot be fired. Parents can take off the hammerhead and carry it with them when they leave home, secure in the knowledge that no unauthorized user--including children--will be able to fire the gun. 
   Because Saf-T-Hammer is a removable safety device, is it your intent, Senator KOHL, that Saf-T-Hammer would still qualify as a gun safety device for purposes of your amendment?

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, it is an honor for me this morning to have in the Senate Chamber both of my ministers--of course, the Chaplain of the Senate, Lloyd Ogilvie, and the individual who gave our prayer this morning, who is Thomas Erickson, minister of the Valley Presbyterian Church in Scottsdale, AZ. This is the church in which I am a member in my home State of Arizona. His wife Carol joins him today in the Nation's Capital, and as I said, it is my honor to be with them today and certainly an honor for my church to have its minister deliver the opening of the Senate. 
   Valley Presbyterian Church is a dynamic congregation of some 2,400 members and growing. Reverend Erickson has been with the church now for almost 13 years. 
   Mr. President, you perhaps noticed that as he was delivering the morning prayer, if you closed your eyes just a little bit, it almost sounded like our Chaplain, Lloyd Ogilvie. I frequently do that when I am in church here or I am in the Senate Chamber. I close my eyes and I can almost hear the other speaking, because they have the same resonant voice, especially when delivering a prayer. 
   So I am honored, as I said, to be able to present Dr. Erickson to my fellow Senators this morning and all of those who observed the morning prayer on television. 
   I thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON to introduce the Border Patrol Recruitment and Retention Act of 1999. 
   In 1996, the Congress passed unanimously, and the President signed, my amendment to the Immigration Reform Act requiring that 1,000 Border Patrol agents be hired each year between the years 1997 and 20001. Last year, Congress provided the Immigration and Naturalization Service with $93 million to hire, train, and deploy 1,000 agents during 1999. 
   We have now learned that the INS will not come close to hiring the required 1,000 agents during this year; and, in fact, may only hire 200 to 400. As a result, states that need the increased personnel the most will not receive them. Arizona, which itself was slated to receive 400 new agents, will now receive only 100 to 150 new agents. That's not nearly enough. Border Patrol agents in the Tucson sector apprehended 60,537 illegal immigrants last month and seized over 28,000 pounds of marijuana, an all-time record in both areas. Project that annually and then factor in the estimate that 3 times as many illegal aliens successfully cross the border than are apprehended. The situation is so out of control in Arizona that recently, 600 people attempted to cross the border en masse in broad daylight. Some Arizonans are growing so anxious about the upsurge of illegal activity in their community that they have attempted to take matters into their own hands. Unless Arizona is given more federal personnel and resources to get things under control, many are worried about how this situation will develop. 
   What the INS says is that it is having recruitment and retention problems, and so it cannot take on the added personnel at this time. Couldn't the INS foresee some of these recruitment issues more than two months before now? And couldn't INS do something to correct the problem of recruitment? 
   We concluded Congress would have to initiate some solutions. Therefore, Senator HUTCHISON and I introduce this bill today to try to begin to address some of the Border Patrol's recruitment and retention problems. It is not a panacea, and we need to continue to explore additional ways of improving recruitment and retention; but it will open the debate and will provide for a much-needed increase in salary levels for the Border Patrol. 
   Currently Border Patrol agents are, for the most part, capped at a GS-9 level (currently, only about 20 percent of agents, namely those who perform special duties, are raised to the GS-11 level). The Border Patrol Retention and Recruitment Enhancement Act would allow all agents with a successful year's experience at a GS-9 level to move up to a GS-11 level. This would enable agents to move from an approximate $34,000 annually salary to an approximate $41,000 annually salary. And that's fair. These agents have a tough time in their assignments. They must speak two languages. They deserve a raise. 
   The bill would also establish the Office of Border Patrol Recruitment and Retention, which would allow the Border Patrol to be more involved in recruiting and hiring and will direct the Border Patrol to make policy suggestions about ways to improve recruitment and retention. Currently, the INS and the Office of Personnel Management are responsible for all such activity. We have heard testimony from Border Patrol chiefs who say that the Border Patrol has unique and specific knowledge about how to enhance these efforts. 
   Mr. President, this bill will not solve all of the Border Patrol's recruiting and retention problems, but it will be a responsible start toward increasing the numbers of agents who will so honorably protect our nation's borders. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
   Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, today, the Senate begins consideration of a budget for the fiscal year that begins on October 1. When it passes, it will be only the second budget in the last 30 years that will be balanced. 
   That will be a tremendous achievement considering that it was as recently as 1995 that President Clinton sent Congress a budget that would have produced annual deficits in the range of $200 billion for the foreseeable future. The budget recommended to us by the Budget Committee will effectively balance the budget, and it will do so even without relying on the surplus from the Social Security trust fund. The small deficit that is projected now is likely to be eliminated once the Congressional Budget Office updates its revenue estimates this summer. 
   Mr. President, the budget we have before us will ensure that the Social Security surplus is set aside so that it cannot be spent on other government programs--$1.8 trillion over the next 10 years. Many of us may have heard President Clinton promise to do the same, but when he sent his budget to Capitol Hill we found that he is actually proposing to raid the Social Security trust fund for $158 billion over the next five years alone. Moreover, we found that the President's plan to deposit 62 percent of the unified budget surplus into the trust fund was nothing more than an accounting gimmick. According to the Comptroller General, David Walker, ``the changes to the Social Security program [recommended by the President] will thus be more perceived than real: although the Trust Funds will appear to have more resources as a result of the proposal, in reality nothing about the program has changed.'' In other words, the Clinton plan fails to delay the cash-flow problem expected in the year 2013 by a single year. 
   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan also voiced opposition to the President's risky plan to invest a portion of the Social Security Trust Funds in the stock market, noting that ``even with Herculean efforts,'' he doubted that investment decisions could be insulated from political pressures. The Clinton plan would allow federal bureaucrats to play politics with people's retirement savings. That is wrong. 
   By contrast, our budget will not put Social Security at risk. It will protect the Social Security surpluses so that they cannot be raided for the President's other spending initiatives. 
   Our budget will help preserve Medicare, as well. It will increase spending on the nation's health care program for seniors by an average of $20 billion a year for the next 10 years. That is in lieu of the $9 billion reduction in Medicare spending that the President's budget recommends. 
   Mr. President, we will cut the public debt in half over the next decade by abiding by the spending limits Congress and the President agreed to two years ago. The Clinton budget, by contrast, would bust the spending limits by more than $20 billion this year alone and result in only half as much debt reduction over the next decade. 
   Most importantly, the Senate budget proposes to return the rest of the emerging surpluses to taxpayers. Congress would still have to pass a separate bill later in the year that sets out precisely what form the tax relief would take, but there are many ideas. They range from a 10 percent across-the-board reduction in income-tax rates to more targeted relief, like repeal of the marriage penalty, elimination of death taxes, and reductions in capital-gains taxes. There are other ideas, too. Any of them is preferable to President Clinton's plan to raise $100 billion in new taxes and fees even though budget surpluses are mounting. 
   Although we have succeeded in balancing the unified budget, we still have two very different visions of where we should be headed. The President has proposed myriad new spending programs--77 new programs in his State of the Union address--paid for out of the Social Security surplus, Medicare, and new taxes and fees. The Senate budget protects Social Security and Medicare, and abiding by the spending limits approved just two years ago, we begin to pay down the debt and provide long overdue tax relief to the American people. 
   I believe the Senate's approach is a better one. I hope my colleagues will join me in voting aye. 
   Several Senators addressed the Chair.

    Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Federal Prisoner Health Care Copayment Act, which would require federal prisoners to pay a nominal fee when they initiate certain visits for medical attention. Fees collected from prisoners subject to an order of restitution shall be paid to victims in accordance with the order. Seventy-five percent of all other fees would be deposited in the Federal Crime Victims' Fund and the remainder would go to the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) and the U.S. Marshals Service for administrative expenses incurred in carrying out this Act. 
   Each time a prisoner pays to heal himself, he will be paying to heal a victim. 
   Most working, law-abiding Americans are required to pay a copayment fee when they seek medical attention. It is time to impose this requirement on federal prisoners. 
   The Department of Justice supports the Federal inmate user fee concept, and worked with us on crafting the language contained in this Act. 
   To date, well over half of the states--including our home states of Arizona and South Dakota--have implemented state-wide prisoner health care copayment programs. Additionally, the following states have enacted this reform: Alabama, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. Additional states are considering implementing copayment programs. 
   Copayment programs have an outstanding record of success on the state level. 
   Tennessee, which began requiring $3 copayments in January 1996, reported in late 1997 that the number of infirmary visits per inmate had been cut almost in half. In August 1998, prison officials in Ohio evaluated the nascent state copayment law, finding that the number of prisoners seeing a doctor has dropped 55 percent and that between March and August the copayment fee generated $89,500. In Arizona, there has been a reduction of about 30 percent in the number of requests for health care services. 
   Copayment programs reduce the overutilization of health care services without denying necessary care to the indigent. By discouraging the overuse of health care, the Prisoner Health Care Copayment Act should (1) help prisoners in true need of attention to receive better care, (2) benefit taxpayers through a reduction in the expense of operating a prison health care system, and (3) reduce the burden on corrections officers to escort prisoners feigning illness to health care facilities is reduced. 
   The Act prohibits the refusal of treatment for financial reasons or for appropriate preventive care. 
   Congress should follow the lead of the states and provide the federal Bureau of Prisons with the authority to charge federal inmates a nominal fee for elective health care visits. The federal system is particularly ripe for reform. According to the 1996 Corrections Yearbook, the system spends more per inmate on health care than virtually every state. Federal inmate health care totaled $354 million in fiscal year 1998, up from $138 million in fiscal year 1990. Average cost per inmate has increased over 36 percent during this period, from $2,483 to $3,363. 
   Before I conclude, I would like to thank my colleague Senator JOHNSON for his support and assistance with this legislation. Additionally, I appreciate the assistance of the Arizona Department of Corrections, and the office staff of Sheriff Buchanan in helping me draft this reform. 
   I look forward to continuing to work with the Department of Justice, the Bureau of Prisons, and colleagues on both sides of the aisle, to implement a fee-for-medical-service-program--a sensible and overdue reform--for federal prisoners.

   Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   Mr. President, first of all, let me declare that this is not a vote to support or not to support the troops. This is an authorization to the President to use military force against Serbia. 
   If this were an appropriations bill to support a mission already underway, a mission which the President had ordered American troops to engage in, there is no question that I assume all of us would have to support that and  would not vote against an appropriation of funds--at least I would not vote against an appropriation of funds--to support the troops. That is not what is involved here. This is an authorization for the President. 
   Second, this is a vote to tell the President two things, I believe: No. 1, before you send American troops in harm's way, you need to have a dialog with the Congress and with the American people to explain two things. 
   No. 1, you need to explain why there is a direct threat to the national security of the United States. And there isn't in this case. And, No. 2, you need to explain how your plan is going to achieve the goals. 
   There are two goals there: to repeal an attack by Serbia against Kosovo and to force the Serbs to enter into a peace agreement. 
   The particular kind of military campaign planned here cannot achieve either goal, in my opinion. The quasi-police forces going into Kosovo are not easily stopped or impeded in their progress by cruise missiles. And, second, I suggest that the kind of plan here of a 48-hour, or similar hour, campaign with cruise missiles against Milosevic is not going to force him to his knees to invite peacekeepers into Kosovo. My guess is that he will, in fact, rebel against it rather than succumb to it. 
   For both of those reasons, I will vote ``no'' on the resolution.

    Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act. 
   From the beginning of time, societies have sought to prohibit most forms of gambling. There are reasons for this--and they are especially applicable to gambling on the Internet today. Consider the following. 
   Youth. A recent New York Times article warned that ``Internet sports betting entices youthful gamblers into potentially costly losses.'' In the same  article, Kevin O'Neill, deputy director of the Council on Compulsive Gambling of New Jersey, said that ``Internet sports gambling appeals to college-age people who don't have immediate access to a neighborhood bookie. ..... It's on the Net and kids think it's credible, which is scary.'' 
   Listen to the testimony of Jeff Pash, the Executive Vice President of the National Football League, before the Senate Judiciary Committee: ``Studies ..... indicate that sports betting is a growing problem for high school and college students. ..... As the Internet reaches more and more school children, Internet gambling is certain to promote even more gambling among young people.'' 
   Families. Gambling often has terrible consequences for families and communities. According to the Council on Compulsive Gambling, five percent of all gamblers become addicted. Many of those turn to crime and commit suicide. We all pay for those tragedies. 
   Harm to Businesses and the Economy. Internet gambling is likely to have a deleterious effect on businesses and the economy. As Ted Koppel noted in a ``Nightline'' feature on Internet gambling, ``[l]ast year, 1,333,000 American consumers filed for bankruptcy, thereby eliminating about $40 billion in personal debt. That's of some relevance to all of us because the $40 billion debt doesn't just disappear. It's redistributed among the rest of us in the form of increased prices on consumer goods. .....'' He continued: ``If anything promises to increase the level of personal debt in this country, expanding access to gambling should do it.'' 
   Professor John Kindt testified before the House Small Business Committee that a business with 1,000 workers can anticipate increased personnel costs of $500,000 a year due to job absenteeism and declining productivity simply by having various forms of legalized gambling accessible. 
   Addiction. Internet gambling enhances the addictive nature of gambling because it is so easy to do: you don't have to travel; you can just log on to your computer. Professor Kindt has described electronic gambling, like the type being offered in the ``virtual casinos'' on the Internet, as the ``hard-core cocaine of gambling.'' 
   As Bernie Horn, the Executive Director of the National Coalition Against Legalized Gaming, testified before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime: ``The Internet not only makes highly addictive forms of gambling easily accessible to everyone, it magnifies the potential destructiveness of the addiction. Because of the privacy of an individual and his/her computer terminal, addicts can destroy themselves without anyone ever having the chance to stop them. 
   Unfair payouts. As Wisconsin Attorney General James Doyle testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, ``[b]ecause [Internet gambling] is unregulated, consumers don't know who is on the other end of the connection. The odds can be easily manipulated and there is no guarantee that fair payouts will occur.'' ``Anyone who gambles over the Internet is making a sucker bet,'' says William A. Bible, the chair of an Internet gambling subcommittee on the National Gambling Impact Study Commission. 
   Crime. Further, gambling on the Internet is apt to lead to criminal behavior. Indeed, ``Up to 90 percent of pathological gamblers commit crimes to pay off their wagering debts.'' A University of Illinois study found that for every dollar that states gain from gambling, they pay out three dollars in social and criminal costs. 
   Cost. According to an article in the March 1999 ABA Journal, ``Online wagering is generating a $600-million-a-year kitty that some analysts say could reach as high as $100 billion a year by 2006.'' I want to repeat that: ``$100 BILLION a year.'' The article continues: ``The number of Web sites offering Internet gambling is growing at a similar rate. In just one year, that number more than quadrupled, going from about 60 in late 1997 to now more than 260 according to some estimates.'' And a recent HBO in-depth report by Jim Lampley noted that virtual sports books will collect more money from the Super Bowl than all the sports books in Las Vegas combined. 
   This affects all of us. 
   Not every problem that is national is also necessarily federal. Internet gambling is a national problem AND a federal problem. The Internet is, of course, interstate in nature. States cannot protect their citizens from Internet gambling if anyone can transmit it into their states. That is why the State Attorneys General asked for federal legislation to prohibit Internet gambling. In a letter to the Judiciary Committee members, the Chairs of the Association's Internet Working Group stressed the need for federal involvement: ``[M]ore than any other area of the law, gambling has traditionally been regulated on a state-by-state basis, with little uniformity and minimal federal oversight. The availability of gambling on the Internet, however, threatens to disrupt each state's careful balancing of its own public welfare and fiscal concerns, by making gambling available across state and national boundaries, with little or no regulatory control.'' 
   Further, in reaffirming his support for the bill, the former President of NAAG, Wisconsin Attorney General Jim Doyle, wrote: ``Internet gambling poses a major challenge for state and local law enforcement officials. I strongly support Senator Kyl's Internet Gambling Prohibition Act. Prohibiting this form of unregulated gambling will protect consumers from fraud and preserve state policies on gambling that have been established by our citizens and our legislators.'' 
   In 1961, Congress passed the Wire Act to prohibit using telephone facilities to receive bets or send gambling information. [18 U.S.C. &#167;1084.] In addition to penalties imposed upon gambling businesses that violate the law, the Wire Act gives local and state law enforcement authorities the power to direct telecommunication providers to discontinue service to proprietors of gambling services who use the wires to conduct illegal gambling activity. But, as pointed out in the March 1999 ABA Journal, ``The problem with current federal law is that the communications technology it specifies is dated and limited.'' The advent of the Internet, a communications medium not envisioned by the Wire Act, requires enactment of a new law to address activities in cyberspace not contemplated by the drafters of the older law. 
   The Internet Gambling Prohibition Act ensures that the law keeps pace with technology. The bill bans gambling on the Internet, just as the Wire Act prohibited gambling over the wires. And it does not limit the subject of gambling to sports. The bill is similar to the one that the Senate, by an overwhelming 90-10 vote, attached to the Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations bill last year. Let me take a moment to explain the bill. 
   The bill covers sports gambling and casino games. Businesses that offer gambling over the Internet can be fined in an amount equal to the amount that the business received in bets via the Internet or $20,000, whichever is greater, and/or imprisoned for not more than four years. To address concerns raised by the Department of Justice, the bill (like the Wire Act) does not contain penalties for individual bettors. Such betting will, of course, still be the subject of state law. 
   The bill contains a strong enforcement mechanism. At the request of the United States or a State, a district court may enter a temporary restraining order or an injunction against any person to prevent a violation of the bill, following due notice and based on a finding of substantial probability that there has been a violation of the law. In effect, the illegal website will have its service cut off. I have worked with the Internet service providers to address concerns they raised about how they would cut off service, and, as a result, the provisions dealing with the civil remedies have been revised along the lines of the WIPO legislation. 
   In sum, the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act brings federal law up to date. With the advent of new, sophisticated technology, the Wire Act is becoming outdated. The Internet Gambling Prohibition Act corrects that problem. 
   I would like to take a moment to review the consideration of the bill during the last Congress. In July 1997, the Judiciary Subcommittee on Technology held a hearing on S. 474. A wide variety of people testified in support of the legislation: Senator RICHARD BRYAN; Wisconsin Attorney General Jim Doyle, the then-President of the  National Association of Attorneys General; Jeff Pash, Counsel to the National Football League; Ann Geer, Chair of the National Coalition Against Gambling Expansion; and Anthony Cabot, professor at the International Gaming Institute. 
   Ann Geer stated that ``Internet gambling would multiply addiction exponentially, increasing access and magnifying the potential destructiveness of the addiction. Addicts would literally click their mouse and bet the house.'' 
   As I noted earlier, Wisconsin Attorney General James Doyle testified that ``gambling on the Internet is a very dumb bet. Because it is unregulated ..... odds can be easily manipulated and there is no guarantee that fair payouts will occur. ..... Internet gambling threatens to disrupt the system. It crosses state and national borders with little or no regulatory control. Federal authorities must take the lead in this area.'' 
   Additionally, in June, the Judiciary Committee held a hearing on FBI oversight at which I said to FBI Director Louis Freeh: ``the testimony from other Department of Justice and FBI witnesses has supported our legislation to conform the crime of gambling on the Internet to existing law. And I would just like a reconfirmation of the FBI's support for that legislation.'' Director Freeh replied ``yes, I think it's a very effective change. We certainly support it.'' 
   The Judiciary Subcommittee on Technology passed S. 474 by a unanimous poll and sent the bill to the full Committee for consideration. The Judiciary Committee passed S. 474 by voice vote. 
   In July 1998, by a 90 to 10 vote, the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act was attached to the Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations bill. In the House, the bill passed Representative MCCOLLUM's Crime Subcommittee unanimously, but due to the lateness of the session, the bill failed to move farther in the House and was not included in the final CJS bill. 
   The bill has broad bipartisan support in Congress and the strong support of law enforcement. As I just mentioned, FBI Director Freeh has testified that the bill makes a ``very effective change'' to the law and the National Association of Attorneys General sent a letter supporting S. 474 to all Senators. 
   Further, the President of NAAG, Wisconsin Attorney General Jim Doyle, wrote a letter expressing his support of the bill: ``Internet gambling poses a major challenge for state and local law enforcement officials. I strongly support Senator KYL's Internet Gambling Prohibition Act. Prohibiting this form of unregulated gambling will protect consumers from fraud and preserve state policies on gambling that have been established by our citizens and our legislators.'' 
   Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth also wrote a letter stressing the support of the states for this bill: ``The adoption of a resolution on this issue by NAAG represents overwhelming support from the states for a bill which, in essence, increases the federal presence in an area of primary state concern. However, it is clear that the federal government has an important role in this issue which crosses state as well as international boundaries.'' 
   In the 105th Congress, S. 474 was strongly supported by professional and amateur sports. The National Football League, the National Collegiate Athletic Association, the National Hockey League, the National Basketball Association, Major League Soccer, and Major League Baseball sent a joint letter of support to all Senators. 
   I would like to read a passage from this letter:  
   Despite exiting federal and state laws prohibiting gambling on professional and college sports, sports gambling over the Internet has become a serious--and growing--national problem. Many Internet gambling operations originate from offshore locations outside the U.S. The number of offshore Internet gambling websites has grown from two in 1996 to over 70 today. It is estimated that Inernet sites will book over $600 million in sports bets in 1998, up from $60 million just two years ago. These websites not only permit offshore gambling operations to solicit and take bets from the United States in defiance of federal and state law but also enable gamblers and would-be gamblers in the U.S. to place illegal sports wagers over the Internet from the privacy of their own home or office.  
   The letter concludes: ``We strongly urge you to vote in favor of S. 474 when it is considered on the Senate floor.'' 
   On behalf of the NCAA, Bill Saum testified in February before the National Gambling Impact Study Commission on the dangers of Internet gambling:  
   Internet gambling provides college students with the opportunity to place wagers on professional and college sporting events from the privacy of his or her campus residence. Internet gambling offers the student virtual anonymity. With nothing more than a credit card, the possibility exists for any student-athlete to place a wager via the Intenet and then attempt to influence the outcome of the contest while participating on the court or the playing field. There is no question the advent of Internet sports gambling poses a direct threat to all sports organizations that, first and foremost, must ensure the integrity of each contest played.  
   Today, in the Judiciary Subcommittee on Technology, I chaired a hearing on Internet gambling. The testimony in today's hearing confirmed that Internet gambling is addictive, accessible to minors, subject to fraud and other criminal use, and evasive of state gambling laws. State Attorneys General from Wisconsin and Ohio asked for federal legislation to address the mushrooming problem of online gambling, and representatives of the National Football League and the National Collegiate Athletic Association expressed their concerns over the effect of Internet gambling on athletes, fans, and the integrity of sporting contests. 
   Mr. President, I would like to thank Senator BRYAN for his hard work on this bill. His support and assistance have been invaluable. I would also like to extend a special thanks to the NFL, NCAA, and the National Association of Attorneys General. 
   The Internet offers fantastic opportunities. Unfortunately, some would exploit those opportunities to commit crimes and take advantage of others. Indeed, as Professor Kindt stated on ``Nightline,'' ``Once you go to Internet gambling, you've maximized the speed you've maximized the acceptability and the accessibility. It's going to be in-your-face gambling, which is going to have severe detrimental effects to society. ..... it's the crack cocaine of creating new pathological gamblers.'' 
   Internet gambling is a serious problem. Society has always prohibited most forms of gambling because it can have a devastating effect on people and families, and it often leads to crime and other corruption. The Internet Gambling Prohibition Act will curb the spread of online gambling.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KYL. Madam President, I rise in support of S. 257, the National Missile Defense Act of 1999. This straight-forward bill states that due to the increasing ballistic missile threat we face, ``It is the policy of the United States to deploy as soon as is technologically possible an effective National Missile Defense system capable of defending the territory of the United States against limited ballistic missile attack (whether accidental, unauthorized, or deliberate).'' This bill is essentially identical to last year's measure which was filibustered by the minority and failed to gain cloture by a single vote. I would ask those who opposed the bill last year to consider the events over the intervening period which reinforce the arguments in favor of national missile defense: 
   First, North Korea launched a three-stage missile last August that overflew Japan in an attempt to orbit a satellite. This missile, the Taepo Dong 1, has sufficient range to reach Alaska and Hawaii as demonstrated by the fact that its debris landed 4000 miles out in the Pacific. The range and the presence of a third stage was a surprise to the Intelligence Community, according to unclassified statements by Robert Walpole, National Intelligence Officer for Strategic and Nuclear Programs. Furthermore, successor missile, the Taepo Dong 2 is expected to be able to reach all of the American mainland and may be ready for testing this year. As the Chairman of the CIA's National Intelligence Council noted last October, ``An ICBM threat from North Korea is looming.'' 
   Second, Iran tested a medium range missile last July that is capable of reaching Israel and U.S. forces throughout the Middle East. This missile, the Shahab-3, may already be in production and Iran, with Russian assistance, is developing a longer-range missile capable of reaching Central Europe. Russian missile assistance to Iran has continued despite intensive U.S. efforts to halt this deadly trade. As CIA Director Tenet noted in testimony last month to the Armed Services Committee, ``Especially during the last six months, expertise and materiel from Russia has continued to assist the Iranian missile effort in areas ranging from training, to testing, to components.'' General Zinni, our CENTCOM commander has stated that Iran may have nuclear weapons within five years. Iran has been typically bloody-minded in its propaganda. During a military parade in Tehran last year, slogans were written on sides of missiles that read ``Israel should be wiped off the map'' and ``the USA can do nothing''. Moreover, last year's hopeful signs that Iranian moderates were gaining ascendancy now look much less clear. 
   Third, Iraq has achieved its long-sought goal of escaping from UNSCOM inspections. Chief UN arms inspector Butler has stated that Iraq has resumed its weapons programs. There is now no inspection regime in place, the UN embargo is under mounting attack including by erstwhile allies, potential suppliers are eager to be of assistance, and Iraq retains a significant missile production and support infrastructure upon which to build. UN inspectors had uncovered drawings of multi-stage missiles and they are within a decade of an intercontinental missile capability. 
   Fourth, China continues measured but steady improvement in its existing force of ICBMs which are already capable of hitting American cities. China's ICBMs have benefitted from both the outright theft and the unwisely permitted transfers of American space launch vehicle technology. Recently there have been disturbing published reports that China stole the design of the nuclear warhead of our Trident missile. This sophisticated multiple independently-targeted reentry vehicle or MIRV design has the capability to be a real force multiplier. Moreover, the technology that China obtains from the United States may not remain there. According to a Washington Times report on February 23, China has assisted North Korea's missile and space technology. China has also developed a habit of using ballistic missiles to intimidate its neighbors. On the eve of Taiwan's first democratic elections in 1996, China launched M-9 missiles to areas within 30 miles of Taiwan's two primary ports. A report just released by the Defense Department states that China is engaged in an intense buildup of ballistic and cruise missiles opposite Taiwan. Easy assumptions that the U.S. can enjoy a constructive relationship with China may be rooted in hope rather than reality. Beijing's recent crackdown on the fledgling Democracy Party serves as a reminder that China remains an authoritarian and potentially hostile regime with a highly uncertain future. 
   Finally, the condition of Russia is cause for serious concern. Russia retains over 6000 strategic nuclear warheads and is still conducting limited modernization even as their strategic forces experience overall decay. While a return to cold war confrontation is unlikely today, the prospects for Russia's successful transition to democracy remain unclear. Their economic meltdown last summer further aggravated problems of nuclear weapons security, and command and 
   control. The competence and morale and, hence, the safety of their nuclear forces are increasingly in question. 
   The timeliness of the warnings of the bipartisan Rumsfeld Commission Report last summer have been more than borne out by these events. The North Korean and Iranian missile tests followed within weeks of that report. You will recall that the Rumsfeld Commission offered three major conclusions. (1) The missile threat to the United States is real and growing. (2) The threat is greater than previously assessed and a rogue nation could acquire the capability to threaten the U.S. with an ICBM within as little as five years. And (3) we may have little or no warning of the emergence of new threats. How prescient these conclusions were. How quickly they were borne out by subsequent events. 
   Madam President, the administration is to be commended for its recognition that a missile threat to the United States exists. On January 20, Secretary of Defense Cohen stated that ``the United States will, in fact, face a rogue nation threat to our homeland against which we will have to defend the American people'' and that ``technological readiness will be the sole remaining criteria'' in deciding when to deploy a national missile defense system. But subsequent statements by administration spokesman have hedged on this forthright statement and suggested that other considerations may affect our deployment decision. For example, Secretary of State Albright has suggested that any deployment was conditional on the actual emergence of a threat and on the successful renegotiation of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. 
   I've just outlined the threat and, in particular, the recent events which demonstrate that it is closer than many believed. There may well be rogue nations with the capability to reach American shores with weapons of mass destruction before we can deploy even a limited missile shield under the administration's most optimistic scenarios of successful tests and timely decisions. And even after Secretary Cohen's announcement, there has been slippage in a key program, namely the Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS) satellites for missile detection and tracking. I joined several others Senators in expressing my concern at this unfortunate decision by the Air Force to delay development of this vial component of any missile defense architecture. If left unchanged, this decision will delay the deployment of any NMD  system until 2006 when the first SBIRS-low satellites are launched. The bottom line is that the threat is developing more rapidly than our response to it. We cannot afford additional delays while our potential adversaries develop and deploy increasingly capable missiles. 
   Second, Secretary Albright and other administration officials have spoken of the need to revise the ABM Treaty to accommodate deployment of a national missile defense. Mr. President, the ABM Treaty is an anachronism. It is the last relic of the cold war. Whatever its merit then, it has none now. In fact, some legal scholars believe the ABM Treaty is no longer binding on the United States since one of the original parties to the Treaty has ceased to exist. Renegotiation of the ABM Treaty is likely to prove a long and fruitless undertaking. Russia will not doubt hold out the prospect of START II ratification as they have done for six years now. The United States has purchased START II ratification several times over and we should not do so again. The economic situation in Russia today renders it unlikely that a START II level, let alone a START I level, of weapons is sustainable. To hold hostage the defense of the United States for the constantly receding mirage of START II would be strategic folly. Russia is not the target of American national missile defense except in so far as we seek the capability to defend against accidental or unauthorized launch. We can and should continue cooperative efforts with Russia, but they should not exercise a veto over our decision to defend ourselves against an Iran or a North Korea. 
   Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have advanced arms control arguments in opposition to missile defense. I suggest that American deployment of national missile defense will actually be a profoundly stabilizing step. If we have the prospect of defending our country from attack by weapons of mass destruction, we are less likely to have to resort to nuclear retaliation. Further, our deployment of a national missile defense will reduce the incentive for nuclear and missile proliferation by our prospective adversaries. It will reduce the ability of a North Korea to successfully blackmail us and our allies with its nuclear and missile programs. 
   The bill before the Senate does not, however, address the ABM Treaty. The bill does not say what kind of architecture the missile defense system should have. It does not say where such a system should be located, or more generally, whether it should be based on land, at sea, or in space. It does not specify a date by which such a system should be deployed. It simply states a national goal, a goal on which bipartisan agreement should be possible. I am surprised and 
   disappointed that the administration has chosen to oppose this bill, the purpose of which seems identical to the policy announced by the Secretary of Defense in January. I would have hoped that we could agree on the goal and turn our attention to the means to achieve it. 
   There is an important debate that has only just begun as to the best means of providing a national missile defense. For example, one option that I don't think has received enough attention is a sea-based missile defense. While the best defense is obviously an integrated land, sea, and space combination, I think it is becoming more and more clear that sea-based systems offer our best near term solution to both theater and national missile defense needs. This is because of their operational flexibility, cost-effectiveness, ability to deploy rapidly where needed, and the potential for ascent-phase intercepts. As you will recall, the ABM Treaty precludes sea-and space-based defenses. Unfortunately, the Clinton administration is attempting to remain within the sacred scripture of the ABM Treaty by proposing one or two fixed land-based sites and hasn't vigorously pursued research and funding of more promising technologies. 
   We need a better alternative. For my money, that alternative is to develop a robust theater navy system which can provide a limited defense against some strategic missiles possibly at an earlier date than the administration's proposals would allow. Such a system can be a bridge to a complete national defense later. For many years now, the Navy has been heavily involved in missile defense and has invested over $50 billion in the Aegis fleet which now comprises more than 60 ships with more than 5,000 missile launchers. The Navy is currently working on two missile defense programs to be based on Aegis ships--the area or ``Lower Tier'' system that will provide protection for point targets against short-range missiles, and the Theater Wide or ``Upper Tier'' system capable of defending areas as large as several countries against much longer range missiles. The Pentagon's current plans do not call for the Navy Theater Wide system to be deployed before 2010 but this timing is driven by budget constraints rather than technology development. In fact, both the navy and the Ballistic Missile Defense Office have recently concluded that if funding were increased by roughly $300 million per year, the system could be deployed between 2003 and 2005 without a significant increase in risk. 
   Madam President, it is a more dangerous world out there than it was two or five years ago. Rogue nations have been able to pursue missile and nuclear programs with little effective hindrance from international proliferation regimes. The past twelve months have witnessed the first tests of the North Korean Taepo Dong I and the Iranian Shahab-3, the latter based on North Korea's No Dong design. Russia flirts with chaos and China once again reminds us that they remain a repressive, authoritarian regime, not a ``strategic partner'' in the administration's ill-chosen phrase. Both continue to assist rogue nations in their weapons of mass destruction. The administration's diplomacy has been inconsistent, distracted, and shortsighted at best. Its military programs are hobbled by outdated arms control strictures. Proliferation outstrips anti-proliferation efforts and rogue state offensive weaponry is advancing more rapidly than the administration's programs to counter them. The time has come for the United States to defend itself from the increasing missile threat that I have just described. The Cochran bill is the first step on this path. I urge my colleagues to support its passage. 
   Madam President, I would like to respond to my friend from Rhode Island and to speak to the question of whether or not we ought to maintain a window of vulnerability, because that is basically what has been presented here. My friend acknowledged the threat to the United States, but said we ought to go slow; after all, this might cost a lot and technology is hard and the Russians are going to be nervous about it. Therefore, maybe we ought to go slow. 
   Let me remind my colleagues what this amendment says. It is very simple:  
   It is the policy of the United States to deploy, as soon as is technologically possible, an effective missile defense capable of defending the territory of the United States against limited ballistic missile attack.  
   Madam President, that is pretty straightforward. We are saying that when it is possible, we should deploy such a system. Why? Because we are threatened. Is that threat sometime off in the future? No. The threat is now. There is a window of vulnerability between the time that we are threatened and the time we can deploy a system to protect ourselves against the threat. Why is this important? We know that Russian missiles can reach the United States already. We know Chinese missiles can reach the United States, and we now know that the North Koreans probably have a missile that can at least reach some of the United States, and they are testing further missiles that would have a longer range and eventually have the capability of reaching the continental United States. 
   Have we ever been threatened by any of these countries? Yes, as a matter of fact, we have. Back when the Chinese were launching missiles across Taiwan before the Taiwanese elections in an obvious effort to intimidate them, the United States decided to send carriers to the Taiwan Strait. One of the Chinese generals is supposed to have said to an American: ``You know, we believe in the long run that you care more about Los Angeles than you do about Taiwan''--the implicit threat being, of course, if you get in our way, if we are ever serious about doing something to Taiwan, we can threaten to launch ballistic missiles against Los Angeles. 
   Is it fair for the people of the United States, for their leaders, knowing this  vulnerability exists, to do nothing about it, or to take the ``let's go slow'' approach that has just been 
   suggested by my colleague? I think not. We would be negligent to the utmost degree if we understood that a threat existed, yet, we failed to protect the American people against a potential attack by a foreign country. That is the first and most important obligation of the U.S. Government--to protect the American people. 
   We now know that ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction carried by them are the weapon of choice--and not just by our old adversary, the Russians, but by rogue nations. That is why we should not allow a piece of paper--the ABM Treaty--to get in the way of defending us. Back in the days my colleague was just referring to, the United States and Russia--whether for good reasons or bad--decided we would remain neutrally vulnerable to an attack by the other; thereby, we would create stability. That may or may not have worked in those days. 
   I argue that there were other factors at play, but let's assume that was the reason. There were only two countries that could threaten each other; therefore, this was a workable arrangement. But to tie our hands behind our back mutually with the Russians doesn't account for today's reality in which there are other nations that could attack us. So while we politely agree with the Russians to maintain a lack of defense against ballistic missile attack, other countries have developed that capability and can threaten us, impede our foreign policy goals and, God forbid, even use the weapons against us with impunity because we don't have the means to defend ourselves. 
   Some would argue that we have the nuclear retaliatory capability to respond to such an attack. Well, Madam President, I for one would not like to have to launch a massive nuclear retaliation against North Korea, or anyone else, as the price of being attacked myself. I would rather deter that attack in the first place by having a defense--a limited defense--which would threaten in no way the Russian system because it would easily overwhelm it, but which would provide limited protection against an attack by a rogue nation. 
   I applaud Senator COCHRAN for his perseverance in continuing to bring this before the body, even though many on the other side of the aisle have not up until now allowed us to have a vote on this, and even though the administration strongly opposes it. 
   What were the arguments posed against the amendment? First is that we should not rush to this, and I think I have already made the point. There is no doubt about the threat here. The window of vulnerability will be in the neighborhood of a minimum of 5 or 6 years. That is too long. Under the administration's plan, we would deploy, maybe in 2005, a system that could defend us--or probably in 2006. We are talking 6 to 7 years from now. I don't think that trying to deploy this system as soon as technologically possible is rushing in any sense that is bad for the United States. Rather, I see a 6- or 7-year window of vulnerability as the problem. I would like to rush even more. I wish we could create the technology tomorrow and deploy this tomorrow. I don't think waiting 6 or 7 years and being threatened during that interim is rushing too much. 
   Secondly, my colleague suggested that we have to consider the threat. I don't know of anybody that denies the threat. The Rumsfeld Commission made it crystal clear that the Russians, Chinese, and the North Koreans have the capability, and that other countries will soon have the capability of reaching States 
   of the United States. Now, that is a threat from weapons of mass destruction. 
   How about the cost? Of course, we have to consider the cost. So how much is this going to cost? Well, about as much as it has cost us to go to Bosnia. The estimates there range from $12 billion to $20 billion. Whatever the cost is, certainly protecting the American people from ballistic missile attack ought to at least be as important as what we have spent in Bosnia, shouldn't it? How about 1 percent of the defense budget? That is what we are talking about. The administration is talking about adding about a billion dollars to a defense budget of $260 billion, or maybe $270 billion. So, Madam President, that is less than 1 percent of the defense budget. It is a fraction of the overall budget of the United States. 
   If this represents the No. 1 threat to the United States from rogue nations, and if it is 1 percent of the defense budget, is that too much? How much is too much to protect the American people, I ask my colleagues? Can you put a number on it? I can't. Certainly, 1 percent of the defense budget is not too much. 
   So first of all, there is a threat and there is a window of vulnerability. We are not rushing this, and we are not spending too much money on it. I challenge my colleagues to answer the question: How much is too much to protect the American people? When we don't even want to see one American life lost in a place like Bosnia, and we go to great lengths to protect our service people when we deploy them abroad because we don't want to lose one person, how much is too much to protect the people of Hawaii or Alaska, the States that are currently threatened by a country like North Korea, which is a country that absolutely cannot be predicted in terms of its behavior? 
   The third issue is diplomacy. We have the ABM Treaty to deal with. I am going to get into a little bit more detail on that in just a moment because we certainly have to think about strategic stability. We don't want to do anything here that would be so disruptive to our relationships with other nations, that somehow we would find ourselves in greater danger than from this particular threat. I suggest to my colleagues that there is no upsetting of the strategic stability of the world if we proceed to defend ourselves, especially from rogue nations. 
   As a matter of fact, I suggest that the deployment of missile defenses to protect the people of the United States will be profoundly stabilizing. If we have the prospect of defending our country against a ballistic missile attack, we are less likely to have to use massive nuclear retaliation, which is more destabilizing. Furthermore, our deployment of a national missile defense will reduce the incentive for nuclear and missile proliferation by our potential adversaries knowing that they can't succeed against us because we have this defense. 
   That is one of the key things that brought down the Soviet Union--knowing that we were committed to develop what was then the Strategic Defense Initiative to preclude the Soviet Union from ever succeeding in an attack against us. They basically packed it up. They said: We cannot compete with that; therefore, we are going to quit. 
   It seems to me that a strong commitment to defend ourselves will have the right effect. It will cause other countries to get realistic about the ability to try to push the United States around by the development of these threatening weapons. They will decide that discretion is the better part of valor and will decide that they can spend their money on more useful things. It will certainly reduce the ability of countries like North Korea to successfully blackmail the United States and our allies because we can't defend ourselves against their weapons. 
   Madam President, let me show, with the aid of a couple of charts, some things that I think are very interesting. This first chart shows the level of offensive weapons, nuclear warheads, permitted under different regimens today under treaties. This is the one we are currently under. It is called the START I. It said both Russia and the United States had to limit our nuclear warheads to about 6,000. So that is where we are. 
   We proposed, and the United States has ratified, the START II treaty, which almost cuts this in half--down to 3,500. We have been waiting, I believe now for 6 years, for Russia to ratify the START II treaty. They haven't ratified it yet. 
   We are worried here about making the Russians upset. How about us being upset? For a long time we have said: Let's create a more stable world; let's get rid of these dangerous weapons; you don't need them; we don't need them; let's reduce them down to 3,500--6 years ago. The Russians still haven't ratified. We have given a lot to the Russians as inducements for them to ratify. We bought the START II treaty many times. But they have yet to deliver. So we are still waiting.  
   Some argue that, because it is so costly to maintain these weapons, actually the Russians would prefer to go right to a more realistic level that they could sustain, a START III level, about 2,000; maybe they can afford to keep 2,000 weapons around; and, therefore, we ought to just jump right over START II and go all the way down to START III. Let's examine that argument for a minute. 
   It turns out that it is not the ABM Treaty at all, or the START II treaty, that is determining the strategic parity between the United States and Russia with respect to nuclear weapons. It turns out that this stability is created more by a very practical situation; that is, how much can the Russians afford? How much, frankly, can the United States afford? 
   As it turns out, Igor Sergeyev, the Russian Minister of Defense, last summer told the Russian Security Council that Russia will be unable to muster a strategic nuclear force of 
   more than 1,500 warheads by the year 2010 and that the reasons have nothing to do with armaments control. They can't afford it. Their economy is broken. They have no money. Much of their military force is in disrepair. And, indeed, the only part they have been modernizing is their strategic nuclear offensive capability. As a result, Sergeyev points out that this is the maximum level they are going to be able to maintain with or without an ABM Treaty, with or without a START II or START III treaty. 
   So it is not what we do with respect to these arms control agreements that is going to dictate the parity of nuclear weapons between our two countries; it is the stark reality of what we can both afford. 
   Frankly, this level of 1,500 to 2,000 is about where we are going to end up. So it doesn't matter whether we deploy another defensive system or not, or a defensive system against nuclear-tipped missiles or not. The fact is, the Russians are going down to this level because they can't afford to do anything else. 
   I think, therefore, that the notion that offensive reductions in strategic nuclear warheads will not occur if this bill is passed is simply not borne out by the facts. This bill has nothing whatsoever to do with that. It is happening and will continue to happen regardless of what we do today. 
   But let's suppose something. Let's make believe something--that some of the arguments similar to those that have just been made are correct and that ``Russia would likely retain thousands of nuclear warheads'' and somehow they would develop the money to do this that they would ``otherwise eliminate'' under these arms control agreements. Suppose some miracle occurs and Russia finds the resources to rejuvenate its strategic forces. 
   What rationale would Russia have for doing this? 
   Bear in mind that what we are talking about here is a national missile defense system. We qualified it, it says ``limited,'' and the reason is that we do not intend to build anything more, and we would not build anything more, than a limited system capable of providing a defense against a limited attack, an attack that we currently believe we are threatened by a rogue nation like North Korea, or, given the debate about China these days, perhaps a China, which doesn't have the same quantity of missiles that Russia does. 
   There are other nations in the world that I will not list that also are developing this capability. 
   Suppose that when we develop this system, Russia looks at it and says, ``How is this going to affect our strategic missile offensive warhead situation? Maybe we ought to have more warheads, because the United States system is going to degrade our capability of successfully attacking them.'' In other words, ``If they have a good defense, maybe we need more offense.'' 
   I pointed out that the defense we are talking about is a minimal defense, perhaps capable of defending against just a handful of missiles, not the 6,000 warheads that the Russians may have today. If the strategic stability argument is to be believed, it has to be because the Russians would find the idea of the United States missile defense so threatening that they would have to retain thousands and thousands of warheads in order to be sure they could overcome our defense. 
   So, let's examine the defensive side of the equation. 
   I have another chart which I think will explain this situation. The offensive warheads again are in red. This is 
   what was originally permitted under START I. You can see that we had about 2,000 warheads at the time. But START I eventually got to the level of 6,000 that I mentioned a while ago. That is where we are today--both countries in the neighborhood of authorized 6,000 warheads. That is the column in red. This is the way it began back when START I was actually ratified, and when the ABM Treaty was created. Back in those days, each side was limited by the ABM Treaty to 200 interceptor missiles. In 1974, at the time the treaty was negotiated, or signed, neither side having plans to deploy the full complement of defensive missiles it was allowed, that number was reduced to 100. That remains the limit today. So both countries have 100 authorized interceptors. Of course, Russia has built its system. We have not built our system. 
   The limited missile defense system the United States is developing will be capable initially of shooting down, as I said, a handful of relatively unsophisticated warheads. The plans for ``Capability 1,'' as we will call it, called for deployment of 20 interceptor missiles to do this job--just 20 interceptor missiles. This is the system the administration claims can be deployed by 2005. Subsequently, this will grow to ``Capability 2,'' which, according to the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, will consist of up to 100 interceptor missiles able to shoot down a somewhat larger number of sophisticated warheads. 
   Although the concept of operations envisions firing several interceptors at each warhead, let's assume for the purpose of argument that each interceptor will work absolutely perfectly and kill one warhead. That is never going to be the case, but we will give the other side the absolute maximum benefit of the doubt. That means that, at most, as envisioned today, the United States system will be capable of destroying 100 Russian warheads, out of a START III total of no fewer than 2,000, or perhaps 1,500, if Minister Sergeyev is correct. Let's examine what that means. 
   Back in 1974, when the ABM Treaty was created, there was a 10-to-1 ratio in terms of offensive to defensive, because you had about 2,000 warheads and 200-interceptor authorized capability, although we never built it. We have now built up to 2,000 warheads, and we have an authorized 100-interceptor capability. The blue line here is the defensive warheads, or the defensive missile capability. 
   So you have 6,000 warheads existing, and a 60-to-1 ratio, because you can only intercept 100 at the absolute most, because you get 1 for 1. Under START II, that ratio would be 35 to 1, because you would have 3,500 warheads and you still have 100 authorized interceptors. Under START III, it would be 20 to 1, because you would have 2,000 warheads, 100 interceptors. Even if Minister Sergeyev is correct, as I said, you would have no more than 1,500 warheads in the Soviet Union and you would have 100 interceptors, for a 15-to-1 ratio--15-to-1 ratio. That is still greater than the ratio that existed at the time of the signing of the ABM Treaty, the time and the age we are trying to go back to and preserve. This is the way things ought to be--1974, a ratio of 10-to-1, offensive weapons to interceptors. 
   That was strategic stability. That was the ratio, the parity that we wanted, and so we negotiated it. That is what is in jeopardy now. 
   That is what is in jeopardy now, Madam President? If you give the other side the absolute maximum of a 1-to-1 kill ratio, you hit 100 missiles with 100 interceptors, the ratio today at 15 to 1 is still a greater ratio than 10 to 1. How could the Russians be more threatened today with a 15-to-1 ratio of offensive over defensive capability when they were perfectly happy to sign the ABM Treaty back in 1974 with a 10-to-1 ratio? How could this be more destabilizing? How could any Senator argue against the protection of the American people today because it would threaten the Russians because it would be destabilizing, it would create a worse situation than existed back in 1974, when the ratio then was 10 to 1? And it would be 50 percent more than that today--15 to 1.  
   You cannot argue it; it is illogical. And for the Russians to contend otherwise would be irresponsible. Certainly for us to act on behalf of their irrational objections would be irresponsible on our part. 
   Incidentally, I might add that this Nation that will allegedly be so angered and concerned about the deployment of our limited defense has the world's only ABM system, nuclear armed, recently upgraded, now in its fourth generation. It is deployed around Moscow with all 100 interceptor missiles allowed under the ABM Treaty. So how is it that a comparable U.S. system cannot be deployed without unduly angering the Russian leadership? They have 100 very modern interceptor missiles today. We have none. So if we have 100 just like they have, how is that going to be destabilizing? It is we who should be arguing about instability, not the Russians. 
   I think the argument that strategic stability would be somehow upset if the United States did what the ABM Treaty authorizes, and that is create a capability to intercept first 20 and then 100 missiles, would hardly be destabilizing, at least to the point that we should delay or preclude ourselves from doing it. 
   Obviously, the Russians will complain; it is in their interest to do so. Although the cold war has ended and we still enjoy a much more positive relationship with the Russians, all traces of rivalry have not disappeared. They still find it in their interest when possible to work in ways inimical to U.S. interests, and they know that our defenselessness against ballistic missile attack constrains our actions around the world, and that, in the Russian view, is not necessarily a bad thing. 
   So one realistically understands that there will be objections, but one must realistically evaluate those objections. I wish my colleague who just spoke a few minutes ago, who so tortuously examined all of the reasons why we could not move forward with this--it is going to cost a lot, the technology is hard, diplomatically we need to think of how the Russians would feel--I wish that we were as concerned about the threat to the United States as we are the feelings of the Russian leadership. And I wish we were as concerned about our ability to project our national interests in our foreign policy against the threat of rogue nations such as the Irans and the Iraqs and the North Koreans of the world as we are about the feelings of the Russians. Russian soldiers and scientists understand the reality that is portrayed on these charts just as 
   well as we do, and we know that a very limited missile defense system that we have the right to deploy in no way threatens strategic stability, no matter how loudly they may protest that it does. Our relationship with Russia is something that must be taken very seriously, but it cannot prevent us from taking reasonable actions to defend the American people against threats from other countries. The day that we conclude that unduly taking Russian concerns into account would inhibit our ability to defend ourselves is the day we have to move forward. 
   So, in summary, strategic stability as defined by the other side in this debate, the ABM Treaty at the time that it was negotiated, which created a 10-to-1 advantage of strategic offensive over defensive weapons, that 10-to-1 ratio is not degraded even under the worst set of conditions that one might imagine in terms of our ability to defend ourselves here, or I should say even under the best of conditions because the ratio will still be 15 to 1 under this condition. It is more likely to be in the neighborhood of 20 to 1 or 35 to 1, the point being that no Russian could feel threatened with this kind of relationship if they didn't feel threatened back here anyway. And this defines the golden mean, remember. 
   With respect to the cost, I think I have covered that. Even this administration is willing to add money to the budget to pay for what it believes will be a system that it can build when it is technologically feasible. Recognizing that the technology is hard, we provide in this amendment that it is our policy to deploy as soon as is technologically possible an effective missile defense system. 
   So we are not saying deploy something that is not technologically possible. Yes, we know technology is hard, but we also know we can get there, the administration believes, by about the year 2005. 
   So to the thought we should not be rushing forward with this amendment, I simply say how long do you want to leave the American people vulnerable? How valuable is it to you to leave the American people vulnerable to a missile attack, or to leave our Nation subject to blackmail, to the threat of such an attack; to prevent us, for example, from defending our friends in South Korea because the North Koreans have a nuclear weapon with a missile capable of hitting Alaska or Hawaii; to prevent us from defending Taiwan against Chinese aggression because they have missiles that can reach Los Angeles; to prevent us from supporting a country like Japan or any of the other interests that we may have around the world? 
   Eventually, it boils down to this: We have an obligation to defend the American people. We will have the technological capability of doing that soon in the next century. There is a threat to the American people today. The cost of building a national missile defense is not prohibitive. Even if it were 1 percent of the defense budget, it would not be prohibitive--I submit, even if it were 10 percent, but it is obviously not going to cost that much. 
   So given the nature of the threat, given the fact that technology is taken into account in this proposal, that it clearly is not going to cost too much even by this administration's analysis, and the fact that it will not disrupt strategic stability in the world, it seems to me that we would be derelict in our duty as representatives of the people not to move forward. 
   The first step in moving forward is to adopt this simple resolution because, as is clear from the debate on the other side, unless we are committed to deploying a national missile defense, we are going to find excuses for not doing it. And until the Senate and the House of Representatives pass a resolution that says we are going to do this, the bureaucrats and the naysayers and those who don't want to do it will have good reason for not moving forward. We will not have spoken on the issue in a definitive way. That is why I applaud my colleague, Senator COCHRAN. He understands that we have to get an expression of serious intent in order to be able to convince the naysayers to move forward. And that is why adoption of this resolution is so important. 
   So I urge my colleagues to support this bill when we have a chance to do so; we do it with great pride and with understanding that it fulfills the most important responsibility we have to the American people, and that is to provide for the national defense.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for Senator BROWNBACK'S legislation, Senate Concurrent Resolution 5, regarding the unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state. As an original cosponsor of this legislation, I believe it is important for the Senate to indicate its opposition to any unilateral declaration of statehood by the Palestinian Authority before Chairman Yasser Arafat's visit to the United States to meet with President Clinton. 
   The legislation underscores three important points: 
   First, the final political status of the territory controlled by the Palestinian Authority can only be determined through negotiations and agreement between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. 
   Second, any attempt to establish Palestinian statehood outside the negotiating process will invoke the strongest congressional opposition. 
   Third, the President should unequivocally assert United States opposition to the unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state making clear that a declaration would be a grievous violation of the Oslo accords and that a declared state would not be recognized by the United States. 
   As we all know from reading the newspapers, this legislation is directed toward those Palestinians, including Chairman Yasser Arafat, who have made statements about the possibility of issuing a unilateral declaration on or about May 4 of this year. Last month a top Palestinian official said, ``We are moving forward in our preparation for the day, May 4th, the date of the declaration of the Palestinian state that would encompass a portion of Jerusalem. The cabinet announced that ``At the end of the interim period [the Palestinian Authority] shall declare the establishment of a Palestinian state on all Palestinian land occupied since 1967, with Jerusalem as the eternal capital of the Palestinian state.'' 
   On several occasions over the past year, the Clinton administration has refused to express U.S. opposition to the unilateral declaration of an independent Palestinian state, and has left it an open question as to whether the United States will recognize a unilaterally declared Palestinian state. As an example, his intention to establish a Palestinian state with its capital in Jerusalem. Unfortunately, the President may have only encouraged this course when he said: ``[T]he Palestinian people and their elected representatives now have a chance to determine their own destiny on their own land.'' 
   This legislation is intended to set the record straight. Despite the President's ambiguous statements, there should be no confusion among the Palestinian leadership about where the United States Congress stands on the issue of a unilateral declaration of statehood. 
   Mr. President, this matter brings to the fore another issue in which the administration's mixed signals and inconsistent policy in the Middle East has enabled false hopes and fantasy to flourish. I am referring to the policy of the United States regarding the status of Jerusalem. 
   With support from 90 percent of the members in both Houses, in 1995, Congress passed the Jerusalem Embassy Relocation Act, the principle feature of which was the requirement to establish an American embassy in Jerusalem no later than May 31, 1999. Another key element of the legislation, which the administration has repeatedly refused to acknowledge, is the statement of U.S. policy regarding Jerusalem. The legislation states: ``It is the policy of the United States that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel.'' Despite that the legislation is now law, the Clinton State Department has repeatedly refused to acknowledge this policy. 
   So, with the acquiescence of the Clinton administration, the Palestinian Authority has chosen to ignore American law and continues to hold out hope that the United States will recognize Jerusalem as the capital of a Palestinian state, perhaps even the capital of a state established unilaterally. 
   This will not happen. 
   The United States Congress has a clear policy regarding Jerusalem. Today, we are stating our position regarding the unilateral establishment of a Palestinian state. While the administration's policies are confusing, ambiguous statements of general support for everything on the table, the Congress is clear and direct. No unilateral declaration. No Palestinian sovereignty over Jerusalem. 
   I commend Senator BROWNBACK and my colleague from Arizona, MATT SALMON, who is the principal sponsor of this legislation in the House of Representatives.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I hadn't intended to speak today, but given the fact that we have a little bit of time, I thought I would share one of the things that is on my mind as we come back to work following the Presidents' Day recess and almost a month of impeachment proceedings, which is what we were doing the last time I sat at this desk a week ago. 
   There is one bit of unfinished business relating to the impeachment proceedings. Because the President was not removed from office, a lot of my constituents, over the course of this last week--people I visited with throughout the State of Arizona during the Presidents' Day recess--wondered what would happen, what would the precedent be, what would the standard be in court proceedings? What was the lesson, in other words, to be learned from the fact that the President was not removed? 
   I had to stop and think about what I was answering them with. I said: We should not take from that the fact that you can lie or that you can obstruct justice, that you can engage in conduct that is designed to subvert justice, to take the law into your own hands. That would be the wrong lesson. I spoke to schoolkids. One of the questions that kept recurring was: If the President is not punished, then won't that lower the standard for the rest of the country in the future? 
   My response, I think, is that we have to go back to what HENRY HYDE was talking about when he first appeared before the Senate at the beginning of the impeachment trial, and that we need to talk to the American people about this as a piece of unfinished business. The Senate trial has come to a conclusion; the President will remain in office; the impeachment proceeding is behind us. And that is all as it should be. But it seems to me that because there is a perception that the President was not punished--I will come back to that in just a moment--that, therefore, somehow there will be a different standard applied in the future, perhaps in sexual harassment or sexual discrimination cases specifically, but more broadly within the criminal justice system. 
   I think the piece of unfinished business is for all of us to commit ourselves to the proposition that the rule of law will not be diminished in the United States, that not only the lawyers and the judges in the judicial process but also all Americans, parents and teachers, talking to our children, and all of us working within whatever part of society we work, will recommit ourselves to the rule of law in the United States and ensure that this case does not create a bad precedent; that we treat this case, rather, as an aberration, as the exception that proves the rule, as a situation which is unique because it involved one person, the President, and an impeachment proceeding which is unique under our Constitution; but that we not accept it as a precedent that you can, as I said, take the law into your own hands, subvert justice, and then get away with it. 
   In one sense, President Clinton has not really gotten away with his bad conduct. He was impeached by the House of Representatives, he was tried in the Senate, and half of the Senate voted on one of the articles to remove him from office. History will certainly judge that his reputation has been diminished as a result of his conduct. And for a person in political life, a President in particular, that is certainly some degree of punishment. In addition to that, the trust of his office has been diminished and he clearly has suffered some public opprobrium as a result of his conduct. 
   Therefore, I think what we have to do is tell young people that, even though his conduct was not perceived by two-thirds of the Senate as sufficiently serious to warrant his removal from office, it does not mean that he wasn't punished. So, in that sense, the lesson to be learned is there will be bad consequences from bad action but they may not be the most severe consequences that can attach to the action. 
   In one of the schools I spoke to, I said, ``You have a yearbook here, don't you?'' And they said, ``Yes.'' 
   And I said, ``Suppose you did something pretty bad, but it wasn't quite bad enough to be kicked out of school. But the yearbook has your picture on it and it says below it: This person lied and did something bad in class and everybody thought he should not be trusted anymore. But it wasn't quite serious enough to kick him out of school.'' 
   I said, ``That would be a pretty bad thing, for everybody who reads that yearbook for 50 years later to see that written under your picture in the yearbook. But it's not quite bad enough to throw you out of school.'' 
   So, let's understand that what has happened to the President here is not good, it is bad, because he did something wrong. I am sure that people on both sides of the aisle will concede that his conduct was inappropriate. So in that sense he has been punished. 
   But in a larger sense, because he was not removed from office, there is still this perception hanging out there that perhaps the rule of law has been diminished; that now it is no longer the case that one will be able to prosecute for perjury or obstruction of justice; that perhaps in a sexual harassment 
   or discrimination case there will be some new precedent established, the ``Clinton standard,'' that you can actually  walk very close to the line of telling the whole truth, and if you choose not to do it and you are clever enough about the way you phrase things, maybe you will be able to escape punishment. Perhaps people who were punished for perjury in sexual discrimination cases ought to be no longer punished under those same circumstances. 
   That is what I am saying is our unfinished business. Every one of us who has something to say about it should say: No, this case does not stand for that. This was the President of the United States whom the Senate chose not to remove from office, the most severe thing that could occur to a President. And there were a lot of reasons for that. Some of our colleagues felt it would simply be too much of a disruption for our country. Some thought that the particular activity in this case was just not quite serious enough to warrant his removal. 
   Those of us who disagreed with that did so, among other reasons, because we believed that allowing the President to remain in office would subvert the rule of law; that this would be used as an excuse for people to lie in the future; that there would not be as much adherence to the precedents in the past, of ensuring that people who take the law into their own hands are appropriately punished. That is one of the reasons that many of us voted guilty in this case. 
   But I think even though we did not prevail and the President was not removed, that everyone in the Chamber would agree--all 100 of us would agree--that we do not want this case to stand for the proposition that you can subvert justice by impeding discovery or by lying, by giving false testimony; that you cannot do those things and expect that the rule of law in the future will be any less severe with respect to its consequences. 
   As I said, this case must be deemed the exception that proves the rule because of its unique circumstances. In every way that those of us who are permitted to do so, we must uphold the rule of law in the country. 
   Specifically, that means we must teach this to our young people. We must talk about it as lawmakers here, when we speak to the local Lions Club or local Rotary Club, wherever we may be speaking, that lawyers and judges in the country must strictly adhere to the law. Anyone who appears before a court as a litigant must themselves strictly adhere to these principles and never violate the law as it exists. And anyone who teaches with respect to what this means should take the position that it does not mean that one can take the law into one's own hands and succeed in subverting justice simply because of what did or did not happen to the President of the United States in this particular case. 
   The rule of law is important to this country because it distinguishes us from almost every other country in the world. There are certainly other countries in which one can expect to get relatively fair justice, but in the United States we consider ourselves unique. We have, for over 210 years, protected the rule of law in this country. We have ensured that even the least among us can get equal justice under law. And this country has done a great deal to ensure that principle is true, whether it is in the Federal courts or the local courts of the country; whether it is with respect to the rich and the powerful and the famous or, as I said, the least among us. In our system, the law applies equally to everyone. 
   We must ensure that remains the case. How many of us would want to submit our lives or our fortunes to the justice system--oh, let's just take one of the many countries south of us, for example--in the southern hemisphere? Or in Russia today, where one cannot even engage in commerce because there is not a rule of law which ensures that dispute resolution in commercial dealings will be done fairly? How many of us would want to be accused of a crime in one of those societies and have to defend ourselves or be sued in one of those societies and be assured that we would be dealt with in a fair way? In many of those countries today, unless you have the ability to bribe someone or to pay someone off, you cannot be assured of fair justice. 
   In the United States today, even though we do not want to go to court, every one of us knows that if we have to go to court, we can at least expect that we will be dealt with fairly because truth-telling is at the bottom of the judicial process and truth-telling will be enforced. 
   It will be maintained because it will be enforced, and we can point to many cases in which people who lied are now serving in jail because of their perjury. 
   That is why it is important to maintain the rule of law in our country. That is what the rule of law is all about. That is why it is important, and that is why we have to sustain it. 
   So, Mr. President, as I reflected on what my constituents were asking me, as I talked to them over the course of this last Presidents' Day recess in Arizona, and I thought about the importance of the rule of law in the United States to each one of us, and the questions that had been raised as a result of the fact that the President was not removed from office, I dedicated myself to talking about this, to writing about it, and to ensuring my constituents back home and, hopefully, people around the country will understand how important it is for all of us over the next weeks, months, and years to ensure that the rule of law is not diminished, is not subverted as a result of the Senate's action with respect to the impeachment of President Clinton. 
   One could draw that conclusion, but we must not permit that conclusion to be drawn. It is up to us to maintain the rule of law in the United States, and I believe that because of the dedication to the principle of the rule of law and the fact that everyone in this country wishes it to remain strong, and the fact that all 100 of us in this Chamber, I am certain, and the Members in the House of Representatives as well, are dedicated to that proposition and do not want to see the result of this case diminish the rule of law; that all of us will rededicate ourselves to that principle and will do everything we can over the course, as I said, of the ensuing months and years to ensure the rule of law in this country remains strong and we will continue to provide in this country, as we have in the past over 200 years, equal justice for all. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. KYL. This case is about the rule of law--specifically, whether actions and statements of President Clinton in federal court proceedings have done such harm to the rule of law that he should be removed from office. I conclude in the affirmative, and reluctantly vote to convict on both Articles of Impeachment. 
   Chairman HENRY HYDE observed that the House of Representatives had come to the Senate ``as advocates for the rule of law, for equal justice under law, and for the sanctity of the oath.'' (145 Cong. Rec. S221 (January 14, 1999).) 
   These are not just grand words. 
   The rule of law refers to our judicial process, which is governed by uniform standards and procedures that we say will always be guaranteed and applied fairly and equally. We are willing to submit ourselves to this process because we have worked hard for 210 years to ensure that it produces impartial justice for all. 
   Equal justice means that each of us, including the least among us, has rights that the state is bound to protect; and it surely includes the requirement that those who make the laws (including the President) must live under them like anybody else. 
   And oaths are essential to the rule of law because the judicial process is about seeking the truth; and that requires that we be able to trust what is said. The oath formalizes the commitment to tell the truth, and the whole truth--a commitment so important that its violation is itself a crime. 
   I believe there are two questions to be answered. 
   The first is whether the President impermissibly took the law into his own hands in a federal civil rights case and seven months later before a federal grand jury in order to suppress the truth. The second question is whether, if the President did engage in the impeachable conduct, it is a breach serious enough to warrant removal from office. 
   The Constitution permits only one vote: to acquit or convict. This leaves some in the anomalous position of determining guilt on an impeachable offense, but having to vote to acquit because they deem the offense insufficiently serious to warrant removal. While the fact that the offense is impeachable should itself resolve the issue of ``proportionality,'' I would not consider it impermissible to reach a contrary conclusion, as some will do in this case. 
   For my part, I answer both questions in the affirmative. The President ``wilfully provided perjurious, false, and misleading testimony'' under oath to a grand jury and he ``prevented, obstructed, and impeded the administration of justice.'' (H. Res. 611). 
   While the House of Representatives asserted that the President's actions were criminal, violations of specific criminal statutes are not essential for wrongful conduct to constitute the ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' that demonstrate unfitness to continue as Chief Executive. Most authorities agree a President cannot be prosecuted while in office for crimes allegedly committed during his term. So, for example, whether a lie under oath would necessarily later result in a criminal perjury conviction cannot be known with certainty, and an impeachment trial is not an effective forum for establishing criminal guilt. It is conduct, not a proven crime, that is the basis for impeachment. 
   This is one of the reasons why it is clear that each Senator may apply his or her standard of proof--it need not be the criminal standard ``beyond a reasonable doubt.'' (See Senate Proceedings in the Impeachment Trial of Judge Claiborne, S. Doc. No. 99-48, at 150.) Moreover, because the Senate constrained the House of Representatives as it did--by limiting the number of witnesses that could be deposed, by effectively foreclosing other discovery, and by precluding ``live'' testimony--it would be unfair to impose a ``beyond reasonable doubt'' standard. 
   The President's counsel argued that the Senate should not consider Article I because the House of Representatives defeated a perjury count relating to the 
   Jones civil action. But Article I also included allegations of ``perjurious, false, and misleading'' statements in the Jones case; so the argument is meritless. Moreover, the President's falsehoods in the Jones civil suit also formed part of his strategy to obstruct justice. 
   What is striking about this case is the President's persistent, sustained, carefully calculated, deliberate, and callous manipulation of the judicial process for over a year. 
   Without attempting to summarize all of the evidence, I conclude that the President lied before the federal grand jury about (1) the nature of details of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky; (2) his assertion that he told the truth in the Jones deposition; (3) the false and misleading statements that he allowed his lawyer to make to a federal judge in the Paula Jones civil case; and (4) his corrupt efforts to influence the testimony of his aides who were potential grand jury witnesses. 
   And it seems clear to me that the President obstructed justice--that he corruptly: (1) encouraged Ms. Lewinsky to execute a false affidavit; (2) encouraged Ms. Lewinsky to lie if called as a witness; (3) encouraged Ms. Lewinsky to conceal gifts; (4) encouraged cooperation of Ms. Lewinsky through job assistance; (5) allowed his attorney to  make false and misleading statements about the affidavit; (6) attempted to influence the testimony of his secretary, Ms. Currie; and (7) attempted to influence the testimony of other aides. 
   The final question is whether the President should be removed for his actions. 
   As a preliminary matter, there can be no doubt that perjurious, false, and misleading statements made under oath in federal court proceedings are indeed impeachable offenses. The fact that the House of Representatives reached this conclusion, of course, establishes the precedent as to the kind of conduct in this case. But, it is also confirmed by the impeachment and conviction of federal judges--of Judge Harry Claiborne, removed in 1986 for filing a false income tax return under penalty of perjury, of Judge Walter Nixon, removed in 1989 for perjury before a grand jury, and of Judge Alcee Hastings, removed in 1989 for perjury related to financial misconduct. I cannot agree with those colleagues who assert that there is a different standard for a President--that it would require a more egregious kind of perjury to remove a President than a judge. Nothing in the Constitution suggests such a double standard. 
   John Jay, the first Chief Justice of the United States, said ``there is no crime more extensively pernicious to society'' than perjury, precisely because it ``discolors and poisons the streams of justice.'' (Grand Jury Charge (C.C.D.N.Y. (Apr. 5, 1792)) (Jay, C.J.), in 2 The Documentary History of the Supreme Court of the United States, 1789-1800: The Justices on Circuit: 1790-1794, at 253, 255 (Maeva Marcus ed., 1988).) 
   As to obstruction of justice, on which there is no other direct precedent, Chief Justice Rehnquist, our presiding officer, in his history of impeachment, Grand Inquests, wrote that ``the counts relating to the obstruction of justice and to the unlawful use of executive power [by President Nixon] were of the kind that would surely have justified removal from office.'' 
   The House mangers pointed out, accurately, that even though perjury and obstruction of justice are not specifically listed as impeachable offenses in the Constitution, the Federal Sentencing Guidelines treat these offenses more seriously than they do the crime of bribery--one of two specifically enumerated impeachable offenses. Significantly, where bribery is committed in connection with a judicial proceeding (such as bribing a witness in a case), its seriousness under the Guidelines rises to that of perjury and obstruction. When misdeeds, in other words, take place in connection with a judicial process, to try to affect or control that process, they get extra attention in our legal system. They are not simply brushed aside. Far from it. Perjury and obstruction are like bribery; they are ``other high crimes'' by any reasonable construction. 
   The President's counsel argued that the President's conduct could not be 
   impeachable because he did not abuse the power of his office in conducting ``matters of state,'' and did not violate the public trust. But impeachable offenses are not limited to the President's conduct of ``matters of state.'' If this were so, Richard Nixon could never have been impeached. If this were so, a twenty dollar bribe for a Senator to vote for a bill would be impeachable, while a million dollar bribe to cover up political dirty tricks would not be. 
   It simply cannot be, as some have argued, that the only impeachable offenses are those that can only be committed by the President. If a President commits murder, can he not be removed? Must we wait until his term is over to deal with his crime? It is clear that seriously wrongful official conduct is impeachable. But it is just as clear that impeachment cannot be limited to that. 
   It is not only the exercise of presidential power but also the violation of a public duty that can constitute impeachable conduct. As the head of the Executive Branch, the President has the duty under Article II of the Constitution to ``take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.'' The 1974 House Judiciary report on the ``Constitutional Grounds for Presidential Impeachment'' summarized that impeachment of a President can ``be predicted only upon conduct seriously incompatible with either the constitutional form and principles of our government or the proper performance of constitutional duties of the presidential office.'' (Staff of House Comm. on the Judiciary, 93rd Cong., 2d Sess. (Comm. Print 1974), Constitutional Grounds for Presidential Impeachment, at 24.) Surely the violation of constitutional obligations can constitute high crimes or misdemeanors for which the President may be impeached. And surely, such violation would constitute an abuse of trust by the Chief Executive. 
   By his oath of office and Article II responsibilities, President Clinton is supposed to see that the sexual discrimination laws are faithfully executed. But he thought the Jones case was illegitimate, so he took the law into his own hands. His conduct in this case clearly violated his public duties, his oath, and the public trust. And it interfered with the proper functioning of another branch of the government. 
   The same is true for his deliberate efforts to impede legitimate discovery efforts in federal court proceedings. Such action ``is incompatible with ..... the constitutional form and principles of our government,'' as the 1974 House Judiciary report said. It simply cannot be that a President who wrongfully interferes with the proper functioning of another branch of our government by attempting to subvert justice in federal court proceedings cannot be impeached because he did not do it as President, but, rather, as a citizen. 
   That the underlying conduct covered up is sexual, is, if anything, an 
   aggravating not a mitigating factor. In sex-discrimination litigation, where there is frequently no corroboration for the plaintiff, a defendant who lies can easily subvert justice. Had the blue dress not been found, with its incontrovertible tangible evidence, I doubt Paula Jones would have gotten a dime in settlement. 
   Judgements about the severity of the impeachable conduct in this case will lead different Senators to reach different conclusions. That is why some of us are willing to say reasonable people can differ. For those who fear the long-term consequences to the rule of law, however, I believe there can be only one result. Anyone who so willfully, callously, and persistently connived to deny the federal court and grand jury the truth, and who used and abused the highest office in the land to advance his personal cover-up is not only no longer worthy of trust--which all agree is essential to the conduct of his office--but also must be removed to avoid the perpetuation of a legal double standard. If federal judges (such as Judges Clairborne, Nixon, and Hastings) are removed for similar conduct; if average Americans are imprisoned for it, can the rule of law long survive ``special exceptions'' for powerful people we like, or who are doing a good job, or who hold elective office? None of these rationalizations are defenses to illegal or impeachable conduct. 
   As I said, sexual harassment cases are precisely the kind of judicial proceedings that demand the maximum cooperation of and truth-telling by the defendant, because of the lack of third-party witnesses or corroborating evidence. In these cases, justice is denied if obstruction, witness tampering, or perjury prevent the truth from coming out. Can anyone say this is not serious? To what standard of seriousness does it not rise? How many plaintiffs will have to lose their sexual harassment, domestic violence, or sexual assault cases because defendants lie and obstruct justice (and there is no blue dress to keep them honest) before it becomes serious? 
   An acquittal in this case will make it harder to deal properly with similar conduct in the future. We will be hard pressed to perpetuate a double standard, so the lowest common denominator of conduct will be established as the permissible norm. And this cannot help but weaken the ability of courts to enforce truth-telling and prevent obstruction of justice. 
   The precedent set by this case may not change the law overnight, but this unforgettable episode is now part of the institutional life of our country. The chief magistrate perverted justice and remained in power. The lesson is corrosive. Like water dripping on a rock, it eventually makes a deep hollow in the American justice system. 
   It is true the President could be sent to jail later. How does that validate his  right to appoint judges and be head of U.S. law enforcement now? How does that square with his leadership of the armed forces right now, as our Commander-in-Chief? Should the standard for the President not be at least as high as for those he appoints and leads? 
   In the end, my colleagues who would censure rather than convict the President are right about one thing: the President's conduct is ``unacceptable.'' But, if conduct is unacceptable, we cannot accept it--meaning, we have to do something about it that does not leave it stand. And under our Constitution that means removal of the President through conviction on the Articles of Impeachment.

    Mr. KYL. Mr. President, this Sunday, February 14, 1999, marks the eighty-seventh anniversary of the granting of statehood to the great state of Arizona. On this historic occasion, I propose to amend, with the attached bill, the act of Congress which in 1910 set in motion Arizona's entry into the Union. The proposed amendment makes two small but important modifications to the Arizona Enabling Act relating to the administration of state trust funds. These changes have been requested by Governor Hull, the state legislature, and the citizens of Arizona. 
   Mr. President, the Arizona Enabling Act required the state to establish a permanent fund collecting the proceeds of the sale of trust land and the land's mineral and other natural products. The principal of the fund is not expendable for any purpose. Instead, it is invested in interest-bearing securities, and the interest is used to support the financial needs of the beneficiaries. 
   Mr. President, Arizona is currently prevented from maximizing the benefits of the permanent fund. The state could improve management, and generate more revenues for the beneficiaries, by gaining authorization to invest part of the fund in stocks, and to reinvest some earnings to offset inflation. This amendment would allow the state treasurer to preserve the real value of the fund by reinvesting an amount equal to the rate of inflation, thereby providing higher payments to beneficiaries over time. This amendment is similar to the change that was granted to New Mexico in 1997. It was approved by Arizona voters on November 3, 1998. 
   Mr. President, the second modification to the Arizona Enabling Act contained in this bill would allow the state to expend monies from the Miners' Hospital Endowment Fund to benefit the Arizona Pioneers' Home. Current law prohibits the commingling of funds associated with state-trust lands. Insufficient funds exist in the Miners' Hospital Endowment Fund to build and operate a separate hospital for disabled miners, but disabled miners have been cared for at the Arizona Pioneers' Home since 1929. Miners who meet the statutory admission requirements for the Hospital for Disabled Miners will continue to be admitted to the Arizona Pioneers' Home on a priority basis.

    Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to authorize an Indian water rights settlement agreement that was entered into on May 4, 1998 by the Gila River Indian Community of Arizona and the Phelps Dodge Corporation. 
   This bill is identical to the legislation I introduced in the last session of Congress. As I said upon introduction last year, this particular settlement is part of a much larger, comprehensive settlement process that will eventually settle all claims of the Gila River Indian Community. I strongly endorse the settlement process and want to encourage all parties to continue their negotiations. Although I am introducing this measure today as free-standing legislation, it is inextricably linked to the outcome of the rest of the negotiations. So while I am encouraged by the settlement process, I am not yet comfortable with pieces of it moving independently. 
   As I did last session, I put this bill on the table so that all interested parties may have a document around which to gather and continue their conversations. While this particular piece of the settlement may be further along than others, I do not want to see pieces move separately. My preference is that the parties arrive at a comprehensive settlement that fully and finally addresses all aspects of the Gila River Indian Community's claim.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to transfer title to the Wellton-Mohawk Irrigation and Drainage District in Yuma, Arizona from the Federal government to the project beneficiaries. If you think this sounds like deja vu, you would be correct--it is. In May of 1998, during the 105th Congress, I introduced the same bill. The version I introduce today is the same version the passed the Senate at the end of last Congress. The bill was approved by all the relevant House and Senate Committees, passed by the Senate, included in a package of similar bills in the House, but, for reasons that I have not been able to determine, never managed to get signed into law. And this particular project transfer was one Regional Director Bob Johnson called ``low hanging fruit.'' In a meeting in my office, he assured me that the Wellton-Mohawk project was a ``perfect example'' of the kind of project that should transfer under the administration's 1995 Framework for Transfer. So this is exactly the kind of project the Department of the Interior should transfer project title from the Department to the project beneficiaries.

    Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to join Senator JOHN MCCAIN as an original cosponsor of the Senior Citizens Freedom to Work Act of 1999. Senator MCCAIN's legislation would give seniors relief from the Social Security earnings limitation contained in current law. 
   During the 1992 presidential campaign, President Clinton said that America must ``lift the Social Security earnings test limitation so that older Americans are able to help rebuild our economy and create a better future for us all.'' I could not agree more. Yet, despite 6 years of urging from many members of Congress and millions of Americans, the President appears reluctant to make good on this campaign promise. So, it has fallen to Senator MCCAIN to pursue this issue, as he has for several years. 
   The Social Security Earnings Limitation (SSEL) was created during the Depression in order to move older workers out of the labor force and to create job opportunities for younger workers. Obviously, this situation no longer exists. 
   In an effort to address this problem, legislation was enacted in 1996, which I supported, which will raise the Social Security earnings limitation to $30,000 by 2002. However, I believe we must do more. Senator MCCAIN's bill would repeal the entire limitation immediately. 
   Currently, under the SSEL, senior citizens aged 62 to 64 lose $1 in benefits for every $2 they earn over the $9,600 limit. Seniors aged 65-99 lose $1 in benefits for every $3 they earn over $15,500 annually. When combined with federal and state taxes, a senior citizen earning just over $14,000 per year faces an effective marginal tax rate of 56 percent. 
   However, when combined with the President's tax on Social Security benefits passed in 1993, a senior's marginal tax rate can reach 88 percent--twice the rate millionaires pay! 
   Some lawmakers apparently forget the Social Security is not an insurance policy intended to offset some unforeseen future occurrence; rather, it is a pension with a fixed sum paid regularly to the retirees who made regular contributions throughout their working lives. Social Security is a planned savings program to supplement income during an individual's retirement years.  
   I believe no American should be discouraged from working. Such a policy violates the principles of self-reliance and personal responsibility on which America was founded. Regrettably, American's senior citizens re severely penalized for attempting to be financially independent. When senior citizens work to pay for the high cost of health care, pharmaceuticals and housing, they are penalized like no other group in our society. 
   Senior citizens possess a wealth of experience and expertise acquired through decades of productivity in the work place. Companies hiring seniors have noted their strong work ethic, punctuality, flexibility. Their participation in the workforce can add billions of dollars to our Nation's economy. To remain competitive in the global marketplace, America needs for its senior citizens to be involved in the economy: working, producing, and paying taxes to the federal government. A law which discourages this is not just bad law, it's wrong--and it hurts not only seniors but all Americans. 
   I will work with Senator MCCAIN in the 106th Congress to enact this legislation which will lift the unjust and counterproductive burden from the backs of our senior citizens. 
   .Mr. MCCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators KYL and HELMS to introduce again this year the Senior Citizen's Freedom to Work Act. Our bill would fully repeal the erroneous Social Security Earnings test. 
   Since coming to the Senate in 1987, I have been working to eliminate the discriminatory and unfair earnings test. 
   I am pleased that in 1996, Congress passed and President Clinton signed into law my bill, the Senior Citizens Right to Work Act. This legislation took a step in the right direction by increasing the earning threshold for senior citizens from $11,520 to $30,000 by the year 2002. Now it is time to eliminate the unjust earnings test in its entirety. 
   Most Americans are shocked and appalled when they discover that older Americans are penalized for working. Nobody should be penalized for working or discouraged from engaging in work. Yet, this is exactly what the Social Security earnings test does to our nation's senior citizens. The Social Security earnings test punishes Americans between the ages of 65 and 70 for their attempts to remain productive after retirement. 
   The Social Security earnings test mandates that, for every $3 earned by a retiree over the established limit of $15,500 in 1999, the retiree loses $1 in Social Security benefits. This is clearly age discrimination, and it is very wrong. Due to this cap on earnings, our senior citizens, many of whom exist on fixed, low-incomes, are burdened with a 33.3 percent tax on their earned income. When this is combined with Federal, State, local, and other Social Security taxes, it amounts to an outrageous 55 to 65 percent tax bite or and even higher. 
   This earnings limit is punitive and serves as a tremendous disincentive to work. An individual who is struggling to make ends meet on approximately $15,500 a year should not be faced with an effective marginal tax rate which exceeds 55 percent. 
   The Social Security earnings test is a relic of the Great Depression, designed to move older people out of the workforce and create employment for younger individuals. This is an archaic policy and should no longer be our goal. Many senior citizens can make a significant contribution, and often their knowledge and experience compliments or exceeds that of younger employees. Tens of millions of Americans are over the age of 65, and together they have over a billion years of cumulative work experience. These individuals have valuable experience to offer our society, and we need them. 
   In addition experts predict a labor shortage when the ``baby boom'' generation ages, and it is evident that employers will have to develop new sources of labor as our elderly population continues to grow much faster than the number of workers entering the 
   workforce. According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, ``retaining older workers is a priority in labor intensive industries, and will become even more critical as we approach the year 2000.'' It seems counterproductive and foolish to keep willing, diligent workers out of the American workforce. Our country must continue to support pro-work, not pro-welfare policies. 
   More importantly, many of the older Americans penalized by the earnings test need to work in order to cover their basic expenses: health care, housing and food. Many seniors do not have significant savings or a private pension. For this reason, low-income workers are particularly hard-hit by the earnings test. 
   It is important to note that wealthy seniors, who have lucrative investments, stocks, and substantial savings, are not affected by the earnings limit. Their supplemental ``unearned'' income is not subject to the earnings threshold. The earnings limit only affects seniors who must work and depend on their earned income for survival. 
   Finally, let me stress that repealing the burdensome and unfair earnings test would not jeopardize the solvency of the Social Security funds. Opponents who claim otherwise are engaging in cruel scare tactics. The Social Security benefits which working seniors are losing due to the earnings test penalty are benefits they have rightfully earned by contributing to the system throughout their working years before retiring. These are benefits which they should not be losing because they are trying to survive by supplementing their Social Security income. Furthermore, certain studies indicate that repealing the earnings test would actually result in a net increase of $140 million in federal revenue because more seniors would be earning wages and paying income taxes on these wages. 
   Mr. President, there is no compelling justification for denying economic opportunity to an individual on the basis of age. It is quite evident that the earnings test is outdated, unjust and discriminatory. 
   I am pleased that this Congress will be focusing on the overall structure of the Social Security system and working together for solutions which would strengthen the system for the seniors of today and tomorrow without placing an unfair burden on working Americans. It is absolutely crucial that we include elimination of the unfair earnings test in any Social Security bill we enact this year. 
   I find it encouraging that President Clinton indicated in his State of the Union Address that he is finally ready to address this issue and allow seniors the freedom to work without being unfairly penalized. As many of my colleagues may recall, this was a campaign initiative of President Clinton in 1992 and I am pleased that it appears that we may finally have a bipartisan victory for eliminating this unfair penalty on working seniors in 1999. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to work with me to get this accomplished for America's seniors.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Voter Turnout Enhancement Study (VoTES) Commission Act, a bill designed to promote fiscal responsibility while helping to motivate more Americans to get to the polls on Election Day. 
   Mr. President, when we balanced the unified budget last year, we did so by taxing and spending at a level of about $1.72 trillion. That is a level of spending that is 25 percent higher than when President Clinton took office just six years ago. Our government now spends the equivalent of $6,700 for every man, woman, and child in the country every year. That is the equivalent of nearly $27,000 for the average family of four. But all of that spending comes at a tremendous cost to hard-working taxpayers. 
   The Tax Foundation estimates that the medium income family in America saw its combined federal, state, and local tax bill climb to 37.6 percent of income in 1997--up from 37.3 percent the year before. That is more than the average family spends on food, clothing, shelter, and transportation combined. Put another way, in too many families, one parent is working to put food on the table, while the other is working almost full time just to pay the bill for the government bureaucracy. 
   In fact, the tax burden imposed on the American people hit a peacetime high of 19.8 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 1997 and, according to the Congressional Budget Office, is continuing to rise--to 20.5 percent in 1998 and 20.6 percent in 1999. That will be higher than any year since 1945, and it would be only the third and fourth years in our nation's entire history that revenues have exceeded 20 percent of national income. Notably, the first tow times revenues broke the 20 percent mark the economy tipped into recession. 
   Already, economists are beginning to project slower economic growth in coming years. Barring any further shocks from abroad, growth for 1999 to 2003 is estimated at about two percent. The heavy tax burden may not be the only reasons for slow growth, but it is a significant factor. Consider that economic growth avenged 3.9 percent annually during the period after the Reagan tax cuts and before the 1990 tax increase. 
   I am convinced that the tax burden is growing, in part, because so much of it is obscured from the view of the taxpayers. Withholding, for example, reduces the visibility and minimizes the pain of making large tax payments. FICA taxes paid by an employer on behalf of an employee never show up on a worker's pay stub at all, even though they reduce wages dollar for dollar. By the time Election Day could hardly be farther away from April 15. 
   If the visibility of the tax burden were increased, people might be more inclined to get to the polls. Move the deadline for filing income-tax returns from April to November and we could give people a reason to vote by focusing their attention on the role of government--and how much it actually costs them--on the single most important day of the year. Moving Tax Day to Election Day would probably result in more change in Washington than anything else we could do. Moreover, maximizing voter turnout is the best way to ensure that government officials heed the will of the people and make sound public policy. 
   The bill I am introducing today would provide for a thoughtful and thorough analysis of a change in the tax-filing deadline from April to November, it potential effect on voter turnout, as well as any economic impact it might have. The bill explicitly requires that an independent commission conduct a cost-benefit analysis--a requirement that Congress would be wise to impose routinely on legislative initiatives to separate the good ideas from the bad, and save taxpayers a lot of money in the process. A number other cost limiting provisions have been included to protect taxpayers' interests. 
   While just about every day of the year is celebrated by special interest groups around the country for the government largesee they receive, the taxpayers--the silent majority--have only one day of the year to focus on what that largesse means to them--how much it costs them--and that is Tax Day. I believe that it ought to coincide with Election Day so people can clearly choose between candidates who support higher taxes and more government control, and candidates who favor lower taxes and the right of people to decide for themselves how to spend their own money.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, today I introduce a series of bills designed to help sustain the economic expansion and enhance the rate of economic growth in this country. The four measures, which together make up what I refer to as the Agenda for Economic Growth and Opportunity, will help encourage investment in small businesses, enhance the wages of American workers, and make our country more competitive in the global economy. 
   Mr. President, it was just over 36 years ago that President John F. Kennedy made the following observation in his State of the Union message--an observation that someone could just as easily make about today's economy. He said, ``America has enjoyed 22 months of uninterrupted economic recovery.''  The current expansion, albeit weaker than most during this century, has gone on somewhat longer. ``But,'' President Kennedy went on to say, ``recovery is not enough. If we are to prevail in the long run, we must expand the long-run strength of our economy. We must move along the path to a higher rate of economic growth.'' 
   Economic growth. The concept is studied endlessly by economists and statisticians, but what does it mean for the average American family, and why should policy-makers be so concerned about it? 
   For most of the 20th century, our nation enjoyed very strong rates of economic growth and the dividends that came with it. The 1920s saw annual economic growth above five percent. In the 1950s, it was above six percent. Economic growth during the Kennedy and Johnson years averaged 4.8 percent annually. During the years after the Reagan tax cuts and before the 1990 tax increase, the economy grew at an average rate of 3.9 percent a year, according to data supplied by the Joint Economic Committee. 
   The Clinton years, by contrast, have actually seen the economy grow at a much slower rate--an average rate of only about 2.3 percent a year. And recent estimates by the Congressional Budget Office project that the growth of real Gross Domestic Product is likely to slow to just over two percent for the last part of 1998 and the early part of 1999. What that means is that, while we may not exactly be hurting as a nation, we are not becoming much better off, either. We are certainly not leaving much of a legacy for our children and grandchildren to meet the needs of tomorrow. 
   Slower growth means fewer job opportunities in the days ahead for young Americans just entering the workforce and for those people seeking to free themselves from the welfare rolls. It means stagnant wages and salaries, and fewer opportunities for career advancement for those who do have jobs. It means less investment in new plants and equipment, and new technology--things needed to enhance productivity and ensure that American businesses can remain competitive in the global marketplace. 
   So what do we do to spur economic growth--to ensure that jobs will continue to be available for those who want them, that families can earn better wages, and that American business maintains a dominant role in the global economy? Those are, after all, the goals of the agenda I am laying out today--an agenda for economic growth and opportunity for all Americans, for those struggling to make ends meet today, and for our children when they enter the workforce tomorrow. 
   Let me begin my answer with another quotation from John Kennedy:  
   ``[I]t is increasingly clear--to those in Government, business, and labor who are responsible for our economy's success--that our obsolete tax system exerts too heavy a drag on private purchasing power, profits, and employment. Designed to check inflation in earlier years, it now checks growth instead. It discourages extra effort and risk. It distorts use of resources. It invites recurrent recessions, depresses our Federal revenues, and causes chronic budget deficits.''  
   Mr. President, although we managed to balance the unified budget last year, there is still much in what President Kennedy said that is relevant to our situation today. Consider, for example, that we balanced the budget by taxing and spending at a level of about $1.72 trillion--a level of spending that is 25 percent higher than when President Clinton took office just six years ago. Our government now spends the equivalent of $6,700 for every man, woman, and child in the country every year. That is the equivalent of nearly $27,000 for the average family of four. But all of that spending comes at a tremendous cost to hard-working taxpayers. As President Kennedy put it, it is a drag on private purchasing power, profits, and employment. 
   The Tax Foundation estimates that the median income family in America saw its combined federal, state, and local tax bill climb to 37.6 percent of income in 1997--up from 37.3 percent the year before. That is more than the average family spends on food, clothing, shelter, and transportation combined. Put another way, in too many families, one parent is working to put food on the table, while the other is working almost full time just to pay the bill for the government bureaucracy. 
   Perhaps a different measure of how heavy a tax burden the federal government is imposing--how big is the drag on the economy--would be helpful here. Consider that federal revenues hit a peacetime high of 19.8 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 1997 and, according to the Congressional Budget Office, will continue to climb--to 20.5 percent in 1998 and 20.6 percent in 1999. That will be higher than any year since 1945, and it would be only the third and fourth years in our nation's entire history that revenues have exceeded 20 percent of national income. Notably, the first two times revenues broke the 20 percent mark, the economy tipped into recession. 
   Mr. President, the agenda I am proposing attacks some of the most significant deficiencies in our nation's Tax Code that are inhibiting savings and investment, and job creation--deficiencies that keep us from reaching our potential as a nation. I do not make these proposals as a substitute for fundamental tax reform or an across-the-board reduction in income-tax rates, which I believe are the ultimate solutions to the problem. But fundamental tax reform is going to take some time to accomplish, maybe several years. And I am not convinced that President Clinton will ever agree to an across-the-board reduction in tax rates. Therefore, what we need now are interim steps--things we can do quickly--to make sure our movement into the 21st century is based on the bedrock of a strong and growing economy. 
   These Tax Code changes will help strengthen the economy and, in turn, produce more revenue for the federal government to help keep the budget balanced. Recent experience proves that it is a strong and growing economy--not high tax rates--that generates substantial amounts of new revenue for the Treasury. It was the growing economy that helped eliminate last year's unified budget deficit. 
   Mr. President, the first of the four tax-related bills I am introducing is based primarily upon President John Kennedy's own growth package from three decades ago. Like the Kennedy plan, the legislation would reduce the percentage of long-term capital gains included in individual income subject to tax to 30 percent. It would reduce the alternative tax on the capital gains of corporations to 22 percent. 
   I would note that Democratic President John Kennedy's plan called for a deeper capital gains tax cut than the Republican-controlled Congress passed in 1997. 
   There was a reason that John Kennedy called for a significant cut in the capital gains tax. ``The present tax treatment of capital gains and losses is both inequitable and a barrier to economic growth,'' the President said. ``The tax on capital gains directly affects investment decisions, the mobility and flow of risk capital from static to more dynamic situations, the ease or difficulty experienced by new ventures in obtaining capital, and thereby the strength and potential for growth of the economy.'' 
   So if we are concerned whether new jobs are being created, whether new technology is developed, whether workers have the tools they need to do a better, more efficient job, we should support measures that reduce the cost of capital to facilitate the achievement of all these things. Remember, for every employee, there is an employer who took risks, made investments, and created jobs. But that employer needed capital to start. Economist Allen Sinai estimates that a capital-gains tax reduction would help businesses create as many as 500,000 new jobs. 
   A capital-gains tax reduction would provide critical help to the country's entrepreneurs, especially those striving to open their own small businesses or grow their businesses. Small business is, after all, that engine that drives the nation's economy. In Arizona, about half of those businesses are run by women. An estimated 130,000 women-owned businesses in the state employ more than 330,000 people. These are precisely the kind of firms that have difficulty securing the capital they need to expand. High capital-gains taxes are one reason why. 
   Mr. President, it may come as a surprise to some people, but experience shows that lower capital-gains tax rates help not only small businesses and the economy, but federal revenues  as well. The most impressive evidence, as noted in a recent report by the American Council for Capital Formation, can be found in the period from 1978 to 1985. During those years, the top marginal federal tax rate on capital gains was cut significantly--from 35 percent to 20 percent--but total individual capital gains tax receipts nearly tripled--from $9.1 billion to $26.5 billion annually. 
   Data from the National Bureau of Economic Research indicates that the maximizing capital gains tax rate--that is, the rate that would bring in the most Treasury revenue--is somewhere between nine and 21 percent. The Joint Economic Committee estimates that the optimal rate is probably 15 percent or less. The bill I am introducing today would set an effective top rate on capital gains earned by individuals, by virtue of the 70 percent exclusion, at 11.88 percent. 
   Mr. President, when capital gains tax rates are too high, people need only hold onto their assets to avoid the tax indefinitely. No sale, no tax. But that means less investment, fewer new businesses and new jobs, and--as historical surveys show--far less revenue to the Treasury than if capital gains taxes were set at a lower level. Just as the local department store does not lose money on weekend sales--because volume more than makes up for lower prices--lower capital gains tax rates can encourage more economic activity and, in turn, produce more revenue for the government. 
   Capital gains reform will help the Treasury. A capital gains tax reduction would help unlock a sizable share of the estimated $7 trillion of capital that is left virtually unused because of high tax rates. More importantly, it will help the family that has a small plot of land it would like to sell, or a small business that would like to expand, buy new equipment, and create new jobs. 
   Moreover, evidence shows that most of the tax savings will go to Americans of modest means. According to Internal Revenue Service data, almost 53 percent of taxpayers reporting capital gains had adjusted gross incomes of less than $50,000. Another 28 percent have AGIs between $50,000 and $100,000. 
   Nearly two years ago, this Congress reduced capital gains taxes, but it did so in a way that added substantially to the complexity of the Tax Code. And, in my view, it did not cut the tax rate enough. John Kennedy's idea--that is, simply providing a 70 percent exclusion--was a superior approach, and that is what I am proposing today. 
   Mr. President, the second part of this bill proposes a similar exclusion for dividend income. The rationale is twofold: first, to further encourage saving and investment; and second, to eliminate any bias in the Tax Code that might favor investments whose returns are paid primarily in capital gains over those that pay dividends. With recent reductions in the capital-gains tax, there may now be more incentive to invest in instruments that produce earnings taxed at the low capital-gains rate, as opposed to investing for dividends which are taxed at the regular, higher income-tax rate. My bill proposes to put dividend income on par with capital gains for purposes of levying an income tax. 
   The exclusion for dividend income would also go a long way toward eliminating the double taxation of such income, which is currently taxed once at the corporate level and then again when it is provided to investors in the form of dividends. A report by the American Council for Capital Formation notes that dividend income is taxed more heavily in the United States than in most other industrialized countries. The Council indicates that dividend income is subject to a U.S. tax rate of 60.4 percent, compared to an average of 51.1 percent abroad. This high rate is due to the double taxation of dividend income. 
   Mr. President, the second in this series of bills is the Corporate Tax Equity Act, a bill designed to help U.S. businesses make larger capital expenditures and 
   thereby enhance productivity and job creation by repealing the corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT). 
   Mr. President, the original intent of the AMT was to make it harder for large, profitable corporations to avoid paying any federal income tax. But the way to have accomplished that objective was not, in my view, to impose an AMT, but to identify and correct the provisions of law that allowed large companies to inappropriately lower their federal tax liabilities to begin with. Ironically, the primary shelters corporations were using to minimize their tax liability--that is, the accelerated depreciation and safe harbor leasing of the old Tax Code--were being corrected at the time the AMT was enacted. 
   I would point out that the AMT is not a tax, per se. As indicated in an April 3, 1996 report by the Congressional Research Service, the AMT is merely intended to serve as a prepayment of the regular corporate income tax, not a permanent increase in overall corporate tax liability. What that means in practical terms is that businesses are forced to make interest-free loans to the federal government under the guise of the AMT. Corporations pay a tax for which they are not liable, but which they are able to apply toward their future regular tax liability. 
   I would also point out that most of the corporations paying the AMT are relatively small. The General Accounting Office, in a 1995 report on the issue, found that, in most years between 1987 and 1992, more than 70 percent of corporations paying the AMT had less than $10 million in assets. 
   The AMT requires corporations to calculate their tax liability under two separate but parallel income-tax systems. Firms must calculate their AMT liability even if they end up paying the regular tax. At a minimum, that means that firms must maintain two sets of records for tax purposes. 
   The compliance costs are substantial. In 1992, for example, while only about 28,000 corporations paid the AMT, more than 400,000 corporations filed the AMT form, and an even greater--but unknown--number of firms performed the calculations needed to determine their AMT liability. A 1993 analysis by the Joint Committee on Taxation found that the AMT added 16.9 percent to a corporation's total cost of complying with federal income tax laws. 
   Mr. President, repealing the corporate AMT would help free up badly needed capital to assist in business expansion and job creation. According to a study by DRI/McGraw-Hill, AMT repeal would have increased fixed investment by a total of 7.9 percent, raised Gross Domestic Product by 1.6 percent, and increased labor productivity by 1.6 percent between 1996 and 2005. The study also projected that repeal would produce an additional 100,000 jobs a year during the years 1998 to 2002. 
   Mr. President, the third bill in this package is the Small Business Investment and Growth Act, which would ensure that small businesses do not pay a higher income-tax rate than large corporations. Congressman PHIL CRANE of Illinois has been promoting similar legislation in the House of Representatives. 
   Mr. President, the 1990 and 1993 increases in marginal income-tax rates put a tremendous strain on the nearly two million small businesses around the country that are organized as S corporations. Since these small businesses pay taxes at the individual income-tax rate, they can be subject to rates as high as 39.6 percent--higher than any other corporate entity. By contrast, the top rate imposed on large corporations is only 34 percent. 
   What sense is there in imposing tax rates on small businesses that are higher than those levied on better financed corporations? Estimates indicate that successful American businesses have been able to create three to four new jobs for every additional $100,000 they retain in the business. So higher taxes are counterproductive. They deny small businesses the funds they need to invest in new jobs, new equipment, and new facilities. That hurts small companies. And it hurts the economy. 
   The bill I am introducing today would establish a top rate of 34 percent when a small business reinvests its earnings in its operation, or when the earnings are distributed to the shareholders for the purposes of making tax payments. This lower tax rate would be applicable only to the first $5 million in taxable income of the small business. 
   The bill is a similar, but expanded, version of legislation that I introduced during the 105th Congress. Although the latest version would provide relief to more S corporations, I want to make  it clear that I would prefer to provide tax relief to all businesses. And since taxes paid by businesses are merely passed along in the form of higher prices, we are really talking about providing relief to all consumers. 
   The Small Business Investment and Growth Act represents an important first step toward reducing excessive taxes on small business and encouraging S corporation owners and managers to reinvest income into their businesses, thereby creating more jobs and fueling economic growth. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this measure and reducing the tax burden imposed on America's small businesses. 
   Mr. President, the fourth in the series of economic growth incentives is a bill to repeal the federal estate, or death, tax. 
   Mr. President, it was Ben Franklin who said some 200 years ago that nothing in this world is certain except death and taxes. Leave it to the federal government to find a way to put those two inevitabilities together to create a death tax that is not only confiscatory, but offensive to Americans' sense of fairness, harmful to the environment, and injurious to small business and the economy. 
   Although most Americans will probably never pay a death tax, most people still sense that there is something terribly wrong with a system that allows Washington to seize more than half of whatever is left after someone dies--a system that prevents hard-working Americans from passing the bulk of their nest eggs to their children or grandchildren. The respected liberal Professor of Law at the University of Southern California, Edward J. McCaffrey, put it this way: ``Polls and practices show that we like sin taxes, such as on alcohol and cigarettes.'' ``The estate tax,'' he went on to say, ``is an anti-sin, or a virtue tax. It is a tax on work and savings without consumption, on thrift, on long term savings. There is no reason even a liberal populace need support it.'' 
   Democrat economists Henry Aaron and Alicia Munnell reached similar conclusions, 
   writing in a 1992 study that death taxes ``have failed to achieve their intended purposes. They raise little revenue. They impose large excess burdens. They are unfair.'' 
   In fact, 77 percent of the people responding to a survey by the Polling Company last year indicated that they favor repeal of the death tax. When Californians had the chance to weigh in with a ballot proposition, they voted two-to-one to repeal their state's death tax. The legislatures of five other states have enacted legislation since 1997 that will either eliminate or significantly reduce the burden of their states' death taxes. 
   Talk to the men and women who run small businesses around the country and you will find that death taxes are a major concern to them. The 1995 White House Conference on Small Business identified the death tax as one of small business's top concerns, and delegates to the conference voted overwhelming to endorse its repeal. 
   Remember, this is a tax that is imposed on a family business at the moment when it is least able to afford the payment--upon the death of the person with the greatest practical and institutional knowledge of that business's operations. It should come as no surprise, then, that a 1993 study by Prince and Associates--a Stratford, Connecticut research and consulting firm--found that nine out of 10 family businesses that failed within three years of the principal owner's death attributed their companies' demise to trouble paying the death tax. Six out of 10 family-owned businesses fail to make it to the second generation. The death tax is a major reason why. 
   Think of what that means to women and minority-owned businesses in particular. Instead of passing a hard-earned and successful business on to the next generation, many families have to sell the company in order to pay the death tax. The upward mobility of such families is stopped in its tracks. The proponents of this tax always speak of the need to hinder ``concentrations of wealth.'' What the tax really hinders is new American success stories. 
   Even if a family does not have to sell its business to pay the death tax, there are still significant costs that are imposed either directly or indirectly. Some people simply take preemptive action--they slow the growth of their businesses to limit their death-tax burden. Of course, that means less investment in our communities and fewer jobs created. Others divert money they would have spent on new equipment or new hires to insurance policies designed to cover death-tax costs. Still others spend millions on lawyers, accountants, and other advisors for death-tax planning purposes. But that leaves fewer resources to invest in the company, start up new businesses, hire additional people, or pay better wages. 
   What that suggests to me is that, although the death tax raises only about one percent of the federal government's annual revenue, it exerts a disproportionately large and negative impact on the economy. Alicia Munnell, who belonged to President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisors, estimates that the costs of complying with death-tax laws are of roughly the same magnitude as the revenue raised, or about $23 billion in 1998. In other words, for every dollar of tax revenue raised by the death tax, another dollar is squandered in the economy simply to comply with or avoid the tax. 
   Over time, the adverse consequences are compounded. A report issued by the Joint Economic Committee just last month concluded that the existence of the death tax this century has reduced the stock of capital in the economy by nearly half a trillion dollars. 
   By repealing it and putting those resources to better use, the Joint Committee estimates that as many as 240,000 jobs could be created over seven years and Americans would have an additional $24.4 billion in disposable personal income. 
   Is it not better to encourage the creation of new jobs for tax-paying Americans than to impose a tax that puts people out of work or lowers their income? I think so, and that is why I favor repeal of the death tax. 
   Mr. President, I suggested a moment ago that the death tax had a harmful effect, not only on the economy, but on the environment, as well. That is something that we need to consider here. An increasing number of families that own environmentally sensitive lands are having to sell the property for development in order to pay the death tax. Natural habitats are being destroyed as a result. With that in mind, Michael Bean of The Nature Conservancy observed that the death tax is ``highly regressive in the sense that it encourages the destruction of ecologically important land.'' It represents a real and present threat to endangered and threatened species and their habitats. 
   Mr. President, let me conclude by citing the report issued a few years ago by the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform, because it goes back to the point about fairness in a very poignant way. The Commission concluded that ``[i]t makes little sense and is patently unfair to impose extra taxes on people who choose to pass their assets on to their children and grandchildren instead of spending them lavishly on themselves.'' I agree. The Commission went on to endorse repeal of the death tax. 
   Mr. President, the Agenda for Economic Growth and Opportunity will help keep the economy on track--it will help forestall the recession that some economists predict is on the way. It will help improve the standard of living for all Americans. I invite my colleagues' support for this very important initiative.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Senior Citizens Income Tax Relief Act. This legislation would give seniors relief from the Clinton Social Security tax increase of 1993. I introduced this bill on August 5, 1993, the day this tax was first imposed on America's senior citizens. 
   Senator PETE DOMENICI, Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, recently predicted that the federal government would generate a budget surplus of up to $700 billion over the next 10 years. He proposed that roughly $600 billion of this surplus be used to fund a tax cut. I could not agree more. I will be working with Senator DOMENICI and members of the Senate on both sides of the aisle to ensure that there will be sufficient room in this surplus for Social Security tax relief for senior citizens. 
   Millions of America's senior citizens depend on Social Security as a critical part of their retirement income. Having paid into the program throughout their working lives, retirees count on the government to meet its obligations under the Social Security contract. For many, the security provided by this supplemental pension plan is the difference between a happy and healthy retirement and one marked by uncertainty and apprehension, particularly for the vast majority of seniors on fixed incomes. 
   As part of his massive 1993 tax hike, President Clinton imposed a tax increase on senior citizens, subjecting to taxation up to 85 percent of the Social Security received by seniors with annual incomes of over $34,000 and couples with over $44,000 in annual income. 
   This represents a 70 percent increase in the marginal tax rate for these seniors. Factor in the government's ``Social Security Earnings Limitation,'' and a senior's marginal tax rate can reach 88 percent--twice the rate paid by millionaires. 
   An analysis of government-provided figures on the 1993 Social Security tax increase finds that, at the end of 1998, America's seniors have paid an extra $25 billion because of this tax hike, including $380 million from senior citizens in Arizona alone. 
   Mr. President, I want to make an additional important point. Despite all the partisan demagoguery, the only attack on Social Security in recent years has come from the administration and the other party in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. Not one Republican supported this tax increase on Social Security benefits. 
   If the administration opposes any meaningful tax cut, the relief we will be able to provide will be limited. It will be difficult, then, to repeal the Social Security tax increase. This is why, in the 105th Congress, I offered an amendment to ensure that we are able to expand tax relief in the future, and why the first tax relief proposal I am introducing in the 106th Congress will repeal President Clinton's 1993 Social Security tax increase.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to introduce an education proposal that will increase parental and student choice, educational quality, and school safety. 
   A colleague from the Arizona delegation, representative MATT SALMON, is today introducing this proposal in the House of Representatives. 
   The ``K through 12 Community Participation Act'' would offer tax credits to families and businesses of up to $250 annually for qualified K through 12 education expenses or activities. 
   Over the last 30 years, Americans have steadily increased their monetary  commitment to education. Unfortunately, we have not seen a corresponding improvement in the quality of the education our children receive. Given our financial commitment, and the great importance of education, these results are unacceptable. 
   Mr. President, I believe the problem is not how much money is spent, but how it is spent, and by whom. 
   The K through 12 Community Participation Act addresses the problem of falling education standards by giving families and businesses a tax incentive to provide children with a higher quality education through choice and competition. 
   The problem of declining education standards is illustrated by a 1998 report released by the Education and Workforce Committee of the House of Representatives, Education at the Crossroads. This is the most comprehensive review of federal education programs ever undertaken by the United States Congress. It shows that the federal government's response to the decline in American schools has been to build bigger bureaucracies, not a better education system. 
   According to the report, there are more than 760 federal education programs overseen by at least 39 federal agencies at a cost of $100 billion a year to taxpayers. These programs are overlapping and duplicative. 
   For example, there are 63 separate (but similar) math and science programs, 14 literacy programs, and 11 drug-education programs. Even after accounting for recent streamlining efforts, the U.S. Department of Education still requires over 48.6 million hours worth of paperwork per year--this is the equivalent of 25,000 employees working full time. 
   States get at most seven percent of their total education funds from the federal government, but most states report that roughly half of their paperwork is imposed by federal education authorities. 
   The federal government spends tax dollars on closed captioning of ``educational'' programs such as ``Baywatch'' and Jerry Springer's squalid daytime talk show. 
   With such a large number of programs funded by the federal government, it's no wonder local school authorities feel the heavy hand of Washington upon them. 
   And what are the nation's taxpayers getting for their money? According to the report, 
   Around 40 percent of fourth graders cannot read; and 57 percent of urban students score below their grade level. 
   Half of all students from urban school districts fail to graduate on time, if at all. 
   U.S. 12th graders ranked third from the bottom out of 21 nations in mathematics. 
   According to U.S. manufacturers, 40 percent of all 17-year-olds do not have the math skills to hold down a production job at a manufacturing company. 
   The conclusion of the Education at the Crossroads report is that the federally designed ``one-size-fits-all'' approach to education is simply not working. 
   Mr. President, I believe we need a federal education policy that will: 
   Give parents more control. 
   Give local schools and school boards more control. 
   Spend dollars in the classrooms, not on a Washington bureaucracy. 
   Reaffirm our commitment to basic academics. 
   My state of Arizona has led the way with education tax credit legislation passed in 1997. This state law provides tax credits that can be used by parents and businesses to cover certain types of expenses attendant to primary and secondary education. 
   Mr. President, today, Representative SALMON and I are reintroducing a form of the Arizona education tax-credit law. 
   The K through 12 Community Participating Education Act would be phased in over four years and would encourage parents, businesses, and other members of the community to invest in our children's education. 
   Specifically, it offers every family or business a tax credit of up to $250 annually for any K through 12 education expense or activity. This tax credit could be applied to home schooling, public schools (including charter schools), or parochial schools. Allowable expenses would include tuition, books, supplies, and tutors. 
   Further, the tax credit could be given to a ``school-tuition organization'' for distribution. To qualify as a school-tuition organization, the organization would have to devote at least 90 percent of its income per year to offering available grants and scholarships for parents to use to send their children to the school of their choice. 
   How would this work? A group of businesses in any community could join forces to send sums for which they received tax credits to charitable ``school-tuition organizations'' which would make scholarships and grants available to low income parents of children currently struggling to learn in unsafe, non-functional schools. 
   Providing all parents--including low income parents--increased freedom to choose will foster competition and increase parental involvement in education. 
   Insuring this choice will make the federal education tax code more like Arizona's. It is a limited but important step the Congress and the President can--and I believe, must--take. 
   Mr. President, it's clear that top-down, one-size fits all, big government education policy has failed our children and our country. 
   This tax-credit legislation will refocus our efforts on doing what is in the best interests of the child as determined by parents, and will give parents and businesses the opportunity to take an important step to rescue American education so that we can have the educated citizenry that Thomas Jefferson said was essential to our health as a nation.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and Senators ABRAHAM, ALLARD, ASHCROFT, BROWNBACK, COVERDELL, CRAPO, FRIST, GRAMM, GRAMS, HAGEL, HELMS, HUTCHISON, INHOFE, MACK, MCCONNELL, SESSIONS, SHELBY, SMITH of New Hampshire, and THOMPSON, to introduce the Tax Limitation Amendment, a joint resolution that proposes to amend the Constitution to require a two-thirds vote of the House and Senate to raise taxes. 
   Mr. President, this is an idea that comes to us from the states. Voters from around the country have approved similar restrictions in recent years--doing so in most cases by overwhelming margins. Most recently, a solid majority of Montana voters approved an amendment to their state's constitution that requires voter approval of all new taxes and tax increases. That is a far stronger constraint than what is being proposed here. 
   By overwhelming majorities, voters in Arkansas, Maryland, and Virginia upheld their states tax-limitation initiatives, rejecting ballot propositions on November 3 last year that were designed to water down existing constraints on tax increases. 
   Two years ago, also by overwhelming majorities, voters from Florida to California approved initiatives aimed at limiting government's ability to raise taxes. Florida's Question One, which requires a two-thirds vote of the people to enact or raise any state taxes or fees, passed with 69.2 percent of the vote. 
   Seventy percent of Nevada voters approved the Gibbons amendment, requiring a two-thirds majority vote of the state legislature to pass new taxes or tax hikes. South Dakotans easily approved an amendment requiring either a vote of the people or a two-thirds vote of the legislature for any state tax increase. 
   And California voters tightened the restrictions in the most famous tax limitation of all, Proposition 13, so that all taxes at the local level now have to be approved by a vote of the people. Of course, voters in my home state of Arizona overwhelmingly approved a state tax limit of their own in 1992. 
   The Tax Limitation Amendment I am introducing today would impose similar constraints on federal tax-raising authority. It would require a two-thirds majority vote of each house of Congress to pass any bill levying a new tax or increasing the rate or base of any existing tax. In short, any measure that would take more out of the taxpayers' pockets would require a supermajority vote to pass. 
   I would note that the proposed amendment includes provisions that would allow Congress to waive the supermajority vote requirement in times of war, or when the United States is engaged in military conflict which causes an imminent and serious  threat to national security. But to ensure that such waiver authority is truly reserved for such emergencies and is not abused, any new taxes imposed under a waiver could only remain in effect for a maximum of two years. 
   Mr. President, why is a tax-limitation amendment necessary? 
   The two largest tax increases in our nation's history were enacted earlier this decade by only the slimmest of margins. In fact, President Clinton's 1993 tax increase did not even win the support of a majority of Senators. Vice President GORE broke a 50 to 50 vote tie to secure its passage. 
   Despite very modest efforts to cut taxes in the last few years, the effects of the record-setting tax increases of 1990 and 1993 are still being felt today. The tax burden imposed on the American people hit a peacetime high of 19.8 percent of GDP in 1997 and, according to the Congressional Budget Office, is continuing to rise--to 20.5 percent in 1998 and 20.6 in 1999. That will be higher than any year since 1945, and it would be only the third and fourth years in our nation's entire history that revenues have exceeded 20 percent of national income. Notably, the first two times revenues broke the 20 percent mark, the economy tipped into recession. 
   Already, economists are beginning to project slower economic growth in coming years. Barring any further shocks from abroad, growth for 1999 to 2003 is estimated at about two percent. In fact, growth during the high-tax Clinton years has averaged only about 2.3 percent annually. That compares to the 3.9 percent annual growth rate during the period after the Reagan tax cuts and before the 1990 tax increase. The heavy tax burden may not be the only reason for slow growth, but it is a significant factor. 
   With that in mind, I believe the President and Congress should consider reducing income-tax rates across the board for all Americans. We will no doubt have that debate about the need for tax relief in coming months. But whether we agree to cut taxes or not, we--the President and Congress--should be able to agree that taxes are high enough and should not be raised further, at least not without the kind of significant, broad-based and bipartisan support that would be required under the Tax Limitation Amendment. 
   Raising sufficient revenue to pay for government's essential operation is obviously a necessary part of governing, but raising tax rates is not necessarily the best way to raise revenue. As recent experience proves, it is a strong and growing economy--not high tax rates--that generates substantial amounts of new revenue for the Treasury. It was the growing economy that helped eliminate last year's unified budget deficit. 
   In any event, voters around the country seem to believe that raising taxes should only be done when there is broad support for the proposition. The TLA will ensure that no tax can be raised in the future without such consensus.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, to ensure that crime victims are treated with fairness, dignity, and respect, I rise to introduce, along with Senator FEINSTEIN, a resolution proposing a constitutional amendment to establish and protect the rights of victims of violent crime. I would like to update the members on the latest form of the Crime Victims Rights Amendment and outline our plans for the 106th Congress. 
   This joint resolution is the product of extended discussions with House Judiciary Committee Chairman HENRY HYDE, Senators HATCH and BIDEN, the Department of Justice, the White House, law enforcement officials, major victims' rights groups, and such diverse scholars as Professors Larry Tribe and Paul Cassell. As a result of these discussions, the core values in the original amendment remain unchanged, but the language has been refined to better protect the interest of all parties. 
   Before I discuss the amendment in detail, I would like to thank Senator FEINSTEIN for her efforts to advance the cause of crime victims' rights and for her very valuable work on the language of the amendment. She has been a tireless and invaluable advocate for the amendment. 
   Mr. President, the scales of justice are imbalanced. The U.S. Constitution, mainly through amendments, grants those accused of crime many constitutional rights, such as a speedy trial, a jury trial, counsel, the right against self-incrimination, the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures, the right to subpoena witnesses, the right to confront witnesses, and the right to due process under the law. 
   The Constitution, however, guarantees no rights to crime victims. For example, victims have no right to be present, no right to be informed of hearings, no right to be heard at sentencing or at a parole hearing, no right to insist on reasonable conditions of release to protect the victim, no right to restitution, no right to challenge unending delays in the disposition of their case, and no right to be told if they might be in danger from release or escape of their attacker. This lack of rights for crime victims has caused many victims and their families to suffer twice, once at the hands of the criminal, and again at the hands of a justice system that fails to protect them. The Crime Victim Rights Amendment is a constitutional amendment that would bring balance to the judicial system by giving crime victims the rights to be informed, present, and heard at critical stages throughout their ordeal--the least the system owed to those it failed to protect. 
   Mr. President, the current version, which is the 62d draft of the amendment, contains the rights that we believe victims should have: 
   The amendment gives victims the rights: 
   To be notified of the proceedings; 
   To attend all public proceedings; 
   To be heard at certain crucial stages in the process; 
   To be notified of the offender's release or escape; 
   To consideration for a trial free from unreasonable delay; 
   To an order of restitution; 
   To have the safety of the victim considered in determining a release from custody; and 
   To be notified of these rights and standing to enforce them. 
   These rights are the core of the amendment.  
   Mr. President, if reform is to be meaningful, it must be in the U.S. Constitution. Since 1982, when the need for a constitutional amendment was first recognized by a Presidential Task Force on Victims of Crime, 32 states have passed similar measures--by an average popular vote of about 80 percent. These state measures have materially helped protect crime victims; but they are inadequate for two reasons: First, each amendment is different, and not all states have provided protection to victims; a Federal amendment would establish a basic floor of crime victims' rights for all Americans, just as the Federal Constitution provides for the accused. Second, statutory and State constitutional provisions are always subservient to the Federal Constitution; so, in cases of conflict, the defendants' rights--which are already in the U.S. Constitution--will always prevail. Our amendment will correct this imbalance. 
   It is important to note that the number one recommendation in a recent 400 page report by the Department of Justice on victims rights and services that ``the U.S. Constitution should be amended to guarantee fundamental right for victims of crime.'' The report continued: ``A victims' rights constitutional amendment is the only legal measure strong enough to rectify the current inconsistencies in victims' rights laws that vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction on the State and Federal levels.'' Further, ``Granting victims of crime the ability to participate in the justice system is exactly the type of participatory right the Constitution is designed to protect and has been amendment to permanently ensure. Such rights include the right to vote on an equal basis and the right to be heard when the government deprives one of life, liberty, or property.'' 
   Until crime victims are protected by the United States Constitution, the rights of victims will be subordinate to the rights of the defendant. Indeed, the National Governors Association--by a vote of 49-1--passed a resolution strongly supporting a constitutional amendment for crime victims. The resolution stated: ``Despite ..... widespread State initiatives, the rights of victims do not receive the same consideration or protection as the rights of the accuses. These rights exist on different judicial levels. Victims are relegated to a position of secondary importance in the judicial process.'' The resolution also stated that ``The rights of victims have always received secondary consideration within the U.S. Judicial process, even though States and the American people by a wide plurality consider victims' rights to be fundamental. Protection 
   of these rights is essential and can only come from a fundamental change in our basic law: the U.S. Constitution.'' 
   Some may say, ``I'm all for victims' rights but they don't need to be in the U.S. Constitution. The Constitution is too hard to change. All we need to do is pass some good statutes to make sure that victims are treated fairly.'' But statutes have been inadequate to restore balance and fairness for victims. The history of our country teaches us that constitutional protections are needed to protect the basic rights of the people. Our criminal justice system needs the kind of fundamental reform that can only be accomplished through changes in our fundamental law--the Constitution. 
   Attorney General Reno has confirmed the point, noting that, ``unless the Constitution is amended to ensure basic rights to crime victims, as will never correct the existing imbalance in this country between defendants' constitutional rights and the haphazard patchwork of victims' rights.'' Attempts to establish rights by federal or state statute, or even state constitutional amendment, have proven inadequate, after more then twenty years of trying. 
   On behalf of the Department of Justice, Ray Fisher, the Associate Attorney General, recently testified that ``the state legislative route to change has proven less than adequate in according victims their rights. Rather than form a minimum baseline of protections, the state provisions have produced a hodgepodge of rights that vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Rights that are guaranteed by the Constitution will receive greater recognition and respect, and will provide a national baseline.'' 
   A number of legal commentators have reached similar conclusions. In the 1997 Harvard Law Bulletin, Professor Laurence Tribe has explained that the existing statutes and state amendments ``are likely, as experience to date sadly shows, to provide too little real protection whenever they come into conflict with bureaucratic habit, traditional indifference, sheer inertia, or any mention of an accused's rights regardless of whether those rights are genuinely threatened.'' He has also stated, ``there appears to be a considerable bloody of evidence showing that, even where statutory or regulatory or judge-made rules exist to protect the participatory rights of victims, such rights often tend to be honored in the breach. .....'' 
   Additionally, in the Baylor Law Review, Texas Court of Appeals Justice Richard Barajas has explained that ``[i]t is apparent ..... that state constitutional amendments alone cannot adequately address the needs of crime victims.'' Federal statutes are also inadequate. Professor Cassell's detailed 1998 testimony about the Oklahoma City Bombing Case shows that, as he concluded, ``federal statutes are insufficient to protect the rights of crime victims.'' 
   Mr. President, I was pleased that in July 1998 the Senate Judiciary Committee passed the amendment, S.J. Res. 44, by a bipartisan vote of 11 to 6. The amendment has strong bipartisan support. It was cosponsored by 30 Republicans and 12 Democrats, including leadership members such as Senators LOTT, THURMOND, MACK, COVERDELL, CRAIG, BREAUX, REID, TORRICELLI, and Ford (now retired). 
   In the 106th Congress, Senator FEINSTEIN and I will work hard to ensure the amendment's passage. We plan to hold a hearing early in the Congress, followed by a markup and consideration by the full Senate. We welcome comments and suggestions from Members and other interested parties. 
   Again, I would like to thank Senator DIANNE FEINSTEIN for her hard work on this amendment and for her tireless efforts on behalf of crime victims. Mr. President, for far to long, the criminal justice system has ignored crime victims who deserve to be treated with fairness, dignity, and respect. Our criminal justice system will never be truly just as long as criminals have rights and victims have none.

   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Balanced Budget/Spending Limitation Amendment--a joint resolution proposing to amend the Constitution of the United States to establish both a federal spending limit and a requirement that the federal government maintain a balanced budget. 
   Mr. President, it seems to me that although we may have succeeded in balancing the unified budget, we still have two very different visions of where we should be headed. Is a balanced budget the paramount goal, even if it comes with substantially higher taxes and more spending? Or is the real goal of a balanced budget to be more responsible with people's hard-earned tax dollars--to limit government's size and give people more choices and more control over their lives? Before we try to answer those questions, let us try to give them some context. 
   When we balanced the unified budget last year, we did so by taxing and spending at a level of about $1.72 trillion. That is a level of spending that is 25 percent higher than when President Clinton took office just six years ago. Our government now spends the equivalent of $6,700 for every man, woman, and child in the country every year. That is the equivalent of nearly $27,000 for the average family of four. But all of that spending comes at a tremendous cost to hard-working taxpayers. 
   The Tax Foundation estimates that the median income family in America  saw its combined federal, state, and local tax bill climb to 37.6 percent of income in 1997--up from 37.3 percent the year before. That is more than the average family spends on food, clothing, shelter, and transportation combined. Put another way, in too many families, one parent is working to put food on the table, while the other is working almost full time just to pay the bill for the government bureaucracy. 
   Perhaps a different measure of how heavy a tax burden the federal government imposes would be helpful. Consider that federal revenues hit a peacetime high of 19.8 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 1997 and, according to the Congressional Budget Office, will continue to climb--to 20.5 percent in 1998 and 20.6 percent in 1999. That will be higher than any year since 1945, and it would be only the third and fourth years in our nation's entire history that revenues have exceeded 20 percent of national income. Notably, the first two times revenues broke the 20 percent mark, the economy tipped into recession. 
   For me, it is not enough to balance the budget if it means that hard-working families continue to be overtaxed. It is not enough to balance the budget if government continues to grow, seemingly without limits, taking choice and freedom away from people in the process. And it is not enough to balance the budget by collecting so much in taxes that it leads the economy into recession. 
   A balanced budget is not the only goal, or even the highest goal. A balanced budget should be the way we find what is the appropriate size and scope of government--the way to make Washington more respectful of hard-working taxpayers' earnings and their desire to do 
   right by themselves and their families. That is where our paramount concern should be--with the taxpayers. 
    Mr. President, last year was the first time in nearly 30 years that Washington managed to balance its books. In fact, we posted a record unified budget surplus of $70 billion, and we did so even though we have no constitutional requirement for a balanced budget. Some will use that fact to argue there is no need for a balanced budget amendment. I would suggest to them that they look back at what happened last October. 
   Just three weeks--exactly 21 days--after confirming that the federal government had indeed achieved its first budget surplus in a generation, Congress passed, and the President signed, a bill that used fully a third of the surplus for increased spending on a variety of government programs other than Social Security, tax relief, or repayment of the national debt. 
   Many people will recall that President Clinton pledged in his State of the Union address a year ago to ``save every penny of any surplus'' for Social Security, yet he was the first in line with a long list of programs to be funded out of the budget surplus. And fearful that if the President did not get his way he would veto the budget and tar Congress with the blame for another government shutdown, many Members of Congress went along and voted for this raid on the surplus. 
   That was just the first in what is expected to be a series of efforts by President Clinton to spend down the surplus in coming months. Another $2.5 billion supplemental spending request is already in the works. 
   Coupled with a peacetime tax burden that is at an all-time high and growing, this portends a dangerous return to the old ways of budget-busting, bigger government--that is, unless we agree to abide by the lasting discipline of a constitutional requirement to balance the budget. 
   The Balanced Budget/Spending Limitation Amendment would impose discipline on Congress and the President in two ways. First, it would require that we maintain a balanced federal budget. Second, consistent with the vision of limited government, it would limit federal spending to 19 percent of the national income, as measured by the Gross Domestic Product. That is roughly the level of revenue collected by the government over the last 40 years. Interestingly, a December 1998 report by the Joint Economic Committee concludes that the optimal level of spending may actually be lower--17.5 percent of GDP. 
   In other words, beyond a certain point--the Joint Committee suggests it is 17.5 percent of GDP--government's claim to private resources can actually hurt the economy. Consider, for example, that economic growth during the high-tax Clinton years has averaged only about 2.3 percent annually, whereas we averaged 3.9 percent annual growth during the period after the Reagan tax cuts and before the 1990 tax increase. 
   Raising sufficient revenue to pay for government's essential operations is obviously a necessary part of governing, but raising tax rates is not necessarily the best way to raise revenue. As recent experience proves, it is a strong and growing economy--not high tax rates--that generates substantial amounts of new revenue for the Treasury. It was the growing economy that helped eliminate last year's unified budget deficit. 
   The advantage of the Balanced Budget/Spending Limitation Amendment is that it keeps our eye on the ball. It tells Congress to limit spending. And by linking spending to economic growth, it gives Congress a positive incentive to enact pro-growth economic and tax policies. Only a healthy and growing economy--measured by GDP--would increase the dollar amount that Congress is allowed to spend, although always proportionate to the size of 
   the economy. In other words, 19 percent of a larger GDP represents more revenue to the Treasury than 19 percent of a smaller GDP.
