 Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks concerning the Auto Choice Reform Act. I am a co-sponsor of this legislation. 
The Auto Choice Act proposes the development of a `no fault compensation system' to provide an option to drivers who do not want to pay for services they do not want and will not use. This legislation would allow for the recovery of economic losses, but not for the recovery of non-economic damages like pain and suffering. Those who choose to stay insured under the tort system would retain the right to sue and be sued for economic and non-economic losses, while those who choose the `no fault' system would be able to sue or be sued for economic damages only. And that is what the Auto Choice Act is really about, Mr. President. Choice for the driving public. 
All drivers are currently insured through a system that requires them to pay for insurance on the assumption that if they are involved in an accident then they will sue or be sued for more than economic damages. The majority of drivers are never involved in a suit for pain and suffering, yet they pay for this coverage every single month. 
Between 1987 and 1994 the cost of automobile insurance increased by 44%. This extraordinary increase was due in large part to excessive claims made by accident victims for pain and suffering, that is, for compensation beyond the costs of automobile damages and medical bills. For every $1 in actual economic loss generated by this system, $3 are paid out for non-economic damages. Rampant abuse of the insurance industry attempts to turn people's misfortune into a sweepstakes. 
This sweepstakes is particularly beneficial for attorneys who collect 40 cents of every dollar paid for bodily injury. Twenty-eight cents from every premium dollar goes to attorneys. According to the Joint Economic Committee, lawyers earn between $15 and $17 billion a year under the current tort system and lawyers on both sides of a dispute make almost two times the amount of money that injured parties receive for actual economic loss. This is abuse of a system that exists to protect people from the genuine financial costs of misfortune and tragedy. 
The Federal Bureau of Investigation estimates that such excessive legal and medical claims, combined with outright fraudulent claims, have added $200 in unnecessary premiums for every household in America. That's a $200 increase for every family--regardless of what type of coverage that family may want. That's $200 that will not be spent on groceries, clothing for children, or tucked away into savings for education. 
This system becomes more inequitable when the burden on low-income and urban drivers is considered. These drivers pay a disproportionate amount of their income for auto insurance. In my home state of Colorado we have the 14th highest insurance rates in the nation. The effects of the high cost of driving in Colorado are particularly noticeable along the more densely populated front range. Last week Denver Mayor Wellington Webb testified before the Senate Commerce Committee concerning the effects of high premium costs on a large urban population. Mayor Webb testified that not only do the urban poor pay a premium disproportionate to their income, but high premium costs can also deter drivers from purchasing insurance at all. Dr. Robert Lee Maril testified to the disproportionate cost of insurance stating that nationally households spend 2% of their annual income on automobile insurance. The upper 50% of people living below the poverty line, however, spend a staggering 14% of their income on automobile insurance. 
Mayor Webb also testified that this is not just an issue for the poor. Middle-income families spend on average 150% more on auto insurance than they do on education, and in the City of Denver alone residents would see their premiums reduced by as much as 40%. 
In July the Joint Economic Committee released a report that demonstrates the benefits of Auto Choice for businesses. In addition to the relief this bill provides for individual drivers, the JEC reports that nearly 40% of all tort cases against businesses are auto-related. The incentives that drive the tort system increase the cost of doing business. In 1994 businesses spent $21 billion on auto liability insurance. Just as families are forced to spend money on high premiums that could be better spent on food or education, businesses are forced to dedicate resources to liability insurance instead of payroll and capital investments. The JEC report concluded that the Auto Choice Act would result in an average 27% savings on commercial auto insurance, potentially saving American businesses $41 billion over five years. 
The Insurance Commissioner from my state of Colorado has endorsed this legislation, however, I realize that in spite of the expected benefits of this legislation, some states prefer their current system. Therefore, this bill provides a choice for the individual states. Under this legislation, state legislatures are able to opt-out of Auto Choice for any reason. Furthermore, the bill clearly states that it will not preclude a State or State Official from fully exercising their regulatory authority concerning policy rates, consumer protection or carrying out the requirements of this act. The Auto Choice Reform Act will leave the ultimate regulation of auto insurance to the states. 
The implementation of The Auto Choice Act would cause the average insurance policy to decrease by $243 annually, saving drivers an estimated $45 billion nationwide. By providing greater choice to the driving public, without cost to the government, the driving public would save $246 billion over five years. That's an enormous savings for simply providing an option to the consumer. This is a bill about choice, it is a bill about savings, and it is a bill about equitable compensation for the American driver.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I wish to thank the conference committee members, and in particular the chairman of the VA/HUD Appropriations Committee, Senator Bond, and the Chairman of the Housing Subcommittee, Senator Mack. I appreciate their working with me to include two provisions in public housing reform language which I feel are important. 
We have worked together to include a provision to allow vouchers for crime victims. This would create an opportunity for individuals who are living in public housing units the chance to leave a bad situation if they are a victim of a crime. 
Public housing residents could receive a housing voucher if they were the victim of a crime of violence that has been reported to law enforcement. 
These individuals would be empowered with the choice of where they want to live and are given the freedom to determine what surroundings they desire. I strongly believe that people should have the option of vouchers when their housing is unsafe. 
We have also included what I hope will be a thorough study by the General Accounting Office of the full costs of each federal housing programs. I have been dismayed by the lack of data on the cost and benefits of public housing, section 8, and voucher programs. We need better data. 
Once we determine what these programs actually cost on a unit by unit basis we can better determine the best approach. I personally prefer vouchers, but I want a complete review of all these programs to help us determine the most cost effective means of providing government assisted housing as we enter the 21st century. 
Again, I would like to thank the chairmen and their staff for completing action on public housing reform legislation and look forward to working with them in the future.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senator Kyl's initiative to provide more choice for our nation's senior citizens. I encourage the majority leader and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Roth to continue to work to address the issue of private contracting so that S. 1194 can be enacted into law. 
I believe that our seniors should have the right to make their own decisions when it comes to matters of their health. Somewhere along the way, it has been mistakenly assumed that once a person reaches 65, they no longer are able to make their own decisions and do not desire the freedom of choice that others enjoy. Since when did the seniors of our nation become so helpless? Shouldn't seniors be afforded the same rights that the rest of us enjoy--to determine what is in their best interest? 
Current law does not permit seniors to purchase their own health care services if those services are covered under Medicare and provided by a physician who accepts Medicare payments. This is ludicrous. Not only does this law take away rights of senior citizens, but these types of regulations within the Medicare system also discourage the participation of doctors. If a physician decides to accept a private contracting fee, the doctor must give up all Medicare patients for two years. In effect, this law has the potential of limiting physicians who participate in the Medicare program. This could consequently decrease the quality of physicians in the Medicare system because doctors refuse to be part of such an oppressive system. 
This issue is one of fundamental rights. No other government program restricts the participants as does Medicare--including Medicaid and health programs for government employees. Medicare beneficiaries should be given the right to pay out-of-pocket and to choose their own health care provider. 
One of the guiding principles of this nation is individual freedom. Congress should not support measures that clearly restrict freedom. I urge the enactment of S. 1194, the Medicare Beneficiaries Freedom to Contract Act.

 Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, now that it seems the debate on campaign finance is over for this session, I wanted to make a few comments concerning the current approach to reform and what I believe would be the best approach. I agree that something needs to be done in fixing the system, but the problem is that the approaches debated this year raise constitutional issues. 
I have supported Congressional reform since entering Congress in 1990, especially term limits. If we want to end the so-called money chase, then lets end the life terms in Congress. Many outside groups who favor campaign finance reform are against term limits for they believe it to be undemocratic. I find quieting peoples voices and stopping them from participating in the electoral process to be even more undemocratic, and probably unconstitutional. 
We have heard that people have become disenchanted with the process. I believe this disenchantment has less to do with the fact that campaigns have become expensive, than they are tired of campaign laws being broken. Let's enforce the laws on the books before we pass more laws and make it even more difficult for citizens to participate. Let's not penalize law abiding citizens because some elected officials will not follow current laws. 
Regarding expensive campaigns, lets take a look at some numbers. When I first came to Congress in 1990, there were 1,759 federal election candidates in the U.S., who raised 471.7 million dollars and spent 446.3 million dollars. This roughly averages to 268,168 dollars raised and 253,753 dollars spent by each federal candidate in the U.S. 
By comparison, in 1996 there were 2,605 federal election candidates which raised 790.5 million dollars and spent 765.3 million dollars. This means that each candidate raised 303,454 dollars and spent 293,781 dollars. 
We can see that spending on campaigns has increased but so has the number of candidates. This influx of new candidates could make some incumbents nervous. But, I say that competition is a positive thing for the electoral system. So, when we hear that there are fewer people who want to run because of the cost of campaigns, we know that this is incorrect according to the Federal Election Commission. 
Yes, fewer incumbents are running for reelection, but more people are trying to replace them in representing their states or districts. 
With overall campaign spending going up, I can understand how some in this body and around the United States find that the cost of campaigns are just too high. However, during my 63 town meetings in 1998, this topic has come up only a few times. But, more and more people are complaining abut taxes being too high. 
Last year, as a percentage of GDP, federal tax revenue reached its highest level since World War II to 19.8% and rising to 19.9% this year. I am much more worried about the working man and woman who must work long hard hours to make ends meet only to find that nearly 40% of their hard earned money must be given to the local, state, and federal government. I think we should give the American people a tax cut. 
My town meetings also indicated that Coloradans are concerned about the national debt and the interest their children and grandchildren will pay. I don't see this getting much attention by the so-called `good government' groups. I am more concerned about the abusive 5.5 trillion dollar debt that we have levied on this nation. Let's pass my bill, S. 1608, the American Debt Repayment Act, and get this burden off the American people's back. 
In regards to campaign finance reform, I believe that reform should pass three tests. First, it should be voluntary; Second, it should be inclusive, not exclusive; And third, it should be constitutional. 
The United States is based on freedom and we have become the model for freedom around the world. However, with freedom comes rights and responsibilities. One of these rights is the ability to join or not to join, to participate or not to participate, to speak or not to speak. The decision to participate should be made by the individual and Congress has the responsibility to preserve this right for all Americans. 
When I ran for the Senate, people participated in my campaign only if they wanted to. They could give either their time or their money. I had to assume that if they did, they did so because they believed in me and the ideas that I stressed. I never forced any person to put out a sign, wear a button, or give a contribution to my campaign, it was always voluntary. 
We need to ensure that any campaign finance reform makes participation a voluntary activity for all individuals. If someone doesn't want to give, they have the right to say no or at least should be able to provide their consent. 
That is why it is important to include the Paycheck Protection Act in any campaign finance reform. I find it confusing at best that we allow labor unions to take money out of a paycheck and use it on political matters without their members expressed written consent. 
According to the Department of Labor, 80 percent, or 8.1 million, of all private sector workers covered by a union contract are required under that contract to pay union dues as a condition of employment, American workers should not have to choose between their jobs which provide the food and clothing or political activity with which they may disagree. I have yet to hear a solid reason how asking people to give their consent to use their required dues for political purposes would hinder a group's ability to participate. 
When I was a small business owner, I was a member of a few groups, but I joined each one voluntarily. I could have removed my name at any time without any threat to my job or well being. Whenever a person is forced to join a group, like those in a closed shop, their dues should never be used for political purposes unless they first state that it is OK to do so. To do less would be deceptive. 
Another problem area is the possibility that the FCC may require free TV time to be provided to federal candidates. 
First, I have never believed that a regulatory agency should act without the authorization of Congress. The Constitution states that `all legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States * * *.' Regulatory agencies only enforce the laws as set by Congress, not make them. 
Second, the American media is a large, vast enterprise. I understand that the broadcasting medium is unique, but I am afraid that this may take us down a slippery slope. How long will it take before we order free space in newspapers and magazines, or free time on cable, or free web sites on the Internet, or free postage for our mailings, just in the name of clean campaigns? 
Lastly, for the states without any major media outlets, such as New Jersey and Delaware, their neighboring states which supply the broadcasting signal will be subsidizing not only their own federal candidates but also the federal candidates of the states that depend on them for the broadcast. Not only do I believe it is wrong for the FCC to implement this without Congressional authorization, but it would force the media to be unwitting volunteers for candidates. 
Freedom must be preserved for all individuals to choose the ideas that they support or oppose. Thomas Jefferson said it best, `To compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves, is sinful and tyrannical.' 
The Supreme Court has been very clear in its decisions regarding the First Amendment and campaign finance laws. Since the post-Watergate changes to the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, twenty-four Congressional actions have been declared unconstitutional, with nine rejections based on the First Amendment. Out of those nine, four dealt directly with campaign finance reform laws. In each case, the Supreme Court has ruled that political spending equals political speech. This Senate attempted to change this through a constitutional amendment limiting the amount one can spend in a campaign, which only tells me that this fact is undeniably recognized by this body. 
The First Amendment is not there to hinder Americans from speaking their ideas, but to ensure that their ideas can be spoken. One way Congress and outside groups speak is through political campaigns, and it is a fact of life that it takes money. After deciding the Valeo vs. Buckley case, former Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall stated that, `One of the points of which all Members of the Court agree is that money is essential for effective communication in a political campaign.' 
When we pull the rug out from underneath people who want to speak their mind, whether they have little or lots of money, we pull the rug out from underneath their basic right to freedom of speech. 
From the much quoted Buckley case, this fact is placed into its proper context. It states, `A restriction on the amount of money a person or group can spend on political communication during a campaign necessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of exploration, and the size of audience reached. This is because virtually every means of communicating ideas in today's mass society requires the expenditure of money.' This encompasses the `distribution of the humblest handbill' to the more `expensive modes of communication' such as radio and television. 
The Court ensures that `a major purpose of the [First] Amendment was to protect the free discussion of governmental affairs' and that any limitations of contributions and/or expenditures `operate in an area of the most fundamental First Amendment activities.' While, the Court found that contribution limits were constitutional up to a certain point, expenditure limits were not. 
The Buckley decision also stated that `* * * the mere growth in the cost of federal election campaigns in and of itself provides no basis for government restrictions on the quantity of campaign spending.' They went further to say, `the First Amendment denies government the power to determine that spending to promote one's political views is wasteful, excessive, or unwise. In the free society ordained by our Constitution, it is not the government, but the people--individually as citizens and candidates and collectively as associations and political committees--who must retain control over the quantity and range of debate on public issues in a political campaign.' 
Simply stated, the government can not ration or regulate the political speech of a citizen through spending limits or limit its quantity any more than it can regulate what newspapers publishes, its circulation, or when it can be printed. 
Which brings me to another point concerning who and how one can spend their money. Our system should not exclude people from expressing their ideas. In the much debated McCain-Feingold bill, there is a provision which would not allow groups to issue ads 60 days before an election. A person or a group's speech is just as valid the day before an election as it is 61 days before. We all have experienced attack ads during a campaign and many times they are very difficult to take. But to quiet them so that a candidate can have an easier time during an election is just flat wrong. Every American should have the opportunity to speak in favor or against any elected official whenever they choose. 
So how can I support legislation which I believe would make our system exclusive, when our 
political process should be inclusive for all citizens who want to speak their minds? I truly do believe it is wrong for me to try and silence people who want to criticize my voting record. That is their right and they should be able to do so whenever they choose and I should be able to defend it whenever I choose and groups that support positions I take should be able to support my position whenever they choose. 
From the beginning, I have believed the 60 day blackout provision to be unconstitutional and a recent case in Michigan shows this to be right. In August, a federal court struck down, on First Amendment grounds, a Michigan election rule prohibited incorporated groups and labor unions from using the names and likeness of political candidates for 45 days before the election. The state argued that the ban should be allowed because it applied `only' to a limited time period and did not apply to PACs and that `the rule does not suffer from constitutional overbreadth because it is content neutral, and is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest in the integrity of the electoral process.' However, the U.S. District Judge Robert Holmes Bell ruled that the ban violated the First Amendment. 
Judge Bell ruled that `[I]n this case the censorial effect of the Rule on issue advocacy is neither speculative nor insubstantial.' He also stated that `[W]hile the time period is short, it could involve a critical time period for communications. . . . A 45-day blackout on using names would protect incumbents seeking re-election from grassroots lobbying efforts on pending legislation, and incumbents would soon learn to schedule votes on controversial legislation during this time period and thus avoid unwanted publicity and attention. . . . The ban on the use of candidates' names is a heavy burden on highly protected First Amendment expression. Voters have an interest in knowing what legislators are associated with pending litigation, an organization's ability to educate the public on pending legislation is unduly hampered if they are unable to name the legislators involved.' 
In conclusion, Judge Bell said, `The mere fact that we are dealing with a corporation rather than an individual does not remove its speech from the ambit of the First Amendment. . . . Because the rule not only prohibits expenditures in support of or in opposition to a candidate, but also prohibits the use of corporate treasury funds for communications containing the name or likeness of a candidate, without regard to whether the communication can be understood as supporting or opposing the candidate, there is a realistic danger that the Rule will significantly compromise the First Amendment protections of not only the Plaintiff, but many other organizations which seek to have a voice in political issue advocacy.' 
I believe Judge Bell's ruling will stand the test of appeal for he stated that any decision regarding the `constitutionality of campaign finance must begin with and usually ends' with the Buckley case. And again, the Buckley decision clearly states that, `. . . the distinction between discussion of issues and candidates and advocacy of election or defeat of candidates may often dissolve in practical application. Candidates, especially incumbents, are intimately tied to public issues involving legislative proposals and governmental actions. Not only do candidates campaign on the basis of their positions on various public issues, but campaigns themselves generate issues of public interest.' 
This clearly states that it is a constitutional right to criticize an elected official and their record, and that no citizen needs to ask permission from the government when and how this can be done. Believe me, I can understand wanting to control the debate of a campaign and silence some of the critics, but I cannot constitutionally, or in good conscience, do that. For every citizen has the right to be a part of the debate. I believe that placing a road block to the First Amendment only closes doors to the system not opens them. 
We will always hear that money is the reason why people don't run or get involved. I can say that I am not a wealthy man. I started a veterinarian hospital with sweat and hard work. When I decided to run for Congress, I didn't have a lot of money, but worked hard to make myself known. When I ran for the Senate, I still wasn't wealthy, but I did run against a wealthy man. When the campaign was over, I had more votes and no campaign debt despite the fact that I was outspent by 750,000 dollars, three-quarter of a million dollars. You don't have to have a lot of money to win a race, just the right message. I will not vote for legislation that I believe would stop someone from speaking their message, even if it's my opponent. 
While I do not believe closing the door on the First Amendment is the right approach, I do believe that opening up the system to fuller and more timely disclosure would provide for a much more robust campaign system. 
This is why I introduced my own bill, the Campaign Finance Integrity Act, S. 1190. My bill does not restrict one from exercising their political speech rights, but asks for complete and honest disclosure of all campaign spending. While this statement is not one of endorsement concerning my legislation, the American Civil Liberties Union did state in a review of the McCain-Feingold bill that, `Disclosure, rather than limitation, of large soft money contributions to political parties, is the more appropriate and less restrictive alternative.' My bill does just that. As a matter of fact, I believe my bill has some of the strongest disclosure requirements of any bill introduced. 
My bill also: 
Requires candidates to raise at least 50 percent of their contributions from individuals in the state or district in which they are running. 
Equalize contributions from individuals and political action committees (PACs) by raising the individual limit from $1000 to $2500 and reducing the PAC limit from $5000 to $2500. 
Indexes individual and PAC contribution limits for inflation. 
Reduces the influence of a candidate's personal wealth by allowing political party committees to match dollar for dollar the personal contribution of a candidate above $5000, by using only 
hard money. 
Requires organizations, groups, and political party committees to disclose within 24 hours the amount and type of independent expenditures over $1,000 in support of or against a candidate. Only the organization discloses it expenditures, not the names of the individual donors. 
Requires corporations and labor organizations to seek separate, voluntary authorization of the use of any dues, initiation fees or payment as a condition of employment for political activity, and requires annual full disclosure of those activities to union members and shareholders. 
Prohibits depositing of an individual contribution by a campaign unless the individual's profession and employer are reported. 
Encourages the Federal Election Commission to allow filing of reports by computers and other emerging technologies and to make that information accessible to the public on the Internet less than 24 hours of receipt. 
Completely bans the use of taxpayer financed mass mailings. 
Lastly, S. 1190 creates a tax deduction for political contributions up to $100 for individuals and $200 for a joint return to encourage small donations. 
Another way to `clean up' the campaign finance system and reduce the so-called special interest money is to reduce the size and scope of the Federal Government and I am not alone in believing this. Last year, Rasmussen Research did a survey showing that 62% of Americans think that reducing government spending would reduce corruption in government. The same survey showed that 44% think that cutting government spending would do more to reduce corruption than campaign finance reform, while 42% think campaign finance reform would reduce corruption more than cutting government spending. I have said many times, if the government rids itself of special interest funding and corporate welfare, then there would be little influence left for these large donors. 
I know that no one in this chamber takes the first amendment lightly. It is the cornerstone by which many of the rights we enjoy today are set. It is there to ensure that the Government does not control us, but that the Government is under control. In 1808, Thomas Jefferson stated what the first amendment should and would mean to each of us--`The liberty of speaking and writing guards our other liberties.' And again in 1828, he said, `The force of public opinion cannot be resisted when permitted to freely be expressed. The agitation it produces must be submitted to.' This is why any campaign finance reform should be reform that preserves the right of free speech and which allows all Americans to voice their opinion.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, this morning there will be a period for morning business until 10 a.m. Following morning business, under a previous order, the Senate will proceed to two stacked rollcall votes. The first vote will be on adoption of the motion to proceed to H.R. 10, the financial services reform bill, followed by a second vote on the motion to invoke cloture on S. 442, which is the Internet tax bill. Assuming cloture is invoked, the Senate will remain on the Internet tax bill with amendments being offered and debated throughout today's session. 
In addition to the Internet tax bill, the Senate may consider the VA-HUD appropriations conference report under a 40-minute time agreement reached last night. The Senate may also consider other available conference reports or any legislative or executive items cleared for action. 
The leader reminds all Members that there are only a few days left in which to consider remaining appropriations bills and other important legislation. Members are encouraged to plan their schedules accordingly to accommodate a very busy week, with votes beginning early each morning and extending late into the evenings. 
I thank my colleagues for their attention, and I yield the floor. 
Mr. HUTCHINSON addressed the Chair.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a colloquy with my good friend from Vermont, Senator Leahy regarding an issue that impacts bison ranchers nationwide as well as in both of our States. 
It is my understanding that the U.S. Department of Agriculture has taken major steps during the past year to ensure that our country's food supply is as safe as possible. USDA requires all firms that wish to sell meat to USDA and other Federal agencies to comply with newly adopted regulations known as HACCP. 
It is also my understanding that the beef, pork, and poultry industries are provided USDA inspection at no cost, and that ranchers who raise American bison must pay a steep fee to USDA for inspection at slaughter and inspection of products to be sold to USDA. These costs exceed $40 per hour, per inspector, both for inspection at slaughter and at further processing. 
I would like to ask my colleague on the Agricultural Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator Leahy, whether he would agree with me that USDA should explore what impact inspection fees has on the bison industry?

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I am speaking in support of an amendment to address a problem facing small reliever airports that do not accept scheduled service operations. Centennial Airport is a small reliever airport near Denver, Colorado, where operations consist primarily of small private chartered and business planes. A unique situation exists at Centennial Airport involving certain charter services and a loophole in the federal regulations governing scheduled flights. 
Centennial Airport is not certificated for scheduled flight service. In fact, the Airport Authority, with strong local backing, has banned scheduled service at Centennial. According to federal law, the Federal Aviation Administration cannot force any airport to become certificated. The airport is not equipped with a terminal, baggage system, or passenger security. Furthermore, Denver International Airport is less than 25 miles from Centennial, and has the capacity to handle additional scheduled service operations. 
A situation arose more than three years ago when a company called Centennial Express Airlines, Inc. began charter service at Centennial, but immediately announced that the airline's service would continue as scheduled service. The Airport Authority sued and the County District Court ordered the flights stopped. In April of this year the Colorado Supreme Court ruled in favor of Centennial Airport Authority's ban. The Court cited the safe operation of the airport as a priority, and upheld the airport's discretion to prohibit scheduled passenger service. 
While this decision protected the airport's right to refuse scheduled service, a similar situation recently arose with another company, Colorado Connection Executive Air Services, and the result has been detrimental for Centennial Airport. 
In 1997, Colorado Connection proposed to start public charter passenger service pursuant to a regular and public schedule. Colorado Connection, which is entirely owned by Air One Charter, tried using a combination of Department of Transportation and Federal Aviation Administration exemptions to offer scheduled service. Air One Charter indicated intent to market 6-12 daily flights to various Colorado cities and to contract baggage services for their flights. 
The Centennial Airport Authority unanimously voted to deny airport access to Colorado Connection's scheduled service. The vote took place in April 1998 and a month later the FAA initiated a Part 16 investigation. The FAA claims that the Airport Authority's move to deny service is unjustly discriminatory. Recently, the FAA issued a decision to pull federal funding for Centennial Airport if the ban on scheduled service is not lifted. This decision is in direct conflict with the Colorado Supreme Court's ruling on the issue. It is the result of a loophole in a law that was not intended to force small airports to take on the responsibility and burden of supporting scheduled service. 
Immediately following the announcement of the FAA's decision, the owner of Centennial Express was reported by the Denver Post to have plans to begin scheduled flights from Centennial Airport. 
I have proposed legislation to rectify this situation and uphold the authority of airports like Centennial to ban all scheduled service if they choose to do so. This proposal allows a general aviation airport to deny access to a public charter operator that operates as a scheduled service, and clarifies that such action would not be in violation of requirements for federal airport aid. This will not require any airport to do anything, and it will not allow an airport to discriminate against one scheduled service operator and not another. 
This measure, which is included in the manager's amendment, is nearly identical to language that the House Commerce Committee has included in its FAA Reauthorization Act. It would prohibit the FAA from charging discrimination if an airport chooses to deny access to scheduled service operators. It will only apply to reliever airports that are not certificated under Part 139 to handle scheduled service and airports within 35 miles of a large hub airport. 
I appreciate my colleagues' support for the rights of small airport authorities and surrounding communities to retain control over their airports.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I rise with good news about Americans on welfare. It is clear that the hard labor we put forth during the 104th Congress to enact welfare reform has been paying off with big returns. The system so many had grown to use as a crutch and a burden to self-sufficiency for 62 years was finally removed in July of 1997. 
States are now showing that Americans can achieve financial independence when given the right tools. I thought it would be of benefit for the Members of the Senate to hear a review about Colorado's experience with changing the welfare program. 
In 1982, I was elected to the State Senate of Colorado and found that one of the first issues I was involved in was the idea that we needed to change welfare. I was approached by one of the counties I represented at the time that had a very frustrating problem. They saw their budget escalating out of control, and there was not anything they could do about it. 
So they said to the Colorado legislature at the time, and they said to me also, `Look, if you will give us some local control, we have some ideas on how we can change the welfare system to make it better and save the taxpayer dollars and actually get people to work and be self-sufficient.' 
They had two phases that they wanted to go through. First of all, they wanted to go through a reorganization of their county government. They wanted to consolidate those agencies that dealt with employment and welfare. And they wanted to put these agencies together and under the guidance of one individual. They happened to select Walt Speckman at the time who was in charge of finding jobs for people in Weld County. This was the county that had come to me and was trying to do something about reforming their welfare system. 
They were putting him in charge because he was used to looking for jobs instead of putting people in a position where they were becoming put in a position to rely on government. This individual was used to getting them off of government and getting them into a self-sufficient program. And having been prepared to do that type of reorganization, they had to come to the State legislature to get some legislation passed. And I was involved in that. 
Another part of that process was that they had to go to the Federal Government and they had to get a waiver in order to be able to waive some Federal laws and regulations that were being applied to the State of Colorado as well as the county. 
As a result of that legislation--which we passed in a Republican legislature, by the way, from both the House and the Senate, and which was reluctantly signed by a Democratic Governor of the State of Colorado--we began to put the program in place. And as it moved along, we found that it was beginning to move people off of welfare into the workplace. It was working in this county at a time when there was a large amount of unemployment because one of the major employers in Weld County at that time had found it necessary--they were in a labor dispute, so they found it necessary to close their large plant. 
We also recognized in this program that we needed to provide some day-care services for many of the women who were on welfare. Most of the people in Colorado who were on welfare were young women who had children. We had to provide educational opportunities for them as well. 
This experience in Colorado gave us an example, those of us who were serving in the Congress at that time. After I left the Senate in the State of Colorado, then in 1990 I got elected to the House of Representatives, and it gave me a good example to point to my colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives about how welfare reform could work if managed properly. And my colleague at that time was Senator Hank Brown from Colorado, who was from Weld County and also worked hard on welfare reform as a Member of the U.S. House of Representatives and in the U.S. Senate. 
When I had the opportunity, as a Member of the House of Representatives, to work on welfare reform, I was thrilled because I could see what could happen if you would just turn the responsibility over to the States. If that State, in turn, would turn the responsibility over to the county, miracles could happen. And that is exactly the type of thing that I proposed in the 1994 election when the Republicans were putting forward the Contract With America. 
I had a good deal to do with putting in a lot of the provisions that were in the Contract With America on welfare reform because I could point to the experience in Weld County and the experience of Colorado and the tremendous success that happened out of that program. So I was absolutely delighted to see that the Republican Congress was beginning to adopt that idea. 
Finally, as I mentioned in my opening comments, in 1997 it was a Republican Congress, with a Republican Senate and Republican House, that finally had a reluctant President who was willing to sign some legislation on welfare reform. And it is working. 
The Johnson era and the decades following this taught us that the availability of Government welfare only feeds poverty, digging a deeper hole for those who grow to depend on it. By returning power to the States and giving them the flexibility to design and administer welfare programs tailored to the needs of their citizens, Americans are seeing the fruits of liberating the public from welfare dependence. 
Some skeptics would say our strong economy and low unemployment are responsible for the decline in welfare cases, but they forget that the flourishing economy of the 1980s barely put a dent in the welfare rolls. It is clear that our new laws are working. 
From January 1993 to March 1998, the number of welfare recipients in the Nation declined by 5.2 million, or 37 percent, from 14.1 million individuals in 1993 to 8.9 million in 1998. 
Since welfare reform was enacted in August of 1996, the number of recipients has declined by 3.3 million individuals, which is 27 percent, while the number of families on welfare has declined by 1.2 million, also 27 percent, since welfare reform was enacted. 
I am proud to say that Colorado continues to be one of the front runners in the progress of welfare reform. Colorado is the only State which has block-granted all welfare funds directly to the counties. 
Since 1995, Colorado's caseload has declined by nearly 50 percent. 
I have a number of other examples that I will point out to my colleagues in the Senate on the success of the Colorado program. 
Each county in my state has been experimenting with various programs which comply with the Colorado state law. Our law requires that an `individual responsibility contract' be signed by each of the 32,000 welfare recipients in Colorado. The contract describes each recipients program for obtaining a job. What makes Colorado's program work is the local flexibility and control handed to counties to carry out the new laws. 
In addition, counties have used their leverage power through their contracting and procurement activities to help create more jobs in the private sector. 
Counties in Colorado tell me they had to re-think their purpose in distributing welfare. Now, they see their role defined more by encouraging recipients to make a commitment to immediate work and imposing a shorter time limit for cutting off those who don't cooperate with this commitment. They are accomplishing this by reeducating recipients, creating new incentives to get off welfare, and contracting out job training. 
Since implementation of `Colorado Works,' our new version of the former Federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Program, welfare cases dropped 28 percent in just one year. 
Several counties in Colorado have shown remarkable progress: 
El Paso County has renamed its welfare office the `Family Independence Center' and has moved into the same building that houses Goodwill Industries. They have developed a philosophy of empowerment of participants to care for their own families and seek employment as soon as possible, not as a last step in the self-sufficiency process. 
Boulder County has taken new strides in implementing reform. In July of 1997, they had 715 cases. At the end of June 1998, the caseload was 562. 257 people were placed in jobs. The average wage of the former recipients was $7.82 an hour. 
Three of those former welfare recipients have found permanent jobs with Boulder County's own employment and training center. 
Mesa County has gone even further with a reduction of 40 percent in their welfare rolls. They tell me it's working because the county commissioners and social services staff have remained committed to getting people off welfare and into jobs. Plus, businesses and human services agencies in the county have pitched in to help find jobs for former welfare recipients. In several Colorado counties, the leading civic organization in welfare-reform efforts is the Chamber of Commerce. Communities are pulling together resources to help new reforms become a success. 
Colorado welfare cases have continued to drop since June of this year to an all-time low of 17,990 cases in the month of August. That is 10,000 fewer welfare cases than we had in 1983--15 years ago. But on top of that, this phenomenon has been taking place while population in Colorado has been increasing. According to the Census Bureau, our population has increased 13 percent from 1990 to 1995. Although caseload reduction is not the only measure for success in this area, the fact that we have reduced our welfare reform by more than 50 percent in just the last five years is worth talking about. 
Caseworkers in my state applaud this work-first model. They stress that there has been a large increase in child care utilization and expenditures--yet another sign that Colorado residents are being put to work. 
Since July, 1997, statewide child care expenditures have increased from $3 million to $6 million per month. Also, the number of families receiving child care assistance increased from 8,200 to 12,600 per month during the same period. 
But I think more than anything else, we should acknowledge that there is a clear-cut change in society's opinion about behavior we once just accepted. It's no longer acceptable for large chunks of our tax dollars to serve as a permanent wage to those who choose to lean on welfare. 
People are not helpless, as the welfare state has told them. In fact, predictions that we would see a massive increase in the homeless population have not come true. 
Instead, we see now that for years, our laws underestimated the abilities of welfare recipients to work and care for their own families by earning their own money. 
Mr. President, changing the work ethic of the welfare community is not a simple process, but the results so far are impressive. The state and local governments are proving that they can accomplish this goal when we give them the latitude to do so. I'm proud to have been a part of this historical policy change.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding. 
Mr. President, I am rising in support of Senate bill 1981, the Truth in Employment Act. 
I agree with my colleague from Arkansas that we do protect the right of employees to organize under the National Labor Relations Act. The problem is that we have small businesses out here that are being harassed and their businesses are being disrupted. I want to take a minute to explain to you or relate an incident that happened in Denver, CO. It is a real life story of what happened. 
This businessman, who happened to be an electrical contractor, saw a van pull up in front of his business. Seven union organizers jumped out of the van, ran into his office, and they applied for a job with the business. They had their videotape running. When all was said and done, he hired some of them and put them to work. When all was said and done, when all the harassment was done, and all of the later procedure and everything, there was a considerable amount of cost to the company in management time as well as actual dollars. It ended up that there were approximately 19 frivolous and sometimes false charges with the National Labor Relations Board. Each one of those charges was eventually dropped. However, the company had already dedicated 500 management hours to deal with problems created by these salting workers and suffered financial losses of more than $1 million. 
This is not workers' rights, this is going out and harassing your competition. It is going out and disrupting another company that is trying to compete in the fair marketplace. It doesn't have anything to do with jobs. What it ends up doing is costing the consumer. You and I, as consumers of electricity, will have to pay more electrical rates because of this type of activity that increases the cost of providing the services that consumers end up utilizing. 
I think this is a good bill. I am rising in support of it. I urge my colleagues to support this. I think my colleague from Arkansas is doing the right thing. I believe that we are protecting the rights of employees. What we are doing is eliminating the harassment and the unnecessary cost to the employer. 
I yield the remainder of my time.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I would like to say a few quick words in support of S. 2094, the Fish and Wildlife Service Revenue Enhancement Act. 
I have toured the Repository in the Rocky Mountain Arsenal. I was impressed by the instructional programs the Fish and Wildlife Service runs from that facility. It is obvious that the Repository serves a vital educational role. The Service is trying to utilize their resources to educate and inform the public about wildlife and wildlife trade. The passage of this bill will allow them to put to good use assets that are now just wasting away, and to further their scholastic goals. 
Another important reason for passage of this bill is that it benefits the National Eagle Repository. They support the cultural and religious activities of Native Americans. We all know how important Raptores such as Bald and Golden Eagles are to the various tribes. The Service goes to great lengths to match the thousands of requests they receive from Native Americans for these rare birds. Any assistance that we can give them which will improve that already excellent operation will be a credit to the Congress. 
I would like to thank Chairman Chafee, Ranking Member Baucus, and their staff for their assistance on this bill. Several improvements were made during the committee process, and I believe the bill is the best possible solution to the funding and allocation problem currently facing the Repository. 
I would urge my current colleagues to support the passage of this bill, and I hope my former colleagues in the House will take up this matter and pass it soon after they return next week. I thank the Chair.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise as a cosponsor and strong supporter of S. 1873, the American Missile Protection Act, and I urge all my colleagues to vote in favor of this much needed legislation. 
Let me begin by being blunt--the United States cannot defend its borders against a single ballistic missile attack. This leaves all fifty states, especially Alaska and Hawaii, defenseless against any country that wants to threaten the U.S. with ballistic missiles. 
We will hear that there is no need for a national missile defense because the Soviet Union is gone. This is true, but the USSR's demise has given rise to many nations ready to take their place. Russia has 25,000 nuclear warheads and recent reports show that their technology and warheads are readily available. Just as problematic is that 25 nations have or are developing nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. Over 30 nations have ballistic missiles, with many more attempting to strengthen their weapon of mass destruction capability. 
Until just recently, China, with its over 400 warheads, had strategic nuclear missiles targeted at the United States. However, these missiles could be red-targeted within minutes if so desired. Just last week, North Korea placed all of South Asia on high alert due to their missile test. They now have demonstrated the capability to build two-stage missiles, which is significant because adding stages increases missile range. While the Administration plays down the threat, I cannot. This leaves the region and our over 80,000 troops in the area vulnerable to attack. Also, according to `Jane's Strategic Weapons Systems,' North Korea is developing long-range missile capability that could threaten southern Alaska and with additional assistance from Russia could later develop missiles with ranges which could threaten the west coast of the U.S. 
Opponents will also argue that a missile defense system cannot defend the United States against suitcase nukes or terrorist attacks on our own soil. They are right, and we need to do more to detect this form of terrorism, but it should not be done at the risk of a ballistic missile attack. To quote William Safire, `. . . nations like China, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, India, and Pakistan have not been investing heavily in suitcases.' These countries are spending money on long range missiles. While many of these countries may never threaten the United States, we should not base all of our future threats on the present. 
Opponents also point out that non-proliferation agreements will end the need for a missile defense. The problem is that not all countries abide by these agreements, or even sign at all. Presently, China, North Korea, and Russia are all engaged in the transfer of missile components and technologies. Despite past denials, North Korea now admits to testing and selling missiles in an effort to help build the arsenals of Iran, Iraq, and Syria. Again, despite the threats and pleadings of the Administration, North Korea has refused to stop developing, testing, and deploying missiles. 
Lastly, opponents of a missile defense system point to the Administration's 1995 National Intelligence Estimate which stated that the United States would not face a threat of a missile attack for at least 15 years. However, to come to this conclusion, they had to exclude any threat to Alaska and Hawaii. This intentional omission is deceptive at best. We must not sacrifice the protection of U.S. citizens living in Alaska and Hawaii just to score political points. By leaving one state vulnerable, we leave the country vulnerable. This is unacceptable. 
While I am a strong supporter of the capability of our intelligence community, they are not perfect. In May, the U.S. intelligence community was caught by surprise when India conducted a series of nuclear tests on the 11th and 13th of that month. In another surprise, despite intelligence estimates that Iran could not field its medium range ballistic missile until 2003, Iran flight-tested this system on July 22nd of this year. Also, it has been reported that Iran is developing a longer-range version capable of reaching Central Europe. 
Again, the Administration believes that we will have at least 3 years warning before any missile attack would be feasible. However, on July 15th, the Congressionally mandated bipartisan Rumsfeld Commission concluded that the United States could get little to no warning of ballistic missile deployments from several emerging powers. The Commission stated that `The threat to the U.S. posed by these emerging capabilities is broader, more mature and evolving more rapidly than has been reported in estimates and reports by the intelligence community.' It also warns that, `The warning times the U.S. can expect of new, threatening ballistic missile deployments are being reduced. . . . the U.S. might well have little or no warning before operational deployment.' 
While it may be difficult, we must admit that we live in an era of unstable international politics. The U.S. should never initiate a ballistic missile attack, but we cannot be sure that other nations are like-minded. The United States must be able to defend itself. I believe the world would be a better place without these weapons. In the meantime though, we must live with the reality that they do exist and in the wrong hands will be used. 
The bottom line is that if the United States is on the receiving end of a missile attack, we are defenseless. I believe it is wrong to understate the danger still lurking in the world. We must do all that is possible to protect all Americans. We must develop a true national missile defense as soon as technologically possible. To do anything less would be to shirk our duties to provide for the common defense of the United States and all its citizens.

 Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to address a problem facing small reliever airports that do not accept scheduled service operations. Centennial Airport is a small reliever airport near Denver, Colorado, where operations consist primarily of small private chartered and business planes. A unique situation exists at Centennial Airport involving certain charter services and a loophole in the Federal regulations governing scheduled flights. 
Centennial Airport is not certificated for scheduled flight service. In fact, the Airport Authority, with strong local backing, has banned scheduled service at Centennial. According to Federal law, the Federal Aviation Administration cannot force any airport to become certificated. The airport is not equipped with a terminal, baggage system, or passenger security. Furthermore, Denver International Airport is less than 25 miles from Centennial, and has the capacity to handle additional scheduled service operations. 
A situation arose more than three years ago when a company called Centennial Express Airlines, Inc., began charter service at Centennial, but immediately announced that the airline's service would continue as scheduled service. The Airport Authority sued and the County District Court ordered the flights stopped. In April of this year the Colorado Supreme Court ruled in favor of Centennial Airport Authority's ban. The Court cited the safe operation of the airport as a priority, and upheld the airport's discretion to prohibit scheduled passenger service. 
While this decision protected the airport's right to refuse scheduled service, a similar situation recently arose with another company, Colorado Connection Executive Air Services, and the result has been detrimental for Centennial airport. 
In 1997, Colorado Connection proposed to start public charter passenger service pursuant to a regular and public schedule. Colorado Connection, which is entirely owned by Air One Charter, tried using a combination of Department of Transportation and Federal Aviation Administration exemptions to offer scheduled service under Federal regulations, because the company that books the flights does not own the aircraft and the schedule is not officially published in the airline guide. The use of two different corporate names allowed Air One Charter to fly the scheduled passenger service under Colorado Connection without subjecting the airline to FAA scheduled service regulations. Air One Charter indicated intent to market 6-12 daily flights to various Colorado cities and to contract baggage services for their flights. 
The Centennial Airport Authority unanimously voted to deny airport access to Colorado Connection's scheduled service. The vote took place in April 1998 and a month later the FAA initiated a part 16 investigation. The FAA claims that the Airport Authority's move to deny service is unjustly discriminatory. Last week the FAA issued a decision to pull Federal funding for Centennial Airport if the ban on scheduled service is not lifted. This decision is in direct conflict with the Colorado Supreme Court's ruling on the issue. It is the result of a loophole in a law that was not intended to force small airports to take on the responsibility and burden of supporting scheduled service. 
Immediately following the announcement of the FAA's decision, the owner of Centennial Express was reported by the Denver Post to have plans to begin scheduled flights from Centennial Airport. 
I am proposing legislation to rectify this situation and uphold the authority of airports like Centennial to ban all scheduled service if they choose to do so. This bill would allow a general aviation airport to deny access to a part 380 public charter operator that operates as a scheduled service, and clarifies that such action would not be in violation of requirements for federal airport aid. This will not require any airport to do anything, and it will not allow an airport to discriminate against one scheduled service operator and not another. 
This amendment is nearly identical to language that the House Commerce Committee has included in its FAA Reauthorization Act. It would prohibit the FAA from charging discrimination if an airport chooses to deny access to scheduled service operators. It will only apply to reliever airports that are not certificated under Part 139 to handle scheduled service and airports within 35 miles of a large hub airport. 
I am not aware specifically of any other reliever airports existing outside of Colorado that have an interest in this legislation, however, I hope that my colleagues see the importance of protecting the right of small airports and surrounding communities to refuse all scheduled service operations.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, during the 105th Session of Congress, my colleagues and I are addressing a broad range of high tech issues, including military, civilian, and commercial space issues. The industry supporting high technology products and services has become extremely important to our nation, and particularly in my home state of Colorado. 
Today I would like to take a look at the high-tech industry through global, national, state, and local perspectives, and relate the broader examples to Colorado. Colorado is a microcosm of the nation when you look at high-tech and the future of the industry. The prosperity, trends, and needs within the Colorado community are prime examples of what the entire nation is faced with. 
The growth-inducing power of technology at the industry level has been astonishing. In the United States, research-intensive industries, such as aerospace, chemicals, communications, computers, pharmaceuticals, scientific instruments, semiconductors, and software-have been growing approximately twice the rate of the U.S. economy as a whole the past two decades. The high-tech world has also become extremely competitive. High-tech firms are now facing global competition, regional competition, and competition for jobs. There is every reason to believe that this trend will continue for at least the next decade. 
As competition increases locally and globally, we must field an educated workforce that can also be competitive. America's future economy depends on sustaining a competitive edge through greater development and knowledge. But there is growing concern that America is not prepared for this new economy. 
I would like to share some startling statistics revealing the serious lack of education in this country. 
Forty percent of our 8 year-olds cannot read.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today, in a place where President's have laid, Officers J.J. Chestnut and Detective John Gibson lay in state under the Capitol Dome, the very symbol of freedom and democracy that they died to protect. 
On Friday, July 24th, Mr. Gibson and Mr. Chestnut laid down their lives for the people visiting their Capitol, for our staffs, and for us. These two brave men are true public servants. Their actions protected American lives and our cradle of freedom, the Capitol. 
Even though I never had the opportunity to meet Mr. Gibson and Mr. Chestnut, I do know many like them. They are both husbands, fathers--Mr. Gibson has 3 children, and Mr. Chestnut has 5, and J.J. Chestnut is a grandfather. I also know them from the friendships that I and my wife Joan have formed with the committed and selfless Capitol Hill Police. I want to thank them for their service to me, my family, my staff, and every visitor that enters this Capitol. 
Mine, my wife's, and my staff's hearts go out to the families of these two loved family men and the Capitol Hill Police for their two fallen respected colleagues. They are heroes. While no words can ever express the sorrow felt, our prayers go out to their families, friends, and the Capitol Hill Police. 
Thank you Officer John Gibson and Officer J.J. Chestnut for your service to all of us and to this country. God bless their memory and their families.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 1151. 
First, I want to begin by thanking Chairman D'Amato for skillfully steering the Credit Union Membership Act through the Senate Banking Committee and onto the Senate floor. 
It has been a pleasure to work with both him and his staff on this Senate Banking Committee. That also is speaking in behalf of my staff also. We have been very appreciative of their work in helping us with our issues and what you are doing for credit unions. 
I am pleased to support this credit union bill in the Banking Committee, and I am pleased to continue to support it now. 
I have always been a supporter of the credit union movement. The main reason I have been supportive is because I felt that any competition among financial institutions is vitally important. And, obviously, the credit unions provide the customer another choice out there; another way of meeting his banking and financial needs. 
During my years in the Colorado State Senate I worked closely with the Colorado Credit Union League and the numerous credit unions and members that we have in Colorado. 
I have been pleased to continue my work with the Colorado Credit Unions as a member of the Senate Banking Committee. 
Mr. President, there are 185 credit unions in Colorado. There are 1,321,000 credit union members in Colorado. 
And the credit unions hold nearly $7 billion in assets in Colorado. 
Credit Unions play a vital role in our communities. They provide an opportunity for groups of people to join together and pool their assets. 
Credit Unions are run by their members. Those members make loans and help each other to get ahead and build a prosperous life for their families and for their communities. 
Let me turn to several provisions in the Credit Unions bill. 
I am particularly supportive of the new capital requirements and the `prompt corrective action' requirements that we put in the bill during our deliberations in the Senate Banking Committee. 
That is because I feel so strongly that we need to work to make sure that our financial institutions remain safe and sound. 
I have always felt that we were particularly blessed to be serving in the Senate particularly during a time when our economy is doing very well. 
As much as I would like to hope that our economy continues to prosper, history has shown us that periodically there are fluctuations in our economy; there are good times and there are bad times. If we do not make good decisions today to assure safety and soundness, it is going to create problems in the future. So that is why I have been so pleased with the safety and soundness provisions that we have added to H.R. 1151. These provisions are vital to protect credit union members. We want the credit union members' movement to remain strong and well capitalized. 
Let me turn to the issue of taxation. From the beginning of this debate, I have opposed the taxation of credit unions. They are collective organizations. They are not-for-profit businesses. They pool their assets. Their gains go back to the members as assets. They also go back to their members as interest, and that interest is taxable to the credit union members. As I said earlier, credit unions exist to help their members, and consequently I do not believe that credit unions should be taxed. I have been concerned with the tax and regulatory burden that remains on small financial institutions, whether they are banks or credit unions. Consequently, I will support elimination of the Community Reinvestment Act. I support lifting the CRA burden on small financial institutions, and I support reducing the tax burden on small banks. 
I raised this issue during the Banking Committee's hearing last month on the proposed financial modernization legislation. We need to do something to make certain that our small community banks can remain viable. We do not want those banks to drown in the burden of regulation and taxation. 
At the time of the hearing I had brought up a question about subchapter S corporations and independent banks, and, graciously, the chairman says, `You know, I think maybe you are on to something. We ought to continue to pursue that.' Consequently, because of the strong support from the chairman in trying to give tax relief to small banks, I put together some legislation. This has all resulted because a small, independent banker from my State of Colorado decided to share with me some ideas he had about S corporations and how we could help small banks through the Tax Code. 
So the chairman was very receptive to those concerns. He said, `Well, let's work on it.' We worked on it. We have introduced some legislation that will be helpful to small bankers in Colorado and throughout the country. 
It has become very clear that small banks do want something done with their subchapter S corporations. The subchapter S provisions of the Internal Revenue Code reflect the desire of Congress to eliminate the double tax burden on small business corporations. 
Subchapter S has been liberalized a number of times, and most recently in 1996. Yesterday, I introduced legislation that will expand and improve subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code, and this is S. 2346. I am joined in this effort by Senators D'Amato, Faircloth, Hagel, Enzi, Bennett, Mack, Shelby, and Grams. This legislation contains several provisions that will make the subchapter S election more widely available to small businesses in all sectors. It also contains several provisions of particular benefit to community banks that may be contemplating a conversion to the subchapter S. 
Financial institutions were first made eligible for the subchapter S election in 1996. This legislation builds on and clarifies the subchapter S provisions applicable to financial institutions. 
As Congress considers credit union legislation and financial modernization legislation, it is important that we explore ways in which we can ensure that the tax and regulatory burden on our community banks remains reasonable. This S corporation legislation is reflective of that desire, and we will now begin working with the Senate Finance Committee to see if we can get this legislation in a bill this year. 
Section 403 of this credit union bill will require the Secretary of the Treasury to submit a study to Congress within 1 year that will make legislative recommendations on how Congress can reduce and simplify the tax burden on small banks. I hope the Treasury Department will be endorsing this S corporation legislation. 
It seems to me that it is one of the better ways to reduce the tax burden on small banks. In the last several months, there has been considerable conflict between banks and credit unions. They both play a vital role in our communities. I hope that in the coming months we can produce legislation that will strengthen credit unions as well as community banks, and I support the bill. 
I thank the members of the committee, particularly the chairman, for their support of H.R. 1151, and look forward to swift passage. I am particularly pleased to serve on this committee because of the cooperation and sincere desire in that committee to make sure that we have strong financial institutions and that we have competition out there, which I think is the real answer to a lot of our problems. 
I yield the floor, Mr. President.  
Mr. DAMATO addressed the Chair.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I am here today to tell my colleagues about an issue of great importance to the people of my state of Colorado. This summer, the state of Colorado has lost an estimated $23 million, at least, due to the problem I am here to address. We have been assured again and again by the Administration that the situation would soon be resolved. I no longer have faith in that assurance, and I believe that I am going to have to make my point stronger and louder in order to secure fair treatment for the State of Colorado. I am disappointed that the problem has lingered for this long, and that my attempts to cooperate with the Department of Transportation have been met with apathy and diluted efforts. 
This is a problem that I have been working on for months, and I am continually and increasingly frustrated by the lack of concern shown by the Administration. I was first made aware in April of this year that an application for international service into Denver International Airport was near approval. A foreign airline filed an application with the Department of Transportation to provide direct service between Denver and London. This flight was to be the first overseas flight at Denver's young international airport. British Airways wants to provide this service, and to date is the only airline that has applied to do so. Of course the prospect of a direct flight to Europe is exciting for the people of Colorado; our booming economy, growing business sector, and tourism industry are primed for this direct international service. 
The application process under the bilateral Air Transport Services agreement between the United States and the United Kingdom is designed to be a routine step. By law, final review by the United States of the British Airways flight is intended only to assure compliance with technical requirements for air safety and ownership. 
At some point in the review process, the Department decided to hold the British Airways flight hostage to influence an unrelated situation. An American airline had approval to provide service between Charlotte, North Carolina and London, but being a new entrant into the market, choice slots were not available for their service. That airline, US Airways, and the Department of Transportation demanded that British Airways relinquish its established slots into London's Gatwick Airport before the Denver-London service would be approved. 
The Senior Senator from Colorado, Senator Campbell, and I met with Secretary Slater. We offered our assistance and shared our concerns, and the Secretary assured us that the situation would be resolved soon. Subsequently, US Airways participated in an international slot conference, and legitimately negotiated more desirable slots at Gatwick. The original conditions for approval of Denver-London service were met. Still, the Department refused to approve the British Airways application. 
My patience in this matter has not been respected. Frankly, the expanding complaints of US Airways have absolutely no connection to the pending Denver-London service, and Department is inappropriately using the people of Colorado. I do not approve of the Department leveraging the concerns of one state against another, or using our international flights as a bargaining chip in an unrelated matter. 
This is the first time the Department has withheld final approval on a US/UK flight to influence the status of another flight. The precedent being set indicates bureaucratic abuse and blatant disregard for a fair resolution of Colorado's problem. The Department should focus on the international flights between London and Charlotte; there is no need to push Coloradans around while the Administration and US Airways are engaged in an unrelated fight. 
It is reasonable to think that this service would easily win support from the Transportation Secretary. British Airways has a clear right to operate this service under the term of the UK/US Air Services Agreement. In addition, Secretary Slater is attempting to negotiate an open skies aviation agreement with Britain. In light of this fact alone, failure to approve the Denver-London route is ridiculous. After this episode with the Denver flight, does the Administration really believe that the British authorities will have faith in the ability of the United States to be forthright in international flight negotiations? 
The issue of approving Denver-London service was postponed recently when the Secretary and several of his top staffers traveled to Africa. Patiently awaiting his return, I came across a story on the AP wire about the Secretary's activities in Africa. I was stunned to see the story that began, and I quote, `Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater Friday called on European authorities to respect aviation agreements negotiated by the United States with individual countries.' It is ironic that the Secretary lectured Europe on fulfilling its obligations under air service pacts when he will not honor the current US/UK pact and approve Denver-London service. How the Secretary could make these comments while keeping a straight face is beyond me. 
Speaking of that trip, I would like to know why the Secretary has been able to find so little time to deal with this pressing issue. When I last spoke to Mr. Slater on the phone, he told me that he was working to resolve the issue in the next few days. I expected his call at the end of that week and hoped to learn that they had approved service. It was the week before our July recess, and the call never came. After waiting for another week and investigating the delay, I learned that the Secretary was traveling to Africa for the second time this year, and that Colorado's problems would have to wait until July 15. While he simply set the issue aside, I could not. Unfortunately, neither myself nor my staff could reach the Secretary or his top aides on this issue because they were all traveling and unavailable. I am concerned that the Secretary and Assistant Secretaries have so much time for traveling and so little time for important issues here at home. I am outraged to know that my constituents' tax dollars, and mine as well, are buying flights to Africa while the state is losing money because of the Department's inaction. There is absolutely no reason that the Secretary could not have approved Denver-London service before he and his staff left for Africa. Now, after being assured that this would be his top priority upon returning from his trip, I am astounded that Mr. Slater is not prepared to be straightforward and make this decision. 
Several Colorado officials have told Secretary Slater, in no uncertain terms, that this is an important issue to Colorado. I watched the original start date for British Airways service move from June First to August First, and saw it again postponed to September First. The Secretary knew very well that the service had to be approved by the end of last week for the airline to be prepared to begin on that date. Failure to approve the flight has resulted in moving the start date to October first. Colorado has already lost four months of direct Denver-London service, and the reasons that the Department has provided for this delay are inadequate. I am through standing by while the Department is delinquent on its approval of Denver-London direct air service. I am prepared to consider using any means available to me to hasten a decision by the Department.

Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Senator from Missouri. I thank the Chair for recognizing me. I appreciate the other Members who are on the floor allowing me to go ahead and speak. I was presiding, and the Senator from Florida has graciously consented to give me some relief from the Chair while I come down and make some comments on this important piece of legislation. 
I want to talk a little bit about my State because I think it gives some idea of how this issue impacts my State. 
I happen to be rising in favor of the Nickles amendment, the Senator from Oklahoma. You see the map on the Senate floor entitled `FHA Loan Limits by County,' which was alluded to during comments made by my colleague from Missouri. During his comments, he pointed to the Rocky Mountain region in my State. That region characterizes counties of high levels of income which would be impacted by the upper loan limit increase in the VA/HUD Appropriations bill. These counties have a high preponderance of second homes. The reason these counties have a higher FHA loan limit is that they are recreation counties. People who go to these counties and have second homes make a considerable amount of money. 
Now, there is no doubt that there is a housing problem in those counties for individuals who have to run the ski lifts, individuals who work in the ski lodges, but they do not have the income level to afford a loan of $197,000 for a home. In fact, some may not even qualify for the lower loan limit range, which we are raising from $86,000 to $109,000. In addition to this disparity of wages that you see in these areas, many of these counties have implemented a no-growth policy. 
Finding affordable housing is certainly a problem we all should strive to deal with, not just at the Federal level, but also at the local level, at the county level, and particularly at the city level. Many counties in Colorado, because of their rapid growth rate, have decided to try to slow down that growth by increasing the costs of development, increasing the costs of homes. 
If we have a problem in those counties with obtaining affordable housing, I think that local governments should have a responsibility and should implement some programs that would hold the costs of those homes down so that those with lower and median incomes can afford them. 
I think my colleague from Oklahoma, Senator Nickles, did a very good job in explaining what the current situation is, and the proposed increase of the FHA loan limit. Currently, the lower FHA loan limit is $86,000 and the upper limit is $170,000. This appropriations bill raises both of these limits to a lower limit of $109,000 and an upper limit of $197,000. I like the idea that we raise up the lower loan limits. I think that helps us meet the needs of lower income and median-income families. The higher income limits, in my view, don't need to be subsidized. Most of that market is already met by conventional loans. In fact, in order to have a $197,000 mortgage, a buyer typically needs an income level of $74,000 or more. These individuals are the top 16 percent of the income earners in the United States. Nearly 85 percent of households earning more than $50,000 already own homes. I think that is reflected in the State of Colorado. 
I point out this idea of raising the loan limits is a rather controversial issue, as far as Colorado is concerned. The mortgage lenders in my State cannot reach a consensus as to whether this ought to happen or not. They are divided. So it is with a considerable amount of thought and concern that I enter into the debate as it applies to my State of Colorado. 
I see no reason why the Congress should be advocating that HUD compete against a very successful private market. I would also point out, from some of the testimony that was received by the Banking Committee on which I serve with the Senator from Florida, Senator Mack, there is really no clear connection between FHA loan limit increases and greater access to financing affordable houses. 
So when I put all these factors together, I find myself opposing raising the upper loan limit, and yet supporting an increase in the lower FHA loan limit. I think a lot of the testimony that was heard by the Banking Committee, the authorizing committee, was significant in pointing out that there is a three-times higher default rate for higher loans than there is for lower loans. In other words, the higher the loan is for the home, the higher the default rate is, as far as FHA is concerned. 
In this program, if there is a default on a loan, the taxpayers must pick up the cost. I do not think it is necessary for us to provide for that indirect subsidy. 
If we look at the lower loan limit, 73 percent of all mortgages of $85,000 or less are already provided by the private sector. Therefore, I think we can assume that this market is being serviced sufficiently. The FHA program is set up to make riskier loans to individuals who are not serviced in the private sector. By allowing the loan limit to increase, FHA will be insuring higher valued loans and will be, as a consequence, exposed to an increased risk. 
As I pointed out earlier, as these loan limits increase, the number of defaults will simply increase. I don't think that we should be increasing the upper loan limit. Therefore, I am supporting the Nickles amendment. I think it is the correct approach to the problem, particularly as it applies to my State. I think it is also the right approach as far as the country is concerned since only three percent of the counties will be affected by the upper limit. 
Without any further ado, I yield the floor. I thank Senators for their indulgence.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I wish to speak about capital gains and the way that we look at the estimates that come from a reduction in taxes such as capital gains. 
Earlier this year, I introduced legislation to reduce the capital gains tax to 14 percent and to provide indexing of the capital gains tax from that point out. This legislation builds on last year's tax bill which moved the capital gains rate down from 28 percent to 20 percent. 
I rise today to commend both the Senate majority leader and the Speaker of the House for their recent calls for a reduction in the top capital gains rate to 15 percent. Both of our leaders have indicated they are introducing legislation to cut the rate. This could be accomplished as early as this year. Again, I commend them for their leadership. 
I also wish to express my support for a provision in the IRS reform bill that returns the holding period for long-term capital gains treatment to 12 months. Last year, the administration unwisely insisted on extending this out to 18 months. This added complexity to the code and represented another attempt by Government to micromanage investment decisions. 
There is a great deal of interest in the tax treatment of capital gains due to mounting evidence that capital gains tax rate reductions not only benefit taxpayers and the economy but also increase revenues. 
Last month, the Joint Tax Committee released new estimates of the revenue resulting in the 1997 reduction of the top capital gains rate from 28 percent to 20 percent. The Joint Tax Committee apparently underestimated the revenue gain in 1998 by $13 billion and in 1999 by $12 billion. In fact, the latest estimates are that over the first 5 years revenue could be as much as $58 billion greater than previously forecast. 
Now, this does not surprise me. In fact, there are a number of us in Congress who have been making this very point for years. The capital gains tax rate cut will increase revenue, not reduce it. There are two principal reasons for this increase in revenue. First, there is the short-term incentive to sell more capital assets; second is the long-term progrowth benefit from a capital-friendly tax policy. 
The capital gains tax is largely a voluntary tax. The tax is only paid if the investor chooses to sell the asset. 
If taxes are high, an investor can hold on to the asset for years. But when taxes are low, investors will often decide to sell the assets and `realize' the capital gain. 
History confirms this pattern. In 1978, when the capital gains tax rate was reduced from 40 percent to 28 percent, capital realizations increased by 50 percent, and tax receipts increased. 
In 1981, Congress and President Reagan further reduced the capital gains tax rate to 20 percent. Once again, capital gain realizations increased dramatically and by 1983 were again up by 50 percent. 
By contrast, tax revenues actually dropped for a number of years following the capital gains tax rate hike in 1986. 
Mr. President, last year, when Congress proposed to cut the capital gains tax rate from 28 percent to 20 percent, the Joint Tax Committee submitted its revenue estimate. 
The Joint Tax Committee forecast a 10-year revenue loss from the rate cut of $21 billion. 
Mr. President, it is clear that the Joint Tax Committee and Congressional Budget Office estimates dramatically underestimated both the strength of the economy and the positive response to the tax rate cut. 
The Joint Tax Committee now concedes that there will be a significant revenue gain from capital gains realizations. 
In my view, a review of the last twenty years of capital gains tax rates and the associated revenues suggests that the model used by the Joint Tax Committee and the Congressional Budget Office to estimate capital gains revenues is flawed. 
The Congressional Budget Office argues that government revenue estimates adequately account for behavioral changes that occur as a result of tax changes. 
Despite this claim, it would appear that when tax rates are lowered the revenue estimating model significantly exaggerates the revenue losses. 
In fact, in no single year after a rate cut has there ever been a loss of revenue. 
Conversely, when tax rates are increased, the model significantly exaggerates the level of revenue gains. 
Not only do the Congressional models fail to accurately measure the response of taxpayers to changes in tax rates, they exclude an estimate of the impact of tax changes on economic performance. 
Congress is largely in the dark when it comes to any estimates of the economic benefit of tax rate reductions. 
It is logical to assume that a lower tax rate on capital lowers the cost of capital. This clearly benefits the economy. As a consequence the Federal Government will realize greater income, payroll, and excise taxes. In addition, State and local tax revenues will also rise. 
Admittedly, all of this is difficult to measure. However, I would like to see some attempt made to include these factors in revenue models. 
At a minimum they should always be appended to the official revenue estimates. This would give Congress a more complete picture of the impact of tax changes on revenues. 
Mr. President, I will note that a recent addition to the rules of the House permits the Joint Committee on Taxation to append dynamic estimates to tax legislation when requested to do so by the Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. 
This dynamic estimate is to reflect the anticipated macroeconomic effects of tax legislation, and is to be used solely for informational purposes. 
It is time for Congress to build on this process. Dynamic estimates should be routinely requested in both the House and Senate. 
Congress should also make greater use of the work of a multitude of economists. I would note for example that in 1997 the Joint Economic Committee published a study by two Florida State University economics professors; James Gwartney and Randall Holcombe that argued that the optimal capital gains rate is 15 percent or less. 
These economists predicted accurately prior to last year's rate cut that a reduction in the rate would increase revenues. 
While improvements in the revenue estimating process are certainly desirable, the fact remains that estimates are just `estimates', and Congress should recognize that those estimates will often turn out to be way off the mark. 
That is why Congress should place greater emphasis on the impact that changes in the taxation will have on the private economy, and less emphasis on projections of government revenue. 
Economic growth, job creation, and international competitiveness should be our focus. 
Mr. President, when it comes to capital gains taxes I suggest that Congress spend less time gazing into the crystal ball of revenue forecasting, and more time focusing on the real world impact of taxes on capital formation, job creation, and economic growth. 
I think it will then be abundantly clear that we should continue to reduce the tax on capital to 14 percent. This will continue the good work that we began last year. 
Mr. President, the U.S. level of tax on capital has been among the highest in the world, I am dedicated to seeing that it becomes one of the lowest in the world. 
A low rate of tax will encourage capital investment, economic growth and job creation. 
This is no time for the United States to sit on its lead; we must continue to ensure that America is the premier location in the world to do business. 
A low capital gains tax will help our economy, but it will also help America's families by reducing their tax burden. 
I look forward to working with Majority Leader Lott and with Speaker Gingrich as we continue to cut the rate of taxation on capital gains. 
I yield the balance of my time.  
Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President I was prepared to offer an amendment to the VA/HUD Appropriations bill that would have taken away EPA's authority to withdraw Colorado's delegated environmental programs. EPA has been threatening Colorado's authorization to administer delegated programs because of an environmental self-evaluation law the State passed in 1994. As many listening know, self-evaluation laws allow companies, individuals, and local governments to go above and beyond what is required in seeking out environmental problems under their jurisdiction. In return the entity who performed the audit is protected from fines. Colorado's law makes good sense, in fact in the short time it has been in existence those who have availed themselves of it have found and corrected many environmental problems that otherwise would have gone undetected. 
However, last February I became aware that EPA may not have been taking the State of Colorado seriously with respect to negotiations on the self-evaluation law. At that time I stated my intention to object to an EPA nominee. Subsequently, I dropped my objection to their nominee after speaking with Assistant Administrator Herman about my concerns. He agreed to do his best to ensure that negotiations occurred in good faith and that they were inclusive of Colorado's elected officials who had an interest in the manner. Over the past several weeks I became concerned that EPA had not followed through on this commitment. 
I was particularly distressed at the prospect that EPA had promised me they would take an action and then turned around and ignored their promise. Earlier today Assistant Administrator Herman called me and assured me that he had been faithful with respect to the previous agreement we had made. However, he agreed to redouble his efforts in negotiating an agreement to the audit issue in Colorado that has broad based support because of broad based involvement among policy makers and other local officials. 
While my inclination is still to offer my amendment, I am willing to forego it in this instance. However, should I find that EPA is attempting to exclude people from negotiations on Colorado's environmental audit law I will revisit this issue soon.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss language in the DoD authorization report contained in the `Additional Matters of Interest' section. The language in the DoD Authorization targets an amendment Senator Wyden and I were able to get accepted during the Superfund markup. 
Earlier this year the EPW Committee marked up S. 8, which if passed and signed into law would significantly improve the Superfund program. At markup Senator Wyden and I proposed an amendment clarifying the waiver of sovereign immunity currently contained in Section 120 of Superfund. A waiver of sovereign immunity basically allows private parties and state and local governments to bring suit against the federal government for noncompliance. 
This original waiver was added in 1986 when Superfund was last reformed and was accepted with broad bipartisan support. The intent of Section 120 is clear and unambiguous to those who research the legislative history and read it faithfully. The words are plain and they read: `Each department, agency, and instrumentality of the United States (including the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government) shall be subject to, and comply with, this chapter in the same manner and to the same extent, both procedurally and substantively, as any nongovernmental entity, including liability under section 9607 of this title.' 
My reading of this is that the federal government needs to comply with the law just like any private party or state or local entity. 
As Senator Stafford said during passage of the 1986 Superfund amendments, `. . . the legislation recognizes the reality that, only in unusual cases, th[at] national security may require issuance of circumscribed Executive orders exempting a Federal facility from the requirements of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986. In all such cases, Executive orders should adopt the method of protecting legitimate national security interests that maximize compliance with the environmental and health requirements imposed by the legislation. For example, it may be appropriate to require EPA employees reviewing cleanup plans [to] obtain a national security clearance, but it would not be appropriate to exempt such plans from national cleanup standards simply because EPA employees are assigned to ascertain what standards should apply to the cleanup.' However, the language in the '86 Amendments was not exact enough and wiggle room was left for the Federal government to avoid their environmental responsibilities. Unfortunately, even though our amendment is merely clarifying, some in the Senate would like to maintain dual cleanup standards, one for those who live near a private National Priority List (NPL) site and another for those who live near an NPL site the federal government has responsibility over. Simply put, that should not be happening. 
The Armed Services Committee has expressed concern with our Amendment and has even gone so far as to include report language in their bill commenting on legal language in another bill. Further they have asked for a study on the cost of our amendment. 
I provide the above background as context for my reply to the Committee's characterization of our amendment to S. 8. In their report the Armed Services Committee made several claims with which I disagree. They also make claims which can be disputed which are outlined below:

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference report to the Educational Savings and School Excellence Act. First of all, before I make my comments, I recognize the leadership of the Senator from Georgia, as my previous colleagues have done. I think he has done a tremendous job in bringing forward the issue of education and what we can do as parents, as Senators, what we can do as school board members, as State legislators, or whatever, to begin to think of innovative ways in which we can improve our educational system. There is no doubt in my mind that we need to have some innovative solutions. 
The reason I am supporting this conference report is because this is an innovative approach that involves parents, as well as school board people. It is going to broaden the effort in education. It is going to benefit all schools, whether it is private schools or public schools. 
I want to take a few moments to sort of review the history of the A+ accounts. Maybe my colleague has already done that, but I think it is very important that we do that. In doing this, I am going to urge my colleagues to join me in supporting these new opportunities that we are going to be creating for children and their families to receive the best possible education. 
Now, reviewing the history a little bit, last year, we authorized educational savings accounts for those individuals who were going to postsecondary education, going on to colleges and vocational schools after graduating from high school. Beginning last June, we introduced this opportunity to more American families by adopting an amendment to the Taxpayer Relief Act, which established education savings accounts. Now, this amendment passed, but it was dropped from the Taxpayer Relief Act bill, due to a veto threat. 
Senator Coverdell's A+ savings account was introduced as a separate bill, and it was passed this spring by a vote of 56-43. I was delighted with the outcome of that vote. Following the recent conference agreement on the Educational Savings and School Excellence Act, I am confident that we have before us a bill that makes sense for all families and children--those who seek private or public education. 
The conference report was passed by the House last week, and it is our turn to pass this bill and hand the President a new opportunity to improve education. 
I would like to go over a few provisions of the Educational Savings and School Excellence Act, putting forth the A+ accounts. Our legislation increases the dollar amount from $500 to $2,000, the amount that parents can set aside to save for 
their children's education for both public and private elementary and secondary school expenses. 
With the education savings account, the money is never Government money, so issues of Government intervention and the constitutionality of using Government funds for religious schools is not a real argument in this debate. 
This bill would empower parents with the financial tools to provide for all of the needs they recognize in their children--needs that teachers or administrators should not be trusted to address in the same way that a parent can. 
This bill would allow families, single parents, or anyone earning less than $95,000 annually to deposit up to $2,000 per child in after-tax income into those interest-bearing savings accounts each year. 
The option for using these funds are simply endless. Raising a child is expensive--we all know that as parents--whether the child is attending a private school or a public school. My children happen to have attended public schools and I will be the first to admit that education is expensive. This bill will help parents save for computers, tutoring expenses--if you have a child with special needs--uniforms, transportation--if you are in rural areas and you have special transportation needs out there--SAT prep courses, so they can get ready for higher education, postsecondary education, or even tuition for private schools. 
Now I would like to go over a few reasons why I am supporting this legislation. I think this bill is simply good news for all students--especially those in public schools. 
This legislation does not ignore any school whatsoever. Numerous provisions have been included to improve public education, as well as private education. It assists smaller schools by increasing the amount of school construction bonds that smaller school districts can use. It provides incentives for public schools to strive for higher academic achievement. It encourages teachers to improve literacy programs by training them to use proven methods, such as phonics. It will help students stay in school by authorizing a national dropout prevention program. 
To make schools more safe, we have included a provision that allows weapons brought to school to be used as evidence in any internal school disciplinary proceedings. 
In addition, the bill includes the provision to make savings in qualified State tuition plans completely tax free. These tuition plans are powerful incentives for parents to save for their children's college education. 
My State of Colorado is one of 21 States that has already implemented this kind of program. I can tell you from what I have observed in my State of Colorado, it is catching on, and it is popular. 
This bill would free up plan holders from having to pay Federal tax on interest buildup. This means more savings for tuition, room, board, and books or supplies. Tax relief for these plans offers yet one more reason to support this conference report. 
This bill is about freedom. It is about education. Let's take a step forward in improving our Nation's education system for all American children. I encourage my colleagues to join me in passing the Education Savings and School Excellence Act today and to support the conference report. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. ALLARD. The Senator has properly described it. 
Again, the thing that excites me so much about this particular piece of legislation is, it is for all students. Traditionally, this has always been thought of in terms of postsecondary--actually, through graduation from high school. But now in this particular piece of legislation, we are thinking in terms of kindergarten, first grade, second grade, which gives a lot of flexibility to parents to decide what is the best educational plan for their students, by bringing this plan and incorporating the money that can be used for many, many different purposes. It might be that there is a special-education student out there who needs some special help because of some deficiencies, needs some special help because of deficiencies in hearing or maybe sight; maybe a rural family has some problem with transportation. 
This flexibility is going to help education, whether it is private or public schools. I think it is going to improve the 
general educational effort. The real benefactor in all of this is going to be public education, because it is going to be supportive of what we are already doing in education. It doesn't take away from public education, it adds to it. 
I want to compliment the Senator from Georgia on working so very hard on this issue and his leadership. I think it is something that we can all be proud of. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today Senator Campbell and I are offering a technical amendment to the 1999 Defense Authorization Bill which would authorize the transfer of water interests held by the Army at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal, including rights in Highland Canal and Antero Reservoir. Before I give the details of the amendment, I want to thank Chairman Thurmond and Senator Levin for accepting this amendment and for all the hard work by the Armed Service staff, who without their active engagement in this process, this important amendment would never have been possible. 
As the clean-up at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal has progressed, quite well I might add, there has always been a great need for water. However, as with much of the West, water is a commodity and a way to provide water has been an area of discussion between all the parties since the clean-up began. Unfortunately, the United States' acre rights to water in the High Line Canal have proved inadequate to supply the Army's needs for non-potable water at the Arsenal. 
In a June 11, 1996 Record of Decision, the Army, Shell, and South Adams County Water and Sanitation District (SACWSD) entered into a Memorandum of Understanding by which the Army and Shell agreed to acquire and deliver 4000 acre-feet of water to SACWSD. 
However, after a lengthy investigation, it was determined that the only realistic source of potable water for SACWSD was by arranging a permanent contract with the Denver Water Board. Also, it was determined that the only way to be certain that the Refuge received a long term supply of 1200 acre-feet of non-potable water was to obtain the same from the Denver Water Board's non-potable reuse facility pursuant to a perpetual contract.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues. I want to thank the chairman for allowing me the time to speak for a few minutes on the bill. 
I rise in support of Senate bill 2138 making an appropriation for energy and water development. I also want to make a few comments in regard to the Jeffords-Harkin amendment, which was adopted a little bit earlier on in the day, which was to restore funding to the renewable energy account in the 1999 energy and water appropriations bill we are now debating. 
First of all, I thank the chairman for his diligence and hard work in working with my office on issues that are very important to the State of Colorado. Last year, you worked hard with our delegation, and are continuing to work with this delegation. I am comfortable with the legislation in the form that it is being reported out of the Senate. 
I also recognize that there is a lot of work, or some work, that has to be done in conference committee and maybe a few issues yet that still have to be resolved as far as this particular bill is concerned. 
Let me just say a little bit about the priorities that I have as somebody who represents Colorado and what I am thinking about as far as those priorities are concerned. First of all, research programs that will benefit from this funding should be a national priority. They are energy-type research, and they are very, very important to the future of this country and having us not rely on foreign sources for our energy. It is well known that nearly half of all our Nation's oil is imported and that these imports account for 36 percent of the U.S. trade deficit. 
American renewable energy and energy-efficient technologies help offset fuel imports. They build our domestic economy, and they strengthen our national security. Renewable power is an attractive energy source for the future. Alternative fuels such as propane, natural gas, ethanol, and methanol are clean fuels and are largely free of the pollutants regulated by the Clean Air Act. Renewable energy will provide clean and inexhaustible energy for millions of consumers. 
Specifically, funding for renewable energy technology is important to my home State of Colorado. My State supports several energy-efficient pilot programs as well as established renewable energy sources. Some of the Nation's best wind and solar resources are in Colorado, and many of my constituents currently rely on renewable energy. 
These are not far-fetched research projects that we are talking about. My State, for example, has many ranchers who are currently using sun and wind energy in the management of their lands, providing for their energy needs. 
Colorado is also the proud home of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, referred to as NREL--the leading renewable energy research laboratory in the Nation, I might add. NREL conducts the needed research and develops and demonstrates sustainable-energy technologies. This lab relies heavily on the funding included in this amendment. 
In addition, there are many entrepreneurs who are counting on funding from the Department of Energy to continue improving and increasing availability of renewable energy technology. There are 132 businesses in Colorado that specialize in renewable-energy-related products and services. Congress must continue to support research for renewable energy. 
We also need to support the partnerships among the 
Government research entities, universities, and businesses. These cooperative efforts ensure that the research produces applicable results and furthers our goal of increasing our use of renewable energy resources. 
In past years, I have sponsored environmental awareness seminars with Colorado State University to promote the use of alternate fuels. I am a former member of the House Renewable Energy Caucus, and I recently became the chairman of the newly formed bipartisan Senate Renewable and Energy Efficiency Caucus. I am a strong proponent of using renewable energy sources, and I believe we should continue to support that research, perfect the technology, and expand the use of renewable resources. 
I thank my colleagues from Vermont and Delaware for their efforts to protect funding for renewable energy. 
The next point I want to make is very, very important. While I do support the intent of the Jeffords-Roth amendment, I want to highlight one portion that I hope the conferees will change. One of the offsets included in the amendment is a 1.5 percent decrease in funding for cleanup of nondefense nuclear sites that are no longer utilized. One of those sites is the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site, which I will talk about further a little bit later on. My hope is to have this site cleaned up by 2006. In order to do that, it will require every dollar that has been appropriated for it in this bill. While in this instance I support the Roth-Harkin amendment, in the future I will have difficulty doing so if this same offset is included. In other words, the priority as far as my State is concerned, we spend every dollar to clean up Rocky Flats, but if we can do that, if we can put more money in renewable labs without taking away from the dollars, I can be supportive. I want it clear that my top priority is the cleanup of the Rocky Flats facility. 
On that topic, Mr. President, I further thank Mr. Domenici and Mr. Reid for their hard work on the energy and water appropriations legislation. 
There is a lot of talk about surpluses nowadays. While I know that Mr. Domenici's subcommittee was not the beneficiary of any surplus, therefore it is a very pleasant surprise that he was able to find the funds necessary for an accelerated cleanup of Rocky Flats. In fact, I note that he provides $32 million over the administration's request to be sure that we remain as close to a 2006 closure date for Rocky Flats as possible. 
As Mr. Domenici knows, this has been a very important issue for me since I came to the Senate last year. The basis of my concern is the proximity of Rocky Flats to over 2 million Coloradans. This makes the site one of the biggest potential threats to the Denver metro area. Rocky Flats is home to tons of plutonium that needs to be removed from Colorado. The funding in this bill will help achieve that end. 
Furthermore, I note the dramatic upward swing in funding from fiscal year 1997 to date. In fiscal year 1997, $487 million was appropriated for Rocky Flats cleanup. In fiscal year 1998, that number jumped to $632 million. Today's bill proposes $657 million for cleanup. If we can hold this amount, we should be able to safeguard this material and close Rocky Flats in an expeditious manner. 
Again, I close my remarks by complimenting the chairman on his hard work on both the budget and this appropriations bill and tell him how very much I appreciate his sensitivity to the problems we have in my State, particularly in regard to cleanup 
of Rocky Flats. 
I yield back the remainder of my time.

We are trying, through our office, to make sure it is well spent. My commitment to you is, we are working hard to help you in overseeing that it is spent responsibly. 
Again, we appreciate your sensitivity to the urgency of this matter. 
And like you, I hope that when we get this cleaned up, we can again clean up sites all over the country with similar situations. I appreciate the high priority you have given this particular site. I thank the chairman.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to repeal the `temporary' 0.2 percent Federal Unemployment Tax (FUTA) surtax. 
The `temporary' surtax was enacted by Congress in 1976 to repay the general fund of the Treasury for funds borrowed by the unemployment trust fund. While the borrowings were repaid in 1987, Congress has continued to extend the surtax in tax bill after tax bill. 
Since 1987, Congress has used extension of the surtax to help pay for tax packages. In fact, the surtax was most recently extended to help pay for the 1997 tax bill. 
This is unfair to small business which has been told repeatedly that the surtax was temporary and would be repealed when it was no longer needed to finance the unemployment tax system. 
The reason for the FUTA surtax no longer exists. The economy is experiencing the highest level of employment in decades, and all state unemployment funds have surpluses. 
It is inappropriate for the government to continue to raise surplus unemployment taxes and use those surpluses for purposes totally unrelated to the unemployment tax system. 
The FUTA surtax hits small businesses hardest because they are often labor intensive. Any payroll tax is added directly to the employer's payroll costs, and payroll taxes must be paid whether the business has a profit or loss. 
Mr. President, prior to my election to the House of Representatives in 1990, I ran a small business. I am well aware of payroll taxes and the burden that they can place on a business. 
The unemployment surtax was in place when I ran my small business. 
I suspect that my view of the surtax is similar to the view of most small business owners. It is one thing to have a surtax when unemployment is high. It is totally unjustified when unemployment is at the lowest level in three decades. 
What really upsets small business owners is the fact that the government is breaking its commitment that the surtax would be temporary. This is not the way the federal government should do business. 
Repeal of the 0.2 percent surtax will reduce the tax burden on employers and workers by $6 billion over the next five years. 
Lower payroll taxes mean higher wages for workers. While the employer appears to fully pay the unemployment surtax and other payroll taxes, the economic evidence is strong that the cost of payroll taxes is passed on to workers in form of lower wages. 
Consistent tax relief will help to ensure that our economy remains the strongest and most competitive in the world. Low taxes reduce unemployment and help ensure that future surtaxes are unnecessary.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, this morning the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 10:30 a.m. Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of the tobacco bill, with a Reed amendment pending regarding advertising. The Senate may also consider the vocational education bill, the Higher Education Act, the NASA authorization bill, the drug czar office reauthorization bill, and any other legislative or executive items that may be cleared for action. 
As a reminder to all Members, the majority leader has announced that there will be no rollcall votes during today's session. Therefore, any votes ordered during Friday's session with respect to the tobacco bill will be postponed to occur on Monday, June 15, at a time to be determined by the two leaders but not before 5 p.m. Any votes ordered with respect to other legislative or executive items will be postponed to occur on Tuesday, June 16. All Members will be notified of Tuesday's voting schedule as it becomes available. 
I thank my colleagues for their attention. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today to encourage the Secretary of the Department of Transportation to act expeditiously in the interest of fairness and in support of the economy of my home state of Colorado. 
I would like to explain the situation that causes me to make this proposal. There exists an agreement between the United States and the United Kingdom to allow US Airways to operate a direct flight from Charlotte, North Carolina, to Gatwick Airport in London, England. In accordance with fair and recognized practices, the airlines with established routes and time slots that have served Gatwick Airport for years were not disturbed, and US Airways was given landing rights for a time slot that is not currently occupied. Although it may not be US Airways' top choice, the time slot that has been allocated appears to be commercially viable. US Airways, however, refuses to begin service unless they are given a better time slot at Gatwick. This request is beyond the provisions of the approved agreement. 
An unrelated agreement to allow British Airways to provide non-stop service from Denver, Colorado, to London, England, is currently pending approval by the United States Department of Transportation. The Department has chosen to deliberately delay approval of the British Airways' agreement in order to pressure British Airways and the authorities at Gatwick Airport to give US Airways the most desirable time slots. The Department is simply holding the Denver-London flights hostage until the demands of US Airways are met. This is not proper use of the Department of Transportation's authority; it sets a negative precedent for airline competition and cooperation between the United States and Europe, and it is impacting the growth of Colorado's economy. 
The Secretary has been kind enough to meet with me personally, along with my colleague from Colorado, Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell, to discuss this issue. In spite of our concerns about Colorado, the Department still resists any effort to progress on the approval of the British Airways Denver-London flights. The date for beginning service was postponed from June 1st to August 1st, and unfortunately British Airways will announce tomorrow that the delay in approval will preclude them from starting service by August 1st. The start date for Denver-London direct service has been indefinitely postponed. 
This postponement denies Colorado its first overseas international flight at Denver International Airport. It prohibits our tourism industry from growing, especially during the upcoming ski season. It prevents increased competition that would result from connecting flights at DIA. It creates a problem for the employees in Denver who have already been hired by British Airways, but who have no jobs. 
I hope that the Department of Transportation takes immediate action on the pending British Airways agreement, and I encourage my colleagues to support me and my efforts to ensure that the British Airways agreement is justly considered, and that Colorado is not harmed as the Department of Transportation deals with the separate concerns of US airways.  
 By Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire (for himself and Mr. Helms):

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise as a strong supporter and a cosponsor of the Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act of 1997. This bill addresses the very serious concern of proliferation of ballistic missiles. While this bill is directed at Iran, the problem of proliferation is one of the United States' most serious problems. The problem must be addressed. 
Iran has been actively pursuing better and more sophisticated ballistic missiles. If the Iranians acquire more long range missiles with a range of at least 1300 miles, then many of our troops and allies in the Gulf region will be seriously threatened. While we know that Iran has already received some of the missile components, we must stop them from receiving the critical support and know-how to move forward. 
There have been many reports of technology transfers between Russia and Iran. Russia has been actively assisting the Iranians in their efforts in not only technology, but also in their research and development programs. While Russia has promised the Administration that they are not doing this, even the Administration states that there is a real disconnect between their words and their actions. 
I believe that this bill is important to stop this disconnect and let the world know that this activity can and should not be tolerated. If we do nothing, then who will. I believe nobody will. And, if we do nothing, within a year Iran could be capable of being able to deploy missiles that could deliver nuclear or chemical warheads about 850 miles. These missiles could reach Tel Aviv Israel, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and many of the air bases where our Armed Forces are located. 
But let me also address a problem that is not being discussed concerning serious military activity between Russia and Iran, with the assistance of the United States. Last year, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation became involved in an office complex project in St. Petersburg, Russia, the Nevsky 25. This project is jointly owned by a main U.S. investor in Golub & Company from Chicago with 10 percent ownership, the St. Petersburg Property Fund with 10 percent, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development with 40 percent, and the Rubin Central Design Bureau for Marine Engineering with 40 percent. 
My concern is that the Rubin Central Design Bureau is a Russian state-controlled military company whose main product line is military submarines. Rubin is the builder of the Russian Kilo-class submarine and has sold 4 Kilo submarines to Iran, 4 Kilo submarines and 2 Project 636 Kilo submarines to China, and counts Algeria as one of its customers. 
Rubin got involved in commercial activities to supplement their submarine production. They have become active in the field of oil and gas, high-speed rolling stock, power generation, and marine ecology. 
Igor Spassky, the Rubin Bureau head, is quoted as saying,  
The main reason for these commercial ventures is to help us survive. There is a major responsibility for the company to preserve its intellectual potential and capability for the design and development of submarines. (Janes Navy International 11/1/96) 
Even with these commercial interests, defense work still accounts for 60-65 percent of Rubin's work. 
OPIC has tried to assure me that Rubin does not have access to assets of the property until the OPIC loan is paid in full and that they are monitoring the situation. The problem is even after the loan is paid, OPIC will have assisted in providing a flow of income for Rubin to continue to build its Kilo class and nuclear ballistic missile submarines. Also, knowing Russia's record in proliferation and this legislation addresses this problem, I am afraid that this project can only help Rubin in providing future funding for these submarines. 
Also, OPIC has said that they are assured that only commercial activity is taking place in this office complex. Again, while this may be the case, the activity of concern is being used with the funds becoming available to the company to engage in their military activities. 
OPIC did say that this is a concern and that they are monitoring it but that this is not a high priority. I believe if this bill to stop missile proliferation is important enough to vote on then sales of submarines which can deliver ballistic missiles, which may be assisted with U.S. funds is just as important. 
Mr. President, before I end I want to encourage all my colleagues to vote in favor of the Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act of 1997 and to take serious the problems of proliferation and the problems of being involved with state controlled military complexes who are engaging in commercial activity in order to supplement their military activity and sales.

 Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Catherine Kalinowski who has been named the Colorado State champion in The Citizens Flag Alliance Essay Contest. This young lady was charged with the task of writing an essay on the theme, `The American Flag Protection Amendment: A Right of the People . . . the Right Thing to Do,' and did a fine job of making the case for protecting the greatest of our national symbols. 
As many in this Chamber know, I am a strong supporter of a constitutional amendment to prohibit the desecration of our flag. The American flag is a great symbol of our Nation, and it should be regarded with the highest of honors. It is a part of our national identity, representing the hopes, dreams, and honor of our country. 
As I read this essay, one passage struck me as particularly insightful. I believe that Catherine sums up our beliefs best when she writes, 
The visage of the nation's flag has altered as it has aged, with modifications in the dimensions, design, and number of stars; yet changing appearance has not impeded the flag from becoming the principal image of American ideals. 
I would like to submit the full text of Ms. Kalinowski's essay for inclusion in the Congressional Record at this time. 
Mr. President, Catherine Kalinowski represents the best and brightest that America has to offer. Young people like her are our future, a future that is brighter because of her commitment and resolve. On behalf of all Coloradans, I would like to congratulate Catherine and wish her the best of luck in the upcoming national competition.

 Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the students from East High School in Denver, CO who participated in the `We the People . . . the Citizen and the Constitution finals held here in our Nation's Capital, May 2-4, 1998. East High School competed against 49 other classes from across the Nation. Their hard work was rewarded with an Honorable mention as one of the top ten finalists in the competition. 
I am always pleased when I have the opportunity to come to the Senate floor to praise students that have taken an interest in their government and their Constitution. By taking part in this competition, the students of East High School have served to strengthen the foundation of our democracy. 
Mr. President, I would like to congratulate the participants, Daniel Berson, Lisa Bianco, Rosemary Blosser, Tristan Bridges, John Patrick Crum, Jessica Dismang, Belle Duggan, Sterling Ekwo, Heidi Gehret, Sarah Givens, Jamaal Harmon, Courtney Hopley, Scott Kronewitter, Melanie McRae, Jennifer Newman, Gavin Rember, Jennifer Roche, Sarah Showalter, Jessica Slenger, Lauren Strickland, Matthew Vellone, Feliz Ventura, Michaela Welch, and their teacher Ms. Deanna Morrison for doing such a fine job of representing Colorado. 
I cannot overstate the achievements of these young people, they are some of the best and brightest that America has to offer. I am proud to say that I, along with all Coloradans, congratulate East High School on a job well done.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, today the Senate will resume consideration of the tobacco legislation. There are two amendments currently pending, and it is expected that a vote on or in relation to one or both of those amendments will occur by 11 a.m. this morning. 
It is hoped that following disposition of those amendments, Members will come to the floor to offer and debate remaining amendments to the tobacco legislation under short time agreements. Therefore, Members should expect rollcall votes throughout Wednesday's session as the Senate attempts to make good progress on this important bill. 
I thank my colleagues for their attention, and I yield the floor. 
Several Senators addressed the Chair.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I am introducing a bill today to amend the Fish and Wildlife Improvement Act of 1978. 
This bill will allow the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce to more effectively use proceeds from the sale of forfeited and abandoned wildlife items. 
Mr. President, there is a warehouse in Commerce City, Colorado, operated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which is filled with wildlife parts and products. 
It is the National Repository for items that have been forfeited or abandoned to the U.S. Government and are being held for disposition by the Service. 
Some of these items are quite unusual: mounted rhinoceros, coral jewelry, stuffed alligators, elephant foot footstools. 
Some of these items are endangered or otherwise protected by law, and it is illegal to import them into the United States. 
Those companies or individuals who were caught trying to do so either abandoned the items or they were forfeited to the U.S. Government through a legal process. 
The Service distributes these wildlife items to museums and to schools for conservation education programs around the country. 
Anyone who flew through Denver's old Stapleton Airport, for instance, might have seen a display in the main terminal reminding travelers about various laws regulating importation of wildlife and wildlife products. 
A similar display is being erected at Denver International Airport. 
In addition to the unusual wildlife specimens stored at the Service's Colorado Repository are some more familiar items such as leather boots, jackets, purses, watchbands, and sea shells. 
These are in the possession of the Service because, in many cases, the required foreign export permits were not obtained or the items were falsely identified. 
Although it is legal to possess and sell many of these wildlife items, there is, of course, a procedure for importing them. This includes obtaining the required foreign export permits prior to importation and properly declaring the items. 
If these procedures are not followed correctly, then the items can be seized. 
Abandonment or forfeiture actions are then initiated with title being transferred to the Government. 
Many times, however, the people who try to bring them in will just abandon them to the Service. 
These items are retained by the Service at the Commerce City facility until an appropriate disposition can be made. 
I want to take just a moment here to point out that the Repository in question is located on the Rocky Mountain Arsenal northeast of Denver. 
This inactive military facility is in the middle of a transformation from a Superfund site to the largest urban wildlife refuge in the country. 
The Arsenal, which once produced nerve agents and chemical weapons, is now a haven for eagles, migratory birds, deer, and other wildlife. 
I've been told that there is hope to one day introduce bison back into the 27 square mile facility. 
The old Arsenal will become a new gem in the National Wildlife Refuge System, and an excellent resource for the people of Colorado.

 Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I had the pleasure of participating in the 14th National Space Symposium hosted last month by the United States Space Foundation. The annual symposium was designed to display and discuss current trends in the space community, and the 1998 theme reflected what has become very significant to the development of the United States space industry: `The Global Relevance for Space: Civil, Commercial and Military'. As the Foundation's President, Bill Knudsen, said in his remarks, `Space is increasingly global in all aspects. The strong interrelationship between government, private industry and military space activities has created a completely new environment.' 
The location of this symposium highlights the significant position of my state of Colorado in the global space business. All aspects of space thrive in Colorado; we have an extensive and growing industry and a significant military presence. 
The symposium addressed several issues and opportunities with a broad international flavor, and with a focus on commercial and market concerns. 
Demonstrating the interrelated nature of space activity, each of the symposium's eleven professional panels had at least one representative from the civil sector, one representing the commercial perspective and one from the national security perspective. This integrated approach produced a spirited dialog on critical space issues. 
The list of participants was impressive, a few especially captured my attention. NASA Administrator Dan Goldin detailed accomplishments of the agency, announced cooperative efforts with the Air Force and substantiated the need for the International Space Station, rejecting suggestions that the Russians should be dropped from the program. Mr. Goldin also spoke to what I believe may be NASA's greatest accomplishment: increasing their productivity while reducing their budget. The NASA budget has decreased 30% since 1993, and in that same time 10 new programs and numerous partnerships have been created. In the coming era of public and private partnership in space exploration and development, NASA has established a high standard of efficiency and achievement. 
The capstone panel, led by Mr. Golden, also featured General Howell Estes, Commander in Chief of NORAD and US Space Command. General Estes emphasized the marketplace as the driving force, while recognizing the necessity of a proper partnership between the private sector and government. 
Robert Mallett, the Deputy Secretary of Commerce, stressed the need to recognize commercial space as the driver of a higher growth job machine in industry that will deliver prosperity and security for coming generations of Americans. 
Our colleague in the House, Representative Curt Weldon, addressed national security, space and arms control concerns as he spoke passionately from his experience of working with the Russians. 
I spoke about the important mission of our military to secure the use of space, and my perspective as a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee on space implications for national security. I believe that the private and public sector must work together to ensure that the United States is the first and best in space. I support legislation in Congress to encourage commercialization of space, and in particular have been supportive of the efforts of our Colorado companies that plan to operate remote-sensing satellites that will offer unique high-resolution satellite photos. 
In addition to the panels, more than sixty exhibitors displayed the latest in space technology at this international conference. The Foundation honored exceptional achievement in space activities, recognizing NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory for their public outreach efforts associated with last summer's remarkable Pathfinder Mission, and the career of space leadership of General Thomas S. Moorman, Jr. USAF (ret.), the former vice chief of staff of the Air Force. 
General Estes and others from the Space Command laid out the future of military space with the unveiling at the symposium of their Long Range Plan. Two technologies were inducted into the Space Technology Hall of Fame, the Global Positioning System and Temper Foam, a NASA Ames Research Center technology used in medical and recreational applications. The Hall of Fame marketed its 10th anniversary of honoring technologies originally developed for the space program and later adapted to benefit others here on Earth. 
The symposium's sponsor, the United States Foundation, is a national non-profit organization with headquarters in Colorado Springs. The Foundation's mission it to aggressively advance civil, commercial and national security space endeavors for a brighter future and to provide and support educational excellence through the excitement of space. The Foundation should be commended for this symposium and for their other important projects, such as the Mission HOME program, a public awareness campaign for the space community, and Space Discovery graduate courses and teacher education opportunities. 
This annual event has grown considerably in the past few years, and I expect it to continue growing in scope and significance. I am already looking forward to next April and the 15th Annual National Space Symposium.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today as a co-sponsor and supporter of S. 1873, The American Missile Protection Act of 1998. This important legislation will remove present barriers to the deployment of an effective, reliable missile defense system, so that our citizens will be free from the threat of an attack by missiles launched from across oceans. Prudence demands that we deploy a domestic missile defense system as soon as we possess the technology to do so. 
Missile technology developed during the Cold War has forever neutralized what was once our greatest domestic security asset--distance. As a result, today many of our citizens have never known a world in which nuclear missiles were not pointed at their families. 
It is unconscionable that now, after years of being in the shadow of nuclear threat, the most powerful nation in the world still cannot defend its own soil against even one ballistic missile attack. 
In the post-Cold War era, a multiple array of new threats exist. Not only do we still face the possibility of accidental launch from a nuclear state--a possibility not without precedent--but now the proliferation of missile components and technology compounds the threat beyond even Cold War-levels. The capability of a rogue state to bypass years of development by clandestinely obtaining nuclear, chemical, and biological materials and long-range ballistic missile technology poses a new, more sinister threat. Procurement by rogue nations--especially by those who have a demonstrated desire to use force outside their own borders--cripples our ability to calculate emerging strategic threats with any degree of certainty. 
Just as a policy of total vulnerability will no longer suffice, neither will a policy characterized by the `gaps and uncertainty' due to the underestimation of the technological capabilities of states like North Korea, Iran, Iraq, China, and now India. 
Refusing to implement a National Missile Defense system as soon as it is technologically possible will render Americans vulnerable to the whims of any rogue regime that manages to procure ICBM technology. 
Bearing in mind that this bill itself violates no treaties, nor seeks to mandate the particulars of implementing a missile defense system, S. 1873 is important bipartisan legislation that should be passed. By eliminating a dependence on underestimated capabilities, this bill is a decisive affirmation that our country is indeed committed to ensuring the security of the American people. 
I urge all my colleagues to support S. 1873.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 2676. 
Mr. President, I also want to talk about reform of the Internal Revenue Service. The Senate Finance Committee examined this issue last year, and they recently conducted a careful reexamination. I commend my colleagues, particularly the chairman of the Finance Committee, for their vigilance on this issue. 
They have worked very hard to identify problems with the Internal Revenue Service and to craft legislation to correct the problems that were pointed out during committee hearings. 
As we saw in the hearings last fall, the IRS has lacked accountability for years. The most recent hearings remind us of the importance of reforming this institution. 
No one can dispute the fact that we must end business as usual at the IRS. 
We must bring accountability and integrity back to the IRS. 
American citizens should not live in fear of their government. 
Certainly most IRS employees work diligently and honestly to insure that they administer the nation's tax laws accurately and fairly. 
But as we have seen, the IRS as an institution has fostered a culture that tolerates and at times even encourages those few who operate outside the law. 
We desperately need reforms to bring to justice those agents and elements within the IRS that have so far flauted the law. 
The best way to curtail the power of the IRS is to simplify our nation's tax laws. 
Congress is the principal entity responsible for the tax code. 
Frankly, I believe Congress should scrap the current tax system and start fresh with a simple and fair system. 
The federal tax burden on hard working Americans is excessive and overly intrusive, and reform is long overdue. 
By striking at the heart of the problem with a fairer, flatter tax system, Congress will put an end to abusive IRS practices. 
Until Congress is able to pass substantive changes to the nation's tax system that the President is willing to sign, we must reform the IRS. 
Senator Roth's bill would create an independent oversight board that would redefine IRS accountability. 
The board would provide desperately needed oversight of the management and operation of the IRS, as well as its enforcement and collection activities. 
Taxpayers have a right to expect honesty and integrity in their dealings with the IRS. 
In fact, the mission statement of the IRS calls on its employees to perform in a manner warranting the highest degree of public confidence in their integrity, efficiency, and fairness. Let me repeat that. The mission statement of the IRS calls on its employees to perform in a manner warranting the highest degree of public confidence in their integrity, efficiency, and fairness. 
When this fundamental trust is breached, taxpayers must have adequate recourse. 
The Senate IRS reform bill gives them the necessary recourse. 
Taxpayers would have expanded ability to collect damages and expenses when they are the target of improper IRS actions. 
Also, agents who take improper actions, such as improper seizures we have heard on this floor, false statements under oath, which was heard in the committee, falsifying documents, we heard those before, violation of taxpayer confidentiality, and even harassing a taxpayer, would be terminated under the Senate bill. 
While it is important to make whole those who have been injured by the IRS, it is even more important to prevent abuses from ever happening. 
Senator Roth's bill would provide this important protection for taxpayers. 
Innocent spouses could no longer be held liable for the tax debts of their spouse, and spousal liability would be limited on joint returns. 
Thanks to this bill, taxpayers will finally receive due process in their dealings with the IRS, which I think is a significant part of this bill. 
IRS agents would have to follow specific procedures before seizing assets or filing liens, and they would be prevented from seizing someone's home for a minor tax liability. 
The IRS would also be subject to the same Fair Debt collection standards that all other bill collectors in America are required to follow. 
This year I have met with citizens in all 63 counties of Colorado. 
In many of those meetings I had, I constantly heard about how frustrating and intimidating it can be to deal with the IRS. The Senate IRS reform bill would make it easier for citizens to communicate with the IRS. 
The bill would require all IRS notices and correspondence to include the name, phone number, and address of an IRS employee that the taxpayer should contact regarding the notice. 
It would also be easier to contact the IRS with general questions since they would finally be required to publish local phone numbers and addresses in the phone book. 
Unfortunately a few agents have elected to use the IRS as their personal weapon, but the abuse of taxpayers must stop. 
The IRS must recommit itself to serving the taxpayers. 
The Senate IRS reform bill is a significant step towards that goal. 
According to Judge William Downes, 
The conduct of our Nation's affairs always demands that public servants discharge their duties under the Constitution and the laws of this Republic with fairness and a proper spirit of subservience to the people whom they are sworn to serve. Respect for the law can only be fostered if citizens believe that those responsible for implementing and enforcing the law are themselves acting in conformity with the law. 
I conclude by saying Congress must pass this legislation to end abusive practices and restore American confidence in the IRS. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, this morning the Senate will resume consideration of H.R. 2676, the IRS reform bill. Under the previous order, Senator Roth will be immediately recognized to offer his so-called `pay for' amendment. It is hoped that after the Roth amendment is offered Senator Kerrey will offer his `pay for' amendment and a short-time agreement can be worked out with respect to both amendments. 
As a reminder, an agreement was reached yesterday limiting the bill to relevant amendments. Therefore, it is hoped that the Senate will make good progress on the IRS bill today in an effort to finish this important legislation by tonight or Thursday. 
Senators should expect rollcall votes throughout today's session on amendments to the IRS bill, or any other legislative or executive items cleared for action.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, first of all, I thank my good friend, the Senator from Michigan, for his very hard work on this particular issue. He was working on the issue before I was elected to the Senate and is recognized for his efforts to try to control the use of illegal drugs. His national reputation precedes my meeting him here in the Senate, so the question is, How did I get involved in this particular issue? I got involved in this issue because I do hold a lot of town meetings in the State of Colorado, the State which I represent. In the inner-city areas of the Denver metropolitan area, the issue of discrepancy sentencing between powder cocaine and crack cocaine was brought up by the minority communities. There were a few members who felt the crack cocaine penalties should be less. But, by far, the majority of members in those meetings felt we needed to make tougher powder cocaine penalties because the crack cocaine penalties were working. 
I also heard some concern from within the judiciary of the State of Colorado about the discrepancy between crack and powder cocaine. So that is how I got involved in the issue. Then I had introduced some legislation to deal with this issue. I had an opportunity to sit down with the Senator from Michigan and we have worked out a provision in a new bill that I think is the right answer. It does toughen the penalties on powder cocaine, brings it more in line with crack cocaine. It is a position I support. It is a position I believe the voters of Colorado and the people of Colorado, even in the minority communities, do support. 
Mr. President, today I rise to address one of the most longstanding and racially sensitive disputes in the criminal justice system. Senators Abraham, Hatch, Feinstein, Kyl, and I are introducing a bill to lessen the disparity between criminal penalties of selling crack and powder cocaine. 
Under current law, a seller of 5 grams of crack cocaine receives the same mandatory 5-year prison term as a seller of 500 grams of powder cocaine. I believe this is inexcusable. 
The disparity between penalties has been scrutinized by the U.S. Sentencing Commission, Congress, and the Clinton administration for the last several years. Recommendations by the administration and U.S. Sentencing Commission have called for lessening the penalties for crack dealers, bringing them closer to the lax penalties applied to powder offenders. 
Our legislation rejects the administration's harmful solution. Lowering the penalty for crack to make it equal to powder cocaine penalties goes against our Nation's conviction to send a strong message to drug dealers: If you sell drugs, you are going to have to face serious consequences. 
The Powder Cocaine Mandatory Minimum Sentencing Act increases the mandatory penalties for dealing powder cocaine to 50 grams receiving a 5-year minimum sentence, bringing it closer to crack's stiff sentence of 5 grams for a minimum of 5 years. 
The disparity ratio of powder to crack cocaine will be a 10-to-1 ratio under our bill instead of the 100-to-1 ratio. This is the same number ratio recommended, by the way, by the commission and by the administration. This correction goes a long way in reforming the unjust disparity that we see now. 
Critics of current law remind us that cocaine dealers carry powder cocaine, leaving customers the risk of converting to crack. The very core of the drug crisis in the United States begins with the arrogance of drug traffickers who have found a way to `work the system.' Our bill will destroy the ease drug dealers now enjoy as they choose to traffic their drug in powder form alone. No longer will the penalty price for dealing powder be a bargain for drug traffickers. The safe option for dealing cocaine will no longer exist. 
During the 1980s, Congress legislated steep consequences for crack cocaine. The crack epidemic was plaguing our Nation with high crime rates and unprecedented statistics of addiction, and it warranted several drastic legal reforms. We saw the destruction wrought on entire communities by this cheap and highly addictive form of cocaine and realized that tough penalties were needed to restrict its availability. 
These tougher sentences were needed, but the problem we are seeing today is that powder cocaine sentences were set before the crack epidemic began. They don't reflect the influence powder has had on crime and drug trafficking. 
It is time to admit that the penalty for powder cocaine must change. The notion that powder cocaine is not dangerous is simply false. A Rocky Mountain News reporter was killed 2 years ago when an heir to one of Colorado's largest fortunes, high on powder cocaine, plowed his sports car into the reporter's car. Ask the wife and son of this young reporter if they think the penalty for powder cocaine should be 100 times less than that of crack. 
Law enforcement officials, including drug enforcement detectives in both Denver and Washington, DC, have encouraged me to pursue passage of this legislation. The National Headquarters for the Fraternal Order of Police issued a 
statement several weeks ago saying:  
The current disparities in the sentencing are unjust and do not provide law enforcement with the tools they need to restrict the sale of powder cocaine. 
The overwhelming majority of violent crime in this country is drug related. We need to do more to get and keep dealers of drugs, whatever the form, off the streets. Your bill will help us do it.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I believe NATO expansion is in the best interest of the United States. Also, expanding NATO will be in the interest of Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary and for that matter--world peace. 
The United States' security is intrinsically tied to the security of all of Europe. An enlarged NATO will only extend the influence of peace and prosperity to these three deserving countries. Also, as Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary continue to grow and flourish, their acceptance into the NATO Alliance will only further integrate Western values and will lock in the practices of democracy. Locking democracy into this region is in the United States interest and we should never shirk from our responsibility and duty to see that democracy is spread throughout the world.

Mr. ALLARD. Let me highlight a few comments from these editorials. 
The Daily Sentinel writes, 
Adding Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic to NATO rewards three countries for their efforts against communism during the Cold War. More importantly, expanding the western alliance to include the three former Soviet bloc captive nations not only is in the best interests of NATO and the United States, but it unequivocally proclaims to the rest of the world that the fate of Central Europe will no longer be in the hands of whatever despots come along, be they Nazis, Communists or something else. 
The Denver Post states, 
The Post believes adding these three nations will contribute to stability in Eastern Europe and thus to world peace. . . . Any student of the 20th century has to admire the freedom-loving spirit displayed by the Hungarians, Poles, and Czechs, often against great odds. . . . their current governments are stable and they are worthy partners of NATO. 
Lastly, from the Rocky Mountain News, 
NATO enlargement is the Western world's way to show that the Cold War is over and that we welcome these countries to freedom. The new threats we face can only be met by forming new alliance to ensure that these democracies do not fall prey to nationalistic or terrorist regimes. The Czech Republic, Poland, and Hungary know life without freedom and now deserve freedom and security that only NATO can provide. 
For me this sums up many of the reasons why I believe adding these three countries to NATO will strengthen, stabilize, and promote peace for the United States and Europe. I urge my colleagues to support this NATO expansion.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I encourage my colleagues to support legislation which will open doors to education opportunities for parents and children throughout our nation. 
Education savings accounts are a sensible step toward solving the education crisis in America by allowing families to save their own money to pay for their child's educational needs. 
This bill would empower parents with the financial tools to provide for all the needs they recognize in their children--needs that teachers or administrators should not be trusted to address in the same way that a parent can. 
These accounts would provide families the ability to save for extra fees, tutoring, home computers, S.A.T. preparation, transportation costs, or in cases of violent incidents, would allow a family to consider another public or private school. 
This kind of tax relief is especially important for parents who are working two jobs with no extra time to help with homework, or those who do not feel adequate in their own knowledge to tutor their children. 
As parents, I know that my wife and I were the best judges of our children's needs because we truly cared about their future. 
And as all parents realize, I knew that I was in the best position to address those needs. 
As a small businessman, I would have welcomed an opportunity to accrue tax-free interest to help pay for more opportunities in education for my children. 
Far too many parents find that their hopes to provide the best education for their children are crushed as they realize the costs involved in accomplishing this task. 
Contrary to popular myth, 75% of the children who would benefit from this bill are public school students. The new estimates released by the Joint Tax Committee appear to disprove the claim that public school revenues would be reduced by A+ accounts. 
The Joint Tax Committee estimates that by the year 2000, 14 million students will be able to benefit from this bill, with 90 percent of those families earning between $15,000 and $100,000 a year. 
This savings is not reserved for the wealthy but instead lifts the burden from our nation's hard working lower and middle class families. 
This bill is good for families--it's good for schools--especially public schools. 
Since parents would be spending their own money, it fuels parental involvement in their children's education. 
And because it gives them increased resources that can be used for education at their own child's school, it encourages parental involvement in the schools as well. 
Tax-free savings accounts may not fix our nation's education system, but they will give parents an opportunity to make a difference for their own children and their own community's school. 
Our tax code has always encouraged various deductions and credits for investment in physical capital, but why have we never encouraged investments in human capital? 
Education for our children is the most worthwhile investment we have--one that we should protect and foster growth. 
This bill is a positive step towards reform and choice in our public school system. 
Why anyone would vote against tax relief for America's families and improving education for all of our nation's children at the same time is difficult for me to understand. 
I thank the Senator from Georgia, Mr. Coverdell, for introducing this bill. 
I believe that the working families in our states will thank us for handing them an opportunity to invest in their own children.

 Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a great American company, one that will be celebrating its 125th Anniversary next month. The success of Coors Brewing Company is a great American story. When Adolph Coors arrived in this country in 1868, he did not speak English, but he did know how to brew a great beer. 
From 1873 until today, Coors has made its reputation on the lasting values of its founder. The American values tradition, commitment, quality, and innovation have long been a part of this history. Holding steadfast to these values has helped Coors grow from a tiny local brewery in Golden, Colorado into a world-class competitor producing more than 20 million barrels of beer each year. Today, Coors' familiar products are sold not only across the United States, but in 45 foreign countries as well. 
Through the years, Coors has been at the forefront of responsible community involvement, and today it is recognized as a leader in corporate citizenship. That is why Business Ethics magazine recently placed Coors in the top ten of its `The 100 Best Corporate Citizens.' Coors also has been cited numerous times for its outstanding record in attracting, hiring, and promoting minority Americans. It is what you would expect, given Coors' record of investing hundreds of millions of dollars in economic development and other programs designed to strengthen Hispanic and African-American communities. 
When you do business in Colorado, respect for the environment is, of course, a must. Coors is a leader in this area as well. Coors launched the aluminum recycling revolution back in 1959 when it began offering a penny for every returned can. Since 1990, the Coors Pure Water 2000 program has provided more than $2.5 million to support more than 700 environmental programs across the nation. 
One of its most noteworthy accomplishments has been in developing and promoting effective programs to discourage abuse of its products. Coors has a record of encouraging responsible consumption of its products by adults--and only adults. Over the years, millions of dollars have been devoted to community-based education and prevention programs. Coors' `21 means 21' message has been one of the elements responsible for the steady decline in underage drinking and drunk driving that we in the United States have been fortunate to see in the recent years. 
Coors has set the standard for responsible advertising, and has led the industry with policies to ensure that its ads encourage moderation, and are directed only to those over the age of 21. 
We all know of the controversies that can befall consumer products of all kinds during the highly politicized times in which we live today. But the record amassed by Coors over the past 125 years is reassuring. It is good to know there are still people and companies dedicated to doing the right thing. 
Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in a toast to the thousands of Coors employees in Colorado, Tennessee, Virginia, and at Coors distributorships in every state of the nation: Congratulations on a job well done!

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I want to just briefly explain what my amendment does. Right now, the total debt that we are facing in this country is $5.6 trillion. The interest that we pay on that total debt is more than the entire defense budget, and I believe we need a plan to pay down that total debt. 
My amendment proposes such a plan. It takes the surplus that is reflected in the budget proposal that is before us here on the floor of the Senate today, and takes those first 5 years and allocates them towards that debt pay-down plan. It says that after the 5 years that are reflected in the budget plan, then we dedicate $11.7 billion a year towards paying down the debt. If we will do that, we can pay down the debt in 30 years and save more than $3.7 trillion in interest. 
The $11.7 billion which we set aside after the 5 years which is reflected in this budget, that is less than 1 percent of the total budget. I am here to ask the Senate to join me in putting in place a plan to pay down the total debt. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

<TEXT>
Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, the purpose of the Allard amendment, which we did debate last night--I brought it back to continue the debate this evening--is to explain just how easy it is for us to make a commitment to pay down the debt by making some commitment of revenue flow for that sole purpose. 
I have a chart with a provision called the `American Debt Repayment Act.' Basically, what it does is take the budget bill, the 5-year plan we have before us, take the revenues, and say we don't spend it, we save it to pay down the debt, and after 5 years we will take $11.7 billion, less than 1 percent of the total budget allocated over 30 years, and we will eliminate the debt by doing that. 
The American family today, when they take out their largest loan--usually to buy a new home--has a 30-year mortgage. I am just saying that we can make a minimal commitment from the budget and we can pay off this debt within 30 years. That is the reason I propose my amendment, because I want this body to make a minimal commitment to paying down the debt. 
When you do this, several things happen. First of all, there is tremendous savings on interest, some $3.7 trillion in interest over that 30 years that is saved that can be used for other programs, whether it is tax cuts or whether it is additional spending. I am not in favor of additional spending. I think tax cuts is the way to go, but the money is there to do it. We do this with this commitment, and yet when we do that we still let our budget grow traditionally at the rate it has been growing in the past. 
We are really not making a sacrifice but we are making a commitment, if we pass this Allard amendment, to help pay off the debt. If we pay off the debt in 30 years, that gets us out to year 2027, 2028. If that has a familiar ring, let me remind Members that is the same date that many economists predict Social Security will be bankrupt. So this is a key first step in us being able to address some very serious problems that we are faced with today, and that is a Social Security that is getting ready to go bankrupt, a Medicare system that is even in worse shape than the Social Security system. This frees up revenue to address those kinds of problems. 
I asked the chairman of the Federal Reserve when he testified before the Banking Committee, Alan Greenspan, if he would comment about paying down the debt. He said he agrees that paying down the debt or eliminating the Federal debt would have several positive impacts on Social Security reform. I will quote his testimony before the Senate Banking Committee on the 25th of February:  
The notion to pay down the debt creates a very large amount of savings in the system, a very big window to do a lot in the area of Social Security, if you go that direction. 
In a letter that I received from Alan Greenspan on March 26, 1998, he said: `Budget surpluses will not by themselves make the current structure of Social Security taxes and benefits viable over the long run. Assuring payment of intended benefits beyond that date will require some statutory adjustments to Social Security receipts and or benefits.' So he does recognize that there is definitely a correlation between Social Security reform and making a commitment to pay down that debt. 
I will comment about the impact of paying off the debt on the total economy. Again, I will quote the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, when he testified before the Senate Banking Committee, again on the 25th of February. In regard to the economy he says: `The means by which you pay off the debt is to run very substantial unified budget surpluses. What happens when you do that is you shift the issue of debt from the public to the private sector. I think there are very major benefits from that occurring.' 
So I think there is a lot of support from people who really know about the budget, know about the economy, know about Social Security, about this, and there are a lot of Americans who support the idea we ought to be paying down the debt. I think the Senate ought to show a similar commitment to pay down this huge debt, which is somewhere around $5.6 trillion. 
I have on the floor with me a colleague, and I yield 8 minutes to the Senator from Wyoming to talk about paying down the debt.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I would like to have an opportunity to summarize my remarks. I ask that my opposition yield back the remainder of their time so I can summarize my comments. 
Apparently, they don't want to do that. I will briefly make comments so that we can move along. 
First of all, we heard many arguments about voting against the balanced budget amendment. Those who voted against the balanced budget amendment said that we should not tie down the hands of the Senate, the Senate should have the discipline in order not to go into deficit spending. My argument has been that the Senate--I have always supported it because I never felt the Senate, although well-intentioned, would ever allow that to happen. We are asking for a simple amendment to pay down the debt, and one of the arguments made against this is that it may raise a point of order if the Senate goes into deficit spending. Most of us, I think, in this Chamber agree that we should not have deficit spending. So it points out again how very important it is to have these types of plans before us if we really are serious about eliminating deficit spending and pay down the debt. If we want a secure economy and we want to make sure that our children and grandchildren have a secure future and we want to continue to see economic growth, the way we do that is to make a commitment to pay down the debt. So I am here to ask for an aye vote on the Allard amendment. 
I ask for the yeas and nays.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, first of all, I would like to commend the chairman of the Budget Committee, the Senator from New Mexico, for his very laudable statement, which he made earlier on in the debate this evening. I think we are very fortunate in this body to have somebody who is trying to bring accountability to the process. I hope that America was listening, because I think he made some very good points, and I think as Americans we need to stop to think about our priorities and how we would like to see those priorities come down in the budget and how we would like to see those priorities in the budget reflect how we want to live our lives as Americans. 
I have an amendment that I would like to see added to the budget plan that this chairman and his committee has put forward, the plan to pay down the American debt. 
I think back last year when I proposed an amendment to the then-budget, a sense-of-the-Senate resolution, that asked the President of the United States to come forward with a plan on how he might want to pay down the debt that we have. I think we ought to take a little time to define the terms. The deficit is how much more we spend in any 1 year than what we bring in in revenue. The debt is an accumulation of all of that excess spending over the years--the accumulation of all of these deficits. So I am of the view that we need to do something; we need to have a plan before us to pay down that debt. 
The President ignored the sense-of-the-Senate resolution that was part of the budget resolution last year, and we got into the budget debate this year. There was simply not any plan coming from the President, or anybody else at that point, on how we might pay down our national debt running somewhere around $5.6 trillion. 
So I have decided I will put forward my plan on how I think we might be able to pay down the debt. As we go through the discussion and the debate, I will show that we will even have some money left over as we pay down the debt to provide some tax relief for Americans. 
I think we are very fortunate that we have somebody like the chairman of the Budget Committee who really believes we need to work to eliminate the deficit and to balance the budget. It brings forth a certain amount of accountability to the process. I think we need to have leaders like him due to the fact that we do not have a balanced budget amendment. 
I was very disappointed last year that a balanced budget amendment did not pass, because I think we needed that accountability in order to assure that the Members of this Senate would work hard to set priorities and not ignore deficits that have been accumulating over the years out into the future and to continue to allow the debt to grow year after year. 
I would like to move forward by beginning to congratulate, again, Chairman Domenici and the Budget Committee on crafting a sensible resolution that maintains the discretionary spending caps previously set forth. I reemphasize that is very key in this debate to assure that we have protected the future for our children and grandchildren by having a responsible budget which holds the promise that we made to the American people. 
Even though it appears that we will realize a surplus before the year 2002, I believe that it is essential for this Congress to show restraint when it comes to budget surpluses. The future solvency of the Federal Government will likely rest on what we do in the next 3 years. There is simply no doubt that the economy is performing well--much better than anyone 
has expected. But today's rosy predictions could turn out to be a black future if we do not plan appropriately. We must begin the process of paying down the Federal debt and preparing for an investment-based Social Security system. Some have said that they would like to see the surplus used for Social Security. I say let's do it. The fact of the matter is that making payments on the national debt is the best way to provide flexibility for changes in Social Security in the short term. The last time I came to the floor to discuss the national debt, it stood at $5.476 trillion. Yes, $5.476 trillion. Today, even as the U.S. economy continues to grow, we have added $114 billion to the debt, which is now over $5.59 trillion. I believe to not apply at least a portion of any surplus to pay down the debt is simply unconscionable. 
In February, Senator Enzi and I introduced the American Debt Repayment Act legislation. It is legislation that I believe is integral to the future of this country. I am a realist. I understand that we cannot retire the Federal debt immediately. What we can do is create a plan which I hope will become a part of the budget plan by which we pay down the debt over a set number of years. 
This is just a minimal plan. There is nothing in it that says we cannot do more. In fact, I hope we can do more because we need to sign on to a plan to pay down the debt. The American Debt Repayment Act provides such a plan. Senate bill 1608 would amortize and pay off the debt in the year 2028. 
Frankly, this is as simple as it gets. The plan puts the Federal Government on a 30-year mortgage to pay its creditors and place our country on sound financial ground. 
Because I believe that we must have a plan when dealing with the debt, I am offering this legislation today as an amendment to the budget resolution. By approving this amendment, we have made the initial commitment to pay down the debt. We are saying to the American people that the Federal Government has finally recognized the time has come to begin to pay off our Nation's credit card balance. 
I realize that there are many competing interests when it comes to using the surplus, and I am willing to meet my colleagues halfway. Anything above the amortized payment is not affected by my amendment and can be used in any way that Congress may deem appropriate. While I advocate tax relief for the American family from any surplus above the required payment, my colleagues might decide differently. This amendment proves that debt reduction and tax relief are not mutually exclusive. 
I would like to take just a moment and refer to the chart that I have here on the floor with me and talk a little bit about the chart. This is an amortization schedule, much along the lines of what you would be shown if you were to buy a new home. Say you are a new American family; you have just been married; you decide to make probably the first big investment of your marriage, and you will make a commitment to pay that down over 30 years. Your banker may very well give you a similar chart which shows how you are going make that payment year after year to pay down the mortgage on your home. 
This is the plan where we talk about paying down the mortgage of the Federal Government year after year. It is a 30-year plan, just pretty much like everybody's home mortgage. To keep things simple, I have just adopted in this proposal pretty much what the Budget Committee has estimated will be the surpluses for their 5-year plan. I say fine, we will not argue with the Budget Committee. We will keep that in place. But after that period of time, we ought to set $11.7 billion a year, in addition to what we did the year before, towards paying down the debt. This accelerates and accumulates over time. 
If we do that, let's look at the year 2004, after the current plan has been adopted. In the year 2004, we have $616 million left over for tax relief, or maybe program growth or some other needs. When we drop into 2005, that comes up to $2.1 billion over and above what I put together on this amortization part for program growth or to reduce the tax burden. My personal preference, as I stated earlier, is to reduce the tax burden on the American family. 
What happens over a 30-year period? We save $3.7 trillion. I think that is a pretty substantial step, savings that we can use for Social Security reform or maybe doing something with our Medicare problems. This is a plan that shows how we can begin to address those very serious problems we have before us, but to also keep as a top priority of this Congress and this Senate a commitment to pay down this national debt. This plan reflects the amount of savings we are going to save for the future generations, our children and our grandchildren. 
The important point I want to make here is to have a commitment to pay down the debt. With even a minor commitment with a 30-year payment, where we are setting aside $11.7 billion a year, we can accomplish this. We can accomplish this with just a simple, straightforward commitment. I remind everybody, our total budget is somewhere around $1.7 trillion. It is not much of the total picture. 
I believe an excerpt from an article on March 23, 1988, in 
Newsday strikes right at the heart of the issue. I have a quote out of that particular article. I will read part of it. I have it up here on the floor. It says:  
* * * if Congress and the President agreed to toe the line and direct all surpluses to pay down the debt for the next 30 years [apparently he has thought about this, too] and if the economy remained on a steady, moderate growth path, the government could pay off its entire debt while covering Social Security and other costs.

Mr. ALLARD. I say to my colleagues, this is exactly what my amendment does, what is talked about in this article. It creates future flexibility to deal with the impending Social Security crisis by paying down the debt over 30 years. I understand we cannot budget 30 years out--the free market economy does not allow us to do that--but what we can do is adopt a blueprint for the future, a blueprint that Congress can follow to eliminate the debt and show the American people, with a little bit of discipline, we can do that--and a little bit of accountability. The American people know how difficult it is to make a living and pay the home mortgage. Let's give them a hand by retiring the national debt and thereby decrease the interest rates that we pay on everything from a home loan to a student loan. 
If somebody asks you, `How am I going to benefit if you pay down the debt?' they are going to benefit because we have lower interest rates with tremendous savings for home loans and student loans. A tax cut would most certainly be beneficial, but we cannot cut taxes at the expense of our children's future and our grandchildren's future. I ask that each and every one of my colleagues join me in this effort and make a commitment to retiring the Federal debt by voting to pass this simple, commonsense proposal. 
Mr. President, if we don't have any further debate on this on either side, I yield back the time, if that is appropriate at this particular point, so the Senator from Idaho can be recognized.

Many people will say that the cold war is over and then will continue to argue that we can now dismantle our defenses and look inward. I completely disagree with this assessment. I think that Secretary Albright, in testifying before the Armed Services Committee on April 23, 1997, made the proper statement in relating this to an insurance policy, saying `If you don't see smoke, there is no real reason to stop paying for fire insurance.' 
Because of President Reagan and his desire to see the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics put on the ashheap of history, the United States no longer faces the threat of the U.S.S.R. But this is no time to be complacent. U.S. interests are still being threatened by internal political and economic instabilities; the reemergence of ethnic, religious, and historic grievances; terrorism; and the proliferation of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons. 
However, for nearly 50 years, NATO has been the organization which has defended the territory of the countries in the North Atlantic area against all external threats and today we have an historic opportunity to recommit to this security. I believe we must not turn our back on this historic opportunity. We must embrace these new market democracies and say that the old ways are gone and that we welcome them into the free world. Relative peace should not stop us from being engaged for peace and freedom. I believe expanding NATO to the Poland, Hungary, and Czech Republic is the best way to ensure peace and stability. 
Over the last few decades, much of the United States' focus has been on the Middle East, the Far East, and Russia. Throughout history, the United States has been closely linked to the stability of Europe. We have been through two world wars and one cold war in Europe. However, since the formation of NATO, not one major war or aggression has occurred against or between member states, except for Argentia's invasion of the British Falkland Islands. Adding these three deserving countries to NATO can do for all of Europe what it has done for Western Europe. It can strengthen emerging democracies, create conditions for continued prosperity, assist in preventing local rivalries, diminish the need for an arms buildup and destabilizing nationalistic policies, and foster common security interests. 
Just as important, enlargement will signal the end of the cold war. It will further break down the Stalinistic wall. We will reassure the world that these once occupied nations are welcomed free countries. No longer will we validate the old lines of Communism but will begin to secure the historic gains of democracy in Central Europe. Unlike, the Warsaw Pact, these countries are voluntarily wishing to join NATO, without the coercion or force from any NATO member. 
Not only will the Stalinist wall be gone, but the acceptance of these three countries will positively show that the West will not lock these countries out, but will lock in Central Europe's democracies. Enlargement will promote multinational defense structures and prevent the renationalization of these democracies. Enlargement will fill the security vacuum created with the fall of the Soviet Union. If this vacuum is not filled, there is concern that the area will begin to divide nationalistically and Central Europe could look like the former Yugoslavia. 
However, just the possibility of membership into NATO has given these countries the incentive to peacefully resolve many of their border disputes. Since 1991, there have been 10 major accords settling differences and much of this progress is credited to the opportunity to join NATO. Even if some of the old disputes arise, NATO membership will help keep the peace, just as it has done in relation to the problems between NATO members Greece and Turkey. I do not believe the United Nations, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the European Union, or any other international bodies have the ability to keep the peace and promote the stability needed that NATO can bring to the area. 
We all know that there has been much concern about the Russian response to NATO enlargement. The Russian leaders have been very public in their displeasure about enlargement. I believe that this is do in part to their misperception that the Alliance poses a threat to Russia's security, NATO is not, and never has been an offensive alliance. NATO is a defensive alliance only. 
We must respect Russia's concerns. But as my respected predecessor Senator Hank Brown has written, `[W]orking closely with Russia in an attempt to allay their concerns makes sense. Slowing or altering NATO expansion . . . hands the Russian government a veto pen.' Like Senator Brown, I believe that this would be a mistake. An enlarged NATO only promotes security and stability in an area of Europe that is vital to Russian security. The invited states must clearly know that they are no longer `eastern bloc nations' but an integral of the circle of democratic countries. 
Lastly, with any expansion there is a concern about the cost. There have been wide ranging estimates. The total amount is estimated at $27 to $35 billion for all current members and the invitees over 13 years, from 1997-2009. A bulk of this cost is to modernize and reform militaries and make them operable with NATO. However, with the United States already having the world's premier armed forces, the bulk of the cost will be incurred by our allies and the three invitees, as they upgrade their forces and facilities 
to meet those standards of the United States and NATO. 
With the addition of these countries, the U.S. percentage share of the NATO budget will go down, and the resolution before us provides that U.S. costs will be kept under control and not be allowed to subsidize those members that are not putting forward their share of the funds. Adequate defense systems always cost money, but alliances make costs more evenly shared through the alliance. 
Let me end with this: NATO enlargement is the Western World's way to show that the cold war is over and that we welcome these countries to freedom. The new threats we face can only be met by forming new alliances to ensure that these democracies do not fall prey to nationalistic or terrorist regimes. The Czech Republic, Poland, and Hungary, know life without freedom and now deserve the freedom and security that only NATO can provide. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Senator from Wyoming for giving me an opportunity this morning to talk a little bit about Social Security reform. It is a delight to be able to work with the senior Senator from Wyoming on this and many, many other issues. 
One of the most important challenges that we face as elected officials is the reform of Social Security. This issue, I think, is a test of our concern for future generations. The problem is far enough into the future that we could get away with doing absolutely nothing, but I do not believe this is acceptable. I am committed, and I think a majority of Members of both parties are committed, to the reform of Social Security, and doing it now. 
Currently, Social Security payroll taxes exceed the level of benefits that are paid out. We, therefore, have a temporary surplus in the program. This will continue to be the case until around the year 2013 when we begin to run Social Security deficits. Unfortunately, none of the current Social Security surpluses are saved. They are spent on other Government programs. If a private company established a pension system like this, the administrator would be sent to jail. 
With each passing year, we lose valuable time. Several years ago, the bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform forecast where they thought the budget would be headed over the next several decades. The most startling fact was that unless we reform entitlements such as Social Security and Medicare, those entitlements will consume virtually all tax revenues by the year 2030. Obviously, taxes would either have to be increased dramatically or spending would have to be cut dramatically on critical Government functions such as defense, law enforcement, transportation, and education. 
This is a future that we simply must avoid. But we can only do this by moving now to reform Social Security. In my view, it is time to begin the transition from an exclusively tax-financed system to an investment-based system. This will take time. Any transition will probably have to be implemented over a period of 25 to 30 years. That is why it is so critical that we begin the transition no later than the year 2000. 
Obviously, under any transition, we must guarantee current 
retirees the return that they have been promised. However, younger generations should be given the option of setting up some type of personal investment account similar to an IRA for a portion of their payroll taxes. Currently, the payroll tax on wages that is dedicated to Social Security is 12.4 percent. Half of this is paid by employees and the other half is paid by the employers. An initial transition might permit 2 percent to be invested in a mandatory account held by the taxpayer. These funds could be invested in common stock, bonds, Treasury notes, money markets, or any mixture desired by the taxpayer. The principal difference between this and the current system is that the personal investment account would be real money. This type of system is gradually being put into place in countries around the world. Australia, Chile, and Great Britain have also begun the transition to an investment-based pension system. 
The long-term benefits are significant. This system would gradually reduce the claim on the U.S. Treasury that exists with the current system. Taxpayers would get a better return on their payroll tax dollars. Each and every American would become a shareholder in the economy. The economy would benefit from the higher level of national savings by forcing everybody to save for their retirement. 
Mr. President, this is just one of a number of ideas being considered for Social Security reform. The important point is that we need to begin a national debate on this issue right now. We need to set to work now in devising a retirement system for the 21st century. 
Mr. President, I now yield the floor. 
Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I would like to respond briefly to the senior Senator from New York. I compliment him on his leadership on this particular issue. Obviously, those of us who are just new to the Senate appreciate the background and wealth of information that he brings to this issue and actually look forward to working very closely with him on these issues. A lot of what he says I agree with, and I think it is an issue that needs to be addressed today. With people like the Senator from New York working on this problem, I feel even more confident we will be able to address the problem in the near future.

 Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an individual who has made a significant contribution to the journalistic profession in the state of Colorado. 
Bob Rawlings, publisher and editor of the Pueblo Chieftain and Sunday Chieftain and Star-Journal, has worked at the same newspaper for more than 51 years. During his tenure at the newspaper he has worked as a reporter, advertising salesman, General Manager, and since 1980 has served as Publisher and Editor. In 1984 he was selected to be president of the Star-Journal Publishing Corporation, which owns and operates both newspapers. 
In 1985-86, Bob Rawlings served as President of the Colorado Press Association. He also has served as a member and past-chairman of the Colorado Bar-Press Committee, and is a past president of the Rocky Mountain Ad Manager's Association. 
He was voted `Colorado Newspaper Person of the Year' in 1989, and was selected `Citizen of the Year' in 1993 by the Pueblo Chamber of Commerce. In 1994, Bob Rawlings was honored as `Colorado Business Leader of the Year,' and at this year's Colorado Press Association's Annual Convention in February, Bob was presented with the `Gold Rule Makeup Award,' which is the highest honor a member of the press can achieve in Colorado. 
For more than a half-century, Bob Rawlings has served his community, state and nation. He represents the best and the brightest of his profession, and the citizens of Pueblo and the state of Colorado are honored to call him one of their own. It is individuals like Bob Rawlings who make America great. It is my pleasure to honor him and thank him for all he has done, and all that he will continue to do for Pueblo and Colorado.

Mr. ALLARD. Thank you very much. 
Mr. President, I just wanted to briefly stand up in recognition of the hard work of my colleague from Colorado on this very, very important issue to Colorado. And I want to add my support to the Colorado Ute Indian Water Rights Settlement Act of 1988. 
I have a number of comments that I would like to submit to the Record. But I just want to recognize in a public way that Senator Campbell has worked very hard on this. Obviously, I think both of us would have preferred to have the full project. But in light of what has come to light, I think most of us agree that we need to keep our word with the Ute Indians in the area, and we need to proceed ahead. It is vital to the area. It is important. Even though it might not be ideal for what we would like to see happen, at least we need to move ahead. 
I thank the senior Senator from Colorado for yielding to me and wish him the very best. I will be there supporting him all the way.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I want to add my support to the Colorado Ute Indian Water Rights Settlement Act of 1998. 
The project that is before us now represents a scaled down version of what was originally promised. 
This project will be inexpensive enough to allow it to pass through Congress and finally do something towards fulfilling the obligations of the United States to the Tribes and their members, while at the same time not being so scaled down and cheap as to fail to live up to the promise our government made years ago. 
The Ute Tribes have accepted this proposal even though it is significantly less than what they were first offered. 
As to whether they are doing this because a smaller project fits all their needs, or because they are realistic enough to admit that the long history of broken treaties is most likely not about to stop now, I'm sure we all have opinions. 
The Utes are willing to accept this deal for a very simple reason: 
They need water. 
Anybody here can go to a water cooler and get a glass of water. But if you want to water your garden, you need a bigger source--a garden hose and a faucet. 
And if you need to water your farm, or supply industry, you need a bigger source yet. 
The Ute Indians are hoping they can rely on the Animas La Plata for their water needs, and they are hoping they can rely on the Government that promised them that water to follow through on delivering the water. 
The Act before us focuses on the three main items needed to fulfill our obligation. It calls for a storage reservoir to be built to hold the promised water, the conveyance needed to transport water to the reservoir, and the guarantee to the Ute tribes of the water in that reservoir. 
These three things are only, oh, 130 years or so in the coming. The Ute Indian Tribe signed a treaty with the U.S. Government in 1868. This treaty promised the Ute Indian Tribes a permanent, reliable source of water. 
In 1988, the Colorado Ute Indian Water Rights Settlement Act reaffirmed these rights. It called for a much larger project than is before us now. 
The Ute Indian Tribe would, of course, probably still prefer the full Animas La Plata Project. Those who favor upholding the word of the United States government to the Ute Indian Tribe would probably prefer the full project. However, there are those who don't seem to care about these matters who have blocked a larger project. 
What we are considering now is smaller, cheaper, and less extensive, but the beneficiaries of it are willing to compromise. They need something, anything, more than they need an ideal. 
There are many reasons to vote for this project. I think the best reason is not because it is authorized by Congress, not because it is ratified by the Supreme Court, not because it is supported by the last three Presidents, and not even because it will save the country over $400 million from the originally agreed-to project. 
The best reason is simply that this project should be voted for because it is the duty and treaty obligation of the United States to the Ute Indian Tribes.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Upper Colorado River and San Juan River Endangered Fish Recovery Act of 1998, legislation that is designed to authorize activities taking place on the Upper Colorado River Basin and the San Juan River Basins to protect various endangered fish species. 
The legislation is the product of meetings between water districts, power users, state and federal governments, and environmental groups and by no means reflects consensus. What it does reflect is a bargaining point that all agree is the proper place to begin. At the request of these groups I am introducing this legislation. I would also like to include in the Record letters requesting that I introduce this legislation. 
I want my position to be clear, it is my view that authorizing legislation should provide certainty to water users in Colorado under the Endangered Species Act and should also allow Coloradans a greater ability to develop their full allotment of the Colorado River. It's also my view that the Fish & Wildlife Service, who are preparing a biological opinion on the program, should reach the conclusion that the program meets the criteria necessary to reach that goal. 
So while at this point I am only introducing this legislation upon request, I hope that after further negotiations among all parties and the biological opinion issued by the FWS all parties involved will support this, or subsequent, legislation.

Mr. ALLARD. I want to thank the chairman for yielding, and I will engage the chairman and the ranking member in a brief colloquy, if I may. 
I had an amendment, 1328, filed and was prepared to offer it for a vote. The amendment would have added particulate matter and ozone as an equally weighted factor for funding from the Congestion Mitigation Air Quality Program (CMAQ). 
My concern is that Colorado has problems from PM-10 in the Denver Metro Area that are transportation related that could be lessened from inclusion in the CMAQ program. My understanding is that high altitude states may have a problem with respect to this pollutant that low altitude states may not have. As the chairman and the ranking member of the Environment and Public Works Committee both know, my amendment would have an impact not only on the CMAQ program, but on the formula as a whole. 
Out of respect to the hours of work put in by the Senator Chafee, Warner, and Baucus, I'm not going to offer the amendment. However, H.R. 2400 which was reported out of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee in the House of Representatives does make allowances for funding PM-10 in CMAQ. 
It's my hope that the leadership of the EPW Committee would find a way to help areas like Colorado deal with their unique problems with respect to PM and carbon monoxide in conference and I will provide any assistance necessary in working toward that end. I will not be offering that amendment with the assurances that you will continue to work with me.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, first of all, I would like to commend the chairman of the Banking Committee, Chairman D'Amato, for all of his hard work on the issue of mass transit and the authorization legislation. 
I have listened with interest to some of the comments both of my colleagues have made here on the floor, and what they say is true in many regards--that we have some real needs in urban metropolitan areas; we have real needs in regard to congestion; we have real needs in trying to deal with the problems of air pollution; we have real needs in trying to deal with the elderly and how they are going to get back and forth to meet their needs of everyday living. 
I have been working with Senator Rod Grams for an amendment on six guideways and the new-start amendment. All it is dealing with is new dollars that will be going to fix guideway systems. We are talking in this amendment about a third of the dollars that actually go into mass transit. 
The State that I come from, Colorado, maybe falls into the classification of a rural State, but the fact remains that many States like Colorado are experiencing tremendous growth. We are not having a rural problem; we are having urban problems. We are having problems with air pollution. We are having problems with congestion and how people are going to get back and forth to work in a timely manner. 
So those problems that many of the larger communities of our country have experienced for many years we are now beginning to experience while moving into a new century. People are looking to the West, and they are looking to the South to retire. They are becoming used to using a lot of these fixed guideway systems. So they are moving to States like Colorado. Maybe they are moving to Arizona, California, Florida, Southern States because it is warmer weather, it is a good place to retire. Consequently, many of the communities that were small are now experiencing growth problems and are experiencing traffic problems in trying to meet the needs of their citizens. 
I have many communities on the front range area of Colorado. That is the area that is just east of the Rockies. The Denver metro area runs all the way from Pueblo, CO, and Colorado Springs, there is a Denver metro area, then north to Boulder and Longmont and Fort Collins. This is an area that extends for about 120 miles. There is a lot of growth occurring in these areas. These communities are looking at ways of how they begin to move traffic off of roads where there is a lot of congestion and where they are dealing with some serious air pollution problems. They want to clean up the air in Colorado. We are privileged that we live in a beautiful State. We want to see it remain that way. 
If we can have a fair option, at least, of trying to tap in on some of the money for new fixed guideway systems and new starts, then it gives these communities an opportunity to begin to plan and to begin to become a part of the formula so that mass transit dollars can become available for those communities. 
As a member of the Banking Committee, I would like to recognize that the chairman has fought hard for more dollars for mass transit. Because of his effort, obviously, we are all going to benefit from it. 
I would also like to thank Rod Grams, who is also a member of the committee, who has been working with me, who is from Minnesota and who is cosponsoring my amendment, for fighting hard to try to get the committee and get the Senate to recognize that as we move into the next century things are changing, that there are States that are beginning to experience urban problems, and they need to have some solutions that may be available through new mass transit projects and need to have an opportunity to access these dollars. 
I have worked hard to see that Colorado and similar States get a fair return on their gas contributions to the highway trust fund. Now I am going to work hard to make sure that there is a fair return as far as mass transit dollars because we are moving into a new century. Many of these States that in the past have not had a need for these dollars now find the need to resolve some of their urban problems that are developing. These efforts, I think, become particularly important in the context of additional funding that appears to have been secured for mass transit. 
The obvious question is which States are going to get this additional money? Is the money going to be distributed under the same formulas in place up to now, or will there be a fair allocation of new funds? 
I would like to talk a little bit about the Allard-Grams amendment, which I think is a very straightforward amendment. It simply states that any new money in the Fixed Guideway Modernization Formula, and the New Starts Program, will go to new transit systems. We are only talking about a third of the mass transit dollars. This is not a minimum allocation amendment. It does not require any set allocation to any State. This amendment would specifically address two of the mass transit programs and requires that new funds go to new systems. All of these transit projects would have to meet the criteria that are currently in law for funding under these programs. 
Mass transit is funded with both gas tax funds and general funds. Currently, 2 cents of the gas tax is allocated to mass transit, and under the recently approved budget agreement that is going to rise to nearly 3 cents. Obviously, there is a lot at stake here for the future. 
Certain areas of the country have done very well under the current system, but some of the disparities, I think, are very striking. From 1992 through 1997, my State received only 50 percent of the return on its gas contributions to mass transit, and many States get far less. This current year, 1998, was actually the first year that my State did well in the program. While I am obviously hopeful that this will continue, it is very important to lay the groundwork to make this happen. 
The funding disparities are striking in some of the mass transit programs. One of the two programs that this amendment addresses is the Fixed Guideway Modernization Formula. Up to this point, 90 percent of the funds, that is, under current law, 90 percent of the funds have gone to 11 cities that are specifically designated in the formula. While the committee bill alters this somewhat, it ensures that the lion's share of the Fixed Guideway Modernization Formula funds will continue to go to 11 statutory cities. 
This is an authorization bill for the 21st century. It takes us through 2003. It is, therefore, very important to recognize that the urban growth in this country is occurring in the West and in the South. If Federal programs are going to be effective, they need to shift with the times, and the high-growth regions of the country are going to have the greatest justification for new mass transit dollars. The Allard-Grams amendment would afford the Senate the opportunity to look at how a portion of the mass transit money is being distributed. 
As noted, the amendment addresses the Fixed Guideway Modernization Formula and the New Starts Program. We selected these two programs because they have, up to this point, been funded entirely by gas tax revenues. These two programs combined constitute about one-third of the mass transit dollars--only one-third of the mass transit dollars. I make this point for a simple reason: This amendment is not an attempt to reallocate the entire mass transit funding system; this amendment is only a modest first step towards equity for those areas of the Nation that are experiencing the greatest degree of population growth. Even with the changes proposed by this amendment, a small number of cities will continue to do very well when it comes to mass transit funding. Our amendment simply requires that new money, money above the 1997 funding levels, will go to new transit systems. Old transit systems will continue to receive what they received in 1997. The difference is they will not continue with such a large, disproportionate share of new funding. 
The problem is most glaring in the Fixed Guideway Modernization Program. This formula program funds everything from underground rail to light rail to bus shuttles and even HOV lanes. While 45 cities currently receive some funding under the program, it has historically allocated 90 percent of funds to 11 cities. I would like to ask the Members of the Senate here to view a chart with me that demonstrates the unfairness of the formula up to now. This is under current law. In this formula, we have 11 statutory cities that are getting 90 percent of the dollars in the Fixed Guideway Modernization Formula. The other 34 cities are getting 10 percent. That is current law. 
I would like to recognize the chairman's efforts. Realizing that there is a problem there, he has tried to do something in this bill. We should not forget that all transit systems have modernization needs. In fact, when we refer to the 34 new systems we are speaking only in relative terms. Before any system even qualifies for Fixed Guideway Modernization Formula funds, it first must be in operation for at least 7 years. In our part of the country, that is getting out of the realm of a new system, if they have been there for 7 years. Many parts of the so-called new transit systems are even much older than that. 
Obviously, the 11 cities have the largest systems, and generally the oldest systems. One would expect them to get a 
large portion of the money. I concede that. However, I think most would agree with me that 90 percent is excessive. The committee bill does begin to address this past disparity. I bring up a chart to show where we are as far as the committee bill is concerned. Again, I compliment the committee and our chairman for his work in this regard. 
This is, again, the Fixed Guideway Modernization Formula and what happens at $1 billion of total funding. Eleven of the statutory cities in this one program, under the Fixed Guideway Modernization Formula, will get 83 percent of the dollars; 17 percent is then divided among these 34 other cities. Even with the committee bill, we see there is a split of 83 percent for the old and 17 percent for the new at the $1 billion funding level. If it is less than that, obviously the 11-cities' statutory amount is going to be protected and there will be even fewer dollars available for these 34 cities as we move below the $1 billion level. 
Let me explain how our amendment would change the way it is now, in the current bill. First, we leave the current Fixed Guideway Modernization Formula in place up to the 1997 funding level. So 90 percent of those funds would continue to go to the 11 statutory systems that receive these funds now. This would continue in each and every year; however, the amendment provides any amounts above the current funding levels would go to new systems.

Mr. ALLARD. I appreciate your willingness to work with us on these issues. And like the Senator from New York, I am not inflexible; I want to recognize the problems we have in these areas and be sensitive to that. All I am asking is that the Senate and the chairman and everybody--and I believe you are doing this--think a little bit about what is happening demographically as we move into a new century, and what has happened to those populations in other parts of the country that are going to be facing some of these problems you have been dealing with for many years. In fact, people from my part of the country, I hope, would consult with people from your part of the country in dealing with these problems, because these are new problems for us. 
There is a tremendous amount of commitment from the local communities in Colorado. They are willing to make commitments to more than pay for their fair share of the mass transit programs. They are not looking for a lot of Federal dollars, but they would like to have a little bit of help. They are willing to commit a lot of local dollars to these programs, even despite the fact that, these are programs that are paid entirely by gas tax dollars. And so in a way, they feel that, well, we spent this money on these gas taxes with the use of our cars and trucks. They have been paying for these in some ways because they have been buying fuel for their vehicles. So they feel that they do not want to be left out of the system. 
I would just like to show what our amendment does, the Allard-Grams amendment on the fixed guideway. It actually changed the formula for 68 percent for 11 statutory cities and then 32 percent for the other 34. And there is some difference of opinion as to where that fair level is. But, like I said, we are willing to be sensitive to your needs. I appreciate the chairman's willingness to be sensitive to our needs. But I would like to explain the second part of our amendment which addresses the New Starts Program. 
Here our amendment, once again, addresses only new money, and we do not take any money from projects already receiving funds from fully funded grant agreements. And why is this amendment necessary? 
Well, Mr. President, one might assume that the term `new starts' means that money allocated through this program must go to new transit program projects. Actually, new starts are currently defined very broadly, and much of the money goes to additions on the same old systems that receive most of the fixed guideway money. And the Senator from New York pointed out those needs. 
Under the Allard-Grams amendment, all money above the 1997 funding level would be set aside for new projects. We define `new projects' as entirely new fixed guideway systems or additions to fixed guideway systems that have been in revenue 
operation for 15 years or less, which is different than current law which says that they have to be in operation at least 7 years. 
Again, this change would not greatly alter the current system, but it would set some important benchmarks for where we would be heading in the 21st century. As I noted earlier, the amendment would not alter the process for selecting worthwhile projects. Both Congress and the Federal Transit Administration would continue to determine which projects have merit and fund them accordingly, and which projects the local communities would be most willing to contribute to to make sure it happens from locally raised funds. 
Currently, there are dozens of potential new starts located in States throughout the Nation. Unless we more carefully earmark funds specifically for new systems, these projects will continue to wait for many years. 
Now, this amendment is an important change, and its impact grows with each year. Those older systems will continue to get a very generous allocation, in my view. However, the new systems in the fastest growing regions of the Nation will be able to claim a growing portion of the funds. 
Now, I have not moved my amendment at this time, and I am not going to at this time, because I want to continue to have this dialogue on the floor with the chairman of the Banking Committee. But there are some very important issues here that I think we need to begin to think about in getting this country ready to address problems that will be coming up in the next century. 
So I now yield to the Senator from Minnesota, Senator Grams, who is a cosponsor on this amendment with me. And I would like to recognize the contributions he has made both to the Senate and to this issue of transportation, particularly mass transit.  
Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I again thank the chairman of the Banking Committee for his willingness to work with both Senator Grams and myself. I think we had a very productive floor debate this morning about the transit needs of the different sectors of this Nation. I think Senator D'Amato has certainly showed his statesmanship this morning in recognition of the transit needs of the more rapidly growing regions of this Nation, much of which is occurring in the Western United States as well as in the Southern States. States like Colorado are experiencing extraordinary growth, and our citizens are certainly anxious to have a fair return on transit dollars. As the chairman knows, Senator Grams and I have filed and discussed an amendment that addresses new dollars that will flow into the New Starts and Fixed Guideway Modernization Programs. 
The chairman has agreed to accept some of the fixed guideway language that was included in our amendment. He has offered to work with us further in the conference committee. I now submit the revised language and urge its acceptance. I thank again Chairman D'Amato for his willingness to ensure high-growth areas that are experiencing problems of congestion and air quality nonattainment shall be recipients of Federal dollars for New Start projects. In addition, we will continue to work with him on the Fixed Guideway Modernization Program to see whether some of the high-growth cities can be eligible for funding on an accelerated basis. I thank the chairman. 
Mr DAMATO. I thank the Senator.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to congratulate my good friend, Senator Enzi, and the University of Wyoming's basketball team on their hard-fought overtime victory over my alma mater, Colorado State University. Senator Enzi and I have engaged in a friendly competition whenever our schools play each other. These two universities are located just an hour apart on the border of Colorado and Wyoming and have always had quite a rivalry between them. Earlier this year, Senator Enzi had the opportunity to praise the Rams as CSU defeated Wyoming on January 24, with the score of 53 to 46. But like most border wars, the tables have turned and now the pleasure is mine. Not only do I have the tremendous opportunity to talk about the Wyoming basketball team on the Senate floor, but I have a tremendous opportunity to wear the Wyoming tie here for a day while I talk about that great basketball team from the University of Wyoming. 
Last Saturday's game marked the 184th time over 88 years that these two teams have met when CSU went head to head with the University of Wyoming in yet another border war. To my dismay, the Rams were defeated in overtime, 69 to 64. It was a hard-fought victory where both teams played outstanding games. Although CSU outrebounded Wyoming and played a tough defensive game, the Cowboys' offense was the deciding factor. 
Wyoming should be commended for having a great season this year, with a record of 18 and 6. Coach Larry Shyatt should also be recognized for bringing this team to the best season they have had in 11 years. The Cowboys certainly cannot be labeled `slowpokes,' considering they have defeated top-ranking teams such as New Mexico and Utah. In fact, the Cowboys are now in third place in the Western Athletic Conference Mountain Division and will be competing for postseason tournament consideration in March. Wyoming will be given serious consideration as a WAC entry for the NCAA Tournament. I commend Wyoming's basketball team, their athletic department, and the University of Wyoming for a job well done. 
Although Wyoming won the most recent border war, I would be remiss if I did not congratulate at least the Rams' seniors and wish CSU the best of luck in their remaining games. I look forward to a strong WAC contingent in the NCAA tournament and hope that CSU will be there to represent the Western Athletic Conference as well. 
The University of Wyoming basketball team is to be commended for a great win against Colorado State University. I am excited about the competition in the WAC, typified by the longstanding rivalry between the border universities. 
Great job, to the University of Wyoming. 
I yield the remainder of my time.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I come to the floor today in support of HR 2631. Let there be no mistake, I support the line item veto, but, perhaps just as important, I support Congressional authority to override the veto if deemed necessary. In fact, one of the reasons that I support the line item veto is to make Members go on record in support of or against the vetoed items. I am willing to go on record and support this Resolution without hesitation. One such program is to fund the Army Strategic Mobility Program railhead project at Fort Carson. This project is recognized by the Department of the Army as a need for readiness and is included in the Administration's own Five Year Plan. 
To give a brief history, the current railhead at Fort Carson was built in the 1940's and includes several one-story wooden warehouse buildings that were built during the same period. Since then, the railhead has received no major improvements or overhaul. 
While the loading and storage capabilities were adequate for many years, they are no longer. Fort Carson is now home to two TIER I units, the 10th Special Forces and the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment. As you know, TIER I units must be able to deploy within 72 hours upon receiving notification. The current capabilities fall far short of this requirement. The Army Strategic Mobility Program requires that the railhead deliver 500 cars for a two day outload. The current railhead only allows for 314, well short of that required for the ASMP. 
The 3rd ACR is the only heavy cavalry unit in the Army's inventory, and as such it can be sent to any theater of operations. It is critical that this unit be able to meet its deployment requirements. Unfortunately, at this time it cannot due to the inadequacy of the Fort Carson railhead. 
Also, Fort Carson would serve as a major staging area for numerous National Guard and reserve units in time of war and the rail-loading and warehousing deficiencies could hamper those activities as well. 
Mr. President, when Congress granted the President the line item veto we did not make him the final voice on budget priorities. Congress has the Constitutional obligation to have the final say on all revenue and outlay matters. This is how I believe the system should work. The President vetoes projects and if the Congress disagrees, then two-thirds of the Members in each body must vote to override. Today, it is my belief that Congress will use its veto-override power to approve these projects which are in the Administration's Five Year Plan.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I spent the month of January attending town meetings throughout the State of Colorado. That is one of the things, when I go back to my State, that I spend a lot of time doing--visiting the counties and visiting with the people of Colorado. Over the years, we continue to have the issue of taxes brought up in the town meetings--probably more so now than at any time that I can recall since having town meetings. 
The American people simply want to have their tax system reformed, particularly those in Colorado. They want lower taxes, they want a simpler tax system, and they want less intrusive means of collecting those taxes. 
Last year, Congress enacted modest tax relief, but it was only a first step. It's time to move forward with more aggressive tax reform. 
Today, I am introducing legislation that will do four things: 
It will continue to reduce the capital gains tax to a top rate of 14 percent. 
It will restore the one-year holding period for capital gains treatment. 
It will index capital gains and, thereby, eliminate the taxation of gains that are due solely to inflation. 
And then, finally, it will eliminate the estate tax. 
These changes will provide important tax relief for families and businesses, and continue to ensure that our economy remains the most competitive in the world. 
Mr. President, the new year has certainly brought good news concerning the Federal budget. But let's be honest. The budget is balancing because of the hard work of the American people, not because of any bold action by the Federal Government. Economic performance in recent years has exceeded all expectations. The result is that the American people have been sending greater and greater amounts of their earnings to Washington. The budget is balancing because of an explosion in tax receipts, not because of any restraint in spending. In fact, the budget continues to grow at a healthy pace. Federal spending in 1998 is estimated to be 4.3 percent above the 1997 level--well in excess of inflation. Many would like this to continue. 
The President assured us in a previous State of the Union Address that, `the era of big Government is over.' But it is clear that he is now proposing a new era of big Government. 
I favor a different course. We should not squander the people's surplus on more Government. Instead, we should begin to pay down the debt and reform the tax system. We should put American families ahead of the insatiable appetite of Washington, DC, for more Government spending. 
Despite last year's budget bill, taxes remain higher than they have ever been. Tax freedom day--the day to which the average American works to pay the combined Federal, State, and local tax burden--is May 9, which is the latest it has ever been. A reduction in the Federal debt and a reasonable level of taxation should be the twin objectives of Congress as we enter the next century. Our job is to ensure that the bridge to the 21st century does not become a toll bridge. 
Mr. President, let me begin with a discussion of capital gains taxes. I call the capital gains tax the `growth tax.' Nearly all Americans own capital, and they experience a tax on that capital when they sell the stocks, or a small business, or a farm. 
Mr. President, let's look at how this capital gains, or growth tax, hits ordinary working Americans. Stock ownership has doubled in the last 7 years, to the point where 43 percent of all adult Americans own stock. Obviously, with those numbers, stock ownership is not just confined to the wealthy; it is spread throughout society. Today, half of the investors are women, and half are noncollege graduates. Stocks are typically held for retirement, education expenses, and other long-term goals. This is precisely the type of saving and investing that we need in our economy. 
Mr. President, I can't leave this topic without talking about small business owners and farmers. There is no clearer area where the `growth tax' makes no sense. Millions of American families put their lives into building small businesses and farms. Often, those businesses or farms are sold to finance a decent retirement. But this can only occur after Uncle Sam gets his cut of one-third or more of all the gains. 
Simply put, low taxation makes it less costly to take the risks that are critical in a capitalist economy. I am proposing that we enact a maximum capital gains tax of 14 percent, with those in the lowest tax bracket paying only 7 percent. Last year's reduction of the capital gains rate was a big plus, but it came with a price--the holding period required to qualify for the lower tax was extended from 12 months to 18 months. 
The holding period change is a poor attempt by the Government to micromanage the economy. This is the type of Government management that has so clearly failed in Asia. A market economy functions best when capital flows freely, unencumbered by Government distortions. The holding period for long-term capital gains treatment has been 12 months for years, and it should stay that way. 
Mr. President, an additional mistake that Congress made in last year's bill was a failure to include indexing. The real `growth tax' is often much higher than 20 percent. This is because our Tax Code does not protect Americans from taxation on capital gains that result from inflation. This is one of the most unfair aspects of the growth tax. Government policies contribute to inflation, and Government turns around and taxes its citizens on that inflation. 
For this reason, I fought hard to see that indexing was included last year. I offered an amendment to the tax bill that would have added indexing. The amendment was carefully structured to avoid any revenue loss. Obviously, I was disappointed with the defeat of this amendment. I presume that this was due largely to the President's opposition to indexing and his veto threat. Despite this, we got a strong vote, and I promised that I would be back. 
I have included indexing in this bill, and I fully intend to offer this at each opportunity. Some have dismissed indexing as `too costly,' but for me this is an issue of fundamental fairness. It is wrong for the Federal Government to tax citizens on inflation. 
Since I mentioned the issue of cost, let me make a few points on this. I have long maintained that a capital gains tax cut will increase revenue. In the short run, it encourages the sale of assets that would not otherwise occur. 
This obviously increases revenue. 
In the long run, a rate cut facilitates a higher level of economic growth. This also results in greater tax revenue. 
Unfortunately, during last year's tax debate, we continued to operate under revenue models that forecast a loss to the government from the capital gains rate cut. 
I hope we can soon put this notion to rest for good. 
It is already apparent that capital gains revenues will be coming into the Treasury at a considerably higher level than forecast last year when we were talking about capital gains. 1998 capital gains revenues could be as much as 50% higher than previously forecast. 
Even state governments will benefit from the rate cut. Earlier this month, analysts for the Colorado Legislature forecast that the capital gains tax changes would result in an additional $38 million this year for the Colorado state budget. 
Obviously, the impact at the federal level will be many times greater.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to add my vocal support to S. 1575, the bill to rename Washington National Airport the `Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.' 
Last year, I was the first co-sponsor of this measure. At the time, I thought I had just beat the rush, and that I would be merely the first of a long list of co-sponsors. I though that surely, if every Member of this chamber was aware of the debt they and their country owe to Ronald Reagan, this bill would have 99 co-sponsors. 
Instead, I was surprised that only 35 others have co-sponsored Senator Coverdell's bill. I was surprised when I learned that this bill is encountering serious opposition. And I will be more than surprised if this bill does not pass. I will be shocked and I will be saddened. It is not often we are able to consider a bill so simple and so right as this one. 
Ronald Reagan can truthfully be called one of the greatest living Americans. President Reagan's most important contribution to his country was the leadership he provided during the West's long struggle with totalitarian communism. When he called the Soviet Union an `evil empire' media pundits scorned him. Today, we all know that he was right. But President Reagan provided far more than rhetoric in the struggle against communism. In 1980, America was dangerously weak and demoralized. President Reagan understood this and he directed the strengthening of all aspects of our military, coordinating our efforts with other members of the Western alliance. 
From the point when Ronald Reagan entered the White House, no additional territory fell to the Communists. From that point forward the tide began to turn. On all fronts, the Reagan administration backed the forces of freedom. Reagan supported Solidarity in Poland, he backed the freedom fighters in Afghanistan, Grenada was liberated, and he helped democratic struggles throughout Latin America. The Soviet Union was everywhere confronted by a Western alliance that 
had finally awakened to the dangers of appeasement. The alliance was greatly strengthened by the friendship and support of President Reagan's close friend and ally, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Together they thwarted Communism and made the Kremlin and its puppet states aware that the free world intended to remain free. The West won the cold war, and Ronald Reagan deserves much of the credit. 
President Reagan's second great triumph was his economic plan. He was the first modern President to directly challenge the notion that more government was good. In his view, Government does not solve problems, it subsidizes them. While this view is widely held today, it was ridiculed throughout the 1960's and 1970's. During those years, Reagan was nearly alone in his struggle against the endless growth of government. But he never altered his message. Unlike other politicians, he stood firm, and gradually the country moved his way. He stopped the slow socialist slide of our Nation, and instead implemented policies that provided the catalyst for the unparalleled financial and economic security and freedom we now enjoy. 
The Reagan program of lower taxes and less regulation was a tremendous success. In the early Reagan years all income taxes were cut across-the-board by 25 percent. The decade to follow witnessed the longest peacetime economic expansion in the history of our Nation. All income groups experienced significant income gains from 1980 to 1989. Twenty million new jobs were created, and the vast majority were high-paying professional, production, and technical jobs. 
In the late 1970's inflation was as high as 18 percent, and interest rates rose to 21 percent. The Reagan economic program brought both of these down dramatically. The 1970's malaise brought on by high inflation, skyrocketing interest rates, high unemployment, and high taxes was replaced by an economy that fostered opportunity, growth, and optimism. 
President Reagan rallied our Nation. He reminded each of us of our proud history and heritage. He was never afraid to proclaim his love for 
America. Most important, he stood up for what he believed. He knew the importance of strength and resolve. The result was the most successful Presidency in decades. As Reagan himself reminded us:  
History comes and goes, but principles endure and inspire future generations to defend liberty, not as a gift from government, but as a blessing from our creator. 
I know that the Federal Triangle building will be opening soon. I know that it is named after Reagan. But Ronald Reagan was a man of the people, not of bureaucrats. When he was called `The Great Communicator' it was not because of his skill with memos or inter-office correspondence. It was because of his ability to speak with, and for, the average American. Some good can come of the irony in naming the second largest and by far the most expensive federal building in America after Ronald Reagan. We can let the name of the Ronald Reagan building stand as a direct counter to the waste and excess involved in its building. It will also be a constant reminder to the civil service workers inside of President Reagan's belief in a small, responsible and effective government. 
But again, Reagan was not a man who loved big government. He should not be memorialized solely by a big government building. The Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport--an airport that is used by our government, but more importantly, by our people, and by the free people of the world--should stand as the monument to the Great American President. 
President Reagan's 87 Birthday is Friday. We need to approve this bill, and present him with a small but well deserved gift from the country he so ably served.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I have, of course, from time to time addressed the Senate at this point in the day because I am introducing a piece of legislation called The American Debt Repayment Act. 
I think this is an important piece of legislation, and it certainly is very timely when we take into consideration that Congress now has the President's budget before us for consideration. Recently the President submitted to Congress what he claims to be a balanced budget for the fiscal year 1999. I would like to welcome him to the ball game of talking about a balanced budget. 
Since I was elected as a Member of Congress in 1990, I have fought to balance the budget using real numbers. In fact, I was a member of the House Budget Committee that passed the first balanced budget in over 25 years only to see this detailed, responsible plan vetoed by the President. 
As happy as I am that the administration has come close to realizing what the Republican led Congress has known all along, that we can balance the budget while maintaining responsible spending habits, I am deeply concerned that all progress could be lost if we do not diffuse the ticking time bomb of the Federal debt. The Federal debt now stands at over $5.4 trillion. That is almost $20,000 for every man, woman and child in the United States. If we do not begin a procedure for paying down the debt and funding the Social Security trust fund, entitlement programs will consume the entire Federal budget by the time the baby boomers retire. This is of great concern to me, and we cannot be shortsighted in dealing with the future of our children and grandchildren. 
The news, however, is not all bad. As I said, the President has submitted a budget that balances on paper beginning with the fiscal year 1999. While the reality could be different, this is still 4 years ahead of the 2002 timetable that was laid out by previous Congresses. Balancing the budget is clearly not the end but, rather, is only the beginning. From the outset, many of us have realized that once the budget is balanced, the Federal Government has the responsibility to retire the Federal debt. Included in the balanced budget agreement of 1997 was an amendment of mine, and it expressed the sense of the Congress that the President submit a plan to pay down the debt when he submitted his budget. He did not follow this congressional guideline and that is one of the reasons why I feel I must come to the floor today and introduce the American Debt Repayment Act with my good friend from Wyoming, Senator Enzi. It is clear that now is the time to begin that process and commit to retiring the Federal debt. 
Let's talk a little bit about what I call the debt tax. The debt tax is the amount of hard-earned tax dollars that Americans send to Washington to pay the interest on the debt. With the Federal budget in balance, we can begin to pay down the debt and decrease the annual gross interest payments of $355 billion. I repeat that, $355 billion is what we are paying in gross interest. This is $355 billion that could be spent on any number of programs, or more beneficially, in my view, tax relief for American families. In real terms, American families are paying an annual debt tax of about $5,300 to pay interest on the debt. As any consumer knows, the interest on unpaid debt compounds quickly, which is exactly what has been happening to our country. We need to relieve our citizens of this burdensome tax. 
Now, there are reports that we might actually realize a surplus before the fiscal year 1999. While I am not ready to take it to the bank yet, I believe that is exactly what we should do with any surplus, take it to the bank and retire the Federal debt. The Congressional Budget Office is predicting a $5 billion deficit for fiscal year 1998. That is down from a forecast of $120 billion at the beginning of the year. I believe that we can and should deliver a balanced budget to the American people beginning with this fiscal year. 
I am a realist and understand that we cannot retire the Federal debt immediately. What we can do is create a plan by which we pay down the debt over a set number of years. I have such a plan. My legislation, the American Debt Repayment Act, 
seeks to amortize and pay off the debt in the year 2028. That is as simple as it gets. My plan puts the Federal Government on a 30-year mortgage to pay its creditors and place our country on sound financial ground. 
Let me share some of the numbers. If we assume a 4.5 percent growth in revenues and similar growth in Federal spending, we could retire the Federal debt in the year 2028 by maintaining a balanced budget and by amortizing the debt payments just like you would pay a home mortgage. Just as important, this plan does not break our promise to the American people under the balanced budget agreement. 
By doing so we save over 3.7 trillion tax dollars in interest payments and free at least that much for tax relief or programs. In fact, if we stick to baseline outlays we will be able to provide over $370 billion in tax relief or program spending through the year 2007 while sticking to the American Debt Repayment Act to pay off the debt. 
I would like to take an opportunity to refer to my chart that I have on the floor where I have placed for the Members to see an amortization schedule on how we are going to pay off this huge debt Americans are faced with today, which is about $5.5 trillion. If we start paying down on the debt in fiscal year 1999, we have a $11.6 billion payment that we start out with and each year we increase the amount we pay down on the debt by $11.6 billion. If we continue that plan, by the year 2028 we have no debt. And what we have saved the American people over that same period of time, and I have it in red here, is $3.7 trillion. By paying down the debt, we have saved the American people in interest savings more than $3.7 trillion. 
By the year 2014 the savings in interest payments could be applied directly to the $11.6 billion to continue to pay down the debt. So this is a very realistic plan. It is a very simple plan. It is less than 1 percent of our total budget that we have in the fiscal year, our total budget being somewhere around $1.7 trillion. It is a plan that I think the Senate should adopt. It is called the American Debt Repayment Act. My hope is that we can set an example for the country as well as the House and send over to the President a plan that will balance the budget by 2028. 
In the end, we will realize tremendous benefits from paying down the debt. It is well-known that the United States economy performs well when Government follows sound budgetary policies. I believe that enacting a plan to retire the debt can only foster economic growth and stability. 
Many of my colleagues have come to the floor to discuss reduction plans, and for the most part we all agree on the necessity to do so. But the problem with plans that call for one-half or one-third of any surplus to repay the debt is that any President or Congress can produce a budget without a dime of surplus even though revenues continue to increase. 
I believe that any money left over after $11.6 billion has been committed to the debt should go to tax cuts, and I will fight against tax cuts for any extra spending. As I indicated earlier under my plan we can pay down the debt and lessen the tax burden on the American family. 
Mr. President, the Federal Government has not reduced its debt burden since 1959. We did not have a deficit in 1969, but it has been way back to 1959 since there has been any effort to reduce the debt burden. We have a historic opportunity to begin the process of retiring the Federal debt. We must eliminate the debt tax by retiring the Federal debt and restoring financial security to the trust funds and the American people. 
The American Debt Repayment Act is the only real plan to retire the national debt. This plan puts forth real numbers with a set payment and a balanced budget requirement to retire the Federal debt. So long as the Federal Government carries a $5.4 trillion debt, we cannot tell our children and our grandchildren that we have provided for their future. By enacting my and Senator Enzi's plan, we can maintain responsible spending levels within the Federal Government while providing for future generations. 
Again, I thank my friend from Wyoming and look forward to the Senate's action on this plan. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. ENZI addressed the Chair.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Georgia for yielding me a few moments. One of the strengths of the Republican Party, and one of the reasons I am so proud of the leadership is that they have encouraged us to go back to our States and talk with the citizens in our States and really find out what the problems are. As we are putting together our agenda here for this session, I really feel like this is a grassroots message. It has come from within the States. It has come from our friends and our neighbors and our local elected officials, the people who have to work with the Federal Government on a daily basis. I have gone back to my State and held a lot of town meetings. This particular year, I decided to hold a lot of town meetings in January. I held 40 town meetings in January. The message that came loud and clear to me is the main thing on people's minds is that there is a growing Federal Government that is continuing to interfere in their daily lives. Somehow or other, they feel they are losing control. Local officials in Colorado feel like they are losing control. Small business people feel like they are losing control and are getting too many dictates from Washington. 
Another thing that has come up in all of my town meetings has been the Tax Code. People are concerned about the tax burden that they have to bear today, particularly from the Federal Government. People want our tax system reformed. They certainly would like to have lower taxes, and they want a simpler and a less intrusive means of collecting those taxes. It strikes me that the two issues of taxes and the growth of Government tend to intertwine with one another. Those two issues, I think, are simply pulled together with this statement: Where the money goes is where the power goes. 
So people stand up, and say, `Well, there is too much power in Washington.' Then they complain the next minute that my request for funds from some program in Washington comes with mandates and strings attached and they begin to realize that there is power related to where that money goes. I think they think that the Federal Government is entirely too powerful. It does claim a huge portion of our economy each year. 
Let me review just a few numbers to make the case for tax reduction and tax reform which is going to be an important part of our agenda. The tax burden has been steadily rising since 1992. In 1992, the Federal Government claimed 19 percent of the economy. By the end of 1997 this has risen to around 21.4 percent. Remember, this is just the Federal Government. It is not State taxes. It is not local taxes. And if we include all of the State and local taxes and Federal taxes, of course, it is much, much larger. We are just talking about the Federal Government's share. 
The government at all levels now claims about one-third of the wealth produced each year in our economy--one-third. I think that is really a high number--certainly much more than any of our forefathers ever dreamed as far as the role of the Federal Government in our national economy. 
According to the Tax Foundation, State, Federal, and local taxes will claim 38 percent of the median two-income family--38 percent. By comparison, in 1965, the burden was 28 percent. It has gone up 10 percent. The tax burden amounts to no more than a typical family will spend on housing, food, and clothing combined. 
Mr. President, if we really want to help families with child care expenses, education expenses, health expenses, or housing expenses, we should reduce the tax burden. They have more money in their pocket. It gives them additional flexibility to spend it how they feel they should instead of sending it to Washington and then coming down with those mandates. 
There is much talk in Washington about the budget balancing and the forecast of some excess revenues which are referred to as a `surplus.' I certainly hope that this happens. 
When I was first elected to the United States House of Representatives, I remember our deficits were running around $340 billion a year. That is how much more they were spending a year than they were bringing in that same year. Now they are projecting--the Congressional Budget Office--somewhere around $5 billion. That is quite a change. 
So I certainly hope that happens. Maybe we can do something here in the Senate to move that along by saying let's look at our budget that we passed last year. Maybe we can do something this year to cut back the $5 billion in spending and actually balance the budget and make sure that it happens. 
But I think we need to be honest about why the budget numbers look so good. The budget is balancing not because of any tough decisions that we made here in the Congress. But it is balancing because of hard-working Americans out there that are being productive. And the reason that they are being productive, I think, is because they really believe that we are committed to balancing the budget. It holds down costs because interest rates are going down. And when they go to buy a car, or house, or when they are in business for themselves, this means they can invest more in themselves than the community. That is certainly part of it. Another part of it is because I think they believe that Republicans are going to--and they did last session--work for reducing the tax burden so they will have more of that for spending. 
So the economic performance in the past year and why it has really done so well is because of action here, I think, in the Republican Congress. 
The American people have been sending greater and greater amounts of their money to Washington. There is no doubt about it. With the budget balancing that we are going to be facing this year, I think we all pretty much agree that it is because of increased tax receipts coming in and not because of restraint in spending or the fact that the budget continues to grow. I think we have to keep that in mind. 
Federal spending in 1998 is estimated to be around 4.3 percent over our 1997 spending level. It is well in excess of inflation which is a little bit over 2 percent. 
So I hope that we will keep in mind that we need to make decisions that move the power from Washington back to the local level, and move it back to the pocketbooks of people who are in business for themselves and are making decisions on behalf of their families. 
So we are going to reduce the role of the Federal Government by cutting taxes. And I am here to say that we need to get on with it. And the sooner we show the American people that we are really serious about cutting taxes I think the better our growth is going to be in this economy and the more we can count on to sustain the economy so it is easier for us to balance the budget and move forward with our daily lives. 
I thank the Senator from Georgia for yielding me time to comment on taxes and our economy and how my constituents feel 
about reducing the budget within their daily lives.

Mr. ALLARD. I thank the senior Senator from Colorado for yielding. 
Mr. President, as a fifth generation Coloradan who has rooted for the Broncos since they were first organized in the early 1960's, I want to give my Mile High Salute! A Super Bowl victory has been a long time coming for Broncos fans. Broncos fans have searched for an identity theme from `Orange Crush' in honor of one of their best defensive teams to `the Mile High Salute.' Many of the themes were lost in time through legal hassles or disappointing seasons. But `the Mile High Salute' is here to stay, etched in history with a Super Bowl Victory! 
Rules limiting the celebration of success on the football field have made it difficult for players and coaches to express their emotions. `The Mile High Salute' has become the Broncos symbol of success on the field. I do not believe there is a more honorable and appropriate way of celebrating in the game of football. The salute is honorable. Denver is the Mile High City. The Mile High Salute has come to mean more than success and honor with the Super Bowl Victory. It has come to mean dedication, hard work, exceeding peoples' expectations, team work and unity, and giving the spirit of competition its just reward. It is in this context that I give my Mile High Salute. 
I want to salute the Green Bay Packers organization. They are a great organization and Wisconsin can be proud of them. They made this Super Bowl one of the best ever. They have a legacy in football that is honored throughout America. I know both my colleagues in the Senate from Wisconsin are avid supporters. 
My good friend Congressman Scott Klug, who I joined in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1991, got carried away with his enthusiasm for his Green Bay Packers and placed a wager with me. Instead of me providing him with Colorado beef he has the honor of bestowing on me some great Wisconsin cheese. Scott is retiring and I will miss him in the Congress because he has done such a great job in bringing about true reform. America is better because of his leadership in the U.S. House of Representatives. 
I extend a Mile High Salute to the offensive and defensive Broncos linemen. They truly exemplify the team spirit and exceeded expectations with the smallest line in the National Football League. Known as the `Orange Hush,' these are men that have an oath of silence, who routinely arrive an hour early for morning meetings so they can watch extra videotape together, who eat meals together, who dress together in the same locker room area, who study the Bible together, and who, most importantly, show up on game day together. 
An obvious Mile High Salute goes to both quarterback John Elway and running back Terrell Davis. They recognized that they didn't do it alone even though they have become heroes of the game. 
John Elway is topping off his marvelous career with a Super Bowl win! Many top NFL quarterbacks never have the opportunity to claim a Super Bowl victory. He will eventually be in the Football Hall of Fame. I know him personally and cannot think of anyone more deserving of such an honor. He is supported by a wonderful wife Janet and family. 
Fifteen years ago few people in the Denver community could have guessed the impact this young quarterback from Stanford would have on the State of Colorado. Today, John Elway reigns as the king of the comeback and the winningest quarterback in NFL history. He is one of the most recognized figures in American sports. Aside from his considerable athletic accomplishments, Elway has proven himself time 
and again to be the heart and soul of his team. As important as Elway's role is in Colorado sports, he plays a greater role in the community. Over the years he has worked tirelessly for the charities of Colorado, and the Elway Foundation is responsible for hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations. I think that in the hearts and minds of all Broncos fans this one is indeed for John. 
Terrell Davis returned to the San Diego area and his high school alma mater to demonstrate the can do attitude. I personally am amazed at his courage, work ethic, and commitment to winning for the Broncos team. His 157 yards rushing and record three touchdowns in a Super Bowl will be remembered. But this was only the culmination of his best season ever. Davis has grown from a 196th pick in 1995 draft to a Super Bowl MVP and 1,750 yard rusher in 15 regular season games. Davis will long be known by the nickname TD as he averaged one touchdown in every game he played in the 1997-1998 season. 
I salute the entire Broncos staff, owners, and coaches. Mike Shanahan has done a great job and certainly is deserving of the honor as a winning Super Bowl coach. Coach Shanahan and his staff have done an incredible job of taking what was a 7-9 team in 1994 to a 12-4 team with the heart to persevere through one of the most difficult roads to the Super Bowl with victories in Kansas City and Pittsburgh. The team statistics speak for themselves, the Broncos offense was ranked number one in the League with 367 yards per game and the defense was the top rated unit in the AFC only allowing 292 yards per game. I congratulate Pat Bowlen because I know that good leadership starts at the top. 
I want to recognize the general manager of the Broncos. John Beake is a good friend and has a great family. He does a great job of representing the Broncos organization. Both he and his wife Marcia need to be recognized for their fight to eliminate drug abuse. Just another example of how the Broncos organization has reached out into the community. 
I give a Mile High Salute to the fans of the Broncos. They are the best. Many, like my wife Joan, were attending Bronco games when they were playing at the old University of Denver football stadium and wore vertically striped socks. Their enthusiasm has not waned over the years. 
It is an honor for me to represent everyone in Colorado in the U.S. Senate. It is especially exciting to be here while winning Super Bowl XXXII. While I was interviewed last week about the President's scandals. I stated a number of times that people in Colorado have their priorities straight. They want their Broncos to win the Super Bowl and that's what they're talking about! 
Joan and I only wish we could be in Colorado helping our friends and neighbors in giving the Broncos and their fans a Mile High Salute.

Mr. ALLARD. Thank you, Mr. President. 
I thank the Senator from Georgia for yielding. And I compliment him on his leadership, particularly on educational issues. 
Today, I am here to encourage my colleagues to support legislation which will open doors of educational opportunities to the parents and children throughout our Nation. Education savings accounts are a sensible step toward solving our education crisis in America by allowing families to use their own money--to use their own money--to pay for their child's education needs. 
This bill would empower parents with financial tools to provide all the needs they recognize in their children, needs that teachers or administrators cannot be trusted to address in the same way that a parent can. 
These accounts would provide families the ability to save for extra fees that they might incur, have to deal with, when they are sending their children to public schools, fees that may be necessary to pay for computers or maybe they want to go down and buy their own computer to help with their child's education, maybe some tutoring needs within the family, maybe they need to prepare for the SAT. 
Transportation costs could also be an educational need, particularly in rural areas, or maybe special circumstances that would allow a family to consider some private alternatives as opposed to public education. 
Handicapped children, for example, I think could really benefit from this because they do have special needs. This encourages the family of the handicapped to meet those special needs and to pay the costs that they may incur and still send them to a public school. 
This kind of tax relief is especially important for parents who are working two jobs with no extra time to help with homework or those who do not feel adequate in their own knowledge to tutor their children. 
As parents, I know that my wife and I were the best judges of our children's needs, and I am proud of the way they have developed. As all parents realize, I knew that I was in the best position to address their needs. I would have welcomed an opportunity to accrue tax-free interest to help pay for more opportunities in the education of my children. Far too many parents find that their hopes to provide the best education for their children are crushed as they realize the costs involved in accomplishing this task. 
Contrary to popular myth, 75 percent of the children who would benefit from this bill are public school students. The new estimates released by the Joint Tax Committee disprove the claim that public school revenues would be reduced by what is referred to as the A-plus accounts. 
The Joint Tax Committee estimates that by the year 2000, 14 million students would be able to benefit from this bill with 90 percent of those families earning between $15,000 and $100,000 a year. 
Mr. President, this is an important piece of legislation. It empowers families, and it empowers them to control the education of their family and meet their special needs. So I am absolutely thrilled with the leadership that the Senator from Georgia is showing in this regard. If my time is running out, I yield the remainder of my time back to the Senator from Georgia.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, it is a pleasure to be here with my colleagues from Arizona and Wyoming, because I share in their concern that this is a fundamental issue of our freedom and that is the right of the seniors to privately contract their own health care. 
Quite frankly, I am surprised we are having to debate this 
issue on the Senate floor. It is amazing to me how far we have strayed from this principle of some fundamental freedoms that the individual should enjoy. 
Again, I compliment particularly my colleague from Arizona for his leadership on this particular issue and also my colleague from Wyoming. 
The notion that in America we have a group of citizens who would be effectively prohibited by law from paying for their own health care is absurd. 
In order to fully understand the issue, I think it is important to review a bit of the history about this particular issue. 
The Health Care Financing Administration has interpreted current law to restrict voluntary, private contracts between physicians and Medicare-eligible beneficiaries. HCFA has issued threats of fines and exclusion against doctors who violate this arrangement and enter into private agreements. HCFA has created a situation where doctors must comply with regulations stipulated by Medicare if they accept even one Medicare beneficiary as their patient. Medicare, as we all know, is the only federally funded health care program that prohibits private contracting by the participants. 
During the balanced budget debate, Senator Kyl offered an amendment that would have allowed for seniors to use their own money for their health costs. Unfortunately, through deliberations in conference, this provision was stricken and a new law that takes effect in January requires physicians who enter into private contracts to forego Medicare reimbursement for a period of 2 years. It has been reported that currently only 9 percent of physicians do not have any Medicare patients. This provision effectively restricts the choice and the quality of health care services provided to senior citizens. This would tend to prohibit doctors from treating elderly patients and would deny seniors the choice of seeking treatment outside of the Medicare system. According to the amended law, any doctor who is found to be treating Medicare patients and privately contracting will be subject to fines and even imprisonment. In all practicality, the language makes private contracting impossible. 
It is imperative that Congress revisit this issue and resolve this shortsighted legislation. I am proud to support Senator Kyl's bill, the Medicare Beneficiaries Freedom to Contract Act, which would allow seniors the ability to use their own discretion and money for their health care needs. This legislation is crucial for the elderly individuals who rely on our Medicare system. By allowing senior citizens the ability to retain the doctors of their choice, they are able to receive the care that they want and require. This legislation is essential to senior citizens' rights to use their own discretion for their health care needs. 
Although it is true that the deficit in January has declined, the portion of these revenues claimed by entitlement spending continues to rise as entitlement spending rises. I agree with my colleague from Arizona when he says this is also something that will help us balance the budget. Why wouldn't Medicare accept the idea that a private individual can pay for his own health care services out there? It means they don't have to pay for it. It means less expenditures on entitlement spending. It means we can do more to reduce deficit spending. Particularly at a time when Medicare is in dire need of reform, how can Congress simply deny seniors the right and ability to use their own money for health services? 
This is not a `Washington one-size-fits-all' situation. We are talking about the health care of our Nation's elderly. Medicare beneficiaries should be given the right to pay out of pocket and to choose their own health care provider. It is their freedom we are infringing upon, and it is imperative we act now to rectify this wrong. 
Congress must create a more efficient and effective health coverage program for seniors. Senator Kyl's bill is one essential step to complete that goal. More choice and competition must be implemented in the Medicare Program, thereby facilitating proper health care coverage that fits different individuals' needs and desires. Congress must act now to rectify this problem. 
I yield the remainder of my time.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I am introducing this legislation to lessen a financial burden on American companies. I am pleased that my colleague from Colorado, Senator Campbell is joining me as an original cosponsor. For approximately 20 years, various U.S. manufacturers have been paying substantial tariffs on a product that is not produced in this country. 
Mr. President, my legislation would significantly reduce the tariff on this particular product from 16 to 6.7 percent. This product is an industrial nylon fabric used in the manufacture of automotive timing belts. United States companies that use this product in their manufacturing processes have no choice but to import it since it has not been produced domestically since the mid-1970's. 
There is no domestic industry to harm by lowering this tariff, consumers will clearly benefit, and many domestic industries will benefit by becoming more competitive. 
My bill would temporarily reduce the tariff on the nylon fabric product for 3 years. After that period, if there are still no U.S. producers, further action would then be in order. Mr. President, reducing American competitiveness to protect non-existent domestic industries simply does not make sense. It is my hope that this situation will be rectified.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today, I want to take a few minutes and let my views be known concerning campaign finance reform. First, I want to commend my colleagues from Arizona and Wisconsin. It is not easy to introduce legislation that you know will be adamantly opposed from the outset. I recognize this and I want to congratulate them. Second, I want to commend the Senator from Kentucky, who on more than one occasion has stood on this floor and took an unpopular stand against popular legislation for all the right reasons. 
Mr. President, I have always been a strong advocate of congressional reform, even to the point of introducing legislation that has upset many of my colleagues. I have always believed that congressional reform should make Congress more like the people we represent not above them. That is why I have long been a supporter of term limits, which I believe would be one of the best campaign finance reform measures we could ever enact. 
Campaign finance reform should give every American the opportunity to participate, as fully or as little as they want. This country's principles are based on freedom. People should have the ability to choose whether they want to participate in the system. We cannot and should not coerce or force citizens participation in this process. Nor should we stifle citizens participation in the electoral process. I do not believe that this quick fix of McCain-Feingold passes either one of these tests. 
First, I do not believe this legislation protects the working men and women in this country. Our electoral system is a voluntary activity. The U.S. Congress should never force participation in a voluntary activity, whether through individual activity or through financial contributions. This is why I believe the Lott amendment is so important for any campaign finance reform legislation. I would never do anything to stop outside groups from participating in the system, I just ask that all activity be voluntary. I would never force anyone to support me by either their vote or through a contribution if they disagreed with my views and I believe this should apply across the board to any group involved in our political system. 
I have heard complaints that the Lott amendment would weaken the union's power and hurt the union membership. If the political positions of the union bosses are supported like they believe they are by the membership, then there should be no problem whatsoever for the unions to stay strong. But, if the unions' Washington office takes positions that are contrary to its membership, then maybe they need to rethink their ways. 
Also, a provision that is forgotten by many who oppose the Lott amendment is that it also applies to corporations and national banks. The amendment makes it unlawful for any corporation or national bank to collect from or assess its stockholders any dues, initiation fee, or other payment as a condition of employment if such dues, fee or payment will be used for political activity in which the national bank or corporation is engaged. Likewise, a labor organization cannot collect or assess its members or nonmembers any dues, initiation fee, or other payment if any part of such dues, fee, 
or payments will be used for political activities. 
I think this amendment is very clear, no matter where you work, you should not have to choose between putting food on the table for your family or participating in an election or supporting an election. Let's make it very clear, the people who do not support this amendment believe that working men and women, union or not, should have to choose between working or supporting issues and elections with which they disagree. 
I have also heard that being a union member is voluntary and one of the most democratic institutions since employees must vote to start a union, elect its leaders and if they do not like the direction the union is taking then they can work to change it or as a last resort, quit the union. If you do not like the direction of the union, you must quit your job as a last resort. I do not think any union member should have to make that choice--a job or a political contribution. This same provision applies to corporations and national banks. No employee should have to choose between keeping their job or participating financially to causes or elections they disagree with. 
Some want to apply this amendment to groups such as the NRA or the Sierra Club or other issue groups. The difference between these groups and the employment condition in the Lott amendment is that joining these groups is completely voluntary and is not tied to a job. If a member of one of these issue groups wants to quit their respective group, then they just stop paying the dues and rip up the card. There is no employment backlash that causes that person to lose their job. 
Thomas Jefferson summed it up best when he said, `To compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves, is sinful and tyrannical.' 
Second, in our quest of campaign finance reform, American citizens should not have to lose their voice. The first amendment is very clear in its wording, `Congress shall make no law * * * abridging the freedom of speech or the press * * *.' While campaign finance reform efforts are based on the best of intentions, whether by legislation or just simple suggestions, most of the time they will affect individuals' first-amendment rights. 
The Supreme Court has been very clear where it stands on the first amendment and campaign finance laws. Since the post-Watergate changes to the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, 24 congressional actions have been declared unconstitutional, with 9 rejections based on the first amendment. Out of those nine, four dealt directly with campaign finance reform laws. In each case, the Supreme Court has ruled that political spending equals political speech. This Senate attempted to change this through a constitutional amendment limiting the amount one can spend in a campaign, which only tells me that this fact is undeniably recognized by this body. 
In the now famous, or infamous to some, Buckley versus Valeo case, the Court states that:  
The First Amendment denies government the power to determine that spending to promote one's political views is wasteful, excessive, or unwise. In the free society ordained by our Constitution it is not the government, but the people--individually as citizens and candidates and collectively as associations and political committees--who must retain control over the quantity and range of debate on public issues in a political campaign. 
This simply states that the Government may not ration or regulate political speech of a citizen through spending limits or limit its quantity any more than it can tell the local newspaper how many papers it can print, what it can print, or when it can print. 
Also, the court states that ` * * * the mere growth in the cost of Federal election campaigns in and of itself provides no basis for governmental restrictions on the quantity of campaign spending * * * .' This goes for not just the candidate but also outside groups who want to participate in the process. 
That brings me to a specific provision in the legislation before us. I have yet to hear what makes 60 days such a magic number. How can an outside issue group's ad carry a valid message 61 days before an election but if run the next day, it would lose all validity and become illegal. This just makes little sense. When I ran for this seat in the Senate, I was blasted from all angles by many different groups, but that's fine. It made my life and campaign a little more difficult, but it let me explain why I voted the way I did. These groups brought all the issues into play and no candidate can hide their record from the public. 
However, no matter how I have to defend my record against these ads, I will never attempt to legislatively silence their voice. To do so would place myself over the rest of America. I cannot support the idea that my viewpoint is so much more important, that no one outside of the candidate can speak less than 60 days before the election. I cannot and will not quiet the electorate. 
I did forget one exception during the 60-day blackout, the media. This 60-day blackout only strengthens the media and whatever they say, cannot be challenged, except by the candidate. Today, newspaper endorsements are held off until the end of the campaign to maximize their effect, but this 60-day blackout period will let the endorsement go without criticism from outside groups. And I question whether once a candidate gets an endorsement, if their campaign will be covered with the same amount of scrutiny as the other candidate, for again, any rebuttal to their coverage can only come from the candidates opponent. 
I believe this provision places too much power in the hands of a few. I have the utmost respect for the media and the professionals who work for in the field, but too much of one gets too powerful for all. 
Also, I believe this 60 day blackout will be used to remove Congress from the close scrutiny of the public. Let me explain. I am afraid that Congress will hold off some of the more controversial issues until the last 60 days before an election in order to escape the scrutiny of these outside groups. This regulation is nothing more than politicians wanting to quiet citizens from bringing up issues that politicians want to ignore. 
Another problem arises regarding soft money. The definition of soft money is campaign money raised outside the regulatory structure for Federal elections--or non-Federal money. These funds are raised and spent by political parties outside of the Federal fundraising limitations to benefit the party's State and local elections efforts. While soft money is not federally regulated, it is regulated by the 50 States. Current law already bans the use of soft money in Federal elections. Basically, a complete ban on the ability of the parties to raise and spend any soft money would federalize all elections because any money given to the national parties in support of state and local candidates would fall under the stricture of Federal laws. 
The Buckley case clearly states that `[S]o long as persons and groups eschew expenditures that in express terms advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate, they are free to spend as much as they want to promote the candidate and his views.' The ACLU says that `the purpose of this profound distinction is to keep campaign finance regulations from overwhelming all political and public speech. And it is this distinction which defenders of the constitutionality of a ban on soft money continue to disregard.' 
The Court has permitted the unrestricted use of soft money by political parties and nonparty organizations in the Buckley decision and has enhanced and given it legitimacy in its subsequent decisions, including a decision involving the Republican Party from my own State of Colorado in 1996. 
Let me also make a point about money being the determining factor in elections. In my Senate race, I was outspent by almost $750,000--a quarter of $1 million. You don't have to have the most money to win, you just have to have the right message and I will not legislatively try and stop someone from speaking their message during a campaign, not even my opponent's. 
Many believe that now is the right time to pass a restrictive campaign finance measure with all the scandal surrounding the last Presidential campaign and that we should take a chance on the Supreme Court to rule it constitutional. The problem with this logic is that since 1976, the Supreme Court has referred to the Buckley decision over 100 times in setting limits on the Government's authority to regulate political speech. I just cannot see this Supreme Court 
overturning a ruling that has become the landmark decision and reference point for all campaign finance decisions. 
In the end, our campaign finance system needs to be fixed, but any reform must not run counter to the first amendment. The first amendment ensures that even if we don't like what someone says, they have the right to say it. While many believe that the amount of money being spent in campaigns is objectionable, the Court has clearly stated that campaign spending is equal to speech and no matter how objectionable, it is protected under the first amendment. 
I will have to say that the McCain-Feingold bill has gotten organized efforts behind it, like this ad run in the Denver Post on Thursday, October 2, by the group Campaign for America. However I would like to point out a few things. 
I find some great irony in this ad. First, if McCain-Feingold passes and this ad was to be aired on TV or radio, it may just be illegal, especially if it is within the 60-day blackout period before an election. If an incumbent believes this ad to be an attempt to influence an election, they can challenge it, thus stifling debate. The very message they wish to send could be stopped by the legislation they support. That is the point I would like to make. 
They want to stop big money and big guys with their big bucks from buying the system, which I want to do also by the way. Well, this group is backed by the some of the richest people in America. Actually, two of the men are on the Forbes 400 list. Plus, many of them have given hundreds of thousands of dollars to each party. It seems to me that this group is a bunch of rich guys using their big bucks to buy legislation. And, despite my request, I have yet to receive a full disclosure from this group on how much is spent, who gives and how much. All I know is who sits on their board of directors. 
But in all honesty, I cannot in good conscience stop them from exercising their first amendment rights. I want any campaign finance reform legislation to encourage this--not stop it. 
This is why I introduced my own bill, the Campaign Finance Integrity Act. My bill does not restrict one from exercising their political speech rights, but asks for complete and honest disclosure for all campaign spending. While this statement is not one of endorsement concerning my legislation, but in a review of the McCain-Feingold bill, the ACLU says, `Disclosure, rather than limitation, of large soft money contributions to political parties, is the more appropriate and less restrictive alternative.' My bill does just that. As a matter of fact, I believe my bill has the strongest open disclosure requirements of any bill introduced. 
My bill also will require candidates to raise at least 50 percent of their contributions from individuals in the State or District in which they are running; 
Equalize contributions from individuals and political action committees [PAC's] by raising the individual limit from $1,000 to $2,500 and reducing the PAC limit from $5,000 to $2,500; 
Index individual and PAC contribution limits for inflation; 
Reduce the influence of a candidate's personal wealth by allowing political party committees to match dollar for dollar the personal contribution of a candidate above $5,000, by using only hard money; 
Require organization, groups, and political party committees to disclose within 24 hours the amount and type of independent expenditures over $1,000 in support of or in opposition to a candidate. 
Incorporate the Lott amendment, along with the requirement of an annual full disclosure of those activities to members and shareholders; 
Prohibit depositing of an individual contribution by a campaign unless the individual's profession and employer are reported; 
Encourage the Federal Election Commission to allow filing of reports by computers and other emerging technologies and to make that information accessible to the public on the Internet less than 24 hours of receipt; 
Completely ban the use of taxpayer financed mass mailings; and 
Lastly, will create a tax deduction for political contributions up to $100 for individuals and $200 for a joint return to encourage small donations. 
One of the best way to reduce special interest money is to reduce the size and scope of Federal Government and I am not alone believing this. A recent survey by Rasmussen Research shows that 62 percent of Americans think that reducing Government spending would reduce corruption in Government. The same survey showed that 44 percent think that cutting Government spending would do more to reduce corruption than campaign finance reform, while 42 percent think campaign finance reform would reduce corruption more than cutting Government spending. I have said many times, if the Government rids itself of special interest funding and corporate welfare, then there would be little influence left for these large donors. 
That is why I am fighting corporate welfare, especially thee Overseas Private Investment Corp. Some may not see OPIC in the same light, but any benefit for corporations will just keep them coming back for more. Another way to achieve campaign finance is too eliminate the Department of Commerce, where a majority of the corporate welfare programs are funded. Also, by scrapping the existing Tax Code with its many tax breaks in favor of a flatter and simpler system would clean up our campaigns greatly. Big Government solutions will not stop big business and big labor money. To break special interest money, we must break the so-called iron triangle of big business, big labor, and big Government. 
I must say that by objecting to the Washington media is very difficult for any politician, but turning your back on the first amendment is more difficult for me. I want campaign finance reform and I have shown in my legislation how I would like to do it, but I will not do so at the expense of the first amendment. Not even at the expense of those people's speech who will disagree with me on this issue. The first amendment is the reason we can disagree. 
Let me end with this. While big money has been made the villain, I believe it is not the money but the people. Bad people will do bad things if given the chance. I believe that the tighter we made it, the more people will try to find loopholes resulting in more scandals. We need to enforce the laws on the books first before we add more Government regulation is not always the answer. To me it sounds like those who are under investigation and are calling for more Government regulation of campaigns are saying, `Stop me before it sin again.' Well let's first uphold the law and then we can better fix it. And when we do, let's not do so at the expense of those who legally want to exercise their first amendment rights. Don't let the bad shut out the good participants in our system. 
I yield the floor.

It is a particular honor for me to be here since I am from the State of Colorado and he is also from the State of Colorado. It is a good thing he is here. It is a good thing that he is chairman of the board of Promise Keepers. It is a good thing he is becoming a leader in this country in talking about those things that are so very important, I think, to this country. It is a good thing he is talking about civility. It is a good thing he is talking about kindness. It is a good thing that he is talking about the integrity and how important integrity is to this country. It is a good thing that he is talking about the freedoms and what this country is all about. I particularly feel it is a good thing he is putting out so much effort to reconcile men through discipleship in the Lord. 
I just wanted to take a few moments this morning to recognize him for his effort on behalf of all of us. I just want to wish the very best this week with Promise Keepers.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today the Senate will be in a period of morning business. Therefore, no rollcall votes will occur during today's session. 
As previously announced, there will be no rollcall votes on Monday. It is expected that the Senate will resume consideration of Senate bill 25, the campaign finance reform bill on Monday. In addition, the Senate will resume consideration of the D.C. appropriations bill early next week. It is hoped we can complete work on that legislation and any appropriations conference reports as they become available. 
Subsequently, Members' cooperation in the scheduling of floor action next week will be greatly appreciated. Senators are reminded that the next possibility of a rollcall vote will be on Tuesday morning. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I believe the public housing bill is sound legislation and would like to extend my appreciation to the chairman and the subcommittee staff for all of their hard work. 
I would especially like to thank the chairman for working with me to include two provisions in the public housing bill. One measure would make vouchers available for Public Housing residents who are victims of crime. This provision would give them the change to live in better surroundings. Also included in the bill is a Housing Cost Commission to determine the full cost to the Federal Government of each of the housing programs administered by HUD. The data from this Commission will be available for Congress as it works to improve the efficiency and quality of federally assisted housing programs. 
I appreciate being able to work together for the goal of improving our public housing system and ensuring that these programs provide necessary assistance to low income individuals while giving them an opportunity to help themselves.

Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Senator from Georgia for yielding. 
Madam President, I rise this morning to talk with my colleagues about the Internal Revenue Service. This week my colleagues on the Finance Committee have been holding hearings to examine the inner workings of the Internal Revenue Service. I appreciate their effort to more closely examine this institution. Not only do I appreciate it, but there are many Americans who appreciate this effort. 
For too long the Internal Revenue Service has not been accountable as an institution. Our Nation was built on a system of checks and balances. However, the Internal Revenue Service seems to have escaped this protection for Americans. 
For too long the Internal Revenue Service has used secrecy, intimidation and fear to do battle against those whom it has been called upon to serve, and that is the American taxpayers. 
I found it especially interesting that during those hearings those who know the Internal Revenue Service best--that is its own employees--were the most afraid. Those who know what the Internal Revenue Service does were the ones who wanted to protect their identities. 
Although there are many dedicated employees at the Internal Revenue Service who perform their jobs honestly and responsibly, there are some who do not. Those few have forgotten the mission statement of the Internal Revenue Service, which calls on them to perform in a manner warranting the highest degree of public confidence in their integrity, efficiency, and fairness. I remind them of this pledge and call on them to uphold it. 
Unfortunately, the abuse of taxpayers is not limited to the testimony we have heard this week. I have held more than 63 town meetings throughout the State of Colorado, and obviously taxes were a big issue. But it was not unusual for me to hear from many people about the difficulties they have had with the Internal Revenue Service. Time and again I have heard stories about how the Internal Revenue Service plays a waiting game, knowing that they have the time, the money, and manpower to outlast a small taxpayer. 
One of my constituents was awarded $325,000 in damages by a Federal court because Internal Revenue Service agents had wrongfully publicized information about her, after agreeing earlier that they would not make that information public. After auditing this taxpayer's business, the Internal Revenue Service seized the business and demanded $325,000 in back taxes. After requesting a reaudit, it was found that she did not owe anywhere close to $325,000. In fact, all she owed was $3,400. And certainly there was no real intent to avoid the law. 
The real problem here, however, was that the agents involved in the case wrongfully disclosed information about the taxpayer after agreeing to not disclose that information. When awarding damages in the case, the judge harshly criticized the Internal Revenue Service saying: 
The conduct of our Nation's affairs always demands that public servants discharge their duties under the Constitution and laws of this Republic with fairness and a proper spirit of subservience to the people whom they are sworn to serve. Respect for the law can only be fostered if citizens believe that those responsible for implementing and enforcing the law are themselves acting in conformity with the law. 
Once again, though, the Internal Revenue Service is dragging its feet, refusing to pay the money. 
Other constituents have described situations where they received notices from the Internal Revenue Service for very minor mistakes and then are assessed penalties and interest that far exceed the amount of tax owed. It is a frightening experience to get a notice from the Internal Revenue Service, particularly when it is so difficult to communicate back to them and actually get some real answers concerning a case. 
I am reminded of a case that came up in interacting with the constituents that I represent in the State of Colorado. Someone came up to me and said, `We sent a certified letter to the Internal Revenue Service with the check.' They signed for the envelope and yet the check apparently had been lost by the Internal Revenue Service. This constituent was fined $200 by the Internal Revenue Service. She felt paying the fine was cheaper than getting professional help to fight the case. Constituents tell me of years of meetings, negotiations, and delay by the Internal Revenue Service. 
Madam President, I request 30 seconds just to summarize my remarks, if I may.

Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, today, I am introducing, with the Senator from Oregon, Ron Wyden, legislation to ensure that Federal agencies comply with the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act. 
This same legislation has been introduced in the House of Representatives for several years by my home State colleague, Dan Schaefer. His leadership in this area has been very important. 
This legislation is very important to the country, but particularly to Colorado, where we have had several problems with the Federal Government applying one standard for themselves, and a different higher standard on private parties. I think this is unfair and should be changed. I've always believed that Superfund reform would be easier if all parties were in the same bathtub with the same scrub brush. 
I've tried to address Colorado's problems with EPA, but unfortunately I've had little success in getting their attention. One example I have brought to their attention was a former research institute at the Colorado School of Mines in Golden, CO. The research institute at Golden was shut down in the late 1980's after years of research had been done by the School of Mines, private entities, and several agencies of the Federal Government, including the Environmental Protection Agency [EPA]. 
After the site ceased doing research various environmental contaminants were found at the site and in 1992 there was an accident that resulted in the contents of a holding pond spilling into Clear Creek. While there was no contamination found in Clear Creek, the EPA had an emergency response cleanup contractor remove approximately 22,000 cubic yards of material from the pond and had it placed in a temporary stockpile. The EPA then issued a unilateral administrative order [UAO] for its disposal. Despite the fact that EPA, the Department of Energy, the Department of Defense, and the Bureau of Mines did research at the site none of them were the subject of the UAO, even though the Bureau of Mines was identified as a potentially responsible party [PRP]. Only the State of Colorado, the Colorado School of Mines, and the private parties were subject to the UAO. To put it plainly, the EPA stuck everyone but their sister agencies with a bill for millions on cleanup. 
In the case of the State of Colorado, they have appropriated a total of $7.465 million for cleanup to cover their costs and the costs the Federal Government should be paying. It's my view that this money could be spent much better, or not spent at all. However, to have the State spend it because EPA won't enforce and Federal agencies won't be responsible is unacceptable. There is also another case in Colorado involving a Superfund site in Leadville. Leadville is a small town that was the home of Baby Doe Tabor and formerly was the site of a large amount of mining. While there is still some mining that occurs in Leadville, they are also beginning to rely more on tourism dollars. 
Unfortunately, the city has a stigma attached to it; it is a Superfund site. All the homes are a Superfund site, all the schools are a Superfund site, all the restaurants are a Superfund site, all the businesses on the main street are a Superfund site. They've been told that because of various mounds of old tailings laying around, the entire city has to be on the national priority list. It's interesting to note though, that the safety concerns of EPA seem to stop short when it comes to Federal responsibility. This story is one of two water treatment plants, one Federal, one private. The private plant, because it's on the Superfund site was built at much greater cost than the Federal plant, which is conveniently just outside the Superfund site. This is despite the fact that the level of contamination is basically equal at both locations. While the EPA disputes this claim, the people who live in Leadville and work at the cleanup site know the difference. 
In case I'm accused of relying on anecdotes for this legislation let me describe two documents that found their way into my office. Let me describe them in reverse chronological order, the first is an August 2, 1996, memorandum which subject is, `Documentation of Reason(s) for Not Issuing CERCLA 106 UAO's to All Identified PRP's.' I want to quote a footnote in this document; it states that, `Pursuant to the applicable procedures, DOJ must concur with any EPA decision to issue a UAO under CERCLA section 106 to a Federal agency.' So if DOJ doesn't concur EPA won't act. So it is revealing to note that a December 15, 1994, letter from a region VIII attorney stated that, `It is my understanding, however, that DOJ has never approved of the issuance of a unilateral order to a Federal agency.' 
By the Federal Government's own admission they will not enforce against a sister agency. Since there is no environmental `cop on the beat' for Federal agencies, the Federal Government should be relieved of their immunity against lawsuits and be treated the same as any private party. That includes having to comply with laws that elected State legislatures enact. This is what this legislation does. It is my intention to see it enacted into law as quickly as possible. 
I want to thank the Senator from Oregon for joining me in this effort.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce legislation that will strengthen the recently enacted line-item veto. 
Currently, the line-item veto can only be exercised by the President when there is a deficit. This legislation would eliminate that restriction and provide for line-item veto authority whether there is a deficit or a surplus. 
Mr. President, the purpose of the line-item veto should be to reduce wasteful Government programs, as well as reduce deficits. 
Last year the Congress approved legislation that granted the President line-item veto authority beginning in 1997. The Congress did this out of principle. Members did not wait to see which candidate won the election before deciding whether to grant the new authority, and in August history was made when President Clinton became the first President to exercise the line-item veto. 
While some Members of Congress may not agree with the specific provisions that the President selected to line-item veto, the important point is that any President should have this power as a check on narrow special interest spending and tax provisions. If Congress wishes to restore a vetoed provision it can do so with the requisite two-thirds vote. 
I have long been a supporter of line-item veto authority for the President. In my view it will serve as a powerful check on Congress' ability to load up bills with wasteful provisions. 
I think it is safe to say that the President's use of the line-item veto has created an environment in which narrow spending and tax provisions are going to be scrutinized much more carefully before they are loaded onto legislation. 
I recognize that there have been court challenges concerning the constitutionality of the statutory line-item veto. I believe that this authority is constitutional and I certainly hope that the Supreme Court comes down on that side. However, this issue is important enough that we should amend the Constitution if necessary. That is why earlier this year I introduced a line-item veto constitutional amendment. 
Today, however we should focus on the line-item veto that is before us and look for ways to improve that law. That is the purpose of this legislation. 
In the last several years our economy has been very healthy and tax revenues have come in at much higher levels than previously forecast. This has created a situation where we may actually see a budget surplus at some point in the next several years. Does this mean we should rescind the line-item veto authority we have given the President? Of course not, but that would be the result as the law was drafted in 1996. 
My view is that the line-item veto should be used in both deficit and surplus times. While we may have some surplus years on the horizon, it is clear that without entitlement reform massive deficits will return just after the turn of the century. This means that we must be constantly working to eliminate wasteful Government programs. A line-item veto is one way to help do that. 
Mr. President, I cast my vote for a permanent line-item veto. The President and Congress cannot afford to take a vacation from the battle against wasteful Government programs.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment of my colleague, Senator Hutchinson from Arkansas. His amendment deals with the American rivers heritage initiative. I should start off by emphasizing that his amendment does not stop the initiative, it does not end it, and it does not hurt our rivers and their protection. This amendment merely ensures that the Federal Government, based right here in Washington, DC, does not become the controlling authority of rivers that have been used, cherished and developed by local communities all around this country, which, in some cases, the decisions made here in Washington may actually go against the wishes of the local community. 
I raise the question, why is our President so afraid of having local input into such an important process as the designation of our American rivers as heritage rivers? 
This amendment ensures that the people who live alongside of a river continue to have a say in the future of that waterway. They are the very ones who enjoy it for recreation, and they use it for commerce, and they actually own the private property on its banks. 
This initiative lists the members that will be involved in a committee responsible for implementation. Each heritage river will have a local bureaucrat that is going to sort of oversee the management of the committee. There is going to be a committee superintendent. Look at the members who serve on that committee. We have the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, Secretary of Energy, the Chair of the NEA, and the Secretary of HUD. These are all bright people, hard-working people, I am sure; but how can they honestly know more about a river, let's say, for example, that runs through Denver, CO--which is the South Platte River--than those people who actually live in Colorado along the South Platte, who actually know more about the seasonal impact on this particular river? If they don't know more, why are they put in charge of future development of the river above and beyond local control? 
Nobody out West wants to come to Washington and try to tell people who live along the Potomac how to control that particular river. Why does anybody want the administrators of these various agencies who live right here in Washington, DC, to have that type of control? And, frankly, their knowledge of a river may be nothing more than their perception of what they see happening on the Potomac River during rush hour when they are sitting on the 14th Street Bridge. 
So I do believe that the real expertise is back at the local communities, the people who live by and use the waters that we are talking about in the heritage river designation. I know of one entity in Colorado that certainly doesn't believe the control should belong in Washington. They believe it should be back at the local level. That one entity happens to be the Denver Post, which recently released an editorial against the initiative, saying that common sense argues against the possibility that a Presidential appointee would know more about the designated streams than those who live along its riverbanks. I happen to agree wholeheartedly with that editorial.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, along with the problem of allowing the Federal Government unchecked control of local rivers, there are several other problems with this initiative. I am worried about the lack of a requirement stating that only affected individuals and organizations can apply for designation. Senator Hutchinson's amendment puts limits on what designates a river community and allows for the actual interests of those who would be affected to be considered. It requires the opinions of property owners affected to be considered--something the administration obviously does not feel concerned about. 
There has been a long trend in this country of slowly cutting away the rights of private property owners. The administration's latest end-run around the Congress--the establishment of this initiative--without congressional authorization or appropriation, and the lack of a guarantee as to what constitutes a local community, and the lack of input from the affected property owners in this initiative, is merely another power grab of the Federal Government at the expense of local government, local communities, and local property owners. 
A vote for this amendment will be a step in the right direction. And I, again, would like to compliment my colleague in the Senate for stepping forward and addressing this issue. I am proud to be a cosponsor of his initiative. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, campaign finance reform is the catch phrase of the year in politics. The problem is that every Senator has a different definition of reform, including myself. That is why today I am introducing the Campaign Finance Integrity Act. I want to ensure that we change the campaign finance system without being unconstitutional and that flies in the face of the first amendment, especially in light of the fact that today is the 210th anniversary of the signing of the Constitution. 
Some in Congress have stated that freedom of speech and the desire for healthy campaigns in a healthy democracy are in direct conflict and that you can't have both. But fortunately for those of us who believe in the first amendment rights of all American citizens, the Founding Fathers and the Supreme Court are on our side. 
Thomas Jefferson repeatedly stated the importance of the first amendment and how it allows the people and the press the right to speak their minds freely. Jefferson clearly stated its importance back in 1798 with, `One of the amendments to the Constitution * * * expressly declares that `Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press,' thereby guarding in the same sentence and under the same words, the freedom of religion, speech, and of the press; insomuch that whatever violates either throws down the sanctuary which covers the others.' Again in 1808, he stated that `The liberty of speaking and writing guards our other liberties.' And in 1823, Jefferson stated, `The force of public opinion cannot be resisted when permitted freely to be expressed. The agitation it produces must be submitted to.' Jefferson knew and believed that if we begin restricting what people say, how they say it, and how much they can say, then we deny the first and fundamental freedom given to all citizens. 
The Supreme Court has also been very clear in its rulings concerning campaign finance and the first amendment. Since the post-Watergate changes to the campaign finance system, 24 congressional actions have been declared unconstitutional, with 9 rejections based on the first amendment. Out of those nine four dealt directly with campaign finance reform laws. In each case, the Supreme Court has ruled that political spending is equal to political speech. 
In the now famous decision, or infamous to some, Buckley versus Valeo, the Court states that, 
The First Amendment denies government the power to determine that spending to promote one's political views is wasteful, excessive, or unwise. In the free society ordained by our Constitution it is not the government but the people--individually as citizens and candidates and collectively as associations and political committees--who must retain control over the quantity and range of debate on public issues in a political campaign. 
Simply stated, the government cannot ration or regulate political speech of an American through campaign spending limits any more than it can tell the local newspaper how many papers it can print or what it can print. This reinforces Jefferson's statement that to impede one of these rights is to impede all first amendment rights. 
Also, supporters of some of the campaign finance reform bills, believe that if we stop the growth of campaign spending and force giveaways of public and private resources then all will be fine with the campaign finance system. It seems to me that if you look at history, price controls didn't work in the 1970's and they won't work in the 1990's. The Supreme Court agrees and is again very clear in its intent on price controls in campaigns. The Buckley decision says, `* * * the mere growth in the cost of federal election campaigns in and of itself provides no basis for governmental restrictions on the quality of campaign spending.* * *' 
Campaigns are about ideas and expressing those ideas, no matter how great or small the means. The `distribution of the humblest handbill' to the `expensive modes of communication' are both indispensable instruments of effective political speech. We should not force one sector to freely distribute our political ideas just because it is more expensive than all the other sectors. So no matter how objectionable the cost of campaigns are, the Supreme Court has stated that this is not reason enough to restrict the speech of candidates or any other groups involved in political speech. 
We need a campaign finance bill that does not violate the first amendment, while providing important provisions to open the campaign finance of candidates up to the scrutiny of the American people and I believe the Campaign Finance Integrity Act does that. 
My bill would: Require candidates to raise at least 50 percent of their contributions from individuals in the State or district in which they are running; equalize contributions from individuals and political action committees, PAC's, by raising the individual limits from $1,000 to $2,500 and reducing the PAC limit from $5,000 to $2,500; index individual and PAC contribution limits for inflation; reduce the influence of a candidate's personal wealth by allowing political party committees to match dollar for dollar the personal contribution of a candidate above $5,000; require organizations, groups, and political party committees to disclose within 24 hours the amount and type of independent expenditures over $1,000 in support of or in opposition to a candidate; require corporations and labor organizations to seek separate, voluntary authorization of the use of any dues, initiative fees or payment as a condition of employment for political activity, and require annual full disclosure of those activities to members and shareholders; prohibit depositing of an individual contribution by a campaign unless the individual's profession and employer are reported; encourage the Federal Elections Commission to allow filing of reports by computers and other emerging technologies and to make that information accessible to the public on the Internet less than 24 hours of receipt; ban the use of taxpayer financed mass mailings, and create a tax deduction for political contributions up to $100 for individuals and $200 for a joint return. 
This is commonsense campaign finance reform. It drives the candidate back into this district or State to raise money from individual contributions. It has some of the most open, full, and timeliest disclosure requirements of any other campaign finance bill in either the Senate or the House of Representatives. I strongly believe that sunshine is the best disinfectant. 
The right of political parties, groups, and individuals to say what they want in a political campaign is preserved but the right of the public to know how much they are spending and what they are saying is also recognized. I have great faith that the public can make its own decisions about campaign discourse if it is given full and timely information. 
Many of the proponents of the more popular campaign finance bills try to reduce the influence of interests by suppressing their speech. I believe the best ways to reduce the special interests influence is to suppress and reduce the size of government. If the government rids itself of special interest funding and corporate welfare, then there would be little influence left for these large donors. Campaign contributions would no longer be based on special interests but on ideas. Let's stop corporate welfare, especially the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, OPIC, where companies get a subsidized ride on the backs of taxpayers in order to invest without risk or without the market controlling the outcome. The best way to eliminate corporate subsidies is to eliminate the Department of Commerce, where a majority of corporate welfare programs are funded. To break special interest money, we must break the so-called iron triangle of big business, big labor, and big government. 
Ojbecting to the popular catch phrase of the moment is very difficult for any politician, but turning your back on the first amendment is more difficult for me. I want campaign finance reform but not at the expense of the first amendment and that is what my legislation does. Not everyone will agree with the Campaign Finance Integrity Act and many of us will disagree on this issue but the first amendment is the reason we can disagree.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I rise to address one of the most longstanding and racially sensitive disputes in the criminal justice system. I am introducing legislation to equalize the criminal penalties for offenses involving crack and powder cocaine. 
Under current law, a seller of 5 grams of crack cocaine receives the same mandatory 5-year prison term as a seller of 500 grams of powder cocaine. 
That disparity between penalties has been scrutinized by the U.S. Sentencing Commission, Congress, and the Clinton administration for the last several years. Although many solutions have called for narrowing the gap in penalties, these recommendations don't go far enough. Instead of equalizing the penalties, they only narrow the disparity in sentencing for powder versus crack cocaine by altering the ratio from 5 to 1 instead of the current 100 to 1. 
Additional recommendations have called for lessening the penalty for crack dealers, bringing it closer to the lax penalties applied to powder offenders. 
My legislation rejects the hollow solution of lowering the penalty for crack to make it equal to powder cocaine penalties. The fact is that 90 percent of those convicted of dealing crack are African-Americans, while the majority of powder cocaine offenders are white. 
Raising the powder cocaine penalties to that of crack will help alleviate the perception of unfairness and racial bias in sentencing. But reducing the penalties for crack cocaine would only increase violent crime and harm those which the law is seeking to help. 
Statistics remind us that cocaine addiction continues to plague our society. According to the Partnership for a Drug Free America, 1 out of every 10 babies born in the United States is born addicted to drugs, and most are addicted to crack cocaine. Crime exploded between 1985 and 1990, the years crack was introduced. In fact, violent crime went up 37 percent in 1990 and aggravated assaults increased 43 percent. Partly because of crack cocaine, more teens in this country now die of gunshot wounds than all natural causes combined. Lowering sentences on crack cocaine would be devastating to the progress we have made in fighting the drug war. 
During the 1980's, Congress legislated steep consequences for crack cocaine. 
The crack epidemic spread across our Nation--and it warranted several drastic legal reforms. We saw the destruction wrought on entire communities by this cheap and highly addictive form of cocaine and realized that tough penalties were needed to restrict its availability. 
These tougher sentences were needed, but the problem we are seeing today is that powder cocaine sentences were set before the crack epidemic began and do not reflect the influence powder has had on crime and drug trafficking. 
This bill provides a twofold solution: It corrects the inequality in penalties which has contributed to the perceived race bias in sentencing; while at the same time stiffening the penalty for powder cocaine offenses, which are currently far too lenient. 
In light of the numerous proposals introduced to correct this problem, I encourage my colleagues to contemplate the alternatives and consider how justice is served in this matter. Maintaining the current ratio is allowing a wrongful disparity in penalties to continue. Congress must act now to correct this injustice.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I am here today to introduce legislation banning commercial tour overflights at Rocky Mountain National Park. 
Tour overflight disturbances are a growing problem at a number of parks. This is an issue that other Members of Congress have addressed in the past, and it will continue to be contentious as long as the natural calm treasured by park visitors is threatened. 
I commend the Members of Congress who have been involved in creating legislation to control national park overflights in general or in a particular park. Details of problems are park specific, which is why I am addressing the issue of overflights at Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado. I hope that introduction of this legislation also serves to help Congress and the administration stay focused on creating a policy to address tour overflights at all national parks. 
The National Park Service is directed by law to protect the natural quiet in our National Parks. The 1916 National Park Service Organic Act states that the Park Service shall conserve scenery and wildlife and leave the areas unimpaired for future generations. Two other public laws explicitly state the need to preserve national parks in their natural state, most recently the National Parks Overflights Act of 1987 that notes the adverse impact that overflights have on the natural quiet and experience. The law also insists that parks should be essentially free from aircraft sound intrusions. In 1996, President Clinton announced his commitment to the peace of our national parks by ordering that agencies protect them against noise intrusions from park overflights. 
Furthermore, surveys have indicated that more than 90 percent of park visitors feel that tranquility is very important, but it is not only the quiet atmosphere that overflights threaten; overflights also have the potential to adversely impact wildlife and other natural resources. 
In particular, I am concerned about proposals for helicopter sightseeing at Rocky Mountain National Park that could seriously detract from the enjoyment of other park visitors and also could have a negative impact on the resources and values of the park itself. I value the wildlife and solitude at Rocky Mountain National Park, and I understand fully the concern that commercial tour overflights will impair visitor enjoyment. 
Rocky Mountain National Park is a relatively small park in the Rockies, about 70 miles from Denver. The park receives nearly 3 million visitors each year, almost as many as Yellowstone National Park, which is eight times its size. The park is easily accessible, yet continues to provide quiet, solitude, and remoteness to visitors, especially in the back country. 
Several problems are specific to this mountainous park. The elevation of the Park does not allow a large minimum altitude, therefore, according to the National Park Service, natural quiet is unlikely if overflights are permitted at all. In addition, the terrain, consisting of many 13,000 foot peaks and narrow valleys, coupled with unpredictable weather, presents serious safety concerns. Also, the unique terrain of Rocky Mountain National Park would cause air traffic to cumulate over the popular, lower portions of the park as pilots are forced to navigate around the dangerous peaks and high winds. 
Not only would the overflights be concentrated directly over the most popular portions of the park, but more powerful, and louder, helicopters must be used to achieve the necessary lift at a high altitude. 
In August the members of the Clinton administration's appointed task force on commercial tour overflights toured Rocky Mountain National Park. One of the participants, a spokesman for the National Air Transportation Association observed the altitude of the park and extreme weather conditions and stated, `I don't know that there's anything here that being in a helicopter would make that much more interesting than what can be seen from the road.' 
These distinctive qualities lead to the conclusion that the best solution to overflight disturbance is a ban on commercial tour flights at Rocky Mountain National Park. It is important for me to affirm that this legislation would only ban commercial tour overflights. It is not intended to have any adverse effect on emergency, military and administrative flights or on commercial high-level airlines or private planes. 
A commercial tour overflight ban has widespread support throughout my State. State and local officials in areas adjacent to the park, including Larimer County, Grand County, and the city of Estes Park have indicated their concerns with flights over the park, and they support a ban. In the last session of Congress the entire Colorado delegation went on record in support of an overflight ban. The Governor of Colorado has also expressed a fear shared by many that such disturbances could cause a loss of tourism. 
Rocky Mountain National Park has been fortunate enough to be free from overflights to this point, partially because local towns have discouraged companies that might provide such services. In addition, there are no existing private property rights that are infringed upon by the implementation of a permanent commercial tour overflight ban. 
At the beginning of this year the FAA issued a temporary ban on sightseeing flights over Rocky Mountain National Park. However, I remain concerned as we await final ruling by the FAA on park overflights and consider the possibility that such low-flying aircraft could be permitted in the park. 
In 1995, one of our top Denver newspapers editorialized that the FAA should make Rocky Mountain National Park off-limits to low-flying aircraft use, the sooner the better. Now, 2 years later, it is time to take action on imposing a permanent ban on scenic overflights.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I must admit that I was less than pleased with the spending portion of the budget reconciliation package. I regret that I was unable to give that section my support. Unfortunately, we failed to address the problem of growth in entitlement spending. We passed on making some needed reforms to the Medicare system. We owe our children and grandchildren much more, Mr. President. I am much more pleased with the tax portion of the budget reconciliation package. One of my primary goals has always been to reduce the tax burden on hard-working Americans. I am proud to say that we will take a step toward this goal today. For the first time in 16 years, we give the American people a measure of tax relief. I am especially pleased that we are taking steps to reduce two of the most onerous and economically harmful taxes--the capital gains tax and the death tax. 
Mr. President, with this act today, we will move in the direction of protecting family farms and businesses from Uncle Sam's grasping arms. Under current law, many family farms and small businesses have to be sold off just to pay the taxes on the founder's estate. This is tragic and irresponsible. But today, we will change that law to allow estates containing small businesses and family farms to deduct the first $1.3 million of the value of the estate. This change in death tax law is a good step in the right direction, although I must emphasize that it is only a first step. No family owned business or farm should have to be sold to pay death taxes. I will continue to fight to see that no family owned business is ever again the victim of the Federal Government's insatiable appetite for more money. 
We also make some good progress in the area of capital gains tax relief in this bill. Under current law, the U.S. has one of the highest capital gains tax rates in the world. These high rates have the perverse effect of punishing those who help our economy to grow by saving and investing and they raise the cost of capital, thereby lowering growth in productivity. With this bill today, we will reduce this economically harmful tax. 
Although we did not get the indexing provisions that I championed, most investors will get a reduced rate of 18 percent if they hold an asset purchased after 2000 for more than 5 years. Low-income investors will be charged an even lower rate of 8 percent for long-term investments. In addition, we are reducing the rate on all capital. Most taxpayers will now be charged a 20 percent rate and those in the lowest income bracket will only have to pay 10 percent. The 43 percent of Americans that now invest in stocks in one form or another will benefit from these provisions. 
Mr. President, I am pleased with these steps that we are taking today to reduce these economically harmful and unfair taxes, and I am proud to say that I will support this portion of the budget reconciliation package. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the future to enact further tax reduction measures that will help our family farms and small businesses.

Mr. ALLARD. Today, Mr. President, I would like to introduce a bill that would provide for more public housing vouchers. I have been working on this issue in the Housing Subcommittee, and it is my hope that a similar provision will be placed in the Public Housing bill. 
The original intent of the Federal housing assistance program was to provide temporary housing to poor individuals and families. Since their inception, federal housing programs have grown dramatically. Today they provide $25 billion per year in housing assistance. 
In my view, the voucher program is the best means for low-income families to find secure affordable rental housing. The voucher program first began in 1974 and has grown to serve over 1.5 million low-income families today. These families are empowered with the choice of where they want to live and are given the freedom to determine what surroundings they desire. Vouchers are the preferable means of providing affordable housing to low-income individuals. 
Vouchers enjoy wide support, including past Republican and Democratic administrations. In fact, the current Secretary of HUD, Secretary Andrew Cuomo supports an expanded voucher program. 
Vouchers are very popular, which is demonstrated by the 1.5 million families who are currently using vouchers or certificates. Vouchers empower individuals and promote competition within Public Housing Authorities and within the community, thereby lowering costs and improving conditions for the residents. Vouchers or other alternatives can be less expensive than the current public housing program; they can save the government money, and improve conditions for the tenants. 
Studies have indicated that project-based housing assistance costs more on average than the voucher housing program. In fact, the findings of the June 1995 GAO report indicated that housing vouchers cost 10 percent less than project-based housing. This study clearly demonstrated that on a national average, the section 8 tenant-based housing program is cheaper than the public unit-based housing program. In fact, one can say that the savings from the movement to vouchers would amount to $640 million per year which could add additional housing assistance. 
Under this legislation, ten percent of the public housing operating funds that are distributed to each public housing authority would be made available for those who currently live in the public housing unit and wish to be given a voucher. Nothing would be required or mandated; it is simply a choice given to the resident. In fact, we make clear that any unexpended amounts set aside for vouchers would be used by the PHAs for normal operating funds. 
Quite frankly, I really don't know how anyone could oppose this provision unless they are just opposed to giving people a choice and an opportunity. 
The language that I have proposed also establishes a preference for crime victims. It states that a voucher will be made available to any resident of public housing who is the victim of a crime of violence that has been reported to law enforcement. People should have the option of vouchers when their housing is unsafe. 
My strong belief is that we should increase the pace at which we move ahead with the conversion of housing from the old central planning and concentrated public housing model, to one of choice and opportunities through the use of vouchers.

 Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my support to the request for a special prosecutor to look into the campaign finance abuses of the last election. 
It comes as a shock to me that I even have to give this speech. It is so clearly necessary to have a nonpartisan, noncoercible investigator looking into these issues that the failure to appoint one in itself looks suspicious. The current troubles over election funding are just the sort of situation the special prosecutor idea was created for. The problem is a far reaching, bi-partisan scandal involving two branches of Government. It is also a scandal where those being investigated have the ability and possibly the desire to curb or even block efforts to fully unearth all the relevant facts. 
And let me make this clear--it is not a potential scandal, Mr. President, it is a scandal. It is a scandal we see unfolding on TV, in the papers, and in the Hart Committee room with Senator Thompson's hearings. 
And by the word scandal, I don't mean it's a little bit of gossip the media can pick over, but a scandal in that the situation is an illegal, unethical, and glaringly blatant violation of what the American people expect from their elected officials. There needs to be a full scale investigation into the entire finance problem, and a special prosecutor is the best way to accomplish this. 
I admire Senator Thompson. I admire what he is doing. I have the utmost respect for his investigatory powers, and I truly believe he can do what he says he is going to do. His committee is fairly and bravely shining the public light of inquiry into the darker corners of election funding, and for that he deserves all the kudos he can be given. But the fact remains that a special prosecutor is needed. 
Senator Thompson's hearings should serve as the springboard from which a special prosecutor's investigation is launched. He has called attention to the problem, he has let our colleagues from both sides of the aisle have a chance to look into the abuses of fund-raising and soft money, and he has helped greatly to awaken the American people to the travesties done in an attempt to win their votes. Now, from this solid base, a solid legal case can be built against those who have abused our--admittedly--easily abusable system. 
A special prosecutor investigation has more mobility, more leeway and more time than a Senate committee. It also is not troubled with partisan bickering and posturing. I know that Senator Thompson has done his best to curtail any partisanship, and he has done an excellent job, but the special prosecutor was created for just this reason--to avoid the clash between parties in a wide ranging investigation. 
Honestly, how can there be any doubt that we need a special prosecutor in this case? 
Not only the chairman, but also the ranking member of the committee looking into campaign finance abuses, Senator Glenn, admits that the evidence before the committee supports the conclusion that attempts were made by foreign powers to buy our elections. 
There are those who say that the Justice Department could handle any illegalities associated with campaign abuse, if indeed any are found. Well, the Justice Department faces a conflict of interest trying to investigate up its chain of command. Anyone who thinks differently is kidding themselves. The Justice Department lawyers looking into this are careerist, and they report to political appointees. 
For instance--the FBI claims they have not been able to find Charlie Trie, but Tom Brokaw was not only able to find him, he was able to interview him. I know that the American media are good, but better than the combined powers of our Federal police forces? More likely, there is a restraining force on the Justice Department. They are not to blame. Nobody should have to investigate their boss, and nobody should have to investigate the people who find them. 
A special prosecutor has not been appointed because the Attorney General says that there is not enough proof to warrant one. I am not sure, exactly, where to begin to refute that idea. The abuses we have been made aware of are so glaring and so blatant and so widespread that I am almost thinking that the Attorney General is kidding. She herself, according to the press, has created a tax force inside the Justice Department and convened a grand jury to look into allegations. 
Now, the special prosecutor's system has taken some hits lately. But we can insure that any prosecutor appointed is given a clear, specialized and fixed mandate to investigate the election funding issue. We can set guidelines that do not curb the power of the prosecutor, but insure a very narrow and specific investigation. 
I urge the appointment of a special prosecutor. I urge the investigation of the election fundraising abuses. I urge a fair and just conclusion to this stain on our democratic election system.

Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, today I file an amendment to provide for more public housing vouchers. 
The original intent of the Federal housing assistance program was to provide temporary housing to poor individuals and families. Since its inception, the Federal housing program has grown to become a $25 billion entity. 
In my view, the section 8 voucher program is the best means for low-income families to find secure, affordable rental housing. The section 8 certificate or voucher program first began in 1974 and has grown to serve over 1.5 million low-income families today. These families are empowered with the choice of where they want to live and are given the freedom to determine what surroundings they desire. Section 8 housing is the preferable means of providing affordable housing to low-income individuals. Vouchers enjoy wide support including past Republican and Democrat administrations alike. In fact, the current Secretary of HUD, Secretary Andrew Cuomo, supports an expanded voucher program. 
Vouchers are very popular, which is demonstrated by the 1.5 million families who are currently using vouchers or certificates. Vouchers empower individuals and promote competition within the public housing authority and within the community, thereby lowering costs and improving conditions for the residents. Vouchers or other alternatives can be less expensive than the current public housing program. They can save the Government money and improve conditions for the tenants. 
Studies have indicated that project-based housing assistance costs more on average than the voucher housing program for each family that is assisted. In fact, the findings of the June 1995 GAO report indicated that the cost of housing vouchers is 10 percent less than the cost of public housing. This study clearly demonstrated that on a national average, the section 8 tenant-based housing is cheaper than the public-unit housing program. In fact, one can say that the savings from the movement to vouchers could lead to an annual savings of $640 million per year and could be applied to over 100,000 low-income families for housing assistance. 
I am a member of the Housing Subcommittee which is currently putting the final touches on authorization language for a new public housing bill. I have proposed that this approach be included in that bill. Under my proposal, 10 percent of public housing operating funds that are distributed to each public housing authority would be made available for those who want vouchers. Nothing would be required or mandated. It is simply a choice given to the resident. In fact, we make clear that any unexpended amounts set aside for vouchers would be used by the public housing authorities for normal operating funds. 
Quite frankly, I really do not know how anyone could oppose this provision unless they are just opposed to giving people a choice and an opportunity. The language that I have proposed in committee also would establish a preference for crime victims. It states that a voucher would be made available to any resident of public housing who is the victim of a crime of violence that has been reported to law enforcement. People should have the option of vouchers when their housing is unsafe. 
My objective here today is to alert the appropriators to my interest in this matter and in my strong belief that we should increase the pace at which we move ahead with the conversion of housing from the old central planning and concentrated public housing model to one of choice and opportunities through vouchers. 
My view is that, whenever practical, programs should be properly authorized before funds are appropriated. Therefore, I am not going to push forward here today on this issue. I will continue my work on the authorizing committee to get this choice added to the law and my efforts will be devoted to getting this done in the next several months through the public housing reform bill. 
I thank you, Mr. President, and I now withdraw my amendment.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation amending the Higher Education Act to revise the proportion of student loans that a bank can maintain in relation to their total consumer portfolio. This bill will allow the Young Americans Bank to continue providing a unique opportunity for young people to learn to control a checking account, save for the future, and manage credit obligations. The bank has had resounding success in teaching young clients how to responsibly handle their finances. 
The Young Americans Bank has been operating for ten years as the only bank in the nation that exclusively serves young people under the age of 22. It is a full service, State chartered, federally insured bank with almost 17,000 customers from all 50 States and 11 foreign countries. Another exceptional element of the bank is that its holding company, the Young American Education Foundation, is the only nonprofit holding company in the country. 
While educating our youth on how to make responsible financial decisions, the Young Americans Bank also has a natural demand for student loans. Section 435 of the Higher Education Act prohibits banks from having student loans comprise more than 50 percent of total loans. Clearly this prohibits the Young Americans Bank from accommodating the large percentage of student loans that they would like to provide for their young clients. It is also important to note that allowing the bank to carry a larger student loan portfolio would improve the bank's financial performance, which in turn would provide more funds for educational programming. 
My legislation would allow very small, nonprofit banks to exceed the 50-percent student loan ratio. The exception would apply only to institutions with a total outstanding student loan volume of $10 million or less, and all loans would have to be made to those age 22 and under. 
The Young Americans Bank enjoys broad support, and I have received letters endorsing this legislation from Denver's Mayor Wellington Webb, the Colorado Bankers Association, the Colorado Governor's office and numerous financial institutions and universities. 
The operation and objectives of the Young Americans Bank should not be limited. This bank does an outstanding job of providing financial and educational opportunities to young people, and I encourage my colleagues to support their mission and encourage the expansion of such a successful institution.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I would like to begin by congratulating Chairman McConnell and Senator Leahy for their hard work in crafting this legislation and working to include language on the CAMPFIRE Program in the bill. 
Mr. President, as I have made very clear in the past, I am a strong supporter of fiscal responsibility on the part of the Federal Government. It is our responsibility to use taxpayer's dollars in the most effective, and efficient way possible. This responsibility at times mandates that we review and question just where our tax dollars are going. 
When USAID's Communal Areas Management Programme for Indigenous Resources or CAMPFIRE Program was first brought to my attention, I had to ask myself, just why are United States taxpayer's dollars being spent to fund big game hunting of elephants in Zimbabwe? If a program could spend dollars to hunt elephants how else are they spending our money? Asking myself these questions was not enough, so I began a comprehensive review of the CAMPFIRE Program. 
Mr. President, I am pleased to announce, that as a result of congressional review a little more fiscal responsibility has been restored to the U.S. Government. Our review of CAMPFIRE has produced three highly beneficial results. 
First of all, fiscal year 1998 will be the last year that the CAMPFIRE project will receive funding. This will end the cycle of appropriations that has already lead to $28 million being spent on this program. This amount, though small in respect to the overall budget, is a good start to tightening up Government spending, especially U.S. funding for international projects. 
Second, the appropriations language states that no U.S. tax dollars will go to directly fund the big game trophy hunting of Zimbabwe's elephants. I think we can agree that an endangered species such as the elephant should not be hunted with the tacit consent of the U.S. taxpayer through governmental funding. 
Finally, for the remaining time CAMPFIRE is funded, USAID must submit to Congress the steps they have taken to implement the CAMPFIRE Program. This will allow us to watch their use of our dollars. For far too long the U.S. has funded international programs with little or no oversight--this will serve as an example of how Congress should police international funding measures. 
Mr. President, I support the Foreign Operations Subcommittee's appropriations for fiscal year 1998 of the CAMPFIRE Program, with the understanding that this is the last year of the program, USAID submit information on how they implement the program, and no U.S. tax dollars will be spent to kill elephants. Now that we have ended the CAMPFIRE Program, it is my hope that we will not have to revisit this issue again in the future. 
In conclusion, Mr. President, I would like to thank Senator Boxer and Senator Smith of New Hampshire for their help in drafting this language. 
I yield my time.

Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Chair. 
Before I begin, I commend my friends, the subcommittee chairman, Mitch McConnell, and Senator Patrick Leahy and chairman Ted Stevens and Senator Robert Byrd, for a very good bill. I support the bill. I believe its overall funding levels are very appropriate, and I plan on supporting it. 
However, I have one concern. My amendment is very simple. It strikes the $32 million for administrative expenses for the Overseas Private Investment Corporation and scales it back to its 1994 level of $21 million. 
Now, why was the year 1994 selected? In 1994, with Public Law 103-392, OPIC's congressional authorized lending authority was last raised. This increased the maximum contingent liability or lending authority cap for insurance from $9 billion to $13.5 billion and increased the contingent liability cap for financing from $2.5 billion to $9.5 million. However, since 1994, there have been no increases in the authorized lending cap for OPIC. As a matter of fact, I have recently learned that while at the end of 1996 OPIC's liability exposure has increased, their total number of issuances has decreased. 
Now, in 1995, 1996 and 1997, OPIC's administrative expense appropriations have increased. In 1994, their administrative expense was $20.2 million; in 1995, their administrative expense was $25.8 million; in 1996, their administrative cost was $21.8 million, and in 1997 their administrative costs again increased to $32 million, while their cap was not increased one dime. In fact, there is a zero percent increase since 1994. 
Now, their administrative appropriation over the same period has increased $12 million--over the last 3 years--resulting in a 50-percent increase. 
Now, why should OPIC's administrative appropriation increase while their lending authority cap has stayed frozen? As I stated earlier, in reality their issuances have declined. While the $32 million in this bill is a freeze as of 1996--and I commend the committee for doing this, by the way--I believe it would be very appropriate to scale them back to the 1994 level. 
All this is occurring while the future of OPIC is very much uncertain. On September 30, 1997, OPIC's authorization ends. As of today, I do not believe the Senate has a reauthorization bill for OPIC. From my understanding, the House of Representatives is just beginning the process of reauthorization and, in the report for the companion foreign operations appropriations bill, it states they are reluctant in the absence of an authorization bill to fund OPIC. I believe this number is enough to administer their outstanding liabilities, but there is still great uncertainly as to what the future holds for OPIC. If reauthorization does occur, then we can come back to this issue at a later date. 
This amendment is not the place, nor do I plan to argue the specific pros and cons of OPIC, for that will come at a future date if we have a reauthorization bill. I plan to be involved in the debate at that time if that comes up. But this amendment is a matter of whether an agency, a Government entity, that depends on the full faith and credit of the United States, with Federal employees, should have their administrative expenses increased by 50 percent over the last 3 years while their authorized lending cap is not increased by one dime, zero percent. 
Make no mistake, OPIC is a Federal agency. It needs the United States to fund its operation. This Congress should always be concerned when an agency staff grows faster than its authority. I know of very few agencies that have no growth in authority which get a 50-percent increase in administrative expenses. It seems, if we are at all serious about reducing the size and scope of Government and take our oversight role seriously, then all agencies should play by the same rules, and we as a Congress should apply these rules evenly to all agencies. I ask my colleagues to support this amendment and keep the growth of OPIC at a minimum, especially when their authorized cap has been frozen since 1994 and with their authorization expiring in September 1997. 
Mr. President, I reserve my right to address the Senate and yield the floor.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I would like to have an opportunity to make some summarizing comments and then, if there are not any other statements, I will make a closing statement. 
I would like to respond by saying it is true that there is some extra revenue that has come into OPIC, but the fact is that that is interest that they have earned, and OPIC itself, in saying how much more income it could generate, said if we could get away from having to buy Treasury bonds and invest in the stock market, we could generate more income. 
To me, that sends a signal that we would be better off in the private sector. A lot of these businessmen have an opportunity to go to the private sector, go to the stock market to fund these projects overseas. And I am a small businessman, too, by the way. I started my business from scratch, but I think as business people, sometimes it is all too easy to turn to the agencies for help. We need to encourage business people to turn to the market and to focus on what they can do to meet the needs of the market. After all, this is an agency. It is a Government-run agency that is picking winners and losers. I would feel much more comfortable having a competitive market system picking winners and losers. 
Many States, like the State of Colorado which I am from, have done a lot to promote foreign competition, but they have done it on their own. Most of the jobs and the new growth that has happened in Colorado has not been the result of OPIC. So I think we have to be careful and not give too much credit to this particular Federal agency. 
Let me end by just stating, again, a few historical facts. In 1971, OPIC's administrative budget was $3.2 million. In 1981, it was $7.5 million. In 1988, it was $12 million. And in 1992, it was $16.4 million. 
In 1996, their administrative appropriation was $28.1 million, and in 1997, it was $32 million. Also, according to OPIC, in 1988, their FTE's, or full-time equivalent employment ceiling, was 125. In 1992, it was 155, and in 1996, it was 182. As these historical numbers from OPIC point out, this is not some sleeping agency, but one whose administrative costs and employment have increased substantially. 
If we take the 1996 number of employees and divide it into the 1996 administrative costs, it comes to $154,000 per employee. Now, I realize that not all this goes to employees' salaries, but also to normal office supplies and other office expenses that go to support each one of those FTE positions. 
But here is the problem. I have yet to hear a compelling argument for continuing increase in the administrative budget when their liability cap is frozen. Also, as I and my staff have searched their records, I have yet to find a clear delineation of where their administration budget goes. 
All I do know is that in this $32 million, and I quote from the bill, `any project-specific transaction costs, including direct and indirect costs incurred in claims settlements, and other direct costs associated with service provided to specific investors or potential investors pursuant to section 234 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, shall not,' again, `shall not be considered administrative expenses for the purpose of this heading.' 
I question what these expenses are and where they go. I cannot find them listed in their reports or from any correspondence. Oversight is a proper function of Congress, and we should pursue it vigorously. 
While I may have some problems with OPIC, Mr. President, I do want to commend them for being prompt and professional in their manner of dealing with my inquiries, and I take my hat off to them for this. 
Again, I reiterate, this amendment is not about OPIC and whether they should continue, because we will get to that later. But this is an argument of whether a U.S. Government agency should have a 50-percent increase in administrative expenses since 1994 when their congressionally mandated lending authority has been frozen during that same period. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and ask for limited growth in all agencies. 
I ask for the yeas and nays.

In 1994, OPIC's lending authority for its insurance and financing was last raised and has been frozen since then. On the administrative cost side, we have seen a growth during that period, when their authority was limited, from $20 million to about $32 million. This amendment just takes the administrative cost back to the 1994 level. It is a reduction of $11 million in administration. I ask for a yea vote.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici, for his fine work. I would like to recognize the tremendous work that my colleague and fellow Senator from Colorado, Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell, has done on behalf of native Americans. 
I rise in opposition to the Feingold amendment. I rise today to offer my support for the Animas-La Plata project. 
This issue has been very contentious for a very long time. While the proponents of the amendment are well-intentioned, they are also very poorly informed. I can think back, maybe 3 or 4, maybe 6 months ago, when there was some activism within America, saying we ought to apologize to native Americans. If we are really concerned about what happens to native Americans, we ought to first look at keeping our word, keeping those treaties which we have signed. 
The 1988 Colorado Ute Indian Water Rights Settlement Act recognized the legitimate water rights claims established by treaty, way back to 1868, and again promised the Ute Indian Tribes a permanent, reliable water source to meet their present and future needs. These are rightful water rights that have been affirmed by the Supreme Court and ratified by Congress. The Animas-La Plata project, the foundation for this settlement, would divert a portion of the annual runoff from the Animas River into an off-stream reservoir, rather than damming the river and flooding the river valley. This project fulfills an obligation that we have to the Indian tribes that we should not forsake. This is a treaty obligation. That is what those who favor elimination would like everyone to overlook. 
The Rocky Mountain News, a major paper in the Rocky Mountain region, in an editorial published last week, made this point very well when they wrote of the opponents to this project: 
They will do anything, it seems, to achieve their goal of seeing the United States break another agreement with Indian tribes. 
As the Ute Tribe stated recently, we only ask that Congress, which promised the two tribes adequate water supply when they placed us on a reservation over a century ago and agreed to a full-size Animas-La Plata in 1988, be fair with us now and support a reduced facility and settlement. 
What opponents of this project don't understand is that in the West, unless we have a facility to store water, we cannot really settle the water claims of the Indians. What happens if we don't fund this project? The tribes will sue, and instead of living up to our agreements, we will see litigation, and I don't think that is where we want to be going. 
But the issue here is bigger than just another project. The issue here deals with not breaking another treaty with another tribe. 
I yield time to my colleague from Colorado, Senator Campbell.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I am here today to offer an amendment that would continue the development and transformation of the Rocky Mountain Arsenal to the Rocky Mountain Arsenal Wildlife Refuge. This has been an ongoing cooperative effort between the Department of the Army, the Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Shell Oil Co., and local, State, and Federal elected officials. 
The Rocky Mountain Arsenal contains 17,000 acres northwest of Denver, CO, that was purchased by the Army in 1942 to manufacture chemical weapons. The Army leased the property after World War II to various chemical manufacturers through 1982. Needless to say, this had an incredible environmental impact. However, through all of this environmental abuse wildlife flourished. In fact, in 1986 a winter communal roost of bald eagles was discovered on site, an incredible occurrence considering the circumstances. 
Because of its protected status, the arsenal became a haven for close to 300 wildlife species including deer, coyotes, owls, and eagles. Efforts were undertaken to preserve the wildlife habitat. These efforts were rewarded in 1992 when Congress passed the Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge Act, legislation that I supported as a Member of the other body. 
Today, cleanup efforts are still underway, but great progress has been made. Groundwater treatment facilities are in place, 350 abandoned wells have been closed, and soil remediation is in progress. This has allowed portions of the arsenal to be opened to the public for wildlife viewing. This amendment allows the public the opportunity for greater access to the refuge. 
The exact purpose of this amendment is to clarify existing law to facilitate the transfer of property at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal to Commerce City, CO, in a negotiated sale at fair market value. The city will hold this land, develop it in accordance with plans made in connection with the Fish and Wildlife Service and other governmental entities, and ultimately sell some of this land, making proceeds available for the continuing development of the Rocky Mountain Wildlife Refuge visitor center. 
The Government Services Administration objected to the original language in Public Law 102-402. We have worked with GSA in formulating legislative language that meets the requirements of GSA as well as my intent and the intent of Commerce City. 
I am always pleased when the Federal Government can work with local governments to provide a public benefit at no cost to the taxpayer. This is one such case. 
Finally, I would like to thank Chairman Thurmond for his assistance and leadership on this amendment, and appreciate the hard work and diligence of his staff.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, let me briefly explain what this amendment is all about. This is an amendment in which we address the indexing of capital gains. When we index capital gains, what we are talking about is protecting long-term investors from taxation on inflationary gains. This helps the family business, the family farm, and the family ranch. It is the family and the average American out there who owns a capital asset. 
Specifically, what the amendment does is--it is pretty much the same indexing provision that was reported out of the House except that it delays the implementation of it to 2002. The holding period of the property would change from 3 to 5 years. 
Just briefly, there are two other very important points that I would like to make about this particular amendment. 
It is revenue neutral over 10 years, as scored by the Joint Committee on Taxation; and, No. 2, it is germane, and in fact it does blend within the current language of the bill. 
I yield back the remainder of my time.

 Mr. ALLARD. Mr President, Kristy Danielle Vaughn, daughter of Gary and Kelli Vaughn, of Joes, Co, was a promising young student about to report for duty this month at the United States Military Academy at West Point. She had been nominated for an appointment there by former U.S. Senator Hank Brown and myself when I served in the U.S. House of Representatives. 
She was a leader in her high school government, 4-H Club, sports, and school organizations, and received numerous awards in all areas. With all these responsibilities, she also gave much of her time to the duties of her family's farm. This bright young woman was suddenly killed in an auto accident recently as she was on her way to the All State Basketball finals in Greeley, CO. 
Kristy very actively contributed her time and talents to her school and her community. She will be greatly missed in Joes, and her opportunities and contributions at West Point will never be realized.

Mr. ALLARD. OK. I appreciate the chairman, Mr. President, giving me an opportunity just to speak a minute or two about this amendment. 
Mr. President, I would like to take this time to discuss this amendment that would give families with uninsured children the opportunity to obtain proper health coverage. 
My amendment would allow families with uninsured children to deposit money in a medical savings account to use for health care services. I believe it is critical to provide lower income families with the option to establish medical savings accounts. MSA's allow consumers to pay for medical expenses through affordable tax-deductible plans that are most suited to their needs. 
Americans want choice in health care. It is time for the Federal Government to listen to the American people and make medical savings accounts an available option. Medical savings accounts are a viable free-market approach to ensuring greater access to affordable health care coverage for the uninsured. 
I believe our efforts need to be focused on providing uninsured children with accessible health care services. My amendment would give these families the opportunity of setting aside MSA funds, especially benefiting those who are self-employed, between jobs, or employed where health coverage is not available. 
I am hopeful that in the 105th Congress, we will be able to expand the availability of medical savings accounts. 
My amendment is one step to achieving the goal of decreasing the number of uninsured children by providing families with the option to receive much needed health care coverage. By making more MSA's available, we can make it easier for parents to finance their children's health care; afterall, the health of our Nation's children is at stake. 
I understand the position of the chairman having to raise this point of order. I just hope that the Finance Committee takes a closer look at medical savings accounts and the problem we have with uninsured children. 
With that, I will go ahead and withdraw my amendment.

Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Senator. I would like to, Mr. President, compliment the chairman for his hard work on this particular piece of legislation. 
Mr. President, this week I am confident that the Senate will approve the largest tax cut since the Reagan tax cuts of 1981. And it is about time. 
In the 16 years since the last tax cut, Congress has enacted two major tax increases--one in 1990, and the other in 1993. 
Mr. President, it is time for a change. It is time to put American families ahead of Washington, DC's insatiable appetite for more Government spending. 
Taxes are now higher than they have ever been. Taxes constitute one-third of the economy. And Tax Freedom Day--the day to which the average American works to pay the combined Federal, State, and local tax burden--and that date is May 9. It is the latest it has ever been. 
Mr. President, I view this tax cut as a downpayment. My long-term objective is to ensure that no American family pays more than 25 percent of its income in taxes. 
A balanced Federal budget, and a reasonable level of taxation should be the twin objectives of Congress as we enter the next century. 
I invite all of my colleagues to support this tax cut and to help ensure that the bridge to the 21st century does not become a giant toll bridge. 
Today I would like to focus on what I call the growth tax. This is typically referred to as the capital gains tax, a term which liberals often use derisively to help create the impression that only the rich pay the growth tax. 
In fact, as you may know, Mr. President, nearly all Americans own capital, and they experience a tax on that capital when they sell a house or when they sell stocks or a small business or a farm or a ranch. 
Under our current Tax Code, gains on capital investment are taxed at a 28-percent Federal rate, and often an additional 5 percent or more in State taxes comes in on top of that. This is the growth tax, and this is among the highest growth tax of any major industrial nation. 
The real growth tax is often much higher than 28 percent. This is because our Tax Code does not protect Americans from taxation on capital gains that result only from inflation. This means, for example, that an investment held for 10 years where up to one-third of the gain can be due to inflation, taxes are due even on this. 
This is clearly one of the most unfair aspects of this tax. Government policies contribute to inflation, and Government then turns around and taxes its citizens on that inflation. 
For this reason, Mr. President, I intend to fight very hard 
to see that indexing is included in our growth tax cut. The House bill wisely includes this provision--and I commend Chairman Bill Archer for this. The Senate bill, unfortunately, does not yet have indexing. Hopefully, by the end of the week, it will. 
Some have dismissed indexing as too costly for this tax bill. But for me this is an issue of fundamental fairness. It is wrong for the Federal Government to tax its citizens on inflation. 
It is not too costly not to include indexing. Indexing simply means that Americans would be permitted to disregard any gains due solely to inflation, and then pay taxes only on real gains. 
Mr. President, let's take a look at how this capital gains growth tax hits ordinary working Americans beginning with their home. 
The Tax Code generally allows gains on a personal residence to be deferred as long as the proceeds are used to purchase another larger home. However, many Americans eventually pay capital gains on their home, particularly as they get older and find that their residence has appreciated substantially in value. 
Our tax bill deals with this issue by exempting all but the very rich from any taxation on gains from their principal residence. This is a long overdue reform. 
Next, let's look at financial investments. Stocks are a frequent source of capital gains taxes, and stock ownership today is more widespread than ever before. Stock ownership has doubled in the last 7 years to the point where 43 percent of all adult Americans own stocks. 
Obviously, with those numbers, Mr. President, it is spread throughout society. Today, half of the investors are women and half are noncollege graduates. 
Stocks are typically held for retirement, education expenses, and other long-term goals. This is precisely the type of savings and investment that we need in our economy. Investments foster business expansion, and job creation. Capital is the lifeblood of a free market economy. Clearly you cannot have capitalism without capital. And our Tax Code should encourage capital investment. 
Mr. President, I cannot leave this topic without talking about small business owners and farmers. 
There is no clearer area where the growth tax makes no sense. Millions of American families put their lives into building small businesses and farms. Often those businesses or farms are sold to finance a decent retirement. But this can occur only after Uncle Sam gets his cut of 28 percent of all the gains. Often, over half of these gains are due only to inflation. It is no wonder that millions of our most ambitious citizens have lost faith in our tax system. 
Fortunately, Mr. President, tax relief is on the way. This bill lowers the growth tax from 28 to 20 percent for most families, and those in the lowest tax bracket would pay only 10 percent. This tax cut would help make life easier for millions of Americans, and it will help our economy to grow and create new jobs. 
To those Americans who own a home, who save for retirement or who own a small business or farm, I say that next time a liberal says that capital gains are only for the rich, remember, he is thinking of you.

Mr. ALLARD. This amendment would strike section 881 of the tax bill. 
This section extends the so-called temporary unemployment surtax on small business and other employers through the year 2007. The House tax bill does not include this provision. The Senate bill, unfortunately, does. I rise to support the House position on this matter. 
The description of this provision put out by the committee notes that in 1976 Congress passed a temporary surtax of .2 percent of taxable wages to be added to the unemployment tax rate. 
I would suggest that at a minimum, if we are going to keep extending this tax, we ought to be honest with the American worker and small business owners and stop calling this a temporary tax. Enough is enough. 
Between 1970 and 1990, there have been three unemployment tax rate increases and three wage base increases. These have resulted in a dramatic increase in the unemployment tax burden. There is no reason to continue this temporary surtax when we have the lowest unemployment in a quarter century and a full trust fund. This is no more than an additional and unfair general revenue raising. 
The reason for the unemployment surtax no longer exists. The temporary surtax was put in place in 1976 in order to repay borrowing of the Federal unemployment trust fund from the general fund of the Treasury. Even though the borrowings were repaid in May 1987, Congress has continued to extend the surtax in tax bill after tax bill. As of today, all the States' reservoirs now have surpluses. 
Since 1987, the surtax has been used solely to raise revenue to pay for tax packages. The tax takes money out of the private economy for no valid reason. 
I have two concerns with this surtax. First, the Federal Government is breaking its commitment to employers and to workers that this added tax would be temporary. Clearly, it is not temporary, and if this provision remains in the bill and is enacted, the tax will have been in place for 30 years. This is not the way Government should do business. 
The second problem I have is that we should not be imposing unnecessary payroll taxes. Payroll taxes cost jobs. Because small businesses are generally labor intensive, payroll taxes, which are a tax on labor, strike small businesses particularly hard. Payroll taxes are paid whether there is a profit or a loss. 
I would note that high payroll taxes in Europe, particularly in Germany, is one of the principal reasons that unemployment is so high. This should be a warning to us to work steadily to limit the payroll tax on U.S. businesses. 
Mr. President, I understand that there is some concern about my amendment, so I will withdraw this amendment and urge the Senate to agree to the House position on this issue. 
There are a number of Senators, and I can assure you there are many thousands of small businesses, that would like to see this provision out of the bill, but before I withdraw my amendment, I would like to make an inquiry to the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Roth. In light of the fact that this tax was to be a temporary tax, would the chairman consider either removing the provision in conference or modifying it to at least terminate the tax more quickly than proposed in the bill?

Mr. ALLARD. I thank the chairman for his sincerity and real concern about the surtax, and I would just, in conclusion, reflect on some of my own experiences with the surtax. When it was first applied in 1976, I was just basically starting out in my small business. I had just been in business 4 or 5 years. I had not been in business long enough to have to pay any unemployment compensation, never had to have any turnover in my business, but every dime counted in that new business. And when that surtax was imposed on that small business that I was starting at the time, it did have an impact. 
I do not believe we can continue to disregard the impact that these unemployment taxes have on small businesses, particularly the small businesses that are just starting out. We need to encourage people to go in business for themselves. We need to encourage people to someday think in terms of being their own boss and being self-sufficient. These types of tax provisions do have a disproportionate impact on small businesses, particularly those just starting out. 
With that, I yield back the remainder of my time. 
I thank the Senator.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I would like to take this time to discuss an amendment that would give families with uninsured children the opportunity to obtain proper health coverage. Congress is constantly searching for ways to provide children with adequate health care, and I have proposed an amendment that would allow children the means to be covered. My amendment would give the working poor health expense accounts to use for their families. 
It is reported that there are 10 million children who are uninsured in the United States. Many of these children are uninsured because their parents have incomes that are high enough to be ineligible for Medicaid or do not have private or employer-sponsored health insurance. 
My amendment would allow families to deposit money in a medical savings account to use for health care services. I believe it is critical to provide lower income families with the option to establish medical savings accounts. MSA's allow consumers to pay for medical expenses through affordable tax-deductible plans that are most suited to their needs. 
Americans want choice in health care. It is time for the Federal Government to listen to the American people and make medical savings accounts an available option. Medical savings accounts are a viable free-market approach to ensuring greater access to affordable health care coverage for the uninsured. Through MSA's, individuals would be given the choice and opportunity to obtain affordable health services. 
I believe our efforts need to be focused on providing uninsured children with accessible health care services. My amendment would give these families the opportunity of setting aside MSA funds, especially benefiting those who are self-employed, between jobs, or employed where health coverage is not available. 
I am hopeful that in the 105th Congress, we will be able to expand the availability of medical savings accounts. Medical savings plans allow individuals the freedom to shop for competitive health care services, which in turn, can help keep the costs of health care down. 
My amendment is one step to achieving the goal of decreasing the number of uninsured children by providing families with the option to receive much needed health care coverage. By making more MSA's available, we can make it easier for parents to finance their children's health care; after all, the health of our Nation's children is at stake.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, recently, the Rocky Mountain News reported on a new program in Colorado, the Community Entrepreneurial Program, which provides small business loans to inner city Denver entrepreneurs. 
The Community Entrepreneurial Program uses private and nonprofit funds, not government money, to fund these micro-loans. It is part of an international effort to set up small businesses around the world, Enterprise Development International, headquartered in Arlington, VA. 
As we continue to find ways to help people help themselves, this program is leading the way in helping individuals with the initiative and drive to start a small business. 
To quote Wil Armstrong, a Denver business leader who is very active in the Community Entrepreneurial Program, `We're backing one little business at a time, trying to make a difference for just one person or one family at a time.'

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise to make a few comments concerning estate tax reform. 
There are a number of things I support in the House tax bill. I am pleased to see cuts in the capital gains tax, and I am pleased to see tax relief for families with children. However, I am very concerned with the proposed adjustment of the estate tax. The estate tax has seen a significant change since 1981, and the current $600,000 exemption has never been adjusted for inflation. If it had been adjusted, it would be worth $840,000 today. The recommended adjustment in the House bill would not even keep pace with inflation and would not ease the substantial economic burden placed on family businesses and farms. 
The proposed Senate version is better but still needs improvement. It raises the exemption to $1 million to all estates by 2008 and would exempt an additional $1 million on family farm and business assets. 
At the time of a person's death, their farm or business has already been subjected to Federal, State, and local tax. The estate tax is a double tax. The estate tax not only places a burden on assets that have already been taxed but it does not discriminate between cash funds and the nonliquid assets and property that make daily activities possible for a family business or farm. These asset-rich, cash-poor businesses can have their livelihood eliminated in order to pay a tax of up to 55 percent--up to 55 percent--of market value of the property left to them. Ironically, the estate tax raises only 1 percent of the Federal Government's revenue but helps to prevent up to 75 percent of family businesses from being passed to a second generation. This practice threatens the stability of our families and communities while inhibiting growth and economic development. 
I strongly support estate tax relief. The current estate and gift tax system poses a great threat to family-owned businesses and farms. I am a cosponsor of legislation to increase unified credit and to index it for inflation. I am also a cosponsor of legislation to eliminate the estate tax entirely. 
Repeal of the estate tax would benefit the economy. George Mason University Professor Richard Wagner has stated that the elimination of the estate tax would enhance the output of the country by $79.2 billion--I repeat, by $79.2 billion--and would create up to 228,000 jobs. Unfortunately, under the current system, the energy that could go into greater productivity is expended by selling off businesses, dividing resources and preparing for the absorption of an estate by the Government. 
The current system leads to the views of an Arizona citrus farmer who said of his family business, `Instead of an inheritance, it's an albatross.' 
We must insist that no more American families lose their businesses because of the estate tax. We must assure that when a family is coping with all the inevitable transition costs of passing a business from one generation to the next, the Federal Government is not there as an added burden. The working people of the United States deserve better. 
Until we accomplish total repeal, I will be working to reduce the burden of this tax. I believe the exemption should be dramatically increased and that the current 17 rates should be reduced to one low, flat rate. The estate tax should then be effectively abolished for family businesses and farms for as long as the assets remain in the family. No family business or farm should ever have to be liquidated just to pay the estate tax. 
I look forward to working with the Senate Finance Committee to reform this outdated and punitive tax system. 
Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time. 
Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I would like to begin by congratulating the people of the Dakotas and Minnesota for their hard work and perserverance through this ordeal. Their resolve speaks volumes about the American spirit, and the American work ethic. I am also pleased with the work of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. These civil servants have helped those Americans affected by natural disasters through one of the worst times of their lives. But Mr. President, I am concerned with the way disaster relief has been handled by Congress and the President. 
What has come to be known as the disaster relief bill, is, in reality, nothing of the sort. Yes, there is disaster relief included in this bill, but there are a number of other provisions as well. Two of these provisions are well known to the American public, and they happen to be two provisions that I favor, and I believe a clear majority of Coloradans favor as well. The most important is the Government Shutdown Prevention Act also known as a continuing resolution. The Government Shutdown Prevention Act would allow the President and Congress to continue good faith budget negotiations without the specter of another Government shutdown. Without this, if the President and Congress cannot agree on funding levels by the end of the fiscal year, the Federal Government will shut down. If this happens, retirement checks, social security payments, Government contracts could all be delayed, national parks would be closed, veterans services would be suspended, and Federal employees would be sent home with pay, a waste of valuable tax dollars. The President objects to the inclusion of the Government Shutdown Prevention Act and vetoed disaster relief, holding those victims of natural disasters hostage, because he did not want to live up to the commitment he made during his State of the Union Address. 
Since the President has objected to riders unrelated to disaster aid, let's look at what is included in his idea of a clean bill minus what he considers to be unrelated riders. His version of a clean bill includes: Assistance to Ukraine; Language concerning buy-American products; $140 million for the Health Education Assistance Loans Program; $650,000 for the National Commission on the Cost of Higher Education to pay salaries and expenses; $33.5 million for the Botanic Garden to pay salaries and expenses; $1.6 million for the Coast Guard to cover operating expenses relating to the TWA flight 800 crash; $650,000 to implement the Cost of Higher Education Review Act of 1997; and changes to the Welfare Reform Act; 
And of most concern to me: $3.5 million for Housing and Urban Development implementation in New York; and $500,000 for a parking garage in Kentucky. 
Many of my colleagues have discussed these issues time and time again, and while many of these projects might be worthwhile, they have nothing to do with disaster relief. But the President overlooks each one of these, and finds fault in preventing the Government from shutting down. I ask the President to stop playing games with the American people by claiming that the Shutdown Prevention Act does not belong in a disaster relief bill when there are multiple unrelated riders, to which he does not object, included in the same bill. I am told that a clean disaster relief bill would be in the area of $3.3 billion. With or without the Shutdown Prevention Act, this is not a clean bill, let us stop playing political games with America. 
The President vetoed the bill because of extraneous provisions, mainly the Government Shutdown Prevention Act. Because this provision is not included, and because of the other provisions unrelated to disaster relief included, I must vote no. A clean bill would not have these additional provisions and I hope that my colleagues can agree that extraneous means extra, no matter whose projects they are. I yield my time.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today, I would like to comment on this historic anniversary that we have reached. Today marks the 30th anniversary of the end of the Six-Day War, and the reunification of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. It is not only a landmark for the people of Israel, and for Jews around the world, but for people of all faiths and all nationalities. 
The 19 years that East Jerusalem was under the control of Jordan saw Jews and Israelis denied the chance to visit the holy sites in the eastern side. The dividing walls and the barbed wire have now come down. When Jerusalem was reunited, Israel opened the city up to all faiths, and that practice continues. Jews, Christians, and Muslims now mingle freely in the entire city. 
Reunification did come at a great cost--the price paid was the Six-Day War. Israel launched a preemptive strike against the Arab troops massed against her, and was successful. It ended the dividing of Jerusalem, but it did not end the gunfire. There is still turmoil in Israel. 
However, although the Mideast peace process is by no means over, we have perhaps reached a point, as described by Churchill, at the end of the beginning. The recognition and continuation of Jerusalem as the undivided capital of Israel is crucial to the ongoing peace process. 
The United States Congress has recognized this fact, and through a series of actions has sought to insure that an undivided Jerusalem is the capital of the State of Israel. Senate Concurrent Resolution 106, in 1990, declared that Jerusalem must remain the undivided capital and called for Israel and the Palestinians to undertake peace negotiations. This war later cited by Prime Minister Rabin as having helped bring participants of the Declaration of Principals on Interim Self-Government Arrangements to the negotiating table. In 1995, the Jerusalem Embassy Act stated as a matter of U.S. Policy that Jerusalem should remain the undivided capital. 
We now celebrate the 30th anniversary of the reunification of Jerusalem, and affirm our desire for that ancient city to remain reunited eternally. I ask, too, that Jerusalem eternally remain a symbol of freedom where all religions can share in visiting the holy city and be a model for religious tolerance and freedom throughout the globe.

Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Senator from Wyoming for yielding. 
In my view, we have had a longstanding problem in the Congress with emergency appropriations, supplemental appropriations, or so-called disaster bills. The problem has been--and truly there has been a disaster such as in North Dakota and Minnesota with the Red River flooding, and that is legitimate. But then built on top of that is a lot of spending that has nothing to do with the emergency nature of this piece of legislation. 
I went on ahead and supported this supplemental appropriations bill even though I had some concerns about the amount of spending that was in the bill. In my view, the truly emergency provisions that are in there run in the dollar range from $2.5 to $4 billion. The bill is an $8.6 billion bill. 
The only thing that made me go ahead and support this particular piece of legislation is a provision in there that said that we would not shut down the Federal Government. I felt it was an appropriate bill. I did not particularly like all the spending that was in there, but I wanted to get something moving ahead so that we could take care of the needs of the people in North Dakota and Minnesota. 
Mr. President, I am disappointed that the President chose to put politics ahead of people. I kept this need to take care of those people in mind, even though I was not entirely happy with the bill. I am disappointed he took such a narrow view. By vetoing the 1997 supplemental appropriations and rescissions bill, he has actually delayed its progress after the Congress has moved ahead. This bill would have provided funding for future disaster relief needs and ensured that we would not face a disaster of another Government shutdown. 
Now, the majority was accused by the minority of being `hard headed and cold hearted' for not submitting the bill to the President sooner. I cannot imagine how outraged they must be now that the President has vetoed the bill. I hope that those who promised to tie up the Senate until this bill is passed are now willing to fight just as hard to override this veto, thereby providing funding for disaster relief and ensuring that there will not be another Government shutdown. 
Let's be clear, this bill is not about holding up money for the flood victims, as some have suggested. Flood victims are currently receiving disaster relief from FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency. To date, FEMA has already allocated over $150 million to victims of the flood. Almost $40 million in housing assistance checks have been issued to more than 21,000 flood victims. In addition, the Small Business Administration has approved more than $75 million in disaster loans. 
In short, the flood victims are being cared for. This bill replenishes funds for FEMA and ensures stability for future disaster funding. 
Just as importantly, this bill is about preventing another disaster, the manmade disaster of a Government shutdown. This seems to be nothing more than a political move by the President designed to ensure that he can shut down the Government again, just as he did before when we were trying to balance the budget. 
This is the same strategy we have seen from the President before. He impedes, stalls, and ultimately vetoes any compromise we reach, playing political games with public safety, and the productivity of our Federal employees. He then tries to get political mileage out of it by blaming the majority in Congress. When an agreement is finally reached, I have no doubt he will take credit for that, too. 
I find it ironic that the President said during his State of the Union Address that the Federal Government should never be shut down again. 
Why, then, does he now veto a bill that does exactly that: Ensure that the Government won't be shut down again? The continuing resolution portion of this bill has ensured that Congress and the President will be allowed to continue budget negotiations in good faith without harming the taxpayers or Federal employees and their families. 
The President needs to put partisan politics aside and focus on what is good for our country. 
I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon because I would like to talk a little bit about the relationship of the citizens of this country to their Government, in this particular case, to the Internal Revenue Service. There is a real burden on most enforcement agencies. When they accuse somebody of a crime, they have the burden of showing beyond a reasonable doubt that the crime was actually committed by that particular individual. That type of burden doesn't exist with the Internal Revenue Service; for whatever reason, your name may come up for an audit, maybe because of some type of a filing that you did in your income tax form that sets off the computer alarms, whatever system that they have. 
That is one of the reasons why I am pushing legislation for a home office exemption. Many times, an audit by the Internal Revenue Service is an indication that you are using part of your home for business, and because of that, you are going to claim a deduction for part of the costs of your home because you are running your business out of that home. 
The Internal Revenue Service frequently approaches taxpayers and says, `Look, we think there is a violation.' The burden is upon that individual to prove they are innocent. So, obviously, the individuals have a great responsibility to keep good records and account for all their expenditures, and whatnot, so that they can justify whatever it is they are doing in the way of business which may allow them a tax deduction, for example. 
On the other hand, I think the agents for the Internal Revenue Service have a particularly awesome responsibility because of the added powers that we grant to them. I just share with this body that I have held more than 56 town meetings since the first of the year and have been very busy in talking to the people of Colorado--I represent the State of Colorado--and hearing about their concerns. It is not surprising that the most frequent issue that came up in the town meetings was related to taxes. People wanted capital gains reduction; they wanted inheritance tax reduction. 
But along with all this concern, they talked about their relationship with the Internal Revenue Service. A lot of them felt there was abuse of power by the Internal Revenue Service. 
There was a decision made last week by U.S. District Judge William Downes which I think highlights another case of taxpayer abuse by the Internal Revenue Service. 
Carole Ward was awarded $250,000 in punitive damages by the Federal Government from the Internal Revenue Service for wrongfully publicizing information about her. After auditing Ward's children's clothing stores--these were young adults, children who decided to go into business for themselves--after auditing the Ward's children's clothing stores, the Internal Revenue Service seized the stores and demanded $325,000 in back taxes. The Internal Revenue Service agents told passersby that Ward was involved in drug dealing. 
Judge Downes was very harsh on the Internal Revenue Service, saying, `This court gives notice to the Internal Revenue Service that reprehensible abuse of authority by one of its employees cannot and will not be tolerated.' 
He went on to describe the behavior of some Internal Revenue Service agents as grossly negligent and they acted with reckless disregard for a law meant to assure Americans that their tax matters are handled with confidentiality. 
While the vast majority of Internal Revenue Service agents and employees are dedicated public servants who work hard to serve the public, it only takes one incident such as this to continue the undermining of public confidence with the Internal Revenue Service. 
Now, Carole Ward had the courage to go into the public arena and fight the Internal Revenue Service, but many American taxpayers are intimidated from responding when the IRS abuses take place. 
I am hopeful that last week's Federal court decision will prompt the Internal Revenue Service to recommit itself to serving the public responsibly and to weed out those agents and employees who abuse their power. I hope they think about their relationship with the taxpayers, not one to make criminals out of taxpayer citizens in this country, but to assist them in filling out their forms and meeting the requirements of the law. 
Again, I encourage all employees of the Internal Revenue Service to look at their added responsibilities and their added responsibility in relation to dealing with the taxpayers and make sure that everybody pays their fair share of taxes and nothing more. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I commend the work of Federal District Court Judge Richard Matsch, the judge in the Oklahoma City bombing case tried in Denver, CO, as well as the prosecution team led by Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Hartzler. 
I do not want to do anything that might prejudice the legal process and sentencing phase of this trial. However, on behalf of all of Colorado, I would like to recognize the outstanding work done thus far. 
Prior to the trial, I took some time out and Judge Matsch took me through the Federal district court and explained to me the security measures that they had taken and explained to me how he wanted to proceed with the trial. I was very impressed with the forethought that had gone into making the proper setting for this very important trial in Denver, CO. 
I realize that the success of something like this is not one man. I realize that a lot of very dedicated people had a role in the progress of this particular trial. But I believe that Judge Matsch has distinguished himself as a jurist and deserves our praise for overseeing the proceedings in this very high-profile case which brought justice for the victims and survivors of the worst act of terrorism ever to hit U.S. soil. 
Confidence in our legal system has been renewed, thanks to the very tight ship run by Judge Matsch, who took a commonsense approach toward the courtroom. Judge Matsch appropriately protected the jurors in his courtroom from distraction and allowed the completely intact jury to reach a unanimous verdict in less than 6 weeks. 
Judge Matsch did a good job because he focused on what was important and not television reaction, prime-time interviews, or book deals. Instead, Judge Matsch focused on justice--justice for the victims of the bombing, justice for their survivors, and justice to the defendant. 
I hope that this commonsense approach is a model for future high-profile cases, and that Judge Matsch does an equally fine job during the sentencing portion of this trial. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, I would like to begin by commending the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici, in fact, the entire Budget Committee, Senator Lautenberg, the ranking member of the committee, for their hard work and diligence in crafting the budget resolution. 
While I am pleased that we have a budget resolution before the Senate, I believe that this document is not without faults and that improvements can be made. 
The people of Colorado elected me on the premise that I would utilize all the tools at my disposal to balance the budget. This is a promise that I made to my constituents and a commitment that I do not take lightly. 
In this light, I am pleased that the current budget debate is focused on not `if' we are going to balance the budget, but `how' are we going to balance the budget. I believe that this is in and of itself a moral victory for those of us who preach fiscal responsibility. Yet, we must now begin the process of balancing the budget by 2002. The framework provided within the budget resolution is an excellent starting point on which we can improve. 
The sense-of-the-Senate amendment talks about what we are going to be doing today. The economy is strong. People have jobs. And the stock market is surging. History tells us, however, that this is not always the case. Unfortunately, the budget resolution assumes economic growth over the next 5 years that is unmatched in this country's history. I am a veterinarian. I am not an economist. But I do know that the document before us today must be able to account for a future that is not necessarily as rosy. 
On the sense-of-the-Senate resolution, we are talking about the years that are following after 2002. Let us say that we have eliminated the deficit. Then what is the next step in the Congress? We need to begin to address the problem of the debt. 
This amendment is a resolution that was adopted on the House side. It says that in order to continue to move forward on the fiscal soundness of this country, we need to begin to pay down the debt, and we do that by spending less than what we bring in in revenues. The amount that I suggested in the sense-of-the-Senate resolution is to spend 1 percent less than what comes in in revenues. 
For example, if we have 5 percent in revenue that comes in in any one of the years, then we would spend out 4 percent. One percent would be moved toward paying down the debt. If the Congress, both the House and the Senate, will commit themselves to this type of plan to pay down the debt, we can balance the budget and pay down the debt by the year 2023. 
The debate so far in both the House and the Senate has been concerning deficits that have been accumulating, and now we must move toward paying those down. I am comfortable that the direction of deficit spending is moving down. But once we eliminate deficit spending, then I think we have to begin to look at paying down the debt. 
The debt is reflected in this budget by the interest that we are paying on the debt, which is running somewhere around $245 billion a year, about 15 percent of our total budget. That is almost as much as what we pay for defense. 
So we put ourselves at considerable liability as we move through the years after 2002 because we do not know what the interest rates are going to be. We do not know whether they are going to be 2 percent, or 6 percent, and heaven forbid if they ever get into the double-digit inflation rates and interest rates that we had in the late 1970's. 
The purpose of this amendment is to begin to pay down that total debt so we don't have that unknown liability that this country will be facing year after year. The sense-of-the-Senate resolution is to point out to the Senate that there is a potential problem. 
So I am asking that this amendment be adopted so that we can begin considering a plan that says that we will begin paying down the debt by spending 1 percent per year less than comes in in revenues, which would eliminate our debt around the year 2023, which would indeed put this country on a very sound fiscal and financial basis. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I again thank the chairman of the Budget Committee and the ranking member of the Budget Committee for their hard work in putting together this agreement. I still have one overriding concern. I think there are a number of Members in the Senate that share my concern about what happens if the revenues we are projecting do not hold up over the years. 
Mr. President, I share the concern that as we move through our economic cycles, the projected revenues in this budget agreement may not hold up. So I think it is a very legitimate question for us to ask ourselves, what happens if the revenues do not hold up to this agreement? Potentially, we could find ourselves back at the negotiating table, working hard to reestablish those priorities set up in the original agreement because the revenues were falling short. 
Mr. President, I ask you bring the Senate to order.

<TEXT>
Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I think it is important that we move toward our goal, that we continue to eliminate the deficit by 2002. The amendment that I am offering considers that if the revenues do not come in as projected, then there will be an automatic adjustment that would occur through the procedure set forth to hold down spending and keep the deficit from increasing. 
We all recognize that the economy goes through cycles. As a member of the House Budget Committee several years ago, I felt the figures coming out of the Congressional Budget Office, built on the first 2 or 3 years prior to that, were good numbers. But I have a feeling that we are reaching the top of our economic cycle and that at some point in time we will be forced to address the problem of not meeting our projected revenues. 
This amendment tries to address that problem. Today, the economy is strong. People have jobs and the stock market is surging. History tells us, however, that this is not always the case. Unfortunately, the budget resolution assumes economic growth over the next 5 years that is unmatched in this country's history. 
The Congressional Budget Office has provided Congress with a series of revised revenue forecasts, all pointing to future economic growth. In fact, balancing the budget is $629 billion easier now than last year at this time. If these revenues do not materialize, then all of our hard work will be lost to increasing deficits. I do not want this hard work to be lost. That is why I have introduced my amendment today. 
The concept behind my amendment is simple: Provide a means to reduce spending within this budget agreement if real revenues fall short of those projected. This amendment will decrease discretionary spending in proportion to the revenue shortfall. This would help ensure that the budget remains on the glidepath to balance by the year 2002. 
I am well aware of the historic nature of this agreement and would like to back the resolution with my undivided support, but I cannot mortgage the future of my children and grandchildren on Congressional Budget Office revenue forecasts. We should make sure that the document before us today has a mechanism to secure deficit forecasts. I do not believe that this change alters the intent of the agreement, but rather enhances its ability to react to changes in the economy, changes we may never see. But we cannot be shortsighted in this matter. If we are going to craft legislation to blueprint the next 5 years, let us be smart enough to realize that we cannot see into the future. Let us be smart enough to include language that allows this agreement to react to future changes. 
I believe we can and should do more. We should do more in the form of tax relief for the American family, more in the form of tax relief for the family farmer, more in the form of reducing waste 
and duplication within the Federal Government. But I also believe that we can do more in future budget debates. 
My amendment is not to serve as a protest, but rather a constructive improvement to a realistic budget compromise. I served on the Budget Committee in the other body and realize how difficult it was even to get to the point where we are today. But this cannot preclude us from holding true to our commitments. This amendment locks in nothing but our commitment to balance the budget. 
My greatest fear is that reduced future revenues will unravel this agreement, just as we have seen with similar resolutions in the past. This amendment allows for future economic changes and would only strengthen the budget resolution. 
The people of Colorado sent me to Washington to balance the budget and, in the process, make sure that any budget agreement keeps the Federal budget on a glidepath to balance. I ask that my colleagues hold true to balancing the budget and support this amendment. 
I yield my time.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I again compliment the chairman and ranking member. I know they have worked hard with the best figures they had. I come from a State, the State of Colorado, that has a balanced budget amendment. I have been involved in the legislative body in the State of Colorado when we went through good years and bad years. During those good years, you look back and you build your budget based on what you think is going to happen at some future point in time. 
The fact is, we do go through economic cycles, and despite the best of intentions and how valid our figures are today, those cycles are unpredictable. I think at one point in time we will have an economic downturn. This Congress needs to be prepared to address those unforeseen circumstances. 
The point of my amendment addresses when those unforeseen circumstances do happen, when revenues coming in do not meet what was forecast and we have a spending level up here and maybe the revenues are coming in lower than expected, we just bring down the spending level and say that we need to adjust our figures in the baseline so that our budget reflects the change in economic conditions in this country. I think it is a commonsense type of amendment, and I ask the Members of the Senate to vote yes on this amendment. I yield the floor.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I would like to respond to the comments made on the floor about our economy and what happens if we go through an economic downturn. 
First of all, I think the biggest burden that the farmers and small businesspeople and the average American family has to deal with in today's world is this huge Federal debt that we are facing. When you look at the amount of interest that we are paying on that debt and the potential liability to the budget, I believe--and this is a fundamental difference being discussed here on the floor of the Senate--but I happen to believe that the most important thing we can do to help our economy, to help the farmers of this country, to help the small businesses and help the homeowner, to help the family businessperson, is to get that burden off their shoulders. 
If you are born today, you are born with a $20,000 debt which each individual in America burdens. How did we get to this point? We got to this point because of the very arguments we just heard on how we need to continue to spend more and more believing that it is going to help our economy. But inevitably we are going to have to pay the price. 
If we do not make the decisions today, the tough decisions today, we are going to have to make them tomorrow. If we do not make those tough decisions, then our children and grandchildren are going to have to pay the price. And I think that is unforgivable. I think it is morally wrong to pass those tough decisions off to the next generation. 
I happen to feel that this is an important amendment because it is holding the Congress accountable, both the House and the Senate. I am saying that if revenues do not measure up, we reduce spending. We have some flexibility in there to protect the most needed programs. I think it is a commonsense amendment. I think it holds true to the agreement generally and the fact that we will hold our priorities together that were agreed upon between the President and the Congress. I think it is a good amendment, and I ask for an aye vote.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, the Mesa Monument Striders have held a road race inside the beautiful landscape of Colorado National Monument since 1993. Over the past 4 years, participation in the race has soared. This year, 250 Rim Rock Run participants will be shut out of the park in an effort by the National Park Service to snuff out a Colorado legacy. 
Yesterday, Deputy Regional Director, Robert Reynolds, upheld the ruling of the park's superintendent to prohibit the race--all in the name of traffic congestion. But this is a 2 hour race held on an early Sunday morning in November. This is a slap in the face to the State of Colorado and the spirit of recreation which national parks were established for. I have watched the culmination of this dispute evolve from an irrational rejection of a race permit to a national dispute over the unjustified actions of a bureaucracy that refuses to listen to the voice of the people. 
The people of western Colorado have bent over backwards to reach a compromise with the park's superintendent. Countless meetings have been held offering rescheduled times and dates or proposals to scale down the size of the race. The sheriff's department has committed their entire force to the security and coordination of the run. The local paper has arranged for a shuttle service to alleviate traffic inconveniences. It is clear to me that no amount of effort to compromise will sway the park service's decision to forbid the race. 
Well, I will not stand for this decision. I am requesting to meet with the acting director of the Park Service to demand a justification for this ludicrous ruling. Next month, this same Park Service is sponsoring the closure of a 13 mile stretch of George Washington Parkway for a road race right here in our Nation's Capital. This might inconvenience a few thousand drivers, but I don't see any Park Service officials challenging the legitimacy of this popular race. If this is the precedent we want to set for holding an event in a national park, then let's just call off the hundreds of events already planned this year in all national parks. 
This controversy is only the latest example of public land managers consistently trying to restrict public access to lands which were set aside for the public to use and enjoy. 
It is not an isolated case. I am convinced that this fight in Colorado is only symptomatic of a much larger problem. 
This is not finished. I will continue to fight this outrageous ruling until someone listens. Closing a national monument road for a few hours to accommodate a simple 23-mile road race should not provoke this kind of controversy. Yet, the Park Service seems determined to continue the controversy by ignoring the runners, the local paper and the community. When will our National Park Service understand that they need to work with the people and not ignore them, especially when we have a community that is willing to do its fair share? 
I yield back the floor.

Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Chair. I rise in support of H.R. 1122, otherwise referred to as the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1997. 
As we have just heard from the previous comments, there are strongly held views on both sides of the abortion issue. I see this every day in my discussions with Coloradans, and I realize that this debate will continue for a long time. The people of my home State of Colorado know that personally I am pro-life and as a State Senator I had a strong pro-life voting record. I maintained that strong stance in my 6 years in the House of Representatives, and I intend to continue to vote my conscience on the issue of abortion during my tenure in the Senate. But what we have before us today is not an issue that breaks down between the pro-choice camp versus the pro-life camp. Even people in the pro-choice camp believe that there are certain reasonable restrictions that should be placed on abortion. A good example is the restriction that we place on public funding of abortions. Each year pro-life people come together with pro-choice individuals to include the Hyde amendment language in the Labor, HHS appropriations bill so that Medicaid money will not be used to fund abortions. Partial-birth abortions should be viewed in a similar light to the public funding issue. 
Mr. President, in my comments I have just used the term partial-birth abortion, and I refer to the bill itself to see how `partial-birth abortion' is defined in the bill. It is defined in this section, and I quote: 
The term `partial-birth abortion' means an abortion in which the person performing the abortion partially vaginally delivers-- 
In other words, the baby is in the birth canal-- a living fetus or baby before killing the fetus and completing the delivery. 
So this is a procedure where the baby is in the birth canal and then whoever is doing the procedure kills the baby and then finishes the delivery. Many pro-choice people agree that the partial-birth abortion procedure should be banned, and a general consensus seems to be forming that this is a brutal procedure which should not be tolerated in a civilized society. 
The reason for this apparent consensus is that it is a medically unnecessary, barbaric procedure. In fact, the front page of today's Washington Times notes that the American Medical Association's board of trustees has determined that there are no situations in which a partial-birth abortion is the only appropriate procedure to induce abortion--the only appropriate procedure to induce abortion. 
It seems likely that President Clinton will bow to political pressures from the extremes in the pro-choice camp and veto this bill. The House passed this bill H.R. 1122 by a veto-proof margin of 295 to 136. In the Senate we will likely need 67 votes in order to ban this procedure. I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation so that we can ban this brutal procedure. 
I yield the floor, Mr. President.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I am proud to announce on behalf of the State of Colorado that today the Senate will have the opportunity to approve House Resolution 25 to allow the placement of the statue of Jack Swigert in National Statuary Hall. 
Coloradans chose astronaut Jack Swigert as the second State statue to be placed in the U.S. Capitol. He was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1982 representing the Sixth Congressional District. Unfortunately, his successful campaign was beset by his battle with bone-marrow cancer. The cancer spread quickly but he insisted on traveling from Colorado to Washington despite his failing health. The Representative-elect died only days before the swearing in ceremony. 
Mr. Swigert is well known as one of the astronauts on the famous Apollo 13 mission. The details of the mission are familiar to many; the suspenseful story of the astronauts' journey was recently depicted in a major movie. The ship and crew of Apollo suffered several complications and disasters, including an oxygen tank explosion that threatened the lives of the crew. It was the relentless determination and competence demonstrated by Jack Swigert and the other crew members that made it possible for the return of the spacecraft to Earth. 
Jack Swigert was born in Denver. He began flying while he was in high school and dedicated himself to becoming a pilot. After graduating from the University of Colorado at Boulder he joined the Air Force and served as a pilot during the Korean war. His strong desire to become an astronaut inspired him to return to school after twice being rejected by NASA's space program. He was admitted to the program at NASA on his third try. 
The statue of Jack Swigert will join the statue commemorating Colorado native Dr. Florence Rena Sabin. Dr. Sabin broke many barriers for women in the field of medicine. She entered medical school in 1893 and pursued a career in medical teaching and research. At a time when women were not considered eligible for the medical teaching profession, she became the first woman to attain the position of full professor at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. She also was the first woman to be invited to join the Rockefeller Institute. 
Upon returning to Colorado, Dr. Sabin was appointed to a subcommittee on public health and helped to draft legislation reorganizing the State health department. At the age of 76, Dr. Sabin took on the duties of manager of the Department of Health and Welfare of Denver and continued to implement public health legislation. 
The passage of House Concurrent Resolution 25 will mark the triumphant end to a 10-year effort to honor Mr. Swigert. The striking statue, which was cast by the Lundeen brothers in my hometown of Loveland, CO, will be provided entirely by private funding. 
Jack Swigert's close friends remember him for his humbling tenacity and courage. I remain in awe of his achievements and spirit, and I am pleased that this statue will join Dr. Sabin in representing the State of Colorado to everyone who visits the Capitol.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to fully restore the home office tax deduction. This legislation is necessary because a recent Supreme Court decision and subsequent IRS regulations have made it impossible for many small business entrepreneurs to use the home office tax deduction. 
During my service in the House of Representatives I introduced this legislation in both the 103d and 104th Congresses. We made great progress in the 104th, and even included a full home office tax deduction in the Contract With America tax legislation. Unfortunately, that tax legislation was vetoed. 
However, by the end of the last Congress we were able to reach agreement with the President on a number of small business tax changes, and among them was a restoration of the tax deduction for home space used for the storage of product samples. This year we should finish the job and restore the full home office tax deduction. 
Increasingly, it is the little guy who gets squeezed by the tax system. While large corporations can rent space and deduct office and virtually all other expenses, many taxpayers who work out of their home are no longer able to deduct their office expenses. 
Traditionally, the Tax Code has permitted individuals who operate businesses within their homes to deduct a portion of the expenses related to that home. However, over the past 20 years Congress, the courts, and the IRS have reduced the scope and usefulness of the deduction. 
The most serious blow came in 1993 when the Supreme Court's ruling in the Soliman decision effectively eliminated the home office deduction for most taxpayers. Under the Supreme Court's new interpretation of `principal place of business' a taxpayer who maintains a home office, but also performs important business related work outside the home is not likely to pass IRS scrutiny. 
This change effectively denies the deduction to taxpayers who work out of their home but also spend time on the road. Those impacted include sales representatives, caterers, teachers, computer repairers, doctors, veterinarians, house painters, consultants, personal trainers, and many more. Even though these taxpayers may have no office other than their home, the work they perform will often deny them a deduction. 
According to the IRS, 1.6 million taxpayers claimed a home office tax deduction in 1991. While not all of these taxpayers were affected by the Court's decision, many were. Clearly, any taxpayers who operate a business out of their home must review their tax situation. 
There are many reasons why a broad home office tax deduction is important. The deduction is pro-family. It helps taxpayers pursue careers that enable them to spend more time with their children. The deduction helps cut 
down on commuting and saves energy. The deduction recognizes the advances of technology--computer and telecommunciations advances mean that more and more individuals will be able to work for themselves and maintain a home office. 
The deduction is a boost to women and minorities who are increasingly starting their own businesses. In fact, over 32 percent of all proprietorships are now owned by women entrepreneurs, and Commerce Department data reveal that 55 percent of these women business owners operate their firms from their home. In addition, there are now well over 1 million minority-owned small businesses and a good number of these are operated out of the home. 
Finally, the home office tax deduction helps our economy. It benefits small businesses and entrepeneurs who develop new ideas, and create jobs. Many of America's most important businesses originated out of a home. 
Small business is increasingly the engine which drives our economy. With large firms downsizing, entrepeneurs must pick up the slack. The importance of this trend is demonstrated by the job shift that occurred during the slow recovery from the most recent recession. During the period of October 1991 to September 1992 large businesses cut 400,000 jobs while small business created 178,000 new jobs. During the boom years of the 1980's, the vast majority of the 20 million new jobs created were in the small business sector. 
It is critical that recent assaults on the home office tax deduction be reversed. That is why I plan to work hard to see that this change in law is enacted as soon as possible.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for yielding to me. 
Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the motion to strike condition 33, relating to effective verification. 
As a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, I believe I have a responsibility to ensure that this treaty can be effectively verified by the intelligence community. 
If the CWC cannot be verified to ensure that it will, in fact, eliminate the scourge of chemical weapons, then what is the point of ratifying it? 
In fact, the CWC may well make things worse, not better, Some signatory countries like China and Iran will use the technology-sharing provisions of titles X and XI, combined with the cloak of international respectability they gain by joining the CWC, to advance their CW programs and exports. 
Condition 33 of the resolution of ratification seeks to address the verifiability problem, by requiring the President to certify to the Congress that the CWC is effectively verifiable before submitting the U.S. instrument of ratification. 
Mr. President, we have all heard what the intelligence community said about the verifiability of the CWC in its National Intelligence Estimate of August 1993, but I think this judgment is worth repeating:  
The capability of the Intelligence Community to monitor compliance with the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) is severely limited and likely to remain so for the rest of this decade. 
If that judgment has changed, the President should be able to provide the necessary certification. But as we well know, and as the Acting Director of the CIA George Tenet has confirmed on several occasions, that judgment has not changed. With all the assets at our disposal, the intelligence community still cannot verify compliance with this treaty. 
The Senate has already discussed the classified aspects of our intelligence and verification capabilities in considerable detail in closed session, and I cannot add anything to that debate now. 
What I would like to do, is provide an example of the way in which a determined proliferator can evade, and deflect, what is perhaps the most extensive scrutiny ever imposed on an unoccupied nation in peacetime. I am referring, of course, to Iraq. 
Iraq is exhibit A for a number of propositions. First, Iraq is the very model of a rogue state. It is a country that has not only developed chemical and biological weapons [CBW], and come within a hair's breadth of producing a nuclear device, but has actually used chemical weapons against Iran, and against its own citizens. 
Second, as a nonsignatory to the CWC, Iraq is an example of those countries that will not be constrained by the CWC, and will proceed apace with the production of chemical weapons. 
Third, and this is the point I wish to focus on, Iraq is the most current example of the effectiveness--or the lack thereof--of even the most intrusive international monitoring. 
Treaty supporters point to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons [OPCW]--and especially the ability of OPCW inspectors to carry out challenger inspections of suspected violations--as a means of effective verification. 
Yet the intelligence community concludes, in an unclassified excerpt from the 1993 NIE, that: 
The key provision of the monitoring regime--challenge inspections at undeclared sites--can be thwarted by a nation determined to preserve a small, secret program by using the delays and managed access rules allowed by the convention. 
Acting CIA Director Tenet reiterated that judgment in a letter to Senator Kyl, dated March 26, 1997. 
In the 6 years since the end of the Persian Gulf war, weapons inspectors from the U.N. Special Commission [UNSCOM] have combed Iraq in search of nuclear, chemical, biological, and missile production and storage sites--inspectors armed with powers far greater than those of OPCW inspectors, I might add. 
Despite this extraordinary level of scrutiny, Iraq is believed to retain: chemical weapon precursors and production equipment, and possibly large quantities of deadly VX agent and munitions; BW cultures, production equipment, agent and weapons. These stocks can be used to create a large stockpile in a matter of days; and an operational SCUD missile capability, including support vehicles, launchers, fuel, operational missiles, and, most alarming of all, possible chemical or biological warheads. 
Last, Iraq retains nuclear weapons blueprints, machine-tools, and know-how; is believed to be continuing its nuclear weapons design work; and probably has the ability to create a nuclear weapon--if it obtains fissile materials--with very little warning. 
Mr. President, I am not reciting this information in order to criticize UNSCOM. I commend Ambassador Rolf Ekeus, and the dedicated UNSCOM inspectors, for their persistence in the face of determined Iraqi resistance and intimidation. 
But if these are the results of 6 years of international monitoring of Iraq--a pariah country, defeated in war, and subjected to massive invasions of its national sovereignty--then I wonder what the OPCW inspectors, with their far more limited powers, can realistically hope to accomplish in other countries? 
As a final note, I should remind my colleagues that before the gulf war, Iraq was a member in good standing of the International Atomic Energy Commission, or IAEA, subject to all the usual IAEA inspections and safeguards. 
Yet Saddam Hussein was within months of having a nuclear weapons capability on August 2, 1990, when he invaded Kuwait. Had Saddam waited until he had a nuclear device, Kuwait might yet be the 19th province of Iraq--and tens of thousands of people, including thousands of American soldiers, might have died. 
Mr. President, I believe that our experience with Iraq demonstrates the intractable problems posed by the verification of the CWC. Supporters of the treaty say, `But we have learned from our experience with Iraq, and we will do better next time.' I cannot join them in that optimistic conclusion. 
If the President of the United States cannot certify that this treaty can be effectively verified, as defined in condition 33, then the Senate should not ratify this treaty. 
I oppose the motion to strike condition 33.

 Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce a line-item veto constitutional amendment. 
This action is particularly timely in light of the decision by a Federal district court judge which declared the recently enacted statutory line-item veto, or more accurately, enhanced rescission authority, to be unconstitutional. 
This judge's decision may be overturned, or Congress may be able to modify the language in a way that satisfies the courts. Baring either of these, a line-item veto can only be provided by amending the Constitution. 
Fortunately, Congress provided for expedited judicial review of the constitutionality of the 1996 Line Item Veto legislation, and the Supreme Court has agreed to hear arguments in the case next month, and to render a decision by July. 
Prior to my election to the Senate I served in the House of Representatives. In that body I introduced a constitutional line-item veto on several occasions. This was motivated by my view that the greatest threat to our economy is the continued deficits which Congress piles on top of the accumulated $5.3 trillion national debt. 
Obviously, the budget system that we have in place is not working. We need a balanced budget amendment and a line-item veto. 
Last year, Congress gave the President what is generally referred to as expanded rescission authority. The Republican Congress committed to give this authority to whoever was elected President in 1996, Democrat or Republican. It was immaterial to us, our objective was to provide a bi-partisan tool to help eliminate wasteful spending beginning on January 1, 1997. 
Last year's legislation was an expansion of the very limited rescission authority granted to the President in 1974 under the Impoundment Control Act. Under that earlier statute, the President could indicate items in the budget that he wanted to rescind, but he was required to obtain the support of both Houses of Congress in order for the rescission to actually be enacted. The budget history of the past two decades demonstrates better than I could why this is akin to the fox guarding the henhouse. 
The Line-Item Veto Act reversed this burden and required the Congress to disapprove any rescissions identified by the President within 30 days. If this deadline was not met, then the item was eliminated. 
This new authority permitted three types of rescissions. First, discretionary appropriations could be rescinded. Discretionary spending is about one-third of the budget and is where most of what is considered pork barrel spending occurs. 
Second, the law permitted the rescission of any new item of entitlement spending. While currently existing entitlements would be exempt, any new item could be stricken--entitlements constitute the remaining two-thirds of the budget and is certainly the fastest growing portion of the budget. 
Finally, certain limited tax benefits could be rescinded. These limited tax provisions were generally defined as provisions that provided a federal tax deduction, credit, exclusion, or preference to 100 or fewer beneficiaries. 
The judge who ruled the line item veto statute unconstitutional focused on the fact that the cancellation or rescission authority under the statue exists only after the President signs a bill. He has up to 5 days after signature to identify these rescissions. The judge concluded that this was an unconstitutional delegation of Congressional power. 
I find this reasoning puzzling since the statute was crafted in a manner that Congress believed to be consistent with past Supreme Court decisions concerning Congressional delegation of authority. The statute also provides nearly identical authority to the impoundment authority held by all Presidents from George Washington up through 1974 when Congress voted to deny this authority to future presidents. 
Obviously, we will hear the final word on this in July. One thing however, is certain. The authority given to the President last year was different from that authority held by 43 state governors. In the states the governor has the explicit authority to line item veto provisions in a bill as part of the actual bill-signing process. 
I believe it is time that we take the approach of the states. In order to do this we must enact a Constitutional Amendment. Under article I, section 7 of the Constitution, the President's veto authority has been interpreted to mean that he must sign or veto an entire piece of legislation--he cannot pick and choose. 
This language reads: `Every Bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it becomes a Law, be presented to the President of the United States; If he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, with his Objections to that House in which it shall have originated, . . .' this section then proceeds to outline the procedures by which Congress may override this veto with a two-thirds vote of both houses. 
The amendment that I am introducing today amends this language as it pertains to appropriations bills. It specifically provides that the President shall have the power to disapprove any appropriation of an appropriations bill at the time the President approves the bill. 
This change will make explicit that the President is no longer confined to either vetoing or signing an entire bill, but that he may choose to single out certain appropriations for veto and still sign a portion of the bill. 
I noted earlier that 43 state governors have some type of line item veto. This is consistent with the approach taken in most state constitutions of providing a greater level of detail concerning the budget process than is contained in the U.S. Constitution. In my view, the line item veto has been an important factor in the more responsible budgeting that occurs at the state level. 
Colorado is one of the states that gives line item veto authority to the governor. That power, along with a balanced budget requirement in the state constitution, has worked well and insured that Colorado has been governed in a fiscally responsible manner regardless of who served in the legislature or in the governor's office. 
Mr. President, I look forward to further discussion on this important issue. I realize that the Supreme Court may overturn the lower court decision and declare the line item veto statute constitutional. However, in my mind, this is no substitute for moving ahead on a constitutional amendment. It is time to eliminate the uncertainly, and provide for explicit line item veto authority for the President.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I rise as a cosponsor and supporter of S. 495, The Chemical and Biological Weapons Threat Reduction Act of 1997. This bill will truly provide the United States the tools it needs and deserves from chemical and biological weapons. It is a comprehensive domestic and international plan to reduce the threat of chemical and biological weapons use, setting forth practical, realistic, and achievable nonproliferation measures to combat the very real dangers posed by these weapons. 
Because of the horrible nature of these weapons, the United States has dismantled its biological weapons program and is now unilaterally destroying its entire stockpile of chemical weapons. This bill reinforces our commitment to finish the job.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that will reform the relationship between central cities and their outlying areas in terms of distribution of highway funds. This issue was brought to my attention by one county in my State and they were quickly joined by several others who feel they have been treated unfairly in their MPO. 
The current law governing MPO's is the 1991 Intermodal Service Transportation and Efficiency Act. This legislation established the planning powers of MPO's and also set standards for membership and qualifications for leaving MPO's. A number of counties in my State have indicated they are unhappy in their particular MPO and would like to leave. However, current law prohibits this. 
One case in particular that has been brought to my attention is Douglas County's experience since 1991. Douglas County is directly south of Denver and is the fastest growing county in the Nation. Furthermore, they are a linkage county connecting Denver and Colorado Springs, which makes Douglas County's transportation needs tremendous. To meet these needs they have attempted to work with their MPO to receive an equitable share of funds. Douglas County has demonstrated that these attempts have failed, while they are 5.27 percent of their MPO, over the years their funding has been .35 percent for the fiscal year 1993-1995 cycle, 1.2 percent for the fiscal year 1995-1997 cycle, and .4 percent of the fiscal year 1997-1999 cycle. Clearly, there is a problem with how these funds are being distributed. 
This issue cannot be dismissed as a one county problem either. In the Denver regional county of governments MPO [DRCOG], with the exception of Denver County, I have received letters from every county supporting the legislation I am introducing today. 
This legislation would lower the barrier for disaffected parties that would like to create their own MPO or join an adjacent MPO. This legislation eliminates the 75 percent of the effected population threshold to leave necessary in current law, and lowers that to 50 percent. Furthermore, it would eliminate the central city veto authority. 
This legislation will have no effect on those who are content with their MPO. Nor will this legislation have any impact on central cities that have worked with their MPO members equitably. It will only impact those areas where counties are being held in a relationship they feel is unfair. It's my hope that in future deliberations on transportation matters we can address and resolve this issue.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to make a few remarks concerning April 15. That is today. As all Americans are no doubt aware, today is tax day. Millions of Americans spent this past weekend finalizing their returns. Today those returns are due. 
However, while the returns and taxes are due today, the tax burden continues. According to the Tax Foundation, the average American family now must work until May 9 in order to pay local, State, and Federal taxes. April 15 may be tax return day, but May 9 is tax freedom day. 
The Tax Foundation also reports that Federal, State, and local taxes now cost a typical two-earner family more than that family spends on food, clothing, transportation, and housing combined. It is no wonder that most families require more than one income. As families work through their tax returns, many were no doubt struck by the complexity of the tax system. Earlier this year, Money magazine revealed the results of its annual report on tax complexity. The magazine commissioned 45 tax professionals, many of them CPA's, to complete the tax return of a hypothetical and prosperous American family. While this hypothetical family certainly had more tax issues to deal with than the typical family, the issues raised were not unique and should have been very familiar to tax professionals. 
The results reported in the Money article were astounding. No two preparers came up with the same result, and the fluctuation in the level of the taxes was striking. There were literally tens of thousands of dollars of differences between the calculations of some of the preparers. 
Nearly $14 billion is spent by the Internal Revenue Service and other Federal agencies to enforce the tax laws each year. There are 136,000 employees of the Internal Revenue Service. There are 17,000 pages of Internal Revenue Service laws. There are 480 tax forms published by the Internal Revenue Service, and there are an estimated 8 billion pages of forms and instructions sent out by the Internal Revenue Service every year. 
I think these statistics make the case for tax reform. There are certainly a number of reforms that need to be made at the Internal Revenue Service. However, Congress is the principal entity responsible for the Tax Code. Congress should scrap the current tax system and start fresh with a simple and fair system. 
I support taking this action now. However, if our leadership determines we cannot reach agreement with the President on comprehensive tax reform, then we should at a minimum reduce taxes this year. This should be done by a reduction in the capital gains tax by at least half the current rate for all individuals, eliminate the estate taxes, and a reduction in the family tax burden. This action should be done as a part of the budget and should not be delayed. 
Before I close, I would like to mention a necessary tax change in health care. This concerns medical savings accounts. Last year, Congress made the tax changes necessary to make medical savings accounts available for up to 750,000 individuals. Medical 
savings accounts allow companies to give the funds currently set aside for health benefits directly to their employees. These employees are then empowered to purchase their own health plans and set aside funds for future medical expenses. 
MSA's, or medical savings accounts, are an important counterweight to Government and health care bureaucracies. They put greater power in the hands of individuals and families. The changes made last year have proven popular and demand for medical savings accounts is high. But even before Congress provided the full deductibility for MSA's, many employers offered them successfully for years. 
Last year, I opposed the artificial cap on medical savings accounts, and today I am introducing legislation that would make medical savings accounts available to all taxpayers. This will foster the type of empowerment and competition that we need in health care. It will also increase health care coverage for the self-employed and, thus, those in transition from one job to another. Medical savings accounts are the ultimate form of health care portability. 
Medical savings accounts provide a superior alternative to a further expansion of Government-run health care. Americans want health care choice and competition, not more bureaucracy. 
I invite all my Senate colleagues to cosponsor this MSA extension legislation. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I am introducing, The Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund Amendments Act of 1997. This legislation, if enacted, would change who controls the bulk of the money from the trust fund, and the purposes for which the money can be spent. The legislation is simple, it mandates that 85 percent of the money in the trust fund must be allocated to the States. It's my view that since the States are responsible for the bulk of underground storage tank enforcement and cleanup, they should have greater control over the dollars. 
This legislation also broadens the purposes for which trust fund dollars can be spent. Under this legislation States would have the authority to use the funds to meet the greater demand for cleanup. 
There has been some concern expressed about how trust fund money has been targeted up to this point. For example, since inception of the program only 1 percent of the money has been used for actual cleanup of orphan tanks. The other 99 percent has gone to administration and enforcement. I think there should be some discussion on whether this money can be spent with greater environmental benefit. Instead of targeting 99 percent to administration and enforcement, perhaps it would be a better idea to help owners and operators who need financial assistance to handle their problem. Since the money for assistance would come from a dedicated tax, and not the general fund, why not get as big an environmental bang for the buck as possible. By taking this action we may also be able to have more appropriated out of the trust fund every year. As some may be aware, only a small portion of the $1.5 billion in the trust fund is appropriated every year. If we can show that the money being appropriated is directly cleaning up tanks, we can certainly make a better claim for those dollars. 
Finally, I understand that EPA and some Members have concerns with this legislation. I think that working with Chairman Smith and Chairman Chafee, and their staffs, we can craft legislation that will be signed into law.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that would provide for a land exchange between the city of Greeley, the Water Supply and Storage Co., and the Forest Service. This legislation was introduced last year and was passed by the House of Representatives as part of the Presidio package. It's my hope that we can pass this legislation and have it signed into law before the session ends. 
The city of Greeley and Water Supply and Storage operate eight reservoirs in the Arapaho-Roosevelt National Forest. Because of the location of the reservoirs they are operated under Forest Service supervision. This supervision has at times been controversial due to disputes concerning whether being located on Forest Service property allows them to divert water in the national forest for purposes other than the benefit of the owners. The legislation I am introducing would benefit Greeley and Water Supply and Storage by allowing them to protect these significant investments. As an additional benefit this legislation would put an end to a bitter dispute between Greeley and the Forest Service. The national forest would also greatly benefit from this legislation. It would receive 708 acres of inholdings within the forest and the wilderness area. This land has been sought by the Forest Service for some time and this exchange would finally allow them to consolidate valuable resources in Colorado. 
I offered this same bill last year when I was in the House of Representatives. Unfortunately, it was caught up in election year politics, specifically, my election. This year I want to put that behind, and work toward passing this legislation as negotiated over the past several years with Greeley, and with Water Supply and Storage, and with the Forest Service. 
I believe that as introduced this legislation strikes a balance between protecting the rights of my constituents in Greeley and Thornton and protecting the environment. 
As currently drafted, Greeley and Thornton have not only agreed to transfer their inholdings, they have also agreed to continue to participate in negotiations with a variety of governmental organizations and environmental groups to designate habitat for the whooping crane. Furthermore, they have agreed to an improved stream flow in the Poudre River as a condition of the exchange and since many westerners would rather part with blood than water, I think they've gone the extra mile. 
This legislation is win/win for all involved. We should put all the politics behind us, pass the legislation, and move on to matters that are less easily resolved.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, during my campaign for the U.S. Senate, I expressed the themes of balancing the budget, congressional reform, making Government smaller, and moving the power out of Washington and to the States and localities. This is why I am proud to introduce Senate bill 519, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation Termination Act, better known as the OPIC Termination Act. 
As a Member of the other body during the 104th Congress, I voted to reform the welfare system of this country. I voted to end the subsidies for farmers. And now I believe it is time to end this form of corporate welfare for large companies. 
I have never believed in give-away programs. Whether you are a farmer or a large corporate owner, you should play by the rules of the free market system. `Less Government' should be the motto of this Congress. 
OPIC is a Government agency which was established in 1969 and is now active in 144 countries. It finances investments for American Fortune 500 companies through direct loans, subsidized loan programs, and insures them against political risk, expropriation and political violence. It entices companies to enter into risky transactions from which private lenders shy away. 
This private activity may seem to have a good end goal, but the problem is not the end but the means. Basically, this is an insurance program run by the Federal Government for corporations who want to invest in risky political situations. In short, we are running an insurance program for major corporations. 
What makes this even more problematic is that OPIC does not back this investment with their own finances, but with the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government--in its simplest terms, the U.S. taxpayer. Every loan and loan guarantee that OPIC finances puts the U.S. taxpayer at risk. Today, nearly $25 billion is being risked in the name of the taxpayers of these corporate OPIC loans. 
Compounding the situation is that these loans and loan guarantees are not safe investments. The Congressional Budget Office supplied a list of the quality of the portfolio at the end of the year, 1995. OPIC has consistently taken risks in operations that are defined with the D-minus credit rating and even an F-double-negative credit rating. 
As a member of the Banking Committee, I can assure you that if the U.S. taxpayer goes into a bank to get a loan to buy a house and they have an F-double-negative credit rating, the bank will ask you to please leave the building. But the Overseas Private Investment Corporation does it every year, and with the hard-working taxpayers' money, dollars backing these loans. So the same taxpayer who can never have a chance to secure a loan with this rating is securing loans for projects with the same kind of credit rating. 
The simple fact is subsidies have shown that this portfolio is so risky you cannot even privatize OPIC because no buyer could risk losing billions of dollars if these loans go bad. Proponents of OPIC state that no loan or loan guarantee has gone bad and this is not risky. 
If this scenario sounds familiar, it is because we have seen it before. In the late 1980's, the same claims were made by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, at least until the crisis hit. One decade and $180 billion in taxpayer bailout dollars later, we found this was not the case. It has 
been said that if we do not learn from the past, we will ultimately repeat it. If we do repeat history, it will again be the farmer in Sterling, the technician in Denver, and the accountant in Grand Junction who picks up the bill. I have learned from the past, and I do not want my children and grandchildren to suffer through another corporate bailout. 
Who gets these loans? Coca-Cola, DuPont, Union Carbide, McDonald's, and even two banks, Chase Manhattan and Citicorp. These, and many other large companies with OPIC loans, are not cash-starved companies, but companies with strong bottom lines. I do not believe the Federal Government should be in the business of business, and I do believe these companies can stay strong and survive without OPIC. As in life, if the risk is too high, then maybe you should look elsewhere. 
What do OPIC loans buy? We, the taxpayers, have developed a soft drink bottling company in Poland and Ghana, a travel agency in Armenia, a magazine in Russia, a lumber mill in Lithuania, an art gallery in Haiti, cable television in Argentina, a hamburger bun bakery and phone book directories in Brazil. 
Now, there may be some worthwhile projects and successes funded by OPIC, but, again, I do not believe that we need to be risking hard-working taxpayer money on these ventures. Plus, this is a subsidy that does not get built into the cost of a product which may compete against American products that are not subsidized. 
Also, proponents of OPIC believe that if OPIC does not provide this insurance, then companies will not enter these risky markets. There are certainly private alternatives to OPIC's activities and one is starting investment funds for developing countries. Today, there are hundreds of private developing country investment funds. Portfolio money is flowing into all parts of the developing world. If interested, they are listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Even the proponents cannot deny the existence of those private alternatives or that they may be available at lower cost. However, it seems they know a good deal when they see one. With OPIC selling the full faith and credit of the U.S. taxpayer, foreign governments would be less likely to stick them with the bill. 
Again, here lies the problem. These subsidized loans to promote trade and investment abroad distort the flow of capital and resources away from the most efficient uses, thus distorting trade and investment abroad. OPIC's impact on U.S. capital and resource markets may be negative due to these distortionary effects of subsidized loans. In layman's terms, OPIC distorts the marketplace, pushing out private investment, and does not allow it to grow. 
This leads to the question, `Is this the appropriate role for Government?' What we are doing with OPIC is investing money in countries involving risky business deals. We are trying to help other countries' government-run corporations make the transition to the private sector. To do that, we run a Government corporation. Thus, we are trying to end other countries' government subsidies by running Government subsidies right here in Washington. This is not moving the power away from Washington, but right into the heart of DC. 
I am not the only one saying that it is time for OPIC to go. In the other body, Representatives Andrews, Kasich, Sanders, Royce, Condit, DeFazio, Klug, Peterson, Shadegg, Jackson, Pascrell, and Dickey have introduced H.R. 387 eliminating OPIC. 
Also, the National Taxpayers Union says few other Federal programs combine such undesirable elements as corporate welfare, wasteful spending, unnecessary foreign aid, mismanagement and risk to the American taxpayers as the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. 
Milton Friedman, one of the leading experts of economics from the Chicago School of Economics, said he does not see any redeeming aspects in the existence of OPIC. It is special interest legislation of the worst kind. 
This leads me to another important reason why OPIC should be eliminated. 
It seems to me that OPIC may be used as a political slush fund. Whether this is a perception or truth, I believe it is time to end this perception of impropriety.

Mr. ALLARD. The headline from above the fold says, `Trade-trip firms netted $5.5 billion in aid, Donated $2.3 million to Democrats.' It goes on to state that 27 corporations that sent executives on trade trips with late Commerce Secretary Ron Brown received part of a multibillion-dollar commitment in OPIC loans and guarantees. All but 3 of the 27 OPIC recipients donated to Democratic Party committees, and most of them gave $50,000 to $385,000 during the President's first term. 
As mentioned in the story, it is very difficult to ascertain whether the OPIC loan influenced giving to the party, or if the donation influenced who received the OPIC assistance, or if there was any impropriety at all. 
To me, it does not matter. Since the awarding of OPIC assistance is entirely discretionary by the administration in power, it invites and welcomes possible abuse as described in the Boston Globe. OPIC should not exist in the first place, and even the perception that it could be used as a slush fund, whether Republican or Democrats, makes its elimination even more important. 
With this bill, some proponents of OPIC will describe me as antibusiness or antitrade. I guess to them, getting the Government out of the business of business is antibusiness. I must say that I believe this is a probusiness, anti big Government proposal. 
I am a free trader. I am a supporter of the GATT and NAFTA, and believe that free trade is the best way to raise the living standards for all Americans. We need to support policies that reduce trade barriers. OPIC does not reduce trade barriers for all companies to compete in the marketplace. It is an income transfer program from U.S. taxpayers to a selected group of businesses, who may have donated or will feel obligated to give to a political party. These subsidies may increase exports for a few selected companies that have the political influence to secure these loans, but it does little to expand the overall economic growth of this country. OPIC loans protect inefficiency and reduce total economic activity, shifting economic resources from taxpayers and unsubsidized businesses to politically connected businesses. Free trade is about getting the Government out of the private sector. The Federal Government can advocate U.S. business and trade without supporting politically connected businesses. Let us push for open markets, not for open political purses. 
Last, as we are attempting to balance the budget by the year 2002 and reduce Government spending, we must begin to eliminate giveaway programs and corporate welfare. Eliminating OPIC will save $107 million this year and $296 million over the next 5 years. This does not include the money saved if any of OPIC loans or guarantees go bad and have to be bailed out by the taxpayers. We must get all spending under control and all parts of the budget must sacrifice. Balancing our budget will do more to increase economic and job growth than any OPIC loan can offer. 
Mr. President, this effort is supported by individuals on both the left and the right of the political spectrum. With all the talk by liberals and conservatives about eliminating corporate welfare, I believe it is time we begin to do what we say and it ought to start here with OPIC. OPIC should not exist under a Republican or Democrat President or Congress. 
I thank you for this time and I ask all my colleagues to support S. 519 and this effort to eliminate the Overseas Private Investment Corporation.

 Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, one of Colorado's most prominent newspapers, the Colorado Springs Gazette, celebrated 125 years of service to the Pikes Peak region on March 23, 1997. 
Although known as the Colorado Springs Gazette-Telegraph since 1947, the newspaper used its 125th birthday as an opportunity to return to its earlier roots as the Colorado Springs Gazette. 
Colorado Springs is one of Colorado's most vibrant communities having experienced tremendous growth in recent decades. It is home to some of our Nation's most important military facilities such as Fort Carson Army Base, Falcon Air Force Base, the U.S. Air Force Academy and NORAD, U.S. Space Command, and the Air Force Space Command at Peterson Air Force Base. Most recently, several prominent family values advocacy organizations have located in Colorado Springs. 
The founder of the newspaper, Gen. William Jackson Palmer, also is regarded as the founder of Colorado Springs. In fact, as the 125th anniversary edition of the Gazette pointed out, the city and the newspaper literally grew up together. 
The colorful history of Colorado Springs has been chronicled for 125 years in the pages of the Colorado Springs Gazette and I join the State of Colorado in wishing its publisher, N. Christian Anderson III and the entire Gazette staff, congratulations.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a fine American, a great father and a good friend, Paul Hoshiko of Eaton, Colorado. Paul recently passed away, but left behind him a legacy of accomplishment and achievement that deserves to be recognized by all Americans. 
To many, Paul Hoshiko was known as a leader in the agricultural arena. To others he was known for his civic involvement and his donation of time and money for various charities. I knew him not only in those regards, but also as a moral man who put his family first; who had a deep and abiding faith in his God; and one who was an unabashed patriot. But in all regards and to all who knew him, Paul Hoshiko, was admired and respected. 
He served on numerous boards and committees throughout his life which showed his standing in the community. One of the most prestigious positions he held was his appointment by the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture to the Colorado State Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Committee. Some other organizations he was involved with were the Extension Advisory Committee, Colorado Seed Growers Association, Central Weld Water District, member of Kersey & Greeley area Chamber of Commerce, member of Weld County Farm Bureau, Director of Lower Latham Reservoir for over 30 years, and the hospital foundation, among others. He received countless awards from these associations which illustrate his leadership and influence. 
Paul was perhaps best known around the country as the `onion king'. In fact, his sole appearance on commercial television (at least so far as I know) was standing in an onion field explaining to a future U.S. Senator what it took, `to be a good onion man'. He was elected to the Board of the National Onion Association and served as president for five years. During his tenure the national office was moved to Greeley, Colorado. He served on the board of directors of this association until his death. 
However, perhaps most notable and dearest to his heart, Paul should be recognized for his lifelong devotion to the 4-H program. He actively participated in this organization his entire life, both as a member and as a leader. He was continuously taking strides to make 4-H an astronomical success, including but not limited to his active involvement in the International Farm Youth Exchange program, the National Western Stock Show, an annual State 4-H golf tournament, and a 4-H lighted softball field. He made a tremendous impact on those lives he touched while partaking in the 4-H program. His devotion is reflected in the faces of those youth who had the opportunity to work with him in these projects. 
In summary, Mr. President, as you can see by my remarks, Paul was a born leader. He gave to his family, community, church and region unselfishly. He was the kind of man who only comes along every so often . . . and his life deserves to be recognized.

Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Senator from Delaware for yielding me some time. 
Madam President, today we must decide to vote in favor of a waiver to allow a very competent and worthy candidate to be the new U.S. Trade Representative or to vote to uphold current law. I have decided to uphold current law. It must be made clear that I do not doubt the competency and ability of Ambassador Barshefsky to faithfully serve as the next U.S. Trade Representative. She has done a tremendous job as the Deputy USTR and has proven herself to be a competent public servant. 
The law we are asked to waive is not some arcane law that has been on the books for decades which may have served us well in the past but is a law that was passed only 2 years ago. The Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 was a very important piece of legislation that opened the doors to the public to see who is attempting to influence our elected officials. Section 21 of the act specifically states that no person who has represented a foreign entity may be appointed as a U.S. Trade Representative or the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative.

Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, while I regret that I have to vote against Ambassador Barshefsky's worthy nomination, I believe as lawmakers we must not only strive to enact the best laws but also to obey not only the letter of the law but also the spirit of the law. Why do we pass laws if the first time they become problematic, we decide to grant a waiver. In the last couple of months, I have heard too many politicians say that it was out of necessity that they bend the law or ignore the spirit of the law or assume that it may not be illegal, and then promise it will not happen again. My solution to this dilemma is to follow the law or repeal it. 
While in the other body, I voted for the Lobbying Disclosure Act and have consistently promised my constituents that I will work hard to enact congressional reform. In this vein, I cannot turn my back on them or on the law that I fought hard to enact. I understand why many will vote for this waiver because Ambassador Barshefsky would make a tremendous USTR, but I must regretfully vote no and only hope that this waiver granting procedure doesn't start a bad precedent for the future. In conclusion, I am voting against the Hollings amendment and the waiver.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Utah for his fine work and debate here on the floor on the balanced budget amendment. I am going to vote for the balanced budget amendment because I am going to keep my campaign promise that I made during the election. It is not a campaign promise that I made lightly. 
I have voted for this very same proposal as a Member of the 105th Congress as a Member of the House of Representatives. I have served in a State that has a balanced budget requirement. I have been the owner of a business that has had to balance its budget. I have been a part of a family that has had to balance its budget. 
I think it is important for the future of our children and our grandchildren that we balance the budget. The only way I see us ever eliminating deficit spending is to pass a requirement in the Constitution that says that we have to balance the budget. For 28 years, we have heard from both Republicans and Democrats on the importance of balancing the budget. That is why I am casting my vote for a balanced budget amendment today.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, first I would like to thank my colleague from Missouri for taking the lead on this important issue of term-limits. Term-limits has been a concern of the people of Colorado for many years. They have said time and time again that the hour has come for Congressional term-limits and I share this belief. That is why I am a proud sponsor of Senate Joint Resolution 16, the Ashcroft-Thompson Term Limitation bill which limits Representatives to 6 years in the House and Senators to 12 years in the Senate. 
In 1990 with 71 percent of the vote, the State of Colorado was the first State to pass a constitutional amendment limiting the number of years for Congressional Members--12 years in the House of Representatives and 12 years in the Senate. Four years later, Colorado passed a more restrictive term limit initiative of 6 years in the House and 12 years in the Senate. Since 1990, 22 other States passed some form of term-limits with the support of over 25 million Americans. However, in 1995, the Supreme Court ruled that State set term-limits for Federal officials were unconstitutional. With the Supreme Court's decision in mind, Colorado voters passed amendment 12 in 1996. The Term Limits Initiative calls for Colorado's elected officials to introduce term-limit legislation, vote in favor of the Congressional Term Limits Amendment, and states that if a member of the congressional delegation does not vote in favor of the amendment then the designation of disregarded voter instruction on term-limits next to their name on the ballot. 
Mr. President, at this time I ask unanimous consent to insert into the Record a copy of the amendment 12 language at the end of my statement.

Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, while I believe that States should have the opportunity to set limits for their elected officials, as Colorado has done on a number of occasions, the Supreme Court's decision has left this important decision up to us. Some have argued that there is little chance that Members of Congress will ever limit their own terms and thereby limit their power. While there is some merit to this argument, I must say that this gives us a great opportunity to show that we, as elected officials, can heed the will of the people and impose term-limits on ourselves. 
I began fighting for term-limits while in the State Senate of Colorado and was one of four State Senators to stand-up on the Colorado Senate floor in favor of them. As a Member of the House of Representatives, I introduced and co-sponsored numerous pieces of term-limit legislation. I was very proud to be a part of the 104th Congress where we voted for the first time in history on a term-limit constitutional amendment. 
I have always believed that our elected officials should be citizen legislators. Citizens from all walks of life with new ideas, thoughts and private work experience fresh in their memory should have a chance to serve. Term-limits will ensure that lawmakers do not become too far-removed from their constituents and will allow more citizens the opportunity to serve. Our legislatures will have a better understanding of main street and how their laws and actions affect the everyday lives of working men and women. 
We find the concept of a citizen legislature in the very foundation of this country. In Article 57 of the Federalist Papers, my most admired historical figure, James Madison wrote: 
The aim of every political constitution is, or ought to be, first to obtain for rulers men who possess most wisdom to discern, and most virtue to pursue, the common good of society; and in the next place, to take the most effectual precautions for keeping them virtuous whilest they continue to hold their public trust. The elective mode of obtaining rulers is the characteristic policy of republican government. The means relied on in this form of government for preventing their degeneracy are numerous and various. The most effectual one is such a limitation of the term of appointments as will maintain a proper responsibility to the people. 
Mr. President, I wholehearted agree with Mr. Madison and his assessment. Despite the large classes in 1994 and 1996, incumbent re-election rates still exceed 90 percent. Term-limits at the State and local levels have made our elections more open and competitive thereby opening the doors to all Americans and allowing for a more diverse legislature. Federal elections would be re-energized by opening-up politics to many people who have been excluded by career incumbents. If people call for more representation by women and minorities, then they should be strong supporters of term-limits. In 1992, 22 of the 24 new women elected to the U.S. House of Representatives were elected in open seats, but only 2 of the 42 women candidates who challenged an incumbent were successful. 
While I agree with many who call for campaign finance reform, only term-limits will truly change the incentives for seeking office. They are a positive tool to break the cycle of excluding those citizens who want to run for election to Federal office but cannot overcome the largest obstacle of all--incumbency and name identification--regardless of the campaign laws and the amount spent on a campaign. 
I have also heard that if the Framers believed term-limits were so important, they would have placed them in the Constitution from the outset. This is the same argument I hear concerning the Balanced Budget amendment. My belief is that the Framers never thought persistent deficits or spending one's career in political office would be a problem. They believed that serving would always be a brief period in one's life and would never be seen as a career. However, it is now clear that only a Constitutional amendment getting term-limits will ensure that the citizen legislator is reestablished as envisioned by the Framers of the Constitution. 
I am pleased to carry on the tradition and hard work of my predecessor Senator Hank Brown. Senator Brown was a leader in this body for term-limits and I am proud to serve in a like manner and continue to fight for term-limits and the will of the people of Colorado. 
Mr. President, early in this session, we will have an opportunity to make good on our campaign promises on term-limits. We must bring business-as-usual to an end and return the power back to the people. I urge all my colleagues to join this fight and begin to make true changes in the way this Congress operates. It is time to bring back the citizen legislator and reconnect our elected officials to the people whom they serve.

Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, last week I talked about the balanced budget movement from a historical perspective. I discussed the fact that when our country started out as a new nation, policymakers felt a moral and ethical obligation to balance the budget year after year after year, and they did that. However, as time evolved, a process was developed under which programs were funded based on demand. This process produced what are called entitlement programs. It created a blank check. As a result of these entitlements and the corresponding lack of accountability, there is no longer the same concern to balance the budget that existed during the time of the Founders. 
I wanted to talk a little bit this afternoon from the perspective of a family man who has grown up in America, from the perspective of a small businessman who has had to start his business from scratch. Those obligations that I faced as a family man and those obligations that I faced as a businessman are pretty much the same obligations that we are facing as a Congress, as the leaders of this country, this great country called America. 
Thus far, we have had two amendments presented before this body which, in effect, provide for exceptions to a balanced budget amendment. One is the Durbin amendment, and the most recent one is the welfare amendment. These amendments are unnecessary. We already have a provision to meet emergencies in the balanced budget amendment proposal that is before us. Madam President, 60 percent of the vote in the House and 60 percent of the vote in the Senate, or 261 votes in the House and 60 votes in the Senate, and we will be able to waive the provisions of this amendment to meet those national emergencies. 
Madam President, I understand I will have an opportunity later on to continue with some of my remarks and that there is an order on the floor for another amendment. 
I will continue my remarks at another time. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Senator for yielding. I would now like to finish my comments that I began a few minutes ago. 
The Wellstone amendment would provide funding for education, nutrition, and health programs for poor children. So, again, as I was speaking about earlier, I want to talk about this from the perspective of a family man and also a small businessman. Joan, my wife, and I started like most American families. After we got our education, we got jobs. We earned a salary and worked hard to save money so that we could incur our first major debt as a family. For most families in this country, their first major debt is when they purchase a home. They are able to incur that commitment only after they have enough income saved up to go ahead and qualify to buy that first house. 
Most families in America work hard to pay down that debt because they understand that if they pay down that debt, then, in effect, they are beginning to free up their resources so that at some later date they can meet the educational needs of their children, the nutritional needs of their children, and they can meet the health care needs of their children. They also, hopefully will be able to save enough of their resources to get their children started out in life. In addition, by paying off that debt, they begin to build up a reserve in their home that they will be able to use in case of emergency. 
That is not unlike the situation that we have here in America. That is why it is important that we get deficit spending under control and that we have a balanced budget amendment that will say to the Congress that it can't spend more money than it brings in. 
Our debt today is greater than $5 trillion. Every year, for the last 28 years, we have continually added to that debt. We have been going in a different direction than the average American family. If we really want a better future for our children and grandchildren, we do not need to establish more Government programs that will cause the deficit to rise instead of fall. Instead, eliminating the deficit is the most unselfish thing that we can do for our children and grandchildren. 
Now, as a small businessman, a veterinarian, when I started out, I had to go to the local banker to take out a loan. The largest portion of that debt went to purchase a building so that I could take care of my clients and their animals' needs. As time moved along, I worked hard to pay down that debt that I had incurred. I knew that the sooner I paid down that debt, the better I would be able to serve my clients because a smaller debt load would begin to free up my resources for other uses. Instead of paying out money on interest, I was able to buy new equipment and bring in more help so that I could take better care of my clients. 
I think that these two situations, as a family man and as a businessman, are not unlike what we face as a country. If we, as Members of Congress, face our responsibility as custodians of this country's future, we simply have to eliminate deficit spending. Despite everybody's good intentions, the trend has been in the opposite direction--our national debt has grown larger every year. I think that the most unselfish thing we can do for our children and grandchildren is to eliminate deficit spending and assure them a prosperous future. That is why I am supporting a 
balanced budget amendment. The only way that we will gather the courage and discipline to address our budgetary problems is if we have a constitutional requirement to balance the Federal budget. 
Now, many will argue here on the floor that we need to protect particular programs. And lots of times they will couch their arguments in terms of certain benefits for our children. But what they really want is to save their own jobs and programs. Because additional waivers or exceptions to the balanced budget requirement will preserve the deficit spending status quo, their primary concern cannot really be our children's future. The balanced budget amendment and eliminating deficit spending is the approach that concentrates on providing for our children's future. It is unselfishly saying that we want a better life for our children and grandchildren. That is why I am such a strong supporter of a balanced budget amendment. 
I wanted to share with Members of this body my experience as a family man and a small businessman. I don't think that the Federal budget is unlike what the average American family or small businessman faces on a daily basis. They understand the need to eliminate deficit spending, to pay down their debt. I just hope that this body has the same foresight that many American families and small business people in this country have. 
I yield back the remainder of my time to the Senator from Utah. Thank you.

Mr. ALLARD. Thank you, Mr. President. 
First of all, Mr. President, I would like to recognize the leadership of my colleague, the Senator from Utah, on the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. 
One of my primary campaign promises when I was running for election to the U.S. Senate was to push for a balanced budget, and I believe that the best way to force us to finally take the courageous steps necessary to balance the budget is to establish a constitutional balanced budget requirement. Statutory balanced budget requirements have proven to be insufficient as Congress has proven its willingness to amend any such requirements. 
I must emphasize that the modern congressional movement to establish balanced budget requirements is not a partisan issue. In 1935, the first bill to establish a statutory balanced budget requirement was introduced by Senator Millard Tydings, a Democrat from Maryland. In the following year, Congressman Harold Knutson, a Republican from Minnesota, introduced the first proposal to place a balanced budget requirement in the United States Constitution. In light of the bipartisan history of the balanced budget movement, I urge all of my colleagues to join together in making the balanced budget amendment the first and most important accomplishment of this 105th Congress. 
During the 104th Congress, the Federal Government surpassed a milestone that our forefathers would have never thought possible--the debt incurred by the Federal Government surpassed $5 trillion dollars. This is an astronomical sum of money, and it is something of which we, as policymakers, should be ashamed. We owe it to our children and grandchildren to do better. We owe it to them to pass a constitutional requirement to mandate that the Federal Government balance its budget by 2002. 
Most people believe that the issue of balanced budget constitutional amendment is a relatively recent issue. But this issue actually surfaced before the Constitution was ratified by the States. 
New York and Rhode Island both included requests that the Federal government be restricted in its ability to borrow money. 
Gilbert Livingston of New York proposed `that no money be borrowed on the credit of the United States without the assent of two thirds of the senators and representatives present in each house.' Admittedly, Mr. Livingston was an anti-Federalist who did not believe in the Union. But he and other anti-Federalists realized that forcing the Federal Government to live within its means would provide an important check on its power. Requiring the Government to go to the people for all of the revenues necessary to run its programs would force it to be accountable to the people. 
Indeed, in 1779 when the United States was still governed by the Articles of Confederation, Benjamin Franklin angrily complained of the extravagances of the Federal Government that were afforded by its ability to print money to pay its bills. While the Government was having difficulties raising the funding to carry out the Revolutionary War, it still managed to spend large sums of money to pay for tea and other wasteful items. 
The dire financial straits of the Federal Government in the aftermath of the Revolutionary War seem to have minimized the concern that the founders had to constrain the ability of the Federal Government to incur debt. In addition, Framers of the Constitution such as Alexander Hamilton believed that the Federal Government would voluntarily restrain itself, and that the public would provide an adequate check if the Government showed a tendency to get out of line. But it was not long before some in the Federalist Party began to voice their support for a constitutional balanced budget requirement. Thomas Jefferson was concerned with what he considered to be the extravagant spending practices of the administration of John Adams and he felt that the best way to correct this problem was to take away the ability of the Federal Government to incur debt. He wrote to John Taylor on November 26, 1798, `I wish it were possible to obtain a single amendment to our Constitution. I would be willing to depend on that alone for the reduction of the administration of our government to the genuine principles of its Constitution; I mean an additional article, taking from the Federal Government the power of borrowing.' Thus, Jefferson saw a balanced budget requirement as the proper tool to constrain the Federal Government within its proper boundaries and to cure the Government of any wasteful tendencies. 
In spite of the concerns of those like Jefferson who felt that the Federal Government needed to be constrained by a constitutional balanced budget requirement, the Federal Government seemed to be able to balance its budget except in times of war and economic downturns until the 1930's. Budget deficits were considered to be abnormalities and Federal officials felt that they had a moral responsibility to their children and grandchildren to balance the budget and even pay down the Federal debt. In his first inaugural address, Andrew Jackson stated, `Some of the Topics which shall engage my earliest attention as intimately connected with the prosperity of our beloved country, are, the liquidation of the national debt, 
and the introduction and observance of the strictest economy in the disbursements of the government.' 
Jackson detested debt because of an experience that he had had as a young man in which he was nearly ruined financially as a result of a debt on a parcel of land that he had acquired as a young man. Jackson considered it to be a matter of public honor and morality to retire the national debt. In a speech in 1831, he commented that when the debt was retired, `we shall then exhibit the rare example of a great nation, abounding in all the means of happiness and security, altogether free from debt.' Although the debt had been paid down on a nearly continuous basis after the United States was brought under the Constitution in 1789, Jackson finished paying off the debts incurred by the Nation in the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812 in 1834--and became the first and only administration to ever retire the debt of the Federal Government of the United States. 
In 1837, the worst economic downturn in the history of the United States aside from the Great Depression caused the Government to resume running occasional deficits. But Jackson's successors shared his belief in a balanced budget and ran balanced or surplus budgets except in times of war or economic downturn. In 1842, President John Tyler wrote that Americans were a `people rendered illustrious among nations by having paid off its whole debt.' 
The Republican Party held the White House almost continuously from the outbreak of the Civil War until the beginning of the Great Depression. And although these Presidents managed to continue the trend of balancing the budget or running surpluses except in times of war or economic downturn, these Presidents were not the model of efficient government that we should aim to follow. Prior to the Civil War, the Federal Government spent a record $74 million. After the Civil War, Federal Government expenditures never dipped below $244 million and often times was in excess of $300 million, an increase of more than 400 percent. As the Federal Government increased its spending, it expanded into new areas of influence. Prior to the Civil War, the Federal Government had mainly confined itself to matters relating to the national defense. After the war, however, the Federal Government increasingly took over waterway and transportation improvement projects from the State and local governments. Although the Federal Government only spent a total of $3.7 million on river improvement and harbor construction between 1850 and 1860, it spent $53.8 million from 1869 to 1879--an increase of over 1,300 percent. 
Not only did the nature of Federal Government expenditures change, the attitude about fiscal responsibility had changed as well. As a favor to their business constituencies, the Republicans were intent upon maintaining exorbitantly high tariffs ranging from the 20 percent Morrill tariff which was enacted to finance the Civil War in 1861 to the Dingley tariff of 1898 and the Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1930, both of which were in excess of 45 percent. As these tariffs represented an enormous tax upon farmers and other consumers, they were very unpopular. The tariffs generated enormous budget surpluses and, as a result, they were hard to justify to the public. Rather than finding ways of returning the money to the people, Congress and the Republican administrations engaged in unprecedented spending binges on patronage and questionable pork-barrel and logrolling projects to reduce the budgetary surpluses to politically acceptable levels. At the same time, they proclaimed their support for balanced budgets to the public. Thus, President Benjamin Harrison described unnecessary debt as criminal even though spending increased during his term from $299 million in 1889 to $383 million in 1893. 
The rules of the Federal budgetary game changed with the New Deal policies developed by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt in the wake of the Great Depression, the worst economic downturn in the history of our Nation. FDR was a well-intentioned man whose primary goal was to end the suffering that he witnessed with any means at his disposal FDR detested the tendency of economists and others around him to try to think about the long-term implications of his policies, but instead preferred to devise immediate solutions to the problems that the people faced. He established numerous agencies and public works projects to try to pull the Nation out of the depression while continuing to profess a sincere desire to balance the budget. One of FDR's fiscal innovations that has had the most profound impact on our economy was the widespread use of entitlement programs which are defined as programs that make payments to all individuals or companies who are eligible by current law and who apply for the benefits. The most popular entitlement program created during FDR's administration was Social Security. Also created under FDR were the Federal farm assistance programs which I am proud to say we successfully reformed and made more market-oriented during last year's debate on the farm bill. 
Most economists agree that the Great Depression ended only with the outbreak of World War II, but the legacy of the Depression era programs has lived on. Several new entitlement 
programs have since been established, most notably the Medicare and Medicaid health programs which were started as a part of LBJ's Great Society fiscal agenda. Although FDR was not completely convinced by Keynesian economic theories, in the aftermath of FDR's administration, Keynesian economics became an accepted theory in determining fiscal policy. This theory, best expressed by the Employment Act of 1946, stated that the Government would run balanced or surplus budgets in times of economic prosperity, but it would seek to run deficits and stimulate the economy during recessions through increases in discretionary spending projects. This theory encouraged a reluctant President Eisenhower to run a deficit throughout much of his administration stating:  
Balancing the budget will always remain a goal of any administration . . . That does not mean to say that you can pick any specific date and say, `Here, all things must give way before a balanced budget.' It is a question of where the importance of a balanced budget comes in; but it must be the aim of any sound money program . . . When it becomes clear that the Government has to step in, as far as I am concerned, the full power of Government, of Government credit, and of everything the Government has will move in to see that there is no widespread unemployment and we never again have a repetition of conditions that so many of you here remember when we had unemployment. 
Based on Keynesian economic theories, Eisenhower approved discretionary spending increases in fiscal year 1958 and fiscal year 1959 which resulted in deficits of $3 and $13 billion respectively. 
This regard for Keynesian economic theories caused administrations to change their views of deficit spending and encouraged the Federal Government to try to micromanage the economy and incur massive deficits in the process. No longer did policymakers consider it such a moral obligation to balance the Federal budget. In the entire postwar period, we have run budgetary surpluses only eight times. It is curious to note that the surpluses in times of economic prosperity in the Keynesian economic theories have almost entirely failed to materialize. The last budgetary surplus occurred in 1969 and the deficits run by the Federal Government have grown increasingly larger reaching a high of nearly $330 million in fiscal year 1992. Luckily, Keynesian economics has increasingly been ignored in recent years as a usable guide for fiscal policy. It has been realized that the Federal Government does not have enough information at its disposal to accurately predict the onset of a recession. In addition, by the time a stimulus package can get through Congress, economic recovery is often already underway. In cases such as these, precious taxpayer dollars are wasted while the economy may be overstimulated resulting in inflation. 
In spite of the recent turn away from Keynesian economic theories, in general the Federal Government's deficits have been growing larger over time, and this trend is only expected to continue. This is due to the rapid growth of entitlement and other mandatory spending. About 55 percent of our spending went to entitlements in fiscal year 1996, and, as projected by the CBO in its January 1997 report on the Economic and Budget Outlook for fiscal years 1998 to 2007, entitlement spending is expected to top $1 trillion in fiscal year 1999. This increased entitlement spending is expected to be accompanied by enormous deficits. In its January 1997 report, the CBO forecasts the deficit to reach roughly $280 billion in fiscal year 2007 if discretionary spending is allowed to increase with inflation. This increase in entitlement spending also corresponds to a continued large role for the Federal Government in the economy, equal to 21 percent of GDP during the next decade, of which 14 percent of GDP would be represented by spending on entitlements by 2002. We simply cannot allow this to happen. 
We must establish efficiency and accountability in the Federal Government. Entitlements, which automatically grow without any action on the part of Congress, are causing these tremendous deficits. Although we can reduce the deficit by freezing discretionary spending, entitlement reform that puts these programs on sound economic footing is absolutely necessary in order for us to balance the budget. As the 105th Congress begins, one of the first things that we need to do is to get our fiscal house in order and send to the States a balanced budget requirement. It is a disgrace that in fiscal year 1996, we burdened the hard-working taxpayer with $241 billion in net interest charges on the national debt. It is even more disgraceful that if we fail to balance the budget, the resulting higher interest rates and lower foreign exchange rate will doom our children to a lower standard of living than they otherwise would have. For our children and our grandchildren, we, the Members of the 105th Congress must be courageous and pass a balanced budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

 Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I am proud to be an original sponsor of the citizen Congress Act with my distinguished colleague from Tennessee, Senator Bill Frist. As a Member of the other body, I was an original sponsor of this bill with Representative Mark Sanford, who reintroduced the CCA earlier this month. 
This legislation is an important element of true political reform. A first step was the passage of the Congressional Accountability Act which applied labor laws to Congress. The next important step is the Citizen Congress Act. This act is to be a reminder to members of both legislative bodies that we are citizen legislators in the true sense of service as envisioned by our Founding Fathers. 
The CCA is a comprehensive bill which eliminates many of the perks and privileges which Congress are afforded. It uses the congressional pension system to encourage limited service and calls for full disclosure of estimates of our retirement benefits. It also eliminates the automatic COLA for Member's salaries. If we want a salary increase, we will have to vote for an increase. The CCA disallows any personal use of frequent flier mileage accrued on official business. This bill would limit the use of frequent flier miles for only trips to and from the Senator's State. The CCA also bans all postal patron franked mailings. This means no more unsolicited mailings to constituents. 
Also, Senators will no longer be able to travel on military aircraft, except where there is space available on already scheduled military flights or where there are no commercial flights to a specific destination. Members will no longer receive free medical attention at military hospitals unless they are veterans and can receive this medical benefit like any other veteran. Finally, the CAA eliminates special parking privileges for Members of Congress, Supreme Court Justices, and foreign diplomats at Washington National and Dulles airports. 
I believe this will make us more responsive to our constituents because no longer will we have the special privileges which citizens are not given. Legislators should have to walk in the same shoes as everyone else, thus making them more sensitive to the concerns and trials of the constituents which we are serving. 
Again, I thank Senator Frist for all his hard work and effort in this endeavor.
