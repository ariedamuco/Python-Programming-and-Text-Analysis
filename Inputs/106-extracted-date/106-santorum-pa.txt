    Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I stand here today to recognize an institution that has remained a staple in Carmichaels and the Southwestern Corner of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for the past one hundred years. Community Bank, N.A. has persevered through recessions, depressions, World Wars, other failed financial institutions, bank foreclosures, market chaos, and mergers and acquisitions without ever having to close its doors. Community Bank, N.A. remains a consistent financial force to its community by providing sound, uninterrupted service to its customers for one hundred years. I would like to warmly congratulate this financial institution for its solid judgement and thoughtful service to the people of Southwestern Pennsylvania. Community Bank is not only a reliable bank, but is a friendly neighbor and has truly contributed to the history and hometown atmosphere of Carmichaels and other communities in which the bank serves. 
   When The First National Bank of Carmichaels opened its doors for business on July 1, 1901, Frank Mitchener was elected president of the Board of Directors, and J. Ewing Baily was its first vice president. Stephen A. Burtner served as treasurer and the remainder of the original board was comprised of Samuel Bunting, Isaac B. Patterson, George W. Strawn, N.H. Biddle and Oscar Hartley. Mr. Dowlin drove a buckboard to the Farmer's and Drovers Bank in Waynesburg to get the cash for opening day. Forty-one original stockholders combined to give the bank a capital stock of $25,000. 
   Richard L. Baily, kin of one of the original founders, and former bank president and Chairman of the Board for over 70 years, is known in Southwestern Pennsylvania for his selfless service to the communities in which the bank serves. Baily tells the story of a lady who once came to the bank to borrow money to buy shoes so her children could go to school. Her husband was unemployed and they lived in a rented house, but she had heard the bank loaned money for worthwhile causes. ``I didn't think I needed to review her assets, and I'm sure she would not [have understood] the term, collateral,'' Baily said. He loaned her the money, and the woman, like most other townsfolk, has remained loyal to the hometown bank that has been loyal to them, in good economic times and bad. The tradition of local loyalty and service continued through Charles R. Baily (son of Richard) whom also formerly served as a director and chairman of the bank's board. ``Community bank is a local landmark that provides financial direction and services to our community friends and neighbors. Hometown commitment has been our bank's pledge for the past 100 years, and that's what it will continue to be,'' says Community Bank Chairman/CEO Ralph J. Sommers, Jr. 
   Known as Community Bank, N.A. since September 1987 (a change in name only to better reflect its larger community growth), the locally-owned and operated financial institution has had a consistent growth in assets, staff, geographic market area, and the numbers of civic and community organizations to which it has contributed. 
   Today, Community Bank, N.A. has some $220 million in assets, is publicly traded as CMYC, boasts 10 branches in Greene and Washington Counties, employs about 100 people in satisfying jobs, and contributes thousands of dollars and many people-hours to scores of local civic, charitable, and philanthropic organizations. 
   The bank's growth is largely attributed to sound management practices, investments in technology, and community commitment at every level. Local deposits remain in the communities the bank serves in an effort to better improve the economic vibrancy of local businesses and the quality of life of residents. Unquestionably, the bank's most valuable assets--its customers, employees, and shareholders--collectively play an integral role in the prosperity of the bank and the communities it serves. The pioneering spirit of that first group of founders in Carmichaels continues in those who have followed, with unparalleled customer service and a community commitment of an incalculable life expectancy. 
   From this amount of information, you can see what a huge role that Community Bank has played in the establishment of the economy and history in Greene and Washington Counties. They are not just a financial institution, but a reliable and friendly staple to the people of the area. I enthusiastically ask my colleagues to join me in commending Community Bank as they celebrate their Centennial.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Affordable Drinking Water Act of 2000.'' This bill sets out an innovative approach to meet the safe drinking water needs of rural Americans nationwide. 
   The Affordable Drinking Water Act of 2000 provides a targeted alternative to water delivery in rural areas. Through a partnership established between the federal government and non-profit entities, low to moderate income households who would prefer to have their own well or are experiencing drinking water problems could secure financing to install or refurbish an individually owned household well. In my home state of Pennsylvania, 2.5 million citizens currently choose to have their drinking water supplied by privately-owned individual water wells. 
   The government assistance envisioned under this bill would also allow homeowners of modest means in Pennsylvania, and the rest of the country, to bring old household water wells up to current standards; replace systems that have met their expected life; or provide homeowners without a drinking water source with a new individual household water well system. 
   Another important component of this legislation will afford rural consumers with individually owned water wells the same payment flexibility as other utility customers. Centralized water systems currently are eligible to receive federal grants and loans with repayment spread out over 40 years. The Affordable Drinking Water Act of 2000 would provide loans to low to moderate income homeowners to upgrade or install a household drinking water well now, and then repay the cost through convenient monthly charges. This ability to stretch out payments over the life of the loan gives rural well owners an affordable option that they otherwise do not have. 
   Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce this legislation today, and believe that it is appropriately balanced to meet the safe-drinking water needs of rural households.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I wish to enter into a colloquy with Senator OLYMPIA SNOWE of Maine and Senator JOHN WARNER of Virginia, two of my colleagues on the Senate Committee on Armed Services, to clarify a provision concerning a U.S. Navy Benefits Center as referenced in Senate Report 106-292 which accompanies S. 2549. 
   As my colleagues are aware, the Department of the Navy's Human Resources Service Centers, HRSCs, located in eight geographical locations worldwide, serve as the regional Human Resources Management, HRM, processing centers for activities and Human Resources Offices in its service area. The HRSCs also provide various centralized HRM programs and services.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I rise in strong support of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act conference report, H.R. 3244, which in addition to seeking to end the trafficking of women and children into the international sex trade, slavery and force labor also includes major provisions reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act, providing justice for victims of terrorism, and Aimee's law. 
   One of the most disturbing human rights violations of our time is trafficking of human beings, particularly that of women and children, for purposes of sexual exploitation and forced labor. Every year, the trafficking of human beings for the sex trade affects hundreds of thousands of women throughout the world. Women and children whose lives have been disrupted by economic collapse, civil wars, or fundamental changes in political geography have fallen prey to traffickers. According to the Department of State, approximately 1-2 million women and girls are trafficked annually around the world. 
   I commend Senator SAM BROWNBACK and Senator PAUL WELLSTONE for their bipartisan leadership on the International Trafficking of Women and Children Victim Protection Act. The bill specifically defines ``trafficking'' as the use of deception, coercion, debt bondage, the threat of force, or the abuse of authority to recruit, transport, purchase, sell, or harbor a person for the purpose of placing or holding such person, whether for pay or not, in involuntary servitude or slavery-like conditions. Using this definition, the legislation establishes within the Department of State an Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking. The Task Force would assist the Secretary of State in reporting to Congress the efforts of the United States government to fight trafficking and assist victims of this human rights abuse. In addition, the bill would amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to provide for a non-immigrant classification for trafficking victims in order to better assist the victims of this crime. 
   Senator ORRIN HATCH and Senator JOE BIDEN introduced S. 2787, the Violence Against Women Act. This bipartisan bill would reauthorize federal programs which have recently expired for another five years to prevent violence against women. It seeks to strengthen law enforcement to reduce these acts of violence, provide services to victims, strengthen education and training to combat violence against women and limit the effects of violence on children. I am an original cosponsor of this important legislation which has been endorsed by the National Association of Attorneys General, the National Governor's Association, and the American Medical Society. On September 26, the House of Representatives passed its version of the Violence Against Women Act, H.R. 1248, by a vote of 415 to 3. I am pleased that this important legislation is included in the Sex Trafficking conference report which passed the House of Representatives on October 6 by a 371-1 vote margin. 
   The reauthorization legislation also creates new initiatives including transitional housing for victims of violence, a pilot program aimed at protecting children during visits with parents 
   accused of domestic violence, and protections for elderly, disabled, and immigrant women. The bill also would provide grants to reduce violent crimes against women on campus and extend the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund. It authorizes over $3 billion over five years for the grant programs. As a Member of the House of Representatives in the 103rd Congress, I supported H.R. 1133, the original Violence Against Women Act, offered by Representative Pat Schroeder of Colorado. Since FY1995, VAWA has been a major source of funding for programs to reduce rape, stalking, and domestic violence. I am also very pleased that my own legislation to strengthen incentives for violent criminals, including rapists and child molesters, to remain in prison and hold states accountable is included in the conference report. 
   Aimee's law was prompted by the tragic death of a college senior Aimee Willard who was from Brookhaven, Pennsylvania near Philadelphia. Arthur Bomar, a convicted murderer was early paroled from a Nevada prison. Even after he had assaulted a woman in prison, Nevada released him early. Bomar traveled to Pennsylvania where he found Aimee. He kidnapped, brutally raped, and murdered Aimee. He was prosecuted a second time for murder for this heinous crime in Delaware County, PA. Aimee's mother, Gail Willard, has become a tireless advocate for victims' rights and serves as an inspiration to me and countless others. 
   This important legislation would use federal crime fighting funds to create an incentive for states to adopt stricter sentencing and truth-in-sentencing laws by holding states financially accountable for the tragic consequences of an early release which results in a violent crime being perpetrated on the citizens of another state. Specifically, Aimee's law will redirect enough federal crime fighting dollars from a state that has released early a murderer, rapist, or child molester to pay the prosecutorial and incarceration costs incurred by a state which has had to reconvict this released felon for a similar heinous crime. More than 14,000 murders, rapes, and sexual assaults on children are committed each year by felons who have been released after serving a sentence for one of those very same crimes. Convicted murderers, rapists, and child molesters who are released from prisons and cross state lines are responsible for sexual assaults on more than 1,200 people annually, including 935 children.  
   Recidivism rates for sexual predators are the highest of any category of violent crime. Despite this, the average time served for rape is only five and one half years, and the average time served for sexual assault is under four years. Also troubling is the fact that thirteen percent of convicted rapists receive no jail time at all. We have more than 130,000 convicted sex offenders right now living in our communities because of the leniency of these systems. The average time served for homicide is just eight years. Under Aimee's law, federal crime fighting funds are used to create an incentive for states to adopt stricter sentencing and truth-in-sentencing laws. 
   This legislation is endorsed by Gail Willard, Aimee's mother, Marc Klass, Fred Goldman, and numerous organizations such the National Fraternal Order of Police, the National Rifle Association, and the Law Enforcement Alliance of America. 39 victims' rights organizations also support Aimee's law including Justice For All, the National Association of Crime Victims' Rights, the Women's Coalition, and Kids Safe. These groups consider Aimee's law one of their highest priority bills. It sends a message that if a state has very lenient 
   sentencing it impacts other states and crime victims in those states as well. 
   I first offered Aimee's law as an amendment to the juvenile justice bill on May 19, 1999, which passed the Senate by a 81-17 vote margin. Congressman MATT SALMON also offered the legislation as an amendment in the House of Representatives on June 16, 1999, which passed by a 412-15 vote. Due to a lack of progress on the conference report it became necessary to move the legislation separately. On May 11, I joined Aimee's mother Gail at a hearing of the U.S. House Subcommittee on Crime, to urge the House to approve legislation separately to keep sexual predators behind bars. The House of Representatives subsequently passed the legislation again by a unanimous voice vote. 
   Aimee's law is an appropriate way to protect the citizens of one state from inappropriate early releases of another state. One of the forty plus national organizations supporting Aimee's law, the National Fraternal Order of Police, said the following.  
   One of the most frustrating aspects of law enforcement is seeing the guilty go free and, once free, commit another heinous crime. Lives can be saved and tragedies averted if we have the will to keep these predators locked up. Aimee's Law addresses this issue smartly, with Federalizing crimes and without infringing on the State and local responsibilities of local law enforcement by providing accountability and responsibility to States who release their murders, rapists, and child molesters to prey again on the innocent.  
   We have made several modest changes to address implementation concerns by the states in the effort to achieve the best protection possible for our citizens. These include (1) Definitions: utilizing the definitions for murder and rape of part I of the Uniform Crime Reports of the FBI and for dangerous sexual offenses utilizing the definitions of chapter 109A of title 18- to provide for uniform comparisons across the states; (2) Sentencing Comparisons: Eliminating the additional 10 percent requirement and utilizing a national average for sentencing only as a benchmark; (3) Study: Also building into the process a study evaluating the implementation and effect of Aimee's Law in 2006; (4) Source of Funds: Provides states the flexibility to choose the source of federal law enforcement assistance funds (except for crime victim assistance funds); (5) Implementation: Delays the implementation of Aimee's Law to January 1, 2002 to allow states the opportunity to make any modifications that they would choose to do; and (6) Indeterminate Sentencing States: Safe harbor for states with sentencing ranges allows for the use of the lower number in the calculation (e.g. if sentencing guideline is 10-15 years, 10 years will be utilized.) 
   We are sending a clear message with Aimee's law. We want tougher sentences and we want truth in sentencing. A child molester who receives four years in prison, when you consider the recidivism rate, is an abomination. Murders, rapists, and child molesters do not deserve early release; our citizens deserve to be protected. In this legislation we are protecting one state's citizens from the complacency of another state, and appropriate role for the federal government. I want to thank my colleagues for their support and urge the passage of this legislation.

   Mr. SANTORUM. In conclusion, Madam President, I thank Senator BROWNBACK for his great work and perseverance in bringing this crime-fighting package to the Senate to pass it and turn it into law quickly. Aimee's law was debated and considered here in the Senate during this session of Congress. It passed 81-17. It has passed the House with over 400 votes. It is a provision that has very broad support. It is one of the No. 1 legislative provisions that the victims rights organizations in America would like to see done. 
   This is a piece of legislation that targets three types of offenders--murderers, rapists, and sex offenders, child molesters in particular. What this does is focus on those three because, obviously, they are three of the most heinous crimes on the books, but they are also crimes that have the highest incidence of repeat offenders, particularly the sexual crimes. 
   Aimee's law is given that name for Aimee Willard. She was a college student outside of Philadelphia who was  raped and murdered by Arthur Bomar. Arthur Bomar was released from a Nevada prison after serving only a small fraction of his sentence for a similar crime. He was released, and within a few months he found his way to Philadelphia, where Aimee was out one evening. She was attacked, raped, and murdered. It was a case that sent shockwaves through southeastern Pennsylvania and the whole Delaware Valley. Aimee's mother, Gail, has been on a crusade since then to do something to make sure convicted rapists and murderers and other sex offenders serve their full sentences. 
   If you look at the sentences that are meted out for these crimes, it is somewhat chilling to realize that if you look at the sentences that are served for murder, for example, the average sentence for murder is 8 years. The average sentence for rape is 5 1/2 years. This is the actual time they serve, and the actual time served for a sex or child molestation offense is 4 years. 
   We believe that you have a high incidence of recidivism in these crimes, and people need to serve longer sentences so they are not a threat to our communities. In fact, more than 14,000 murders, rapes, and sexual assaults on children are committed each year by felons who had been released after serving a sentence on one of those very same crimes. So 14,000 of these crimes are committed by people who have committed these crimes in the past, who were let go to commit a crime again. 
   What we believe and what we have suggested is, frankly, very modest. It is modest in the sense that it is, I argue, even for those 81 Senators who voted for this legislation the last time around--and some expressed concern that this was going to be too tough on the States--not as tough as it was before. We have changed it in ways that have made it a little less onerous on States to have to keep up with these provisions. We tightened the definitions more. We created flexibility for the States for them to choose which funds they would use. 
   This is basically what this proposal does. It says if you release someone from prison who has not served 85 percent of their sentence, or has served a sentence below the national 
   average for the crimes that we enumerate, and that person goes out and commits a crime in another State, then the State in which the person has committed the second crime--the released felon commits a second crime--then it has a right to go to the original State who let this person out early and seek compensation for all the costs associated with the prosecution, conviction, and incarceration of that criminal. 
   That hardly seems like the overbearing Federal Government dictating to States how to run their criminal justice system. These are Federal funds. States can choose which Federal funds they can allocate for this purpose. But what it says is we need to get tougher in having tougher sentences and making sure that those sentences, when given, are served. 
   I don't believe that is too much to ask for this Congress, and I very strongly urge my colleagues to support this measure, and recognize that if this measure is not supported this bill will be dead and will have to start over again in the House of Representatives.

    Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 85th anniversary of Harcum College. The Harcum Post Graduate School was opened by Edith Hatcher, a talented concert pianist, and her husband Octavius Marvin Harcum. Together they chose a venture that would combine her ``talents as an educator and artist and his business vision and ability.'' Harcum College opened its doors on October 1, 1915 in Melville Hall, with three students and five pianos. 
   In its early years, Harcum was a preparatory school, giving students the skills needed to attend college. Mr. Harcum was the first President, but when he died tragically in a car accident in 1920, Edith assumed the Presidency. She remained in that position for more than 30 years. The college continued to grow, yet it was a proprietary institution and faced financial difficulties. In 1952 it could no longer be run as a profitable enterprise; Edith declared bankruptcy. 
   The Junto Adult School was a non-profit educational corporation founded by Benjamin Franklin. It purchased the assets of Harcum and decided to use it as a two-year college for women. Philip Klein assumed leadership, and in 1955, Pennsylvania granted Harcum permission to be the first junior college in the Commonwealth's history to confer the Associate of Arts and Science degrees. 
   Throughout the years, tremendous expansion of facilities has occurred yet Harcum remains committed to its original philosophies. Harcum College embraces a value system based on four principles: a respect for and appreciation of diversity; the ability to make sound ethical and moral choices; the need to take responsibility for self and others; and a commitment to lifelong learning. All members of the Harcum community are committed to the success of one another. 
   Harcum College has always placed learning first and is committed to providing individualized educational experiences for a diverse community of learners. Harcum educated students in the arts and occupational skills, and in Mrs. Harcum's words, the college respected each student as an ``individual with personal needs, interests, aptitudes, and aspirations.''  
   I commend Harcum College for its accomplishments and commitment to education. Harcum has faced many challenges over the years, and I congratulate the institution as it remains an outstanding educational facility.

    Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise to day to honor the veterans who will be inducted into the Hall of Valor at Soldiers' & Sailors' Memorial Hall. On October 14, 2000, 15 veterans, all of whom served in World War II, will be inducted in the Hall of Valor. All the  veterans being recognized have received either the Silver Star or the distinguished Flying Cross and are residents of Allegheny County and other areas of Pennsylvania. 
   Each inductee has distinguished himself through gallantry and courage at the risk of his own life, above and beyond the call of duty. This nation values their service and has recognized these acts of heroism and bravery and those of other servicemen and women. Today, I would like to remember and acknowledge the extraordinary valor each inductee displayed in the name of freedom. 
   Induction in the Hall of Valor is one way we can bear witness to and acknowledge the service of each inductee. I wish to extend my sincere gratitude for their sacrifice and dedication in the U.S. Armed Forces. All of the heroes we honor today--both those present and those who have gone before us--deserve the highest esteem and admiration. I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in recognizing a few of our nation's veterans as they are inducted into the Hall of Valor at Soldiers' & Sailors' Memorial Hall in Pittsburgh, PA. 
   In recognition of their actions, Joseph Burdis, Jr., Samuel L. Collier, James J. Fisher, James W. Regan, John A. Somma, William G. Stampahar, Leonard R. Tabish, and Arthur R. Kiefer, Jr. will be inducted in the Hall of Valor. The following veterans will be posthumously inducted: Richard Ascenzi, William John Beynon, Thomas J. Korenich, John Lipovsik, Jr., Joseph Anthony Papst, Michael J. Popko, and Sigmund J. Zelczak.

    Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 300th anniversary of St. David's Church in Berwyn, Pennsylvania and St. Peter's Church in the Great Valley, near Paoli, Pennsylvania. The two parishes were established in 1700 as mission churches of the historic Christ Church, Philadelphia to serve those that settled Chester County. 
   Philadelphia is where so many of our Founders came together to deliberate, sign the Declaration of Independence and fight in battles during the Revolutionary War. Both churches, now nationally registered landmarks, were involved in the war. St. David's parish sent forth General Anthony Wayne to fight with General Washington, and St. Peter's served as a field hospital for soldiers that were wounded. 
   For 300 years--longer than we have been a nation--these two churches have been vital elements of the communities in which they reside and serve. Governor Tom Ridge recently selected St. Peter's Church, a registered historical landmark, as the site for the signing of Pennsylvania's ``Growing Greener'' bill. 
   On October 21, 2000 these two churches will hold a combined anniversary celebration at St. Peter's Church in the Great Valley. The celebration will feature historic symposia, period food and  costume, and the burial of a time capsule. This event will enable people to gain insight into the lives of our historic forebears. I commend area leaders for initiating such a celebration and look forward to the upcoming festivities. 
   I am therefore pleased to celebrate the 300th anniversary of St. David's Church and St. Peter's Church. To honor this event, I put forward the following proclamation:  
   Whereas, 300 years ago, St. David's Church and St. Peter's Church in the Great Valley were founded as missions of the historic Christ Church, Philadelphia; 
   Whereas, the congregations of St. David's Church and St. Peter's Church in the Great Valley played a vital role in the early growth of historic Chester County, Pennsylvania; 
   Whereas, St. David's Church was the home parish and eventual burial site for General Anthony Wayne, a hero of the American Revolution; 
   Whereas, St. David's Church and its graveyard are registered as a National Historic Landmark; 
   Whereas, St. Peter's Church in the Great Valley is a registered National Historic Landmark which served recently as the site selected by the Governor of Pennsylvania for the signing of the ``Growing Greener'' land conservation bill; 
   Whereas, St. David's Church and St. Peter's Church in the Great Valley have sent their parishioners out into the larger community as public servants throughout their history; 
   Whereas, St. David's Church and St. Peter's Church in the Great Valley continue to serve their communities, their State and the Nation as strong civic partners in numerous programs to provide food, shelter, clothing, education, health care, and other forms of nurture to those in need; 
   Now therefore be it resolved by the United States Senate That St. David's Church and St. Peter's Church in the Great Valley be officially recognized and commended on the occasion of their 300th anniversary of worship, September 2, 2000.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, as the last baseball games are about to be played in Pittsburgh's Three Rivers Stadium, a stadium referred to as the ``House that Clemente Build,'' I am reminded of Roberto Clemente, one of the greatest athletes and humanitarians of all time. Every baseball fan can recite Roberto's achievements during his professional career as a Pittsburgh Pirate--from hitting a remarkable .317 over 18 seasons and collecting 3,000 hits, to his 12 Gold Glove awards and 12 National League All Star Game appearances. However, it was his philanthropic gestures which truly represent Roberto Clemente's invaluable legacy. 
   As many people know, Roberto Clemente died tragically on December 31, 1972, after he and four others boarded a small DC-7 to deliver food, clothing and medicine to Nicaragua, to aid victims of a devastating earthquake. The four-engine plane, with a  questionable past and an overload of cargo, crashed into the Atlantic Ocean, killing all aboard. What is not well known is that, upon hearing rumors that Nicaraguan government officials were delaying the delivery of relief supplies, Roberto Clemente left his New Year's celebration with family and friends to travel to Nicaragua in order to personally oversee the delivery of the Puerto Rican relief supplies to the individuals devastated by the Managua earthquake. On that fateful New Year's Eve night in 1972, the world lost not just a great athlete, arguably the greatest in the history of the Pittsburgh Pirates, but a humanitarian, a cultural icon, and a hero. 
   Mr. President, over the years, Roberto Clemente's dedication to his fellow man became legendary. As one of the first Latin America baseball players in the Major Leagues, Roberto Clemente faced language barriers and racial segregation throughout his career. He worked tirelessly to improve professional baseball's understanding of the unique challenges faced by young Latin American ballplayers thrust into a new culture and language as they start their baseball careers. 
   However, his concern for is fellow man did not stop at the foul lines. throughout his career, Roberto Clemente expressed his concern for the troubled lives faced by urban youth both in the United States and Puerto Rico. In a 1966 interview with Myron Cope for ``Sports Illustrated,'' Roberto Clemente discussed his desire to help youth by stoking their interest in sports. Roberto Clemente believed that sports could bring families together in an athletic setting while providing a stage for youngsters to excel. In what would be the final months of his life, Roberto Clemente conducted a series of baseball clinics for Puerto Rican youth in addition to fundraising efforts for a large sports facility dedicated to the youth of the world. 
   Mr. President, Robert Clemente's humanitarian legacy continues to this day with the Roberto Clemente Sports City in Puerto Rico. Established March 18, 1973, when the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico's government granted 304 acres of land for development, the Roberto Clemente Sports City commemorates Roberto Clemente's commitment of a better life for children through sports, education and community service by creating an environment for the development of the human spirit through sports, involving community, education and human rights. This sports facility provides high quality recreational and sports facilities for children, youth and the general public such as: baseball, volleyball, basketball, tennis, swimming, track and field, batting cages, a golf range, tae kwon-do, camping and social and cultural activities. The Roberto Clemente Sports City provides Puerto Rico with learning and training facilities, to include tutoring, mentoring and professional development programs in sports and life. 
   As eloquently stated by Bowie Kuhn in his 1973 eulogy to Clemente, ``he made the world `superstar' seem inadequate. He had about him the touch of royalty.'' With all of this in mind, Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to support the resolution I am offering with Senator SPECTER which urges our fellow Americans to honor Roberto Clemente's legacy every day through humanitarian and philanthropic efforts towards their fellow man.

    Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Born Alive Infants Protection Act. I would like to thank Senator HUTCHINSON and Senator FITZGERALD for joining me as original sponsors. This bill is the Senate companion to H.R. 4292, which the House of Representatives passed by a vote of 380-15. 
   When I came to the Senate six years ago, I never imagined that the bill I am offering today would be necessary. Simply stated, this measure gives legal status to a fully born living infant regardless of the circumstances of his or her birth. I am deeply saddened that we must clarify federal law to specify that a living newborn baby is, in fact, a person. 
   One could ask, ``Why do you need federal legislation to state the obvious? What else could a living baby be, except a person?'' I will begin my explanation with events in 1995, when the Senate began its attempts to outlaw a horrifying, inhumane, and barbaric abortion procedure: partial birth abortion. In this particular abortion method, a living baby is killed when he or she is only inches from being fully born. Twice, the House and Senate have stood united in sending a bill to President Clinton to ban this procedure. Twice, the President has vetoed the bill. And twice, the House courageously voted to override the veto. Although support in the Senate grew each time the ban came to a vote, the Senate fell a few votes shy of overriding the veto. 
   The Supreme Court's ruling in Stenberg v. Carhart, as well as subsequent rulings in lower courts, are disturbing on a number of levels. First, the Supreme Court struck down Nebraska's attempt to ban a grotesque procedure the American Medical Association has called ``bad medicine,'' and thousands of physicians who specialize in high risk pregnancies have called ``never medically necessary.'' Further, the Court said it did not matter that the baby is killed when it is almost totally outside the mother's body in this abortion method. In other known abortion methods, the baby is killed in utero. Finally, the U.S. Supreme Court, and the Third Circuit Court have stated it does not matter when the baby is positioned when it is aborted. This assertion, to me, is the most horrifying of all. 
   In the five years worth of debates on partial birth abortion, I have asked Senators a very simple question: ``If a partial birth abortion was being performed on a baby, and for some reason the head slipped out and the baby was delivered, would the doctor and the mother have the right to kill that baby?'' In five years, not one Senator who defended the procedure has provided a straightforward ``yes'' or ``no'' response. They would not answer my question. So last year, I revised it. In an effort to try to define when a child may be protected by the Constitution, I asked whether it would be alright to kill a baby whose foot is still inside the mother's body, or what if only a toe is inside? Again, I did not receive an answer. 
   Unfortunately, evidence uncovered at a recent hearing before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution suggests my questions were not so hypothetical. In fact, two nurses testified to seeing babies who were born alive as a result of induced labor abortions being left to die in soiled utility rooms. Furthermore, the intellectual framework for legalization of killing unwanted babies is being constructed by a prominent bioethics professor at Princeton University. Professor Peter Singer has advocated allowing parents a 28 waiting period to decide whether  to kill a disabled or unhealthy newborn. In his widely disseminated book, Practical Ethics, he asserts, ``killing a disabled infant is not morally equivalent to killing a person. Very often it is not wrong at all.'' 
   In response to these events, the Born Alive Infants Protection Act grants protection under federal law to newborns that are fully outside of the mother. Specifically, it states that federal laws and regulations referring to a ``person,'' ``human being,'' ``child,'' and ``individual'' include ``every infant member of the species homo sapiens who is born alive at any stage of development.'' ``Born alive'' means ``the complete expulsion or extraction from its mother of that member, at any stage of development, who after such expulsion or extraction breathes or has a beating heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definitive movement of voluntary muscles, regardless of whether the umbilical cord has been cut, and regardless of whether the expulsion or extraction occurs as a result of natural or induced labor, caesarean section, or induced abortion.'' The definition of ``born alive'' is derived from a World Health Organization definition of ``live birth'' that has been enacted in 30 states and the District of Columbia. 
   Again, all this bill says is that a living baby who is completely outside of its mother is a person, a human being, a child, and an individual. Similar legislation passed by the House of Representatives received overwhelming bipartisan support from Members on both sides of the general abortion debate. I am hopeful that the Senate and the President can agree that once a baby is completely outside of its mother, it is a person, deserving protections and dignity afforded to all other Americans.

    Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today in tribute to Jim Kanouse of The Boeing Company, who is retiring after fourteen years of service with the aerospace company and over 30 years of service with the United States Army and the United States Congress. 
   Jim grew up in America's heartland, South Bend, Indiana, and graduated from Indiana University. He also attended the University of Notre Dame, and throughout his career has maintained the highest standards of his alma maters, always leading by example as a proud member of the ``Indiana Hoosiers'' and the ``Fighting Irish.'' 
   Jim continued his career as an officer and Army Aviator with the United States Army including three tours of duty in Vietnam. He was highly decorated for valor and wounds in combat. As a pilot of numerous aircraft, including the very dangerous and very demanding OV-1 ``Mohawk,'' Jim survived many encounters and engagements with enemy forces ranging from an arrow shot at his aircraft in a rice paddy to a .50 caliber round piercing his fuselage and striking his pilot seat. He was highly decorated for valor and wounds in combat, including the Distinguished Flying Cross for rescuing a downed pilot. Like so many of his generation, Jim served proudly, unselfishly and bravely with little fanfare, recognition or appreciation. On behalf of the United States Senate, the United States Congress and the American people, I salute Jim Kanouse and all the veterans of his generation. 
   Jim eventually brought his skills to Washington, D.C. representing U.S. Army Legislative Affairs in the House of Representatives. Escorting members overseas, representing Army programs to members and staff, and responding to constituent inquiries about Army affairs, he again proudly served his nation and service. Members who traveled with Jim respected his knowledge, expertise and easygoing style. Respected by Democrats and Republicans alike, he then left Capitol Hill to pursue a career in legislative affairs with The Boeing Company. 
   For over a decade, Jim Kanouse was one of the primary focal points for Senators and Representatives with the world's largest aerospace company, representing revolutionary aircraft programs ranging from the RAH-66 ``Comanche'' Army scout helicopter to the F-22 ``Raptor'' Air Force jet fighter. 
   I consider Jim Kanouse a friend. We all in Congress wish you well deserved time to enjoy life with your lovely wife, Eileen, and your loving children  and grandchildren. Congratulations on your retirement.

    Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Dr. Ernest Urban as he retires from the largest healthcare system in the world, the Veterans Health Administration/Department of Veterans Affairs. For 26 years, Dr. Urban's compassionate, caring medical service has made an impact on our nation's heroes, our veterans. 
   Dr. Urban has served the Veterans Affairs Pittsburgh Healthcare System comprised of University Drive, Aspinwall and Highland Drive Divisions for 15 years as Chief of Staff. He has also been a professor and Assistant Dean for Veterans Affairs at the University of Pittsburgh's School of Medicine since 1985. Prior to 1985, he served in several other capacities in hospitals and universities all over the country. Dr. Urban has also authored publications dealing with many aspects of medicine that have proven to benefit the quality of care for our veterans. Most importantly, he continues to lecture and teach on a wide range of topics that benefit the VA Health Administration Personnel and provides medical leadership to carry into the 21st century. 
   I have been privileged to personally witness the hard work and dedication of doctors like Dr. Urban within the Veterans Administration Healthcare System. From 1946 until 1985, my mother served as a VA nurse at several hospitals including Aspinwall Veterans Hospital in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Butler Veterans Hospital in Butler, Pennsylvania. As Chief of Nursing for 32 years, my mother can attest to the commitment which is typical of VA doctors and nurses everywhere. During times of low funding and limited staffing, VA doctors and staff worked harder than ever to care for the needs of their patients. While my experience on the Senate Armed Services Committee has served as affirmation of the dedication of Veterans Healthcare Administration, it pales in comparison to the hard work and sacrifice that I personally witnessed as the son of someone who served in the Veterans Healthcare Administration. 
   It is at this time that I would like to recognize Dr. Urban for his tremendous dedication to the medical profession. As he prepares for retirement, we can only celebrate the faithful service he provided to the needs of all veterans.

    Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize Ms. Claire Howard of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania who will serve as President of the USA Council of Serra International next year. This is a most noteworthy accomplishment, as she is the first woman ever to serve in this high capacity. I would like to insert the following article into the RECORD, which was printed in the Allentown Diocese Times on August 3, 2000:  
   Claire Howard of Bethlehem was installed as President-Elect by United States Serra clubs at the annual Serra International Convention in Kansas City. She will serve a one-year term as President-Elect on the USA/Canada Council Board. In 2001, she will become the first woman President of not only the USA Council, but also the first in Serra International's 65-year history. 
   As President-Elect of the USA Council (USAC) of Serra International, a worldwide organization that works to foster and promote Catholic religious vocations, she will work closely with the national staff and local Serra clubs, and assist the president as needed. She also serves as a liaison with the council's 13 standing committees. 
   ``I'm looking forward to making sure we all really commit ourselves to the ministry of building up the body of Christ through our Serran work,'' Howard said. 
   A charter member of the Serra Club of Bethlehem, Howard has served two years as club President. An active member over the years, she has served on almost all the standing committees. 
   Her future seat as president is not Howard's only ``first'' in Serra International; she has trail-blazed the way for women in Serra for years, ascending steadily through the ranks of the organizational structure. In 1993, she was the first woman to serve as District Governor of Serra International and in 1994 became the first regional representative (again the first woman) of Region 3 of the then newly formed USA/Canada Council of Serra International. 
   She has chaired USACC's Meetings and Conventions Committee, which is responsible for coordination of the fall regional conventions in the 13 regions of the United States and Canada. In recent years she has served as USA Council Vice President for the Membership and Programs committees. 
   For the past six years, she has been the Coordinator of the Serra Clubs of the Allentown Diocese's ``Life/Vocation Awareness Weekend,'' working closely with diocesan Director of Vocations the Rev. Francis A. Nave. The weekend offers any adult who would like to explore the possibilities of entering the priesthood or a religious order a time of reflection, prayer and interaction with priests and religious [leaders]. 
   Howard was also appointed by the Most Rev. Edward P. Cullen, D.D., Bishop of Allentown, to be the Serran representative for the Allentown Diocese Vocation Recruitment Committee. 
   An active member of St. Anne Church, Bethlehem, she serves as a Eucharistic minister, lector and coordinator of the adult Bible study group. Howard's community work includes active membership in Morning Star Rotary; sustaining membership in the Junior League of the Lehigh Valley; Bethlehem Palette Club; and Bethlehem Quota Club. 
   She works as a full-time associate real estate broker with RE/MAX 100 Real Estate of the Greater Lehigh Valley. She is married to John J. Howard Jr., and they have three grown children. They divide their spare time between a small home in Orlando, Fla. and a season home in Stone Harbor, N.J. 
   The USA Council was formed officially June 1, 1994, as a national council for all Serra clubs in the United States and originally included clubs in Canada. The USA Council represents Serra International in the United States and is committed to its mission. 
   As Serra International is the lay vocations arm of the church, the council's mission is to foster and affirm vocations to the ministerial priesthood and vowed religious life in America, and through this ministry, further their members' common Catholic faith. 
   The council's primary purpose is to establish communication links between the Catholic Church hierarchy, Serra clubs and local Serrans to effectively distribute information, coordinate vocations programs and activities, and promote membership growth in the two countries. There are 12,585 Serrans in 313 Serra clubs in more than 100 dioceses in the United States. 
   Serra International, founded in 1935 in Seattle, Washington, is a Catholic membership organization of lay men and women who work to promote vocations to the priesthood and religious life while developing their Catholic identity. There are more than 22,000 Serrans organized into 732 clubs in 35 countries throughout the world.

    Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, it is at this time that I would like to recognize Ms. Sue Dillon for her efforts as founder and president of Tail's End Farm Animal Rescue. Ms. Dillon started this organization to save horses from going to slaughter and focused on finding them good homes. 
   In 1993, she realized that there were no organizations or facilities in Pennsylvania to accommodate homeless farm animals needing shelter. Consequently, in order to save the lives of these animals, Ms. Dillon decided that she would take on the challenge of providing a safe haven for these animals. In 1996, she discovered that she needed to turn her facility into a full-scale, no-kill, animal facility. She obtained a non-profit status, the correct licences and opened her doors to cats, dogs, and any other homeless animals. 
   Although Ms. Dillon has volunteers to run the farm, help with adoption, and other facets of the operation, she remains to be a huge part of the Rescue. She continues to be actively involved with the everyday operations of the organization. 
   I would like to take this opportunity to recognize Sue Dillon in taking the lead to provide a safe haven for many of these animals. She is an exemplary citizen, and I applaud her efforts on this issue.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, the Senate is completing a historic vote on the U.S.-China Relations Act of 2000, H.R. 4444, which grants permanent normal trade relations, PNTR, status to the People's Republic of China. Realizing that many Pennsylvanians have expressed very strong feelings on both sides of this issue, I would like to take a moment to discuss my reasons for supporting this measure. 
   First, it is important to understand what normal trade relations, NTR, is. Since 1980, the United States has granted China NTR status every year, subject to an annual review. ``Normal trade relations'', NTR, is the tariff treatment the U.S. grants to its trading partners. All but a select few countries receive this trade status. NTR simply means that products from a foreign country receive the same relatively lower tariff rates as our other trading partners enjoy. The lower tariff rates result from years of negotiations and various trade agreements in which the U.S. reduces its duties on imports, in exchange for reduced rates on its own products. NTR lowers tariff rates, but does not eliminate them altogether. In this way, NTR substantially differs from a free trade agreement. Free trade agreements, such as NAFTA, set dates by which all tariffs among the member countries will be eliminated. I would also note that certain countries receive even lower tariffs than NTR affords through ``preferential'' tariff status.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, on behalf of the majority leader, I have been asked to make a unanimous-consent request. 
   I ask unanimous consent that immediately following the passage of H.R. 4444, the Commerce Committee be discharged from further consideration of S. 2497 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration under the following terms: Two hours on the bill to be equally divided in the usual form; that there be up to one relevant amendment in order for each leader, that they be offered in the first degree, limited to 30 minutes equally divided and not subject to any second-degree amendments; and that no motions to commit or recommit be in order. 
   I further ask unanimous consent that following conclusion or use of debate time in the disposition of the above described amendments, the bill be advanced to third reading and a vote occur on final passage of the bill, as amended, if amended, all without any intervening action or debate. 
   The bill has to do with the entertainment industry and the entertainment industry marketing their videos and CDs to those people--children--who are proscribed, really, from buying them or attending those kinds of movies. These are R-rated movies. Children under 17 are not permitted in these without an adult. Yet we have a report just issued, I think earlier this week, that says the movie industry targets the very people who are not supposed to be viewing these kinds of materials or listening to these kinds of materials. 
   So this is a unanimous-consent request to move this out of the Commerce Committee and to deal with this issue on the floor promptly. This is an important issue that has been a bipartisan issue in the past. I hope my unanimous-consent request will be approved by the Democrats.

   Mr. SANTORUM. The reason we are trying to move expeditiously here is the FTC has come out with a record that shows the egregious nature of the conduct of Hollywood with respect to the marketing to young people of material that is inappropriate for them, that they 
   have said they would not so market. It is very similar to the charges we have heard about tobacco companies, that are not supposed to sell to minors, marketing to minors. Here we have the identical situation. 
   The other side has not been reticent about bringing tobacco legislation to the floor to stop the marketing to minors at the drop of a hat. Yet when it comes to protecting Hollywood, we have a roadblock. We have an opportunity here to reform the system, to do something substantive about an issue that is undercutting the moral fabric of our country, that is poisoning the minds of our children, and we have a roadblock because we have more important issues to discuss. According to the other side, there are other issues more important than these issues. I don't think there are very many issues that are more important than a deliberate attempt to market inappropriate material to young minds. That, to me, is about as high a priority as we can get. 
   There may be some other things the other side believes are more important than that, but bringing this bill to the floor and having this debated is a very important issue. As the Senator from Nevada mentioned, their own Vice Presidential candidate believes this is a very high profile issue. 
   Let's deal with it. Let's not talk about it; let's not politic about it; let's not pander about it; let's do something about it. Here we have, again, an opportunity for us to do something substantive, to create reform, to move the agenda forward, and we have a roadblock; we have an objection: It is just not the right time; it is just not the right way; it is just not the exact thing we would like to do. 
   Let's move forward. Let's start moving on reform. We hear complaints that nothing gets done around here. Every time we start to put something forward to try to move a reform, the answer is no. We are going to continue to try. This is not the last time we are going to try to get unanimous consent on this matter. This is an important matter that we need to bring up and we need to deal with before this session ends. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to address a matter of critical importance to our Nation's 39 million Medicare beneficiaries, 2 million of whom live in Pennsylvania alone. I speak of the current erosion of the Medicare+Choice program, a situation which demands attention by Congress and this administration. 
   Currently, more than 6.2 million Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in the Medicare+Choice program, receiving high quality, affordable health care services through HMOs and other private sector health plans. Beneficiaries are choosing these plans because they typically provide a more comprehensive package of benefits (including coverage of prescription drugs), lower out-of-pocket costs, and a stronger emphasis on preventive health care services than the old Medicare fee-for-service system. 
   As my colleagues well know, for more than ten years Medicare beneficiaries have had access to this array of enhanced health benefits and options through the Medicare's risk contract program, and the success of this program was evidenced by the fact that beneficiaries signed up for Medicare HMO coverage in large numbers. From December 1993 through December 1997, enrollment in Medicare HMOs increased at an average annual rate of 30 percent. In states such as Louisiana, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Texas, enrollment in Medicare HMOs increased even more rapidly. In December 1997, shortly after the enactment of the BBA, Medicare HMO enrollment stood at 5.2 million, accounting for 14 percent of the total Medicare population--up from just 1.3 million enrollees and 3 percent of the Medicare population in December 1990. 
   The success of the Medicare HMO program inspired Congress to establish the Medicare+Choice program in 1997 through the enactment of the Balanced Budget Act (BBA). In establishing the Medicare+Choice program, Congress had three goals in mind: (1) to build on the success of the Medicare HMO program; (2) to give seniors and persons with disabilities the same health care choices available to Americans who obtain their health coverage through the private sector; and (3) to further expand beneficiaries' health care choices by establishing an even wider range of health plan options and by making such options available in areas where Medicare HMOs were not yet available. Three years later, however, the Medicare+Choice program has not fulfilled its promise of expanding health care choices for Medicare beneficiaries. Instead, a large number of beneficiaries have lost their Medicare+Choice plans or experienced an increase in out-of-pocket costs or a reduction in benefits. 
   This disturbing trend is especially harmful to low-income beneficiaries, who are almost twice as likely to enroll in Medicare HMOs as are other Medicare beneficiaries. For many seniors and persons with disabilities who live on fixed incomes, having access to a Medicare HMO means that they can spend their limited resources on groceries and other daily essentials. Beneficiaries also like Medicare HMOs because they provide coordinated care and place a strong emphasis on preventive services that help them to stay healthy and avoid preventable diseases. 
   Mr. President, when Congress enacted BBA in 1997, plans were still joining the Medicare+Choice program and 74 percent of beneficiaries had access to at least one plan. But today, access dropped to 69 percent, with 2 million fewer beneficiaries having access to a plan. Next year, 711,000 Medicare beneficiaries will lose access to health benefits and choices as a result of Congressional underpayment and burdensome HCFA regulations. 
   In addition, many Medicare HMOs have curtailed benefits, increased cost-sharing and 
   raised premiums. Average premiums have increased $11 per month in 2000. 
   Two major problems are responsible for this outcome: (1) the Medicare+Choice program is significantly underfunded; and (2) the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) has imposed excessive regulatory burdens on health plans participating in the program. The funding problem has been caused by the unintended consequences of the Medicare+Choice payment formula that was established by the BBA, as well as the Administration's decision to implement risk adjustment of Medicare+Choice payments on a non-budget neutral basis. Under this formula, the vast majority of health plans have been receiving annual payment updates of only 2 percent in recent years--while the cost of caring for Medicare beneficiaries has been increasing at a much higher rate. 
   When plans withdraw from communities, beneficiaries are forced to switch plans, or in some cases revert back to the traditional Medicare program, which does not cover additional benefits like eye and dental care, or, more importantly, prescription drugs. 
   It is in response to this crisis in the Medicare+Choice program that I am pleased to be introducing The Medicare Beneficiaries' Choice Stabilization Act. This legislation will make numerous changes to the way Medicare+Choice rates are calculated and will seek to sensitize the funding mechanisms in the current Medicare system to the difficulties of health care delivery in all communities, and particularly in rural areas. 
   As the costs of providing care in some areas can be higher than the payments from Medicare, The Medicare Beneficiaries' Choice Stabilization Act will also give plans the opportunity to negotiate for higher payment rates based on local costs.  
   Realizing the importance of assuring that the benefits of programmatic regulations outweigh their costs, my legislation will also provide Medicare+Choice providers regulatory relief from overreaching HCFA dictates. Rather than devoting substantial human and financial resources toward compliance activities, which leaves fewer resources available for paying for health care services provided to beneficiaries, Medicare+Choice plans ought to be left to the fullest extent possible to the business they know best: providing high quality and cost effective health care to our Medicare beneficiaries. 
   Congress must devote more adequate funding to the Medicare+Choice program, and work to ensure that resources are allocated in such a way as to assure that the Medicare+Choice program is viable in areas where beneficiaries have already selected health plan options and that the program can expand in areas where such options are not yet widely available. I am sponsoring Beneficiaries' Choice Stabilization Act with just these goals in mind, and I hope my colleagues will join me in a bipartisan effort to save and strengthen the Medicare+Choice program and the valuable health benefits it provides for our Medicare population which relies on them.

    Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the Duquesne University School of Pharmacy on its 75th anniversary. Since September 21, 1925, the school has made valuable contributions to our nation by training thousands of pharmacists who serve the healthcare needs of our communities. 
   The mission of the School of Pharmacy, Mr. President, is to prepare students for life-long learning and careers in the profession of pharmacy. The school accomplishes this through outcome competency-based programs with an emphasis on appreciation for ethical and spiritual values. Moreover, the school conveys to students a foundation in the pharmaceutical, administrative, social and clinical sciences which are the bases for pharmaceutical care and research. Students, furthermore, acquire the ability to think critically and communicate effectively; and to understand personal, professional and social responsibilities. 
   Mr. President, it is with these ideas in mind that I ask my colleagues to join with me in congratulating the Duquesne University School of Pharmacy for its invaluable service to our nation. The health of our friends, families and neighbors is dependent on the diligent work of schools such as this.

    Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes of Senate business to recognize a man who I hold in the highest regard, Mr. Lanny Frattare. Mr. Frattare has been a tremendous figure and icon to the people of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He has contributed energy and timeless hours to the Pittsburgh community through his involvement with the Pirates, the Parent and Child Guidance Center, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, Goodwill Industries, and Bob Prince Charities. 
   Lanny Frattare is celebrating his twenty-fifth year as ``The Voice of the Pirates,'' announcing more than 3,500 games. Only Bob Prince has described the action of Pirate baseball longer, 28 years. Mr. Frattare was even gracious enough to let me join him in the announcer's box for several games over the years, which was definitely one of my greatest thrills as a Pittsburgher. 
   A native of Rochester, New York, Frattare received has bachelor's degree in communications from Ithaca College in 1970. His baseball broadcasting career began in 1968 with the Geneva Senators, a Class A team in New York. Frattare's association with the Pirates organization began in 1974 and 1975 when he broadcast games for the Triple-A West Virginia team, the Charleston Charlies. He was also a radio DJ and Sports Director at WBBF in Rochester before joining the Pirates in 1976. 
   ``There was no doubt about it''--Lanny Frattare continues to make significant impact on his listeners and on the history of the Pittsburgh Pirates. I feel privileged to know him and see the contributions he's made to the Pittsburgh community.

    Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I would like to recognize Captain Walter Rybka and the officers and crew of the Flagship Niagara on their return from their East Coast ten-month voyage. The Flagship Niagara is a symbol of Erie, Pennsylvania's history and serves as an Ambassador of the Commonwealth when in participates in tall ship  events. As a resident of Pennsylvania, I am proud to have such a treasure as part of our history. 
   The Flagship Niagara has played an important role in our nation's history. It sailed proudly in the War of 1812 and fought in the Battle of Lake Erie. I commend the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission, the Flagship Niagara League, and the City of Erie for restoring the ship and making it available so that others in the United States may learn of its history. 
   I would also like to take this opportunity to express my sincere appreciation to those who serve on the Flagship Niagara. The Flagship Niagara is a part of Pennsylvania's history, and your commitment to the ship and to Erie is highly commendable.

    Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize Mrs. Coretta Ogburn who died on Monday July 31, 2000. She was born on July 30, 1909 in Pittsburgh to the late Sally and Henry Black. 
   Mrs. Ogburn graduated from the Pittsburgh Public School System and later became employed for many years with the Allegheny County Health Department from which she retired in the 1970s. She was also well known as a dedicated and highly respected community leader for her committed efforts to her Church and community organizations. She was actively involved in the Negro Emergency Education Drive (NEED), the Urban League, the YWCA, the YMCA, and the Pittsburgh branch of the NAACP. 
   During her tenure as a member of the NAACP, Mrs. Ogburn sat on the Executive Committee, Human Rights Dinner Committee, Scholarship Committee, Women in the NAACP (WIN), and the Membership Committee. As Chair of the Membership Committee, she was instrumental in increasing branch memberships for the organization, and in 1958, she received her first award for soliciting the most NAACP memberships. In addition, the National Office of the NAACP awarded Mrs. Ogburn a medal for her accomplishments as one of the top membership solicitors in the entire nation. Mrs. Ogburn was awarded several other awards for her commitment and dedication to this organization. 
   It is an honor for me to recognize Mrs. Coretta Ogburn and the selfless time and energy she put towards her community.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I come to the floor this morning, following my distinguished colleague and good friend from Alabama, feeling the same inadequacy to express my thoughts and feelings about the life of someone for whom I had a tremendous amount of respect. As PHIL GRAMM so aptly put it in his eulogy on Saturday, if you knew PAUL COVERDELL, he was your friend. PAUL was a friend. 
   I guess in the last week from reading and listening and talking to people about PAUL, it is incredible that in this city someone could be so universally understood by everyone. All of us are individuals. We are very complex. 
   Some often say in Washington that politicians have many facets and many faces. PAUL was PAUL. He was like that to me. He was like it to JEFF. He was like it to the Presiding Officer. He was like it to everyone here. Everyone who has gotten up and talked about PAUL said the same thing in the final analysis. They talked about his decency, his good nature, his peacemaking, his optimism, his energy, and his enthusiasm. 
   I understand we are going to compile all of the things that have been said about PAUL. The remarkable thing is the sameness of what everyone says about PAUL. It is a remarkable quality in and of itself--that PAUL was always PAUL. He was always himself. He was never trying to be something for everyone to meet their expectation. He was who he was, as genuine and as pure as you can possibly be. That is a tremendous gift that he had. 
   It is so resoundingly amplified by the comments of our colleagues whose eulogies and comments have been out of the same embryo. That may be one of the great legacies and lessons of PAUL COVERDELL and his life. 
   There are a few people who I want to thank. First, I thank Nancy and his mother for the dedication that they gave to PAUL in allowing him to provide his service. 
   He spent an incredible amount of time working issues, long days and long nights away from Nancy while she was in Georgia. She made a tremendous sacrifice for him and for his career in the Senate. Obviously, the impact she had on PAUL's life was profound and obviously positive. The same could be said for his mother. I cannot imagine a mother being more proud of a son than PAUL's mother was of him and the contribution he made to Georgia, to the Senate, to this country. 
   I thank the people of Georgia for sending the Senate PAUL COVERDELL. He had some tough races but Georgia stood behind him, supported him, and elected a Republican Senator, twice, from the State of Georgia. Georgia should be very proud of that choice. 
   Finally, I thank God for sending PAUL, a truly extraordinary person. When I found out on Tuesday PAUL very well may not make it, I was sitting in the back talking to Senator GORTON. I was talking about what a tragic loss it would be should PAUL die. I looked around at the desks, I looked at SLADE, and I said: I don't know where PAUL's desk is. He never sat at his desk. He was always running all over the place--down in the well, back in the Cloakroom, running from place to place. He was never at his desk. I thought to myself, where did he sit? 
   What a fitting analysis of the role that PAUL COVERDELL played in this place. He was everywhere, doing everything, never sitting back at his desk worried about himself or what he would say or do but running around making things happen, back in the Cloakroom with that Styrofoam Waffle House coffee cup. I don't know where he got all those Styrofoam Waffle House cups, but he had one in his hand all the time. There would be two or three placed throughout the Cloakroom by the end of the day. Everyone knew where PAUL had been. He was just working all the time, putting every ounce of his energy--and it was an incredible amount of energy--into his work in the Senate. 
   I was at the funeral on Saturday. Many things were said about PAUL moving on from one life to the next. It reminded me of a quote from a funeral I attended earlier this year for Governor Casey in Scranton, PA. The quote on the back of the book we received when we came into the church could not help but remind me of PAUL: ``Death is not extinguishing the light. It is putting out the lamp because the dawn has come.'' 
   PAUL's light here in the Senate burned so bright. He illuminated every conversation. Every room he walked into with his energy, with his positive attitude, with his optimism. That light will be missed. Lights that seem to burn the brightest are doomed not to burn the longest. If we are measuring the wattage or the illumination that has been cast on this Earth, no one cast more light in 61 years than PAUL ever did. It is a comfort to know that the dawn for PAUL has come and that he is experiencing a brighter light than we all know right now. It is a comfort to know he is experiencing that light and is in heaven. 
   As a Catholic, I believe in intercessory prayer. Those in heaven can pray to God to help those on Earth. I know PAUL is praying for us. I ask for your prayers, PAUL, for all of us here, because we will miss you.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to query my distinguished colleague from Alaska, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, on a program of importance to my constituents. Mr. Chairman, is it the intention of the conference committee that of the $4,000,000 appropriated in the Air Force's operation and maintenance title for the Manufacturing Technical Assistance Pilot Program (MTAPP), $2,000,000 shall be expended during fiscal year 2001 only for the continued expansion of the program into Pennsylvania through the National Education Center for Women in Business at Seton Hill College? As the Chairman may know, half of the appropriated FY2000 funds are not being provided to the program in Pennsylvania, and I seek to ensure that during FY2001 the funds are allocated between the two MTAPP programs.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to empower at-risk youths and their communities. My legislation would establish a national youth entrepreneurship clearinghouse and permit curriculum-based youth entrepreneurship education as an allowable use of funds. Only curriculum-based youth entrepreneurship programs that demonstrate success in equipping disadvantaged youth with applied math and other analytical skills would be eligible for assistance under this measure. Students who participate in these programs learn basic entrepreneurial skills and gain a better understanding of the relationship between the subjects they learn in their classrooms and the business world. By teaching students practical skills needed to establish and maintain thriving entrepreneurial projects, the programs empower students and prepare them for future endeavors as contributing members of their communities. My legislation will instill pride in at-risk youths by providing them with the opportunity to improve their surroundings, while they explore and learn about the many career choices available to them in the business world. 
   I am pleased that this measure was included in the Elementary and Secondary Education Reauthorization bill passed by the House of Representatives, and it is my hope that we can facilitate its passage in the Senate and move closer to providing significant and meaningful initiatives for our children in need.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise to engage in a colloquy with the distinguished Chairman of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee regarding a study to improve farming practices in Africa. 
   As the chairman knows, the Trade and Development Act of 2000 was signed into law in May. This Act authorized a study on ways to improve African agricultural practices. This study will be conducted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture in consultation with a land grant university and a not-for-profit organization that has firsthand knowledge of African farming. 
   While a two year study is authorized, it is my understanding that ample data and research exists supporting the need to establish a more formal relationship to improve farming practices in Africa. 
   To that end, I ask the Chairman if he would work with me to ensure that the USDA takes up this study in a timely fashion and incorporates the existing data so that we can formally implement these recommendations.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a brief colloquy with the distinguished Chairman of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator GORTON, concerning future demonstration projects under the Clean Coal Technology program. Mr. President, clarifying the intent of the program will be helpful in my efforts to ensure that a very worthwhile initiative in Pennsylvania received full consideration by the Department of Energy. 
   The lack of a coherent and consistent energy policy has contributed to the high fuel prices that have hit the working families in Pennsylvania and across the nation very hard. It is the lack of a national energy policy that has led to our nation's reliance on foreign oil. Today, we import 56 percent of our fuel. This is the highest level in the history of our country. For a historical perspective, we only imported 36 percent of our oil during the energy crisis of the 1970s. 
   Mr. President, we must reduce our reliance on imported oil. We must conserve energy resources, improve energy efficiencies, and increase domestic energy supplies. We also need to aggressively expand our research and development efforts to encourage the use of domestic renewable energy sources. 
   The Pennsylvania initiative that I referred to would do just that by developing a facility that would convert Anthracite culm to a clean diesel fuel. The project would produce 1.4 million  barrels a year of zero-sulfur, high-energy diesel fuel, at the same time reclaiming land now rendered unusable and environmentally damaging. Additionally, it would create 1,000 construction and 150 permanent jobs. 
   Would the Senator agree that the establishment of such a facility, whose principal focus is to develop domestic renewable energy sources by transforming coal and coal waste into high quality diesel fuel, is the type of activity that the Clean Coal Technology program should encourage?

   Mr. SANTORUM. This is a bipartisan attempt in the Senate to match the bipartisan effort that has been ongoing in the House of Representatives with the President of the United States on what is called the Community Renewal New Markets Initiative. Basically, we have taken the House-passed legislation and added a couple of very important provisions to that House-passed legislation, and we are now offering it to this death tax repeal legislation in the Senate. 
   The two major additions to the House-passed legislation--there are several, but the two major additions are the low-income housing tax credit, which is something that has passed this body before, and again has broad bipartisan support, raising the per capita number or allotment for the low-income housing tax credit per State; and the second is something that Senator LIEBERMAN and I have been working on now for quite some time called individual development accounts. 
   I think these two key provisions are very important to the idea of empowering individuals, not only in their communities, which the community renewal package does, but also in providing the opportunity for wealth accumulation through individual development accounts, and providing that incentive to save for a home, to save for a college education, to save for the startup of a new business. 
   In addition, there are some other very important provisions. Earlier this year, Senator ABRAHAM offered the New Millennium Classroom Act, another addition to the House-passed bill, which provides incentives for businesses to donate money to poorer schools, so we can have computer equipment in those poorer schools to bridge the digital divide. 
   We have a charitable choice provision, which is broader than the House provision, which was introduced by Senator ASHCROFT, the Presiding Officer, that is in line, frankly. 
   I was reading Vice President GORE's speech that he gave last year where he talked about a ``New Partnership.'' He talked about the 1996 welfare reform bill. He said:  
   [This provision states] that states can enlist faith-based organizations to provide basic welfare services, and help move people from welfare to work.  
   He goes on to say:  
   They can do so with public funds--and without having to alter the religious character that is so often the key to their effectiveness.  
   I go on to quote:  
   I believe we should extend this carefully tailored approach to other vital services where faith-based organizations can play a role--such as drug treatment, homelessness, and youth violence prevention.  
   That is just to name a few. 
   So what we see is that the Vice President has embraced this charitable choice provision and an expansion of that, which I think is vitally important. 
   With that, Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.

I want to mention some of the people who today let us know that they are supporting this amendment: The National Association of Home Builders, the Chamber of Commerce, the Credit Union National Association, American Bar Association, the Corporation for Enterprise Development, to name a few. 
   With regard to the charitable choice language, I certainly understand the concerns. The Vice President, the nominee of the Democratic Party, does not share the concerns voiced by many Members on the other side. I understand the White House has some concerns about the breadth of programs covered. 
   I said to Secretary Sperling, I am very willing to negotiate those and put a list together and limit those covered, but the charitable choice provisions are very broadly supported, I must say.

Northampton County was established in 1752, thus its official celebration will not occur until March 11, 2002. However, on June 26, 2000, Northampton County kicked off this celebration with a lunch designed to draw support and preparation for the events in 2002. 
   Jerry Seyfried, former county executive and current court administrator, is coordinating the celebration preparations. He mentioned some of the events that are in the works, including a parade on September 23, 2001, a historic family treasure hunt, a black-tie gala, and a sports showcase. Most importantly, the celebrations will be geared toward local schools, churches and ethnic groups. This celebration is expected to be the largest event that Northampton County has ever undertaken. 
   Northampton County has served as a crucial part of Pennsylvania's history, and I commend the area for initiating such a tremendous celebration for this most historic event. I look forward to the upcoming festivities in 2002 and hope to participate in them.

   Joyce's stepdaughter, Lizzie, came to this decision as she recognized the importance of the relationship she has with her stepmother. I commend both Joyce and Lizzie for embracing their new family members in this manner. 
   Many people are blessed with step-relationships similar to the Capuzzis. However, none have ever illustrated that with the idea of creating a holiday just for the recognition of this type of relationship.

   Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Chairman. I know that you are very much  aware of the devastation caused by polycystic kidney disease, better known as PKD. Our colleagues may be interested to know that this disease afflicts over 600,000 Americans, which is more than the combined total of cystic fibrosis, Huntington's disease, sickle cell anemia, hemophilia, muscular dystrophy and Down's syndrome. That translates into an average of almost 1400 sufferers in each congressional district, or 12,000 in each state. 
   PKD is the most prevalent life-threatening genetic disease, and is the third leading cause of kidney failure, resulting in almost $2 billion spent every year to treat end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis or transplantation. End-Stage Renal Disease is the fastest growing part of Medicare, and I know we are all looking for ways to strengthen that important program. 
   Mr. President, I would like to ask the Chairman if, in the context of the funding provided to the National Institutes of Health in this bill, could he tell us your intentions with regard to PKD research?

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to discuss with Chairman SPECTER the plight of nearly 1,000 displaced coal workers in southwestern Pennsylvania. As Senator SPECTER is aware, these employees of Consol Coal have recently lost their jobs and have sought federal assistance to provide a wide variety of adjustment assistance services including occupational skills training, career plan development, and job search assistance. 
   As my colleague knows, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania had requested over $12 million in an emergency grant application that was submitted to the U.S. Department of Labor. In addition to the services already mentioned, needs-related payments were requested in order to provide income support to workers who participated in retraining activities. These payments are essential as they provide a modest source of income for the workers while they are pursuing additional skills and education in order to prepare for a new vocation. Unfortunately, the Department of Labor only funded a portion of the request, indicating that needs-related payments could not exceed 25 percent of the total application. However, in the past the Department has not held similar applications to the same standard. In fact, I have been made aware of a grant award for mine workers who requested needs-related payments in excess of 70 percent of the total grant application. 
   Knowing of the need of these displaced coal workers and the inconsistency of the Department of Labor in awarding funds, I ask that Chairman SPECTER work with me in the coming weeks to identify appropriate funds in the Department of Labor's budget to support these workers as they prepare for new careers.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to address an issue that Senator SPECTER and I have been working on with Pennsylvania hospitals and the Health Care Financing Administration. Since 1998, we have been trying to resolve a dispute concerning the inclusion of a state's General Assistance population as a part of its Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) payment calculation. HCFA asserted in 1998 that Pennsylvania hospitals were including General Assistance (GA) days in their Medicare DSH calculation, when they should only have included Medicaid days. This issue at the time was an enormous concern to the hospitals which provide care to the neediest populations in my state, and this issue remains unresolved today. 
   Mr. President, this is a matter of fairness and applying the rules and interpretations equally. Medicare fiscal intermediaries had been reimbursing hospitals with GA days included for the past twelve years. In 1998, HCFA reversed its own intermediaries' interpretation and began recouping the so-called overpayments as far back as fiscal year 1993. Since then, Pennsylvania hospitals stopped including the GA days in their DSH calculations. 
   I now understand that thirty-five other States had been including General Assistance days in their Medicare DSH calculations, and that since January of this year, HCFA began allowing some states which operate under Section 1115 Medicaid waivers to include  the GA population in the Medicare DSH calculation. Pennsylvania hospitals operate under a Section 1915 waiver, and it has been made clear to them that they cannot count GA populations in their calculations. 
   Mr. President, HCFA appears to be unfairly applying GA days and Medicare DSH calculations across states. I am very concerned that hospitals in Pennsylvania remain at a disadvantage, and I remain committed to working with HCFA to clarify once and for all how the GA population should be treated under the Medicare DSH program. 
   I appreciate the diligence that my colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator SPECTER, has shown on this matter, and I will continue to work with him toward a satisfactory resolution.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, as this Congress continues to deliberate options of how best to care for our senior population, it is critical to consider, as well, the role that caregivers play in accommodating the delivery of such care to loved ones. Family caregivers are often forced to make difficult sacrifices. By just one measure, it is estimated that the average loss of income to these caregivers is more than $600,000 in wages, pensions and Social Security benefits. This does not have to be the case, though. 
   It does not have to be the case with the choices afforded by legislation I am pleased to be introducing today along with Senator ROCKEFELLER of West Virginia aimed at reforming Medicare's home health benefit. The Medicare Adult Day Services Alternative Act of 2000 would provide Medicare beneficiaries who qualify for home health benefits the choice to receive those services in qualified adult day care centers, and simultaneously assist family caregivers with the very real difficulties in caring for a homebound family member. 
   It is with America's Medicare beneficiaries and family caregivers in mind which makes the Medicare Adult Day Services Alternative Act a winner for Medicare, for patients and for their caregivers. First, it would allow patients to receive home health services in a setting that promotes rehabilitation by providing social interaction, meals and therapeutic activities above and beyond the provision of the prescribed home health benefit. Second, caregivers for homebound patients would be able to maintain employment outside of the home because they would know that their family member is in a healthy, protected environment during the day. 
   With this legislation, patients could elect to receive some, or all, of their home health benefit in a home or an adult day care congregate setting. I think my colleagues would agree with me that the opportunity to interact with others with similar needs can improve patients' mental and physical wellbeing. While not expanding the existing eligibility criteria for home health, this legislation offers Medicare beneficiaries a greater sense of autonomy afforded by receiving necessary care outside of their homes. 
   The adult day care center would be paid 95% of the rate paid to a home health agency for providing the Medicare-covered service. But within that lump-sum payment, the adult day care center would also be required to cover transportation, medication management, therapeutic activities, and meals. 
   The Medicare Adult Day Services Alternative Act recognizes the benefit that will come to family members of Medicare recipients of this service. These caregivers will be able to attend to other things in today's fast-paced family life, knowing their loved ones are well cared for. This creative solution to health care delivery also adequately reimburses providers and is designed to be budget neutral. 
   I hope that members on both sides of the aisle will join me in advancing this important issue for Medicare beneficiaries and their families. As this Congress considers various proposals to improve Medicare's home health benefit, this proposal deserves the serious attention and consideration of my colleagues. I look forward to working with them to enact this pro-beneficiary, potentially cost-saving reform legislation.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I thank both my colleagues, my colleague from Pennsylvania and my colleague from Minnesota, for allowing me just a few minutes, at least 5 minutes, to explain the subject matter of this amendment. 
   I heard the Senator from Arizona, Mr. MCCAIN, talking about Internet protection. Let me say I commend his work as chairman of the Commerce Committee in pursuing this area because it is an important area, to provide needed protections for children in libraries and schools, to have a program in place to deal with the issues of pornography and violence and the other things that have opened up on the Internet. 
   I have nothing but words of praise for the Senator from Arizona and for the work he has initiated. In fact, the amendment I have just introduced uses his language pretty much as the base of the amendment. But in looking at this issue, now, for the past several years--and I have young children; I am very concerned about their access to the Internet--talking to people from both libraries and schools, and others who are interested in the subject area, I believe the McCain amendment, while I think it goes so far, can in fact and should go further. 
   In this respect, as the Senator himself mentioned, there are maybe 100 filtering software packages out there. Some are good, some are not so good; some are state of the art, some are not. His amendment does not require anyone to buy state-of-the-art filtering software. It just says you have to buy filtering software or blocking software. 
   In fact, even the state of the art does not include some of the things about which I am very concerned. One of the real concerns I have is chat rooms. When you talk about pedophiles and people who prey on people via the Internet, they do it principally through these chat rooms. I am not aware of very much software that blocks chat rooms. 
   So you have a lot of things in addition to sites that maybe are pornographic or violent, or other problems you find on the Internet, that may be blocked with some of these software packages. But it doesn't get to the scope of the dangers on the Internet. 
   What I have suggested in my amendment is that, in the alternative, we require local communities, schools--anyone who participates in the e-rate, the same premise on which Senator MCCAIN's amendment is based--that they develop a policy that there be local hearings and public notice, and there be a community effort put together for the community to get involved and make the decision on a community basis on how they are going to deal in a comprehensive way with this. In fact, we list several things in the amendment that must be covered by this local policy. 
   The policy is then reviewed by the FCC simply to determine whether the school district, for example, has met the criteria and actually has a policy in place to deal with the areas specified in the legislation. If the community decides they do not want to go through public notice, they don't want to have hearings, they don't want to go through this process of developing a local plan, then Senator MCCAIN's amendment falls into line; they must buy filtering software. So we keep his amendment as sort of the hammer to encourage localities to do that. 
   I think what Senator MCCAIN said was absolutely right. Most of these communities are already buying software. I have been through hundreds of schools and have talked about this issue. Most of them understand the dangers out there and, in fact, have developed or are in the process of developing a program to deal with this problem. What we want to do is provide some guidance to them, some encouragement to them, and in the case of Senator MCCAIN's underlying amendment, which again is part of our amendment that I have just filed, it is a hammer that says: If you don't provide a comprehensive local approach, then you have to buy the software. 
   To me, it is a philosophical argument. It says: Should we have Washington come down and hammer you and say here is what you have to do, or should we have a program that says: Here is the problem. Local parents and teachers and community, you go out and bring the community together and do the hard work of democracy, which is to work together to come up with a solution to the problem. I am hopeful we can do that. 
   I just say briefly, my amendment, the bill I have introduced which is S. 1545, which is the text of this amendment, has been endorsed by the American Association of School Administrators, American Association of Education Service Agencies, International Society for Technology in Education, National Rural Education Association, the American Library Association, the National Education Association, the Consortium for School Networking, and the Catholic Conference. They all support my amendment. That is about  as wide a cross-section as you can get. And I would add someone very local. On this issue, Dr. Laura Schlesinger also supports our approach as the alternative to the McCain amendment.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, as I discussed very briefly today, I rise in support of what the Senator from Arizona is trying to accomplish. I think he was the first to bring this issue to the floor of the Senate. He is to be congratulated for that. 
   He has a piece of legislation that has been out there for a couple of years and has fostered a lot of good thought and a lot of discussion as to what the best Federal policy should be in dealing with the problem of inappropriate use of the Internet at schools and libraries. His legislation actually led me to look further into it as constituents contacted me with respect to it. So let me say, from the outset, I congratulate the Senator from Arizona for his work and for his effort in this area. 
   I have a little different approach I want to talk about today that I believe improves upon the base bill that Senator MCCAIN came up with a couple of years ago. I have been working with a group of people, from the left to the right, if you will--from the Catholic Conference to the National Education Association, from the American Libraries Association to Dr. Laura Schlessinger. So I think our effort here covers the ideological spectrum pretty well and is a consensus that is built around one thing--that while Internet filtering software is a good idea, generally speaking, it is an imperfect tool to meet the real complicated needs of teachers, administrators, and librarians who have to deal with the Internet on a daily basis in their schools. 
   I think the Catholic Conference put it best in their letter, actually to Senator MCCAIN, which says that his legislation ``fails to include one of the most effective tools utilized by the vast majority of Catholic schools throughout our Nation, the Ethical Internet Use Policy''--in other words, a comprehensive policy at the school level to deal with not only access to sites that may be inappropriate on the Internet, which is what filtering gets to, but a variety of different things that are very important. 
   For example, electronic mail. Unfortunately, we hear so many stories about people being contacted through electronic mail, chatrooms, that are if not as dangerous in some cases even more dangerous than the sites that may be accessed on the World Wide Web, where you have predators who are out there trying to grab the mind of a young person. 
   Again, the attempt to do filtering software is helpful. But we have to have a policy developed at the community level that deals with things that go beyond these dangerous Internet sites, such as the electronic mail and chatrooms, and other kinds of direct electronic communication. 
   Under this legislation, we require that a policy be developed at the local level with respect to unauthorized use of minors, such as hacking, another area which is of grave concern not just for the minors themselves but for the user community at large, and a policy with respect to the dissemination of personal information of the minor. These minors log on. They have personal information in there. There needs to be a policy to take care of that. 
   What our legislation simply does is--it would actually amend the McCain amendment, although not formally here in the Senate--say that you must have a local policy that includes, No. 1, at least, public hearing and notice requirements, a public hearing where the community gets together and, at the community level, we come up with an Internet policy that has to meet these certain criteria. In other words, we don't say how they do it, but that, in fact, they have policies that address these broader concerns than just eliminating one particular Internet site or Internet sites. So it is, in fact, a requirement to develop a local policy. 
   If they choose not to do that, then the McCain language becomes operative. You must buy filtering software. We don't require filtering software. Even the Senator from Arizona has admitted there are 90-some titles out there--some are good; some are not. His legislation doesn't direct you to have buy a good one; you just have to buy one. It is certainly not the most comprehensive way of dealing with it. In fact, it may be a way that creates a false sense of security that you are dealing with problems, and it may actually reduce the amount of oversight that should be present in schools and at public libraries. 
   Again, I compliment the Senator, but we need to take one step further. Given the problems we have seen develop through chatrooms, through e-mail, through hackers, and through dissemination of information about minors, to do it at the local level is the best way to accomplish this with the fallback hammer, if you will, of the McCain underlying requirement to buy filtering software. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, in response to the critique of the Senator from Arizona who says ours is really status quo and this is a large loophole, it is not status quo. No. 1, it is not required under law today; we require a public notice and a public hearing and a policy to be formulated at the local level that addresses inappropriate matter on the Internet, the World Wide Web, electronic mail, chatrooms, and other forms of direct electronic communication, such as hacking and other unlawful activities by monitors, and any other kind of dissemination of personal identification information regarding minors. 
   That is not current law. The review body is the same review body in his legislation, the FCC. He requires a filtering software to be purchased, and you have to certify that with the FCC. We say that you have to implement a  policy, have public hearings and meetings, and you have to submit that policy to the FCC for them to review to ensure that you have covered the areas that we require. That is not status quo. 
   He may not agree that decision should be made at the local level, and I accept that. I think we have an honest philosophical disagreement on whether we should have a one-size-fits-all Federal mandate that you have to buy filtering software. By the way, that filtering software may cover chatrooms; it may not. That is called monitoring software. There is no requirement for monitoring software to be covered for this, just filtering software. Some filtering software is better than others; some is comprehensive, some is not, and some is older. There is no requirement as to what software and how good it is that needs to be purchased under the McCain legislation. 
   What we say is that we believe this is best implemented at the local level. If you read from the Catholic Conference--and the Senator from Arizona suggested that all the profamily groups were supporting his legislation. I think the Catholic Conference can stand up as a profamily group, and they don't support the McCain legislation; they support ours. I think one of you who are Dr. Laura Schlessinger listeners know that she has been outspoken on the issue of Internet pornography and has been leading a campaign on that issue. She has been working with us and she supports the idea of having local communities have public hearings and notices so parents know they can have input so that we can raise the visibility of the issue at the local level in dealing with a variety of issues, not just a simple filtering software mandated by Washington, DC. 
   So it is a one-size-fits-all, and I believe incomplete, solution. Do you trust the local schools and do you trust the local communities to come up with a standard that meets the needs of that community? That is much more comprehensive by definition--it has to be--than the filtering software alternative being offered by Senator MCCAIN. I just suggest, and historically I have supported--particularly in the area of education--local communities making those decisions for themselves, as opposed to a Federal mandate from Washington, DC. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, in response to the Senator, we do not remove the requirement. We say that we would like to see the local community participate and develop a comprehensive policy. If they fail to do so, then they have to buy the filtering system. I have visited 160 schools since I have been in office. Over the last year and a half, in particular, I have talked to a lot of school librarians and administrators about the Internet and Internet pornography. All of the ones I have talked to, when I discussed the legislation and the ideas--in fact, some of this has come from the schools themselves throughout Pennsylvania. The ones who glow about their policy are the ones who have comprehensive policies. 
   Yes, they have filtering software, but that is just a piece of a bigger puzzle. If you just rely on that piece, I think what you can do is create a false sense of security that you have solved the problem, particularly in community libraries. I argue that in requiring public hearings and notice and input, that will put a chilling effect on some of the librarians who Senator MCCAIN referred to, who maybe are not as concerned about pornography as they should be, or not as concerned about chatrooms as they should be, or not as concerned about e-mails as they should be. But a public consciousness and the public input that will result from a community standard being applied to those people who work at these facilities is the answer to that--not a filtering software which is imprecise and, in cases of chatrooms, hacking, e-mail, and a variety of other things, ineffective. It is not comprehensive. And so I agree. 
   There is nobody who would like to see more protection from that than me. I have five little kids under the age of 10. So I understand the need and the concern. I come here as a father who is very concerned about the ability of children to be able to access sites they should not get to or communicate with people with whom they have no business communicating. But it is up to the community to take an interest in their children, to design a policy that is comprehensive, and this requires a comprehensive policy. By the way, if the librarians and those who run the libraries or the schools say they don't want to deal with this, then you have the McCain mandate. You will have the mandate that you have to buy the filtering software. So they can't avoid doing something. Again, the body that will oversee this is going to be the FCC, the same body the Senator from Arizona puts in place to oversee his requirement. 
   So I believe what we have done is tried to build upon a positive step. Again, I congratulate the Senator from Arizona. He has been a leader in this problem. He has blazed the trail. I believe what we have offered is a constructive addition to his policy. 
   I will step back on this point. The Senator from Arizona said the Catholic Conference doesn't oppose his bill. As I read it again, they did not oppose it, but they listed two pages of concerns about his policy. Then they wrote to us recently and talked about how they liked what we did. But I understand they are not in the business of opposing and supporting. Let me just say their intentions are clear.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I respectfully disagree. My amendment is supported by groups on the left and the right and the middle: the NEA, the American Library Association, and the Catholic Conference. 
   Senator MCCAIN started the ball rolling. I give him credit for requiring Internet software. The fact is, that is not comprehensive enough and not locally generated. My amendment says we have to have public notice and a public meeting by the community, involving the library or the school, to develop a comprehensive Internet policy. 
   Blocking software does not deal with chatrooms, e-mails, hacking, and dissemination of minor information over the Internet. It is good as far as it goes, but we need a comprehensive policy that is locally developed with community standards. If they choose not to do that, then they have to buy the software. 
   We require a policy that deals with all of these four things I just mentioned and have public meetings and public notice to get the community involved. 
   One of the big problems with use of the Internet is that parents and community leaders do not know what is going on with this little black box in the library or school. This requires public comment, it requires public notification, and public input in a process that desperately needs to be a public one and community standards need to be set. 
   It is supported by a wide variety of organizations. Those of my colleagues who voted for the McCain amendment can also vote for this amendment and walk out with a clear conscience and see a much more comprehensive policy put in place.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I welcome Rev. Gus Roman from Canaan Baptist Church in Philadelphia. Reverend Roman is a giant among pastors in Philadelphia. He has held many leadership positions within the clergy, within the city of Philadelphia, and has been the right arm of Rev. Leon Sullivan, who may be a giant among giants within Philadelphia and around the world. 
   In particular, I refer to his work reaching into Africa, working on AIDS projects with the terrible scourge that is crossing Africa today. Reverend Roman is on the front line urging not only his church but other churches to respond to the need in America, as well as the wonderful things we have been able to accomplish--Reverend Roman and myself and others--in the community in Philadelphia. He has been a great leader, someone who has been a real tour de force not only in evangelizing the word of God but in putting God's will into action in the community. 
   It is an honor to have him here today. We certainly welcome him wholeheartedly to the Senate.

    Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize James Stalder as he retires as Managing Partner from the Pittsburgh office of Pricewaterhouse-Coopers LLP. He initially joined the firm in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania before transferring to the National Headquarters in New York, where he served as Director of Tax Research and Technical Services for the Ohio Valley Area. In 1988, he was appointed Managing partner of the Price Waterhouse office. Since July 1998, Mr. Stalder has been Managing Partner of the PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP office. 
   Upon retiring, Mr. Stalder will commence a deanship at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh. He will assume the position of Dean of the A.J. Palumbo Undergraduate School of Business and the John F. Donahue Graduate School of Business. Judging by Mr. Stalder's proven leadership, it is clear that he will be a great asset to Duquesne. 
   Mr. Stalder has served as President of the Pennsylvania Institute of Certified Public Accountants and as a member of the Council of the American Institute of Public Accountants. He is also a Life Trustee of Carnegie-Mellon University where he has been a member of the faculty of the Graduate School of Industrial Administration since 1981. A graduate of The Pennsylvania State University, he also serves as a member of the University's Smeal College of Business Administration Board of Trustees. Moreover, Mr. Stalder was instrumental in the creation of the Pennsylvania Tax Blueprint Project, which is developing micro simulation economic impact models to enable the Governor and legislators in Pennsylvania to measure and intelligently debate alternative tax reform proposals. In addition, Mr. Stalder has served as Chairman of the Greater Pittsburgh Chamber of Commerce and in many other leadership roles in similar organizations. I commend Mr. Stalder for his demonstrated service to leadership in these organizations. 
   Mr. Stalder has received numerous awards for outstanding service to his community. Among these is the Distinguished Public Service Award, the top award presented to an individual by the Pennsylvania Institute of Certified Public Accountants, which ``honors CPAs who have truly made a difference through active participation in public service. 
   Mr. Stalder will be an excellent addition to the administration at Duquesne. Throughout his professional life, he has worked with some of the leading multi-national corporations in the world. He will be able to offer his extensive expertise in tax accounting and related fields, as well as the skills of negotiating and deal making. 
   James Stalder is a role model not only to the residents of Pittsburgh but to the entire Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. I wish him the best as he takes on new challenges.

    Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise with great pride to introduce the Affordable Housing for Seniors and Families Act. I am very pleased to say that Senator KERRY of Massachusetts and Senator SARBANES are original cosponsors of this bill. 
   Even as our national economy flourishes, many Americans are struggling to find safe, decent, sanitary, affordable housing. HUD estimates that 5.4 million families are either paying over half of their incomes for rent or living in substandard housing. Of these households, 1.4 million, or 26%, are elderly or disabled. The scarcity of affordable housing is particularly troubling for seniors and the disabled who may require special structural accommodations in their homes. 
   As Vice Chairman of the Subcommittee on Housing and Transportation, and as a member of the Aging Committee, I feel a heightened sense of urgency in helping these special populations find housing. Thus, I am pleased to offer a bill which: reauthorizes federal funding for elderly and disabled housing programs; expands supportive housing opportunities for these special populations; codifies options to enhance the financial viability of the projects; assists sponsors in offering a ``continuum of care'' that allows people to live independently and with dignity; offers incentives to preserve the stock of affordable housing that is at risk of loss due to prepayment, Section 8 opt-out, or deterioration; and modernizes current laws allowing the FHA to insure mortgages on hospitals, assisted living facilities, and nursing homes. Together, I believe these measures will help to fill the critical housing needs of elderly and disabled families. 
   On September 27, 1999, the House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved the Preserving Affordable Housing for Senior Citizens in the 21st Century Act (H.R. 202) by a vote of 405-5.  Several aspects of H.R. 202, which protected residents in the event that their landlords did not renew their project based Section 8 contracts, were included in the FY 2000 VA-HUD appropriations bill. The legislation I offer today is modeled on the House-passed bill, without the preservation provisions that have already been enacted. I would like to take a few moments to highlight the major provisions of this bill. 
   The Section 202 elderly housing program and the Section 811 disabled housing program each provide crucial affordable housing for very low-income individuals, whose incomes are 50 percent or below of the area median income. By law, sponsors, or owners, of Section 202 or Section 811 housing must be non-profit organizations. Many sponsors are faith-based. The Affordable Housing for Seniors and Families Act will increase the stock of Section 202 and 811 housing in several ways. First, it reauthorizes funding for Section 202 and 811 housing programs in the amount of $700 million and $225 million, respectively, in FY 01. Such sums as are necessary are authorized for FY 02 through FY 04. Second, it creates an optional matching grant program that will enable sponsors to leverage additional money for construction. Third, it allows Section 202 housing sponsors to buy new properties. 
   This legislation also codifies options giving owners financial flexibility to use sources of income besides the Section 202 and Section 811 funds. For instance, by requiring HUD to approve prepayment of the 202 mortgages, this bill allows sponsors to build equity in their projects, which can be used to leverage funding for capital improvements or services for tenants. It gives sponsors maximum flexibility to use all sources of financing, including federal money, for construction, amenities, and relevant design features. In order to raise additional outside revenue and offer a convenience to tenants, owners are permitted to rent space to commercial facilities. In the cases of both Section 202 and 811 housing, owners may use their project reserves to retrofit or modernize obsolete or unmarketable units. Finally, this bill allows project 
   sponsors to form limited partnerships with for-profit entities. Through such a partnership, sponsors can also compete for the Low Income Housing Tax Credit, and build larger developments. 
   The importance of providing a ``continuum of care'' for seniors and disabled persons to continue living independently is addressed in the Affordable Housing for Seniors and Families Act. For example, this bill helps seniors stay in their apartments as they become older and more frail by authorizing competitive grants for conversion of elderly housing and public housing projects designated for occupancy by elderly persons to assisted living facilities. Responding to obstacles the handicapped face in finding special-needs housing, it allows private non-profits to administer tenant-based rental assistance for the disabled. It also ensures that funding will continue to be invested in building housing for the disabled by limiting funding for tenant-based assistance under the Section 811 program to 25% of the program's appropriation. Funding for service coordinators, who link residents with supportive or medical services in the community, is authorized through FY 04. Moreover, service coordinators are permitted to assist low-income elderly or disabled families in the vicinity of their projects. Seniors who live in their own houses will be assisted by a provision in Title V which allows them to maximize the equity in their homes by streamlining the process of refinancing an existing federal-insured reverse mortgage. 
   Title IV of this legislation focuses on preserving the existing stock of federally assisted properties as affordable housing for low and very low-income families. Each year, 100,000 low-cost apartments across the country are demolished, abandoned, or converted to market rate use. For every 100 extremely low-income households, having 30% or less of area median income, only 36 units were both affordable and available. Even in rural areas, the potential loss of assisted, affordable housing is very real due to prepayment of mortgages, opt-out of assisted housing programs upon contract expirations, frustration with government bureaucracy, or simply a recognition that the building would be more profitable as market-rate housing. Title IV responds with a matching grant program to assist state and local governments who are devoting their own money to affordable housing preservation. Likewise, it authorizes a competitive grant program to assist nonprofits in buying federally assisted property. 
   Current law allowing the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) to insure mortgages on hospitals, nursing homes, and assisted living facilities has become outdated. Title V modernizes the law and removes barriers to using FHA insurance for such facilities. Likewise, it recognizes the integrated nature of healthcare by allowing the FHA to provide mortgage insurance for ``integrated service facilities,'' such as ambulatory care centers, which treat sick, injured, disabled, elderly, or infirm persons. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this important bipartisan legislation. In closing, I would like to express my gratitude to Senator KERRY for working closely with me on this important legislation. I also would like to thank Senator SARBANES for his cosponsorship.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to address the issue of Social Security. Last week I got up toward the end of our time and did not have a chance to talk about the issue, but I briefly mentioned my strong admiration and support for Gov. George W. Bush's courageous and bold proposal in offering to the American public an opportunity to meet the Social Security crisis head on and deal with it in a responsible way through investment as a way to try to bridge the gap that now exists in the Social Security system--``the gap'' meaning not enough money coming in to pay benefits down the road once the baby boom generation begins to retire. 
   I have been out for the past 4 years talking about this issue and have talked in front of every conceivable group you can imagine. Yesterday I was in Harrisburg, PA, talking to the State AARP about Social Security and the importance of having politicians face up to the issue and explain to the American public how we are going to fix the problem. 
   The problem is very simple. Right now, there are about 3.3 people working for every retiree on Social Security. Social Security is a pay-as-you-go system. So those 3.3 working people have to pay enough in Social Security tax to pay for the benefits to that 1 retiree. 
   Just to give you a comparison, back in 1950 we had 17 workers paying into the system for every 1 retiree. That is why, in 1950, we had a payroll tax of 2 percent on the first $3,000 you earned, because there were 17 people paying and you could pay a relatively low rate of taxation to pay for the benefits. Now you pay 12.4 percent of every dollar you earn, up to, I believe it is, $72,000. 
   So it is a dramatic increase in taxes that has occurred because we went from 17 workers to every 1 retiree to 3.3 workers to every 1 retiree. In the next 20 years, we will go from 3.3 workers to every 1 retiree, to around 2 workers or maybe even a little less than 2 workers to every 1 retiree. 
   It is pretty obvious what is going to have to happen. We are going to have to make a change in the system because the current flow of revenue from 3.3 workers to support 1 retiree will be dramatically reduced when you only have 2 workers. You cannot keep the current rate of taxation and support that 1 retiree. 
   So the question is, What do we do about it? Do we wait, knowing it is going to happen? Everybody who is going to be working 20 years from now has been born, and everybody who is going to retire in 20 years from now has been born. So we know what the demographics are going to look like. The question is, What are we going to do about it? 
   There are three things you can do to fix the Social Security problem and only three things. There are only three things you can do. 
   No. 1, you can do what we have done 20-some times in the past; that is, increase taxes, from what started out as 2 percent on the first $3,000 to now 12.4 percent on up to $70,000 of income. So you can increase taxes. 
   The second thing you can do is reduce benefits. We have done that in the past, too. We raised the retirement age. We adjusted some of the benefit numbers. You can reduce benefits. 
   How much would we have to do of either raising taxes or cutting benefits? According to the Social Security trustees, the actuaries there, we are looking at a payroll tax increase, if we wait 15  or 20 years--which is what some here at the national level, the Vice President, for example, and some on the other side of the aisle have suggested; that if we wait, everything is going to be fine, that there will be no problem for another 30 or 35 years. Just wait. What if we wait? If we wait 20 years to fix this problem, we are looking at a payroll tax increase of roughly 40 percent, going from 12.4 to about an 18- or 19-percent payroll tax for the next generation. 
   So if you are a politician today and you do not plan on being around 20 years from now, I guess the answer of waiting is a pretty good option: Put it on to the next group of politicians and the next generation of people, and let them pay those taxes. They may say: ``As for me, I would rather just get elected and not make any tough decisions and not have to tell anybody about what pain is going to be in the future because under my watch there will not be any.'' That is the kind of leadership we do not need in America, in my opinion. But that is an option. 
   The first option is to increase taxes dramatically down the road. The second option is to cut benefits. By the year 2035, I think it is, Social Security taxes coming in will cover about 70 
   percent of what is needed to be paid out in benefits. So what does that tell you? We will have to cut benefits by about a third; that if we do not increase taxes, then we will have to cut benefits by a third. I suspect you will not find one vote in the Senate to do that today. And I do not believe you will find any votes in 20 years to do that. So that option is pretty much off the table, I suspect. 
   So those are the two options that are available, unless you take the third option. This is where Governor Bush has come out. I give him a lot of credit for doing so. The third option is investment, increase the rate of return on the money that is actually going into the system now to make up the shortfall in the long run. This is not a view that is a partisan viewpoint; this has broad bipartisan support in the Senate. 
   Many on the other side of the aisle believe in personal retirement accounts. Even more Members on the other side of the aisle and the President agree with investment where the Government actually takes the money and invests it. 
   So there are two kinds of investments. We can do it two different ways. The way I suggest and Governor Bush suggests is that every individual get a portion of their payroll tax to be put in a personal retirement account, which they own, they control, they invest, but they cannot touch until they retire. That is how I suggest the investment be done: The individual owning it, the individual investing it, the individual controlling it. 
   The President's suggestion, in two of his budgets in this current term of office, is that, yes, a portion of Social Security trust funds can be invested, but the Government invests it. There would be no individual ownership. It would be Government ownership. The Government would invest a portion of the Social Security trust funds in stocks and corporate bonds. Why? The President pretty much gave the same speech I am giving where he said there are three options: You can increase taxes, cut benefits, or invest; and the President chose investment. 
   The President, in his budget, chose investment. But the investment he chose was the Government ownership of that investment. We choose investment and say the individual should own the investment, and the individual should benefit from the investment; that the Government should not ``benefit'' from the investment. 
   There are a whole host of reasons the Government should not own corporations or stocks. We already regulate corporations. We tax corporations. Now we have gotten in the business of suing corporations. We should not also own them. That is the Government owning the means of production. For those of you who have not been in your political science class recently, the Government owning the means of production comes right out of the books of Karl Marx. We do not need the Government of the United States owning corporations. 
   By the way, I think most Americans believe very strongly about that, that Government ownership of stocks and bonds is not something that is particularly desirable, but the idea of investment is desirable. 
   The biggest criticism I hear from the Vice President, and the critics of Governor Bush's idea, is that this is a ``risky scheme.'' Contrast that with what their proposal is. Their proposal has, I would agree, less risk and more certainty. I would agree with that. There is less risk and more certainty. The certainty, though, is not a particularly desirable one. The certainty is we will have to raise taxes or cut benefits. 
   So you can argue that the Gore plan is less risky, is much more certain. We will have to raise taxes or we will have to cut benefits, or do a little of both. So in that respect there is certainty. But it is not certainty that I think the American public is looking for. 
   He suggested the Bush plan is risky because it involves investment. I did not hear that criticism of the President's plan to invest in the equities market. He did not criticize his own President's plan when he suggested that money from Social Security should be invested in the equities market. I guess some believe it is not risky if the Government invests it, but it is risky if you do. I am not too sure that holds a lot of water. Either investment in the market is risky or it is not risky. 
   Sure, obviously, there are risks in investment in the market. But every other retirement system in America is financed through investment. The people who are doing basically pretty well in America have 401(k) plans and IRAs and Keogh plans and other plans where they take money that they are earning. Here in the Federal Government, Federal employees have a thrift savings plan, all of which is invested in stocks and bonds. And we use the miracle of compound interest, over time, to be able to then afford to pay the benefits for those retirees once they hit retirement. 
   Every person who is doing pretty well in America has one of those plans at their disposal. It is the folks who are not doing so well who don't get a piece of the American pie. What the Vice President is saying is: For you folks who have these plans, that is OK; we think that is a good idea. 
   In fact, you will find the Vice President and others who are opposing personal retirement accounts for Social Security are at the same time encouraging people to go out and develop 401(k)s and invest and save for retirement; that it is a good idea. ``So if you have your own money and you make enough money, we encourage you to invest it. But if you are low income and you can't put money aside, we don't want you to have a piece of this. We don't want you to have your own personal retirement account within Social Security. We are just going to reserve that for people who have enough money to do it on their own. We will allow you to participate in the growth of the American economy, in the increase in the markets and economy, in the dynamism of the American dream that is going on in our capital markets today. If you have money, you go ahead and participate, and we will encourage you. We will provide tax incentives for you to do that. But if you are lower income and you are making ends meet and all you have for your retirement is Social Security, sorry, we will not allow you. It is too risky for you to do this.'' How paternal; how discriminatory. 
   What we support is to give every working American a very small piece at first. Maybe in years to come it will be larger, but at first a very small piece of the American pie, 2 percent, 3 percent of every dollar they earn for low and middle-income people to be put in a personal retirement account for them to invest; so as America grows and prospers, they won't be sitting on the sideline watching the rich get richer while they do not prosper from the growth in America. That is cruel. 
   We have an opportunity to reach out to moderate and low-income individuals and allow them to participate in the American dream of ownership, of investment, of participating in the growth of America, not just their own growth with respect to their wages. I think it is a tremendous opportunity. It is the first and biggest chance to bridge what I see as one of the biggest problems facing America today, which is the growing gap between the rich and the poor in this country. 
   I will never forget back in 1992, then-candidate Clinton would talk about the  decade of greed of the 1980s, how the rich got richer and the poor didn't get it. ``The 1980s, under Reagan, was the decade of greed.'' We don't hear President Clinton talking about that now. Does anybody ever wonder why he doesn't talk about that anymore? The reason he doesn't talk about it anymore is because during the 1990s, the rich got far richer than they did in the 1980s, and the poor didn't do that much better than they did in the 1980s. In fact, the gap between the rich and the poor widened more in the 1990s than it did in the 1980s. If the 1980s was the decade of greed, the 1990s, under the Clinton-Gore administration, was the decade of supergreed. 
   Why did that happen? It is pretty obvious why it happened. It happened because those who were wealthy, who owned and invested as the markets went up, as the value of assets went up, their income went up. Their wealth went up. If you are a worker who doesn't have wealth, doesn't have savings, doesn't have investment, then your wealth only goes up by the wage increase you get, which is 3 or 4 percent. So while the NASDAQ goes up or the Dow Jones goes up 10, 15, 20 percent or higher, your wages go up here at the bottom 2 or 3 percent, the gap grows. 
   One-third of all income in this country comes from investment. Yet the average person in America, someone right in the middle, has a total savings of $1,385. Half of America or more is left behind. 
   What we want to do with personal retirement accounts for Social Security is say to those Americans: Welcome to the American economy; participate in the American dream of growth and ownership of investment. With that, we will not only fix Social Security, but we will begin to do something that is fundamental, which is to bridge the wealth gap in America. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I strongly oppose this amendment for two reasons: No. 1, on its substance. If everyone is concerned about the damage to the political system and the damage to the public and the violation of things in which we believe, of organizations running independent expenditures, then cover everybody who does it. If my colleagues are only concerned about certain political groups and not concerned about other political groups  that may happen to favor their political position, then this is all about politics and not about reform. 
   Let's be clear. This is a rifle shot on this bill. This does not cover labor unions, this does not cover the Sierra Club, this does not cover the trial lawyers, all of which are the major funders of the other side of the aisle. 
   I am one of those Senators up for reelection who is going to be at the butt end of the expenditures of those very same groups, and no one over there will be outraged by the ``damage to the public,'' these groups do. 
   They are only concerned about the damage to the public that groups that do not favor them do. 
   We heard so much: We need to talk honestly with the public. Let's talk honestly with the public. We are rifle shooting here. We are killing the American political process by picking winners and losers. 
   At the same time, the second reason I oppose this bill is because we are killing the Defense authorization. 
   So we have two losers here. We have the political process--the big loser--because here we are in Congress picking winners and losers. And the second, we have the Defense authorization process, which I, as a subcommittee chairman, and like my colleague from Arkansas, a subcommittee chairman, we put a lot of time and effort into this bill because we understand, as the chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee, Jim INHOFE, said, we put in a lot of effort trying to craft a bipartisan bill. 
   We don't have too many coming to the floor these days. It is a bipartisan bill. I have worked with my ranking member, JOE LIEBERMAN. We have worked together in concert to put together a bill we can all support--and we all did support in committee --that really meets the needs of our military, that addresses some of the critical issues we had in our subcommittee. We had to deal with the transformation of the Army. I know everybody in this Chamber is concerned about how we transform the Army. 
   There are some very critical decisions we made in this bill that affect the future of our armed services, and particularly the Army, that I don't believe will be made correctly if we do not pass this bill. 
   There are some critical issues in the area of the Joint Strike Fighter. We made tough decisions that will not be met if we do not pass this bill. 
   A lot of people say we can wait. The House may not blue-slip this. The House voted on this issue. They voted it down. We know what they will do on this issue. The fact is, even if that is not the case, this is not the right amendment. This is not the right way to address this issue. 
   If you care about the ``corruption of the system'' that these organizations do, cover everybody. If you care about gaining political advantage, vote for this amendment because you will gain political advantage. You will put a chilling effect on some groups and ``Katie bar the door'' on the others. If that is what you want, if what you want is political advantage, you got it. Vote for it and kill both fairness in public discourse and disclosure, which I am for. 
   I will vote for an amendment--but not on this bill because I think it will hurt this bill--at some time. I hope the leader brings up this issue. But make sure we cover everybody. Make sure we do not pick our friends: You don't have to say anything. You don't have to disclose anything. And by the way, you guys who we really don't like, we are going to get you. We are going to chill your contributions. We are going to make you report everything. 
   That is what this is about, folks. If we are talking about honesty here, tell the truth. What does your amendment do? That is the truth. So I am happy to debate the truth. The truth is, I will support an amendment that is broad. I will support an amendment that provides disclosure for everybody who engages in political campaigns but not pick my friends over my enemies. 
   I would not vote for a bill that just picks my friends. Even you said we are not going to cover those organizations, Senator, that help you; we are just going to cover the guys who do not help you, I would vote against it. Do you know why? Because we should not be doing that. That is wrong. You want to talk about breeding cynicism? Bring up an amendment that calls for disclosure which excludes the groups that favor you and punishes the ones that don't, that brings cynicism to the process. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that  will assist our nation's dairy farmers at a time when the dairy industry is facing tremendous difficulty. This legislation proposes a regionally equitable plan that will bring some predictability to a business that is otherwise challenged by inherent variability that accompanies dairy farming. 
   I am pleased to have Senator HERB KOHL of Wisconsin join with me today in this effort. Given the importance of the dairy industry to our respective states, Senator KOHL and I worked together over the past few months to forge a consensus plan that addresses the concerns of dairy farmers nationwide. For far too long, regional politics has plagued efforts to achieve a fair and equitable national dairy policy. As a result, milk pricing has become increasingly complex and overly prescriptive. Given that dairy farmers are receiving the lowest price for their milk in more than twenty years, I feel strongly that Congress needed to step to the plate and offer a fair and responsible solution--the very reason for this action. 
   The National Dairy Farmers Fairness Act has two major goals: 1. create a dairy policy that is equitable for farmers in all regions of the country; 2. provide more certainty for farmers in the prices they receive for their milk. To accomplish these goals, this legislation creates a safety net for farmers by providing supplemental assistance when milk prices are low. Specifically, a sliding scale payment is made based upon the previous year's price for the national average of Class III milk. In short, the payment rate to farmers is highest when the prices they received were the lowest. In order to be eligible, a farmer must have produced milk for commercial sale in the previous year, and would be compensated on the first 26,000 hundredweight of production. All dairy producers would be eligible to participate under this scenario. 
   Without a doubt, our dairy pricing policy is flawed. Many solutions--modest to sweeping--have been proposed, discussed, and debated on the Senate floor yet final agreement among interested parties has so far eluded us. As a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee who represents the fourth largest dairy producing state in the nation, I am committed to preserving the viability of Pennsylvania's dairy farmers. This legislative proposal represents the strong concern and interest of mine to find a middle ground in the often heated debate on dairy policy. I am pleased to join with Senator KOHL in this effort, and I believe it sends a strong signal that compromise can be achieved even on the most contentious of issues.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the accomplishments of 30,020 Pennsylvanian Wal-Mart associates. These dedicated individuals, along with 870,000 other Wal-Mart associates nationwide, raised more than $14 million for the National World War II Memorial Campaign. 
   This outstanding achievement brought the World War II Memorial  Fund to more than $90 million. This donation brings the fund increasingly closer to its goal of $100 million. On June 6, 2000, Barbara Ritenour and Bonnie Cowell from Belle Vernon, PA joined 40 other Wal-Mart associates to present this contribution to former Senator Robert Dole, National Chairman of the World War II Memorial Campaign on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. 
   The purpose of this event on June 6 was to thank those who went above and beyond the call of duty to help meet this financial goal. It was the small contributions of bake sales and parking lot carnivals that made such a difference. 
   Wal-Mart employs over 1,900 World War II veterans. They recognize the importance of constructing a memorial to salute the men and women who fought in the war as well as those who supported it from the home front. 
   I commend the efforts of those so dedicated to the memory of those who served in World War II, and I wish the World War II Memorial Campaign continued success as they work to meet the remainder of their $100 million goal.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about S. Con. Res. 116, a concurrent resolution introduced by Senator TRENT LOTT of Mississippi which commends Israel's redeployment from southern Lebanon. I should have been reflected as a cosponsor of that resolution but my name was inadvertently left off the list of cosponsors. I ask that I be shown as a cosponsor of S. Con. Res. 116. 
   Mr. President, I fully support the resolution and would like to offer my comments on the historic events that have recently transpired. Just yesterday, I met with a group of young students who were visiting Washington, DC, as part of a legislative conference sponsored by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. I was truly impressed by the level of interest and knowledge of these students. 
   One of the items we discussed was the need for the United States to provide support for Israel as it withdraws from southern Lebanon. I support the efforts of Prime Minister Barak to withdraw Israeli forces from southern Lebanon and echo the comments that it is time for all foreign military forces to leave Lebanon. Furthermore, the Governments of Syria and Iran must be held accountable for acts of terrorism committed in Lebanon. 
   Mr. President, Israel has demonstrated its commitment to the peace process and its commitment to comply with United Nations Security Council Resolution 425. It is now time for the United Nations and the international community in general to fulfill their obligations to the peace process and to ensure that southern Lebanon does not become a staging ground for attacks against Israel.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I wish to briefly continue the discussion started by Senator GRAMS from Minnesota. I commend him for his fine work on the issue of Social Security and moving forward on personal retirement accounts. 
   I also commend Gov. George W. Bush for his bold and, I think, prescient decision to move forward on the issue of personal retirement accounts for Social Security. This is the kind of leadership this country is looking for, someone who is going to tell the truth to the country, let them know what the decisions to be made are with the most important social program in this country, Social Security. 
   The Governor laid out very clearly the options before us: We can either raise taxes, we can cut benefits, or one can invest some of the current Social Security revenue stream into stocks and bonds. He came out and said: I am for investment. That is the way we are going to solve this problem and create opportunities for every working American, with every working American sharing a piece of the American dream, the free spirit of America. 
   I commend him for that, thank him for his leadership, and look forward to talking about this issue over the next several months to move this issue forward for America.

    Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to join Stefanou Chiropractic Centers in supporting the sixth annual Kids Day America/International event in Philadelphia on May 20, 2000. Stefanou Chiropractic is the official chiropractic office representing Kids Day America/International at the event, which will benefit the World Children's Wellness Foundation. 
   Kids Day America/International is a special day set aside to address health, safety and environmental issues. It was founded for the purpose of educating families and communities about important social concerns that affect us as individuals and as a community. 
   Our children represent the promise of a bright future, and we must uphold our obligation to nurture and protect them, providing them with the opportunity to learn, achieve, grow and succeed in a healthy and safe environment. Kids Day America/International is an opportunity to teach our children positive principles which will benefit them for a lifetime. 
   I would like to offer my best wishes to Stefanou Chiropractic Centers for a successful and educational event to be enjoyed by all. To honor this event, I put forward the following proclamation:  
   Whereas, the health and well-being of children is our responsibility; and 
   Whereas, the safety of our children is a significant concern for parents, community leaders and health care givers; and 
   Whereas, environmental welfare is of universal concern and deserves the utmost attention; and 
   Whereas, if started in childhood, proper health, safety and environmental habits can be maintained for a lifetime, producing a valued member of society, and enhancing our community; 
   Now, therefore, I urge my Senate colleagues to join me in proclaiming the 20th of May, 2000 as ``Kids Day America/International.''

    Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize May 12 as Chronic Fatigue and Immune Dysfunctions Syndrome [CFIDS] Awareness Day as well as the efforts of the Chronic Fatigue Syndrome [CFS] Association of the Lehigh Valley in fighting this disease. 
   CFIDS, also known as CFS, is a complex illness which effects multiple systems of the body. The syndrome is characterized by neurological, rheumatological, and immunological problems; incapacitating fatigue; and numerous other symptoms. Over 800,000 Americans of all ages, races, and socioeconomic classes suffer from this often debilitating disease. Tragically, persons with this syndrome can experience symptoms sufficient to deprive them of opportunity for gainful employment. 
   CFIDS is often misdiagnosed because it is frequently unrecognized and can resemble other disorders. Therefore, it is imperative that education and training of health professionals regarding CFIDS be expanded and that there be greater public awareness of this serious health problem. While there has been increased activity at the national, state, and local levels, and in private  research institutions, more must be done to support patients and their families. 
   The CFS Association of the Lehigh Valley works to encourage further research to conquer CFIDS and related disorders, and to inform and empower those affected by the disorder until a cure is found. The association, a member of the CFIDS Support Network of the CFIDS Association of America, is celebrating their eight year of service to the CFIDS community and has participated in May 12 activities since 1993. Moreover, the association has been awarded the CFIDS Support Network Action Award for ``Excellence in Service in the Area of CFIDS Awareness Day'' in 1996 and for ``Excellence in Commitment and Other Service to the CFIDS Community in the Area of Public Policy'' in 1995. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in commending the CFS Association of the Lehigh Valley for its efforts, and in recognizing May 12th as CFIDS Awareness Day.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, today we celebrate the National Day of Prayer, set aside as a day to humbly come before God, seeking His guidance for our leaders and His grace upon us as a people. I would like to take this occasion to implore my fellow Americans to remember why it is that prayer is so important for our nation. 
   Since the earliest days of America's heritage, we have been richly blessed by God. We have been granted liberty, prosperity, and a measure of peace unknown to most nations throughout history. Even during periods of hardship, God has given us strength to endure, and has used our tribulations to mold us into a better nation. 
   While we daily enjoy God's bountiful provisions, we need only look at our nation's history to realize that His blessing has not been granted to us by accident. America has been blessed as a result of our historic reliance upon Him. From the moment that Christopher Columbus first set foot in the New World until today, Americans have trusted God and sought to follow His direction. Columbus prayed to God for strength and guidance to help his companions endure the difficult voyage to the New World. Our founding fathers looked to God in prayer for wisdom to create a government that would ensure freedom and liberty. Through war and depression, America called out to God for strength and courage. In times of prosperity, we praised God for his many blessings. 
   God's blessing does not come without expectations, however. God commands us to obey Him and follow His laws. When calling for a day of national humiliation, fasting and prayer in 1863, President Abraham Lincoln admonished our nation in the following statement:  
   We have been the recipients of the choicest bounties of Heaven. We have been preserved these many years in peace and prosperity. We have grown in numbers, wealth and power as no other nation has ever grown. 
   But we have forgotten God. We have forgotten the gracious Hand which preserved us in peace, and multiplied and enriched and strengthened us; and we have vainly imagined, in the deceitfulness of our hearts, that all these blessings were produced by some superior wisdom and virtue of our own. 
   Intoxicated with unbroken success, we have become too self-sufficient to feel the necessity of redeeming and preserving grace, too proud to pray to the God that made us! 
   It behooves us then to humble ourselves before the offended Power, to confess our national sins and to pray for clemency and forgiveness.  
   Those words are as true today as they were when spoken by Abraham Lincoln many years ago. God has given us commands to follow so that we might be able to fully enjoy His creation and receive the benefit of His blessing. When our nation has turned our back on God's commands, we have been plagued by such tragedies as slavery, crime, drug abuse, and abortion. If our nation is to continue to be blessed by God, we must renew our commitment to God daily through prayer. 
   President Ronald Reagan designated the first Thursday in May to celebrate the National Day of Prayer. My challenge is to make every day a day of prayer, so that we might follow God's will and continue to receive His blessing into the 21st century and beyond.

    Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, as we prepare to celebrate National Nurses Week during the week of May 6 through May 12, 2000, I would like to give special recognition to the dedicated nurses who serve the largest healthcare system in the world, the Veterans Health Administration. I rise today to recognize our Veterans Administration nurses for the critical care which they have provided throughout our nation's history and continue to provide today. 
   The first VA nurses served the needs of veterans of the Spanish-American War and World War I. In the 1930's, the VA Nursing Service was created, and employed 2,500 registered nurses. Throughout World War II, Korea, Vietnam, and the Persian Gulf War, VA nurses continued the tradition of outstanding service to our nation's veterans. The number of VA nurses has grown substantially, and today the Veterans Health Administration employs 34,000 registered nurses and 26,000 licensed practical nurses and nursing assistants, serving an average of 25 million outpatients and 1 million inpatients annually. The VA Nursing Service maintains its tradition of excellence by encouraging nurses to pursue higher education, and was a forerunner in introducing advanced employment and educational policies. These trained professionals work in a nationwide system of VA health facilities located throughout the continental United States and its territories. 
   I have been privileged to personally witness the hard work and dedication of Veterans Administration nurses. From 1946 until 1985, my mother served as a VA nurse at several hospitals including Aspinwall Veterans Hospital in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Butler Veterans Hospital in Butler, PA. As Chief of Nursing for 32 years, my mother can attest to the commitment which is typical of VA nurses everywhere. During times of low funding and limited staffing, VA nurses worked harder than ever to care for the needs of their patients. While my experience on the Senate Armed Services Committee has served as affirmation of the dedication of Veterans Administration nurses, it pales in comparison to the hard work and sacrifice that I personally witnessed as the son of a VA nurse. 
   As we celebrate National Nurses Week, it is imperative that we remember those who have faithfully served and continue to care for our Nation's veterans.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to remind my fellow Americans of a horrific tragedy which occurred in Poland six decades ago. April 13 serves as a day of remembrance of this terrible massacre. 
   On September 1, 1939, Germany invaded Poland to begin World War II. Two weeks later, in accordance with the secret Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact, the Soviet Union invaded Poland from the East and completed the partition of this nation. The Soviet invasion lasted eleven days and resulted in the forced deportation of 1.5 million Poles to Russian labor camps. Of those 1.5 million, approximately 15,000 Polish military officers disappeared under mysterious circumstances. On June 22, 1941, tensions between Germany and the Soviet Union exploded as the German army stormed into Soviet territory. It would take nearly two years before the German army would uncover evidence relating to the 15,000 Polish officers who had disappeared in 1940. 
   In 1943, German forces near Smolensk, in western Russia, investigated reports they heard from Russian civilians to the effect that a large number of prisoners had been murdered by the Soviet secret police in the area nearly three years earlier. The German investigators were led by local Russians to a series of mounds in a wooded area about 10 miles west of Smolensk. On April 13, 1943, German officials made a gruesome discovery as they uncovered buried corpses. They found numerous victims, each with hands bound behind their backs and a bullet hole in the base of their skulls. Over the course of the next month, the Germans exhumed more than 4500 corpses. Unable to continue to dig through Katyn Forest, Germany requested the assistance of the International Red Cross and representatives of neutral countries to determine the circumstances surrounding the execution and burial of these 4500 Polish officers. 
   After examining the bodies, these representatives reported to the appropriate authorities their conclusion that the men buried in Katyn Forest were those of Polish military officers, along with a number of civilian cultural leaders, business leaders, and intellectuals--scientists, writers, and poets--who had been in the portion of Poland occupied by the Soviet Union in September 1939. The Soviet Union vehemently denied the allegations of responsibility. Once the Soviet Union had reclaimed Katyn Forest, a pro-Soviet investigation of the Katyn Forest Massacre determined that the Polish officers and leaders had been massacred by the German army. It would take another 45 years before the truth of the massacre would finally be acknowledged by the leaders of the Soviet Union. 
   Aside from United States congressional hearings held in Britain, Italy, Germany and the United States in the early 1950s, the Katyn Forest Massacre was largely forgotten by the international community. But the truth of Katyn Forest remained vivid for the Polish nation. Polish nationals were determined to discover the truth. These individuals wanted justice for the fallen comrades. 
   After the publication of an account of the Massacre by a Soviet historian in 1990, Polish President Wojciech Jaruzelski quickly arranged a series of meetings with Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and other Soviet officials in an attempt to finally bring a conclusion to the Katyn conspiracy. On April 13, 1990, the day after President Jaruzelski's final meeting with Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet news agency published a statement of acknowledgment on behalf of the Soviet government for summary execution of 15,000 Polish officers in the Katyn Forest during late April and early May of 1940. The statement claimed that the NKVD, the Soviet secret police, followed the orders of their chief, Lavrenti P. Beria, and massacred these 15,000 Polish captives. 
   We must never forget the crime against humanity which was carried out in this rural section of Poland. As our nation looks towards the 21st Century and the promising future, we must always remember the sacrifices of brave and gallant men in the defense of their nation and their heritage which have helping the world achieve greater freedom and democracy. April 13 should always be remembered not as a day in which hope briefly dimmed when these brave men were executed but a day in which freedom triumphed and shown brightly after decades of silence.

    Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, today, I rise to introduce legislation that would help people who ``telework'' or work from home, to receive a tax credit. Teleworkers are people who work a few days a week on-line from home by using computers and other information technology tools. Nearly 20 million Americans telework today, and according to experts, 40 percent of the nation's jobs are compatible with telework. At one national telecommunications company, nearly 25 percent of its workforce works from home at least one day a week. The company found positive results in the way of fewer days of sick leave, better retention, and higher productivity. 
   I am introducing the Telework Tax Incentive Act to provide a $500 tax credit for telework. The purpose of my legislation is to provide an incentive to encourage more employers to consider telework for their employees. Telework should be a regular part of the 21st century workplace. The best part of  telework is that it improves the quality of life for all. Telework also reduces traffic congestion and air pollution. It reduces gas consumption and our dependency on foreign oil. Telework is good for families--working parents have flexibility to meet everyday demands. Telework provides people with disabilities greater job opportunities. Telework helps fill our nation's labor market shortage. It can also be a good option for retirees choosing to work part-time. 
   Last fall, a task force on telework initiated by Governor James Gilmore of Virginia made a number of recommendations to increase and promote telework. One recommendation was to establish a tax credit toward the purchase and installation of electronic and computer equipment that allow an employee to telework. For example, the cost of a computer, fax machine, modem, phone, printer, software, copier, and other expenses necessary to enable telework could count toward a tax credit, provided the person worked at home a minimum number of days per year. 
   My legislation would provide a $500 tax credit ``for expenses paid or incurred under a teleworking arrangement for furnishings and electronic information equipment which are used to enable an individual to telework.'' An employee must telework a minimum of 75 days per year to qualify for the tax credit. Both the employer and employee are eligible for the tax credit, but the tax credit goes to whomever absorbs the expense for setting up the at-home worksite. 
   I am pleased to work with Congressman FRANK WOLF who has introduced identical legislation in the House of Representatives, H.R. 3819. A number of groups have already endorsed the Telework Tax Incentive Act including the International Telework Association and Council (ITAC), Covad Communications, National Town Builders Association, Litton Industries, Orbital Sciences Corporation, Consumer Electronic Association, Capnet, BTG Corporation, Electonic Industries Alliance, Telecommunications Industry Association, American Automobile Association Mid-Atlantic, Dimensions International Inc., Capunet, TManage, Science Applications International Corporation, AT&T, Northern Virginia Technology Council, Computer Associates Incorporated, and Dyn Corp. 
   On October 9, 1999, legislation which I introduced last year in coordination with Representative FRANK WOLF from Virginia was signed into law by the President as part of the annual Department of Transportation appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2000. S. 1521, the National Telecommuting and Air Quality Act, created a pilot program to study the feasibility of providing incentives for companies to allow their employees to telework in five major metropolitan areas including Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles. Houston and Chicago have been added as well. I am pleased that the Philadelphia Area Design Team has been progressing well with its responsibility of examining the application of these incentives to the greater Philadelphia metropolitan area. I am excited that this opportunity continues to help to get the word out about the benefits of telecommuting for many employees and employers. 
   Telecommuting improves air quality by reducing pollutants, provides employees and families flexibility, reduces traffic congestion, and increases productivity and retention rates for businesses while reducing their overhead costs. It's a growing opportunity and option which we should all include in our effort to maintain and improve quality of life issues in Pennsylvania and around the nation. According to statistics available from 1996, the Greater Philadelphia area ranked number 10 in the country for annual person-hours of delay due to traffic congestion. Because of this reality, all options including telecommuting should be pursued to address this challenge. 
   The 1999 Telework America National Telework Survey, conducted by Joan H. Pratt Associates, found that today's 19.6 million teleworkers typically work 9 days per month at home at home with an average of 3 hours per week during normal business hours. In this study, teleworkers or telecommuters are defined overall as employees or independent contractors who work at least one day per month at home. These research findings impact the bottom line for employers and employees. Teleworkers seek a blend of job-related and personal benefits to enable them to better handle their work and life responsibilities. For employers, savings just from less absenteeism and increased employee retention total more than $10,000 per teleworker per year. Thus an organization with 100 employees, 20 of whom telework, could potentially realize a savings of $200,000 annually, or more, when productivity gains are added. 
   Work is something you do, not someplace you go. There is nothing magical about strapping ourselves into a car and driving sometimes up to an hour and a half, arriving at a workplace and sitting before a computer, when we can access the same information from a computer in our homes. Wouldn't it be great if we could replace the evening rush hour commute with time spent with the family, or coaching little league or other important quality of life matters? 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to consider cosponsoring this legislation which promotes telework and helps encourage additional employee choices for the workplace.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, today, I rise in support of S. 2390, ``Project Exile: The Safe Streets and Neighborhoods Act of 2000'', which establishes a grant program to provide incentives for states to enact mandatory minimum sentences for certain firearms offenses. I commend Senator DEWINE for his leadership and appreciate the opportunity to join with him and other colleagues working together on this important legislation. The time has come to restore our commitment to aggressively prosecuting gun crimes around this country. In states and cities around the country where aggressive prosecution of gun crimes is coupled with tough prison sentences, violent crime has gone down. Tough law enforcement saves lives. 
   This legislation provides $100 million of additional resources over five years as incentives for efforts like Project Exile. To qualify for the grant program, states must have a mandatory minimum of 5 years without parole for convictions of violent crimes and serious drug trafficking offenses where a firearm is used during or in relation to the crime. In the alternative, the state can have a federal prosecution agreement which would refer those arrested for federal prosecution of the alleged gun crime in a collaborative effort between law enforcement. 
   Project Exile started in Richmond, Virginia as an attempt to reduce violent crime by aggressive enforcement of gun laws and improved law enforcement coordination. Since the program began in 1997, violent crimes involving handguns have decreased 65 percent and overall crime has been reduced by 35 percent. 385 guns were taken off of the street. In 1999, Project Exile was adopted statewide in Virginia. It has given prosecutors the ability to choose within which courts they will try offenders and created tougher penalties for people committing crimes with guns. 
   I have also worked to help expand this approach to Philadelphia in 1999, where ``Operation Cease Fire'' also adopts a zero tolerance policy for federal gun crimes. Project Exile has already proven that present laws can work if enforced properly. Federal, state, and local law enforcement and prosecutors work side by side to expedite prosecution of every federal firearms violation. In 1999, over 200 federal gun-related indictments were issued in Philadelphia and the surrounding counties. This is a 70 percent increase in indictments in only one year. 
   The bill authorizes $10 million in Fiscal Year (FY) 2001, $15 million in FY02, $20 million in FY03, $25 million in FY04, and $30 million in FY05. States must provide at least a 10 percent match and must also at least maintain current funding levels to qualify. Funds can be used for public awareness campaigns, law enforcement agencies,  prosecutors, courts, probation and correctional officers, case management, coordination of criminal history records, and the juvenile justice system. Representative BILL MCCOLLUM introduced similar legislation in the House of Representatives as H.R. 4051. This legislation passed the House yesterday by a 358-60 vote margin. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this important initiative to collaborate with local efforts to prosecute and prevent the criminal use of guns in our schools and neighborhoods.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, my amendment increases veterans' health care benefits by $500 million, which is what the Independent Budget, which is supported by a variety of veterans organizations, has come forward and said they need to provide adequate health care for our Nation's veterans. 
   I commend the chairman of the Budget Committee for increasing veterans' health care benefits by $1.4 billion, but that isn't enough to provide for the needs of our veterans population. 
   This is an important issue to keep the promise that we made to our veterans to provide adequate health care. It is also important for our military. What we need to do is to show the people in the service right now, who want to stay in the service and make careers out of the service, that we are going to keep our promises to them when they leave the service. This is an important amendment to provide adequate health care benefits for our veterans as well as to show our people in the current military that we are going to keep our promises. 
   I ask unanimous consent that Senator ABRAHAM be added as a cosponsor of the amendment.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to join with my colleague, Senator JUDD GREGG of New Hampshire, in introducing the Social Security Right to Know Act of 2000. 
   This legislation is aimed at providing the American people with accurate and up-to-date information about the current and future financial operations of the Social Security program, so that they may be in a better position to understand the choices involved in putting our most vital social program on sound financial footing for the long term. 
   I would like to commend the Senator from New Hampshire for his instrumental role in promoting a similar proposal in the form of an amendment to the Social Security earnings test repeal legislation that this body recently considered and passed. Unfortunately, we did not take advantage of Senator GREGG's tireless efforts to reach across party lines to incorporate improved reporting to the public about the Social Security program as part of the earnings test repeal. This legislation is a complement to Senator GREGG's prior efforts, and I am pleased to be offering this legislation here today with his support. 
   As Congress continues to consider options to preserve and strengthen our Social Security system, it is increasingly important that Americans have access to certain salient information with respect to Social Security's current and future financial picture. 
   Why is this so important? As all of my colleagues will recall, in his State of the Union Address to Congress on January 27, 1998, President Clinton declared that it was time for the nation to begin a dialogue on the ``necessary measures to strengthen the Social Security system for the twenty-first century.'' He went on to say that the American people should be invited to join in this discussion, facing these issues squarely, and forming a true consensus on how we should proceed. In his address, the president announced a series of public policy forums to be held around the country, and also called for a White House Conference on Social Security to be held in December, 1998. The president indicated that early in 1999 he would convene the leaders of Congress to craft historic legislation that would re-create ``a Social Security system that is strong in the twenty-first century.'' 
   I know that there was bipartisan support here in the Senate and in the House of Representatives for President Clinton's calling to make long-term Social Security reform our most important domestic policy priority. And two years ago I was optimistic about the prospects for enacting such historical legislation, particularly about the opportunity to engage the nation in an honest national discussion about the need to reform Social Security, and exchange ideas as to how we might best achieve this. But, as we all know, we held a national dialogue on Social Security, and the American people did participate in the policy forums which came to pass, and yet here we are today with little progress toward a bipartisan consensus on sustainable Social Security reform. 
   I believe that this is so partly because of the fact that there is a tremendous amount of misinformation and lack of understanding among the American public about Social Security's financing challenges, and this lack of understanding continues to harden popular resistance to long-term Social Security solutions. 
   Case in point: last week, we saw the release of the 2000 Annual Report of the Board of Trustees of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and Disability Insurance Trust Funds, popularly referred to as the Social Security Trustees' Report. The Social Security Administration 
   relayed that this Report revealed that the Social Security program's long-range financial picture has improved since last year. Specifically, the Board of Trustees announced  that the Social Security Trust Fund assets will not be depleted until 2037--three years later than reported in last year's report. 
   At first glance, this statistic might convey an air of reassurance to the public, such to the point in some minds that if we can just continue to grow our economy at its current rate, we will obviate the need for enacting fundamental reforms to Social Security. Or at least, such reporting of Social Security's finances might lead to the common conclusion that the program is perfectly fine for nearly 40 years. 
   This reliance on the paradigm of trust fund accounting is one of the main reasons that we have not been able to achieve bipartisan consensus on long-term Social Security reform. There is scarce mention in the Trustees' Report that the Social Security Trust Fund balances ``are available to finance future benefit payments . . . only in a bookkeeping sense. They do not consist of real economic assets that can be drawn down in the future to fund benefits. Instead, they are claims on the Treasury that, when redeemed, will have to be financed by raising taxes, borrowing from the public, or reducing benefits, or other expenditures. The existence of a large trust fund balance, therefore, does not have any impact on the Government's ability to pay benefits.'' 
   Mr. President, if this description of the Trust Funds sounds familiar, it is because this is the exact wording contained in the Administration's budget up until its most recent submission for Fiscal Year 2001. What this means, in other words, is that the trust funds are merely claims on future government revenues, IOUs to be redeemed through higher taxation, lower spending on Social Security or other government obligations, or a return to deficit financing. 
   I think that this is a rather important piece of information for the American people to understand in assessing Social Security's future. But it should not be buried in some multi-hundred page budget document or 223-page Social Security Trustees' Report. Maybe if we made this information more accessible and apparent, then we would have more concern for the fact that Social Security's financing problems begin as soon as 2015--when Social Security dedicated payroll tax receipts are no longer sufficient to pay benefits--and not in 2037. The Social Security Trustees last week revealed it will cost $11.3 trillion in new money between 2015 and 2037 to convert into cash benefits the IOUs held by the Social Security Trust Fund. But we have no actual resources necessary to meet these benefit promises between 2015 to 2037. 
   Also not mentioned in the most recent Trustees' Report, Mr. President, is the fact that the system's unfunded obligations actually grew from the 1999 Report's release by about $1 trillion in constant 2000 dollars, according to analysis by the House Budget Committee. This is because the change in valuation period adds a new, expensive, underfunded 75th year and drops a year when benefit costs are relatively cheaper. This is a paradox of pay-as-you-go financing that is not known or understood by most of the public, and is rarely if ever referenced in the media. To be sure, the unfunded obligations of the United States government are measured and accounted for in some obscure Department of Treasury publications, but this data should be at the front and center of the Social Security reform discussion, in plain view for every American to access. 
   Another information gap which the Social Security Right to Know Act seeks to close relates to individual Social Security statements, formerly known as Personal and Earnings and Benefits Statements (PEBES). This document was conceived by our friend and venerable 
   colleague, Senator DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN of New York. In 1989, Senator MOYNIHAN persuaded Congress to adopt the requirement for the Social Security Administration to provide this document as a way ``to reassure Americans that Social Security will be there for them,'' and to help them adequately plan for retirement by indicating that Social Security doesn't fully replace wages or salaries. 
   Though well intentioned, the current Social Security statement falls short of its desired goal by glaringly omitting certain information critical to understanding the system's serious future funding problems, and the related implications for individual and family retirement planning. To be fair, the statements do make reference to such bland phrases as ``changed in the past,'' ``must do so again'' and ``we are working to resolve.'' But the truth is that by 2037, the program will collect sufficient revenues to pay only $0.72 for every dollar of promised benefits. Overall, Social Security's deficit that year will come to more than $1 trillion in today's dollars. Again, this is important information that should be made abundantly clear in order for the American public to assess Social Security's and their own financial futures. 
   This is why this legislation is so important. For too long, the nature and scope of Social Security's financing problems have been shrouded by inconsistent and incomplete information, which has yielded public confusion and has polarized the Social Security reform debate. 
   The Social Security Right to Know Act would improve the information contained in current Social Security Administration publications, and thereby enable Americans to better plan for their own retirement and to understand the benefits and costs that the current Social Security system will produce. 
   This legislation will do several things to shed more light on what lies ahead for Social Security. First, it will expand the Personal and Earnings and Benefits Statements (PEBES), now called ``Social Security Statements,'' to include information about the projected date of the program's first financing deficits as estimated by the Social Security Trustees, and also the percentage of promised benefits that can be funded under current law. 
   Second, it will require the Trustees' Report to include an estimate of Social Security's aggregate unfunded obligations--i.e., the difference between the program's promised benefit outlays and its cash income over the long-range 75-year evaluation period--and the change in such amount from the previous year's estimates. 
   Third, it calls on the Trustees to submit to Congress a separate summary publication that highlights salient data pertaining to Social Security's financing, identifying the first year that Social Security is projected to run a cash deficit, as well as the size of projected deficits. 
   Fourth, it will expand the PEBES or Social Security Statements and the annual Social Security Trustees' Report to include an explanation of the role of the Social Security Trust Funds as debt owed by the federal government, as opposed to an asset of the federal government. 
   Fifth, it will broaden the public accessibility of the economic modeling employed by the Office of the Chief Actuary. 
   Our bill would introduce no new information that is not already acknowledged somewhere in past publications of the Social Security Trustees or in previous Presidential budget submissions. However, it is our view that the importance of this information is so great that it should be displayed before every wage-earner and beneficiary of the Social Security system, and not buried in documentation that is now available only to policymakers. 
   Americans deserve ``straight talk''--clear and accessible information--about Social Security's long-term financing challenges in order that they might better understand the consequences of a rapidly growing aging population, and the reality of the choices before us. This is just what the Social Security Right to Know Act is designed to provide. And with these objectives in mind, this legislation is long overdue. 
   I presume that we are all in agreement that the federal government should be telling Americans the full truth about Social Security. It is my sincere hope that our colleagues will look at this legislation and join us in building on Senator GREGG's prior efforts and other bipartisan ideas to make sure that Americans have as much information as possible in our national discussion on how best to save and strengthen Social Security. The Social Security Right to Know Act is an effort to continue a process, based on the principle that ``knowledge is power,'' and I truly believe that the information that this legislation is seeking to provide Americans in a clear and  concise manner is essential for our moving forward toward sustainable solutions to Social Security's funding problems. Though some of our colleagues may have ideas and input as to how best to provide the American public with a better understanding of Social Security's future--and I am open to working with my colleagues to improve this bill's specific provisions as we continue this process toward Social Security reform--it is my firm belief that with the intent and principles contained in this legislation, we as a nation will be in a better position to cease assessing Social Security's future in terms of preconceived, fixed notions, and take heed of the demographic and economic realities which lie ahead.

    Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise to join my friend and colleague, Senator JON KYL of Arizona, in introducing the Fair Care for the Uninsured Act of 2000, legislation aimed at ensuring that all Americans, regardless of income, have a basic level of resources to purchase health insurance. 
   As we all know, the growing ranks of uninsured Americans--currently 44 million and increasing at a rate of 100,000 per month--remains a major national problem that must be addressed as Congress considers improvements to our healthcare delivery system. The uninsured are three times as likely not to receive needed medical care, at least twice as more likely to need hospitalization for avoidable conditions like pneumonia and diabetes, and four times more likely to rely on an emergency room or have no regular source of care than Americans who are privately insured. 
   The Fair Care for the Uninsured Act represents a major step toward helping the uninsured obtain health coverage through the creation of a new tax credit for the purchase of private health insurance, a concept which enjoys bipartisan support. 
   This legislation directly addresses one of the main barriers which now inhibits access to health insurance for millions of Americans: discrimination in the tax code. Most Americans obtain health insurance through their place of work, and for good reason: workers receive their employer's contribution toward health insurance completely free from federal taxation (including payroll taxes). This is effectively a $120 billion per year federal subsidy for employer-provided health insurance. By contrast, individuals who purchase their own health insurance get virtually no tax relief. They must buy insurance with after-tax dollars, forcing many to earn twice as much income before taxes in order to purchase the same insurance. This hidden health tax penalty effectively punishes people who try to buy their insurance outside the workplace. 
   The Fair Care for the Uninsured Act would remedy this situation by creating a parallel system for working families who do not have access to health insurance through the workplace. Specifically, this legislation creates a refundable tax credit of $1,000 per adult and up to $3,000 per family (indexed for inflation), for the purchase of private health insurance; would be available to individuals and families who don't have access to coverage through the workplace or a federal government program; enables individuals to use their credit to shop for a basic plan that best suits their needs which would be portable from job to job; and allows individuals to buy more generous coverage with after-tax dollars. And of course the states could supplement the credit. 
   This legislation complements a bipartisan consensus which is emerging around this means for addressing the serious problem of uninsured Americans: Instead of creating new government entitlements to medical services, tax credits provide public financing to help uninsured Americans buy private health insurance. Representative DICK ARMEY has been a leader in this field for some time now, having introduced last year similar legislation in the House of Representatives. And just recently, Senators JEFFORDS and BREAUX introduced their own version of health insurance tax credit proposal here in the Senate. I applaud their efforts for advancing this important public policy initiative. 
   A tax credit for the purchase of insurance would make it possible for many more people to obtain insurance, thereby helping to lower the total cost of insurance. In reducing the amount of uncompensated care that is offset through cost shifting to private insurance plans, and in substantially increasing the insurance base, a health insurance tax credit will help relieve some of the spiraling costs of our health care delivery system. It would also encourage insurance companies to write policies geared to the size of the credit, thus offering more options and making it possible for low income families to obtain coverage without paying much more than the available credits.  
   It is time that we reduced the tax bias against families who do not have access to coverage through their place of work or existing government programs, and to encourage the creation of an effective market for family-selected and family-owned plans, where Americans have more choice and control over their health care dollars. The Fair Care for the Uninsured Act would create tax fairness where currently none exists by requiring that all Americans receive the same tax encouragement to purchase health insurance, regardless of employment. 
   It is my hope that my colleagues will join me in endorsing this approach to provide people who purchase health insurance on their own similar tax treatment as those who have access to insurance through their employer.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, Senator JOHN EDWARDS and I introduced S. 2293, the Deposit Insurance Fairness and Economic Opportunity Act. Also joining in this effort are Senators JESSE HELMS, FRANK MURKOWSKI, and KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON. 
   This bill is a continuation of an effort begun last year during consideration of S. 900, the now Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. I offered an amendment on the Senate floor regarding the annual obligation that banks and thrifts pay into their respective deposit insurance funds to retire the debt on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation (FICO) in the late 1980s. This annual assessment for banks and thrifts totals nearly $800 million. This money is used to support the federal deposit insurance system consisting of the Bank Insurance Fund [BIF] and the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF). 
   By law, banks and thrifts are required to contribute the equivalent of 1.25 percent of their deposits into the insurance funds for it to be considered capitalized. Presently, and for the last several years, these funds have met--and exceeded--that statutory requirement. For example, the SAIF steadily increased from 1.25 percent in 1996 to 1.45 percent in 1999. Similarly, the BIF rose from 1.34 percent in 1996 to 1.37 percent in 1999. 
   Over time, this situation has evolved where banks and thrifts are required to meet the annual obligation despite an overcapitalization of the insurance funds. In short, this is money that is leaving our communities that could be used for expanded lending in the areas of home buying, small business start-ups, and educational expenses. According to a former Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation [FDIC] Commissioner, every dollar available for capital can yield $10 in additional community lending. Therefore, it is projected that this bill could generate up to $8 billion in new loans each year. 
   To achieve the goals of requiring the banking community to meet their financial obligation to the funds; maintain the safety and soundness of the deposit insurance funds; and allow needed dollars to remain in our communities,  Senator EDWARDS and I have proposed the following in S. 2293: (1) Raise the designated reserve ratio of the deposit insurance funds from the current 1.25 percent of assets to 1.4 percent of assets. This will provide an enhanced buffer in the deposit insurance funds to ensure their continued safety and soundness; (2) Allow funds in excess of the 1.4 reserve ratio to be used to pay the annual FICO obligation; (3) Allow money to be returned to banks and thrifts on a pro-rata basis when the debt is retired on the FICO bonds in 2017. As mentioned before, the BIF and SAIF are overcapitalized, and continue to grow since the funds are invested in government bonds and generate investment income. The legislation specifies that only when both BIF and SAIF exceed the 1.4 reserve ratio can the excess be used to pay the annual assessment. 
   I believe the approach set out in S. 2293 is one of common sense. Congress required the two deposit insurance funds to be capitalized at a set level. The mandate was accepted and met by the bank and thrift industries, and growth in the fund has led them to exceed the original requirements. This legislation simply affirms that banks and thrifts must continue to meet their statutorily-required financial obligation, and if the deposit insurance funds are healthy and sound, then such excess dollars can be kept in their communities.

    Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to wholeheartedly support a resolution to designate May 25 as ``Day of Honor 2000,'' to recognize African American and other minorities who fought so valiantly during World War II. I would like to take this opportunity to encourage nationwide participation in this Day of Honor Observance. 
   African Americans and other minorities fought and died in World War II to protect the freedom and liberty that we so often take for granted. Too often during the war and in years since, these brave men and women were subjected to unfair discrimination and have never received the recognition they deserve. 
   In 1941, we lived in an era in which African Americans could not eat at a lunch room counter with others, or drink from the same water fountains. Yet, we felt no hesitation in asking these same Americans to fight for democracy. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I see firsthand the sacrifices that our men and women in the armed forces make to preserve America's freedom. How much harder must it have been to make these same sacrifices fifty years ago. We owe them more than we can ever repay, and for this reason I wholeheartedly support a resolution and encourage nationwide participation in recognizing those African Americans who helped to preserve the liberty that has made our country great. 
   Pittsburgh will be joining cities across the nation who will host a ``Day of Honor Observance'' on March 15, 2000, as part of the effort to recognize these citizens to whom we owe so much. I will be participating in this observance and I encourage you to join me in honoring those who put their lives on the line so that we might be free.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I come to the floor to stand in support of S. 2251, the crop insurance reform bill. I thank all of my colleagues on the Senate Agriculture Committee for the tremendous work they did in getting this bill to the floor. First and foremost, thanks goes to the chairman of the committee, Senator LUGAR, for his willingness to bring this issue up in a timely fashion, so we could get this legislation out of committee and to the floor to get some meaningful support for our Nation's farmers, particularly those farmers who are not participating in the current Crop Insurance Program. 
   Congress is reaching out to farmers, encouraging them to participate in the Crop Insurance Program to give them the kind of risk management tools they need to deal with the uncertainties of weather conditions, prices, et cetera, experienced in the past several years in agriculture. 
   I thank the chairman for his good-faith adherence to moving this bill in a prompt fashion. I thank in particular also Senator PAT ROBERTS of Kansas and Senator BOB KERREY of Nebraska for their incredible work with me as one of two Senators from the Northeastern part of the United States on the Agriculture Committee. They reached out to see what we could do in crafting a piece of legislation which would broaden the base of the Crop Insurance Program to include many areas of the country that have not participated in the old Crop Insurance Program, basically because it wasn't tailored to meet the needs of many regions of the country, particularly the Northeast. 
   Believe it or not, agriculture is the No. 1 industry in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Most people don't realize that, but we also have the largest rural population of any State in the country. Agriculture is very important to the way of life for the millions in Pennsylvania who do not live in Pittsburgh or Philadelphia, who live in between those two cities in the great rural areas of our commonwealth. 
   We have the third lowest participation rate in crop insurance in the country. We are anywhere from single digits to reaching a high of about 20 percent participation of our farmers. It is a very small rate of participation. We need to encourage our very diversified farmers to get into this program to provide a safety net for them in the event of drought, floods, or other problems they may encounter in producing their crops. 
   There is an opportunity for them now with this bill. With about a third of the money in this bill devoted to specialty crops, it is a real opportunity for our fruit growers and for our vegetable growers--truck farmers, we call them--folks who produce potatoes up in the great northwestern part of our commonwealth, and a variety of other producers, as well as nursery men and women. Those are the folks who now cannot get any kind of help or support. We have provisions included for them in pilot programs. There is a real opportunity for risk management tools that many farmers in our States have not had the opportunity to enjoy. 
   Special thanks, again, go to Senator ROBERTS and Senator KERREY. They come from the bread basket, Nebraska and Kansas. Frankly, they understand very well the issues of agriculture. To their credit, they understood that if we were going to move forward with agriculture policy under Freedom to Farm, we would have to make sure that all areas of the country had the kind of tools necessary to be able to farm successfully. This legislation will go a long way in providing government aid to an area of the farming country that has been left behind in the past. 
   I heard Senator ROBERTS and I thank him for his kind comments. Senator ROBERTS talked about the battle we had on the floor of the Senate last year with respect to the agricultural supplemental. 
   There was a record drought, a 100-year drought in Pennsylvania, which caused about $1 billion in crop losses. It was a frustration to me in that there was a very small part of that bill which was designated to help farmers who had suffered as a result of that nonprogram crop, former program crop farmers. We have a very small percentage of those in Pennsylvania. 
   As a result, a lot of the help in that bill was in the form of AMTA payments. A very small percentage of our farmers in Pennsylvania receive any AMTA payments. As a result, the bill was of minimal help to our farmers. We tried to include some things for dairy and livestock and some things for specialty crops, and we were successful--I thank the Senator from Mississippi for including that--but it highlighted the concern that many of us in the Northeast have with the direction of farm  policy in the Senate and in the Congress generally. 
   In this legislation, for the first time in quite some time, we have seen a nod to the Northeast, saying what goes on up there is not insignificant. Pennsylvania, for example, is the fourth largest dairy-producing State in the country. New York is the third largest dairy-producing State in the country. We have real production agriculture in many States in the Northeast and that production agriculture needs to have the same tools available to be able to survive through the difficult times as other areas of the country. We may not have the frequency of disasters as in other areas of the country, and I understand that and respect that, but it does not mean we should have any fewer tools to be able to deal with the vagaries of the marketplace or the vagaries of the weather. 
   This bill does that. It does it in a very fair way, reaching out to farmers who have not participated in the program in the past. It eliminates some of the hurdles and obstacles which have limited our access in the past and I think will create a much stronger backbone for agriculture in Pennsylvania which we desperately need. 
   Rural Pennsylvania is lagging behind economically from the rest of the Commonwealth. We have record employment rates in metropolitan areas, but, still, some rural counties in Pennsylvania have double-digit unemployment rates where the principal economy is either mining or agriculture. 
   These kinds of tools to support farmers who are the backbone of that economy are very important to keep these farms operating through very difficult weather disasters. It is very important to have these tools available to our farmers at an affordable rate and to provide real coverage for these losses, not as we have seen in the past. 
   I again thank Senator LUGAR and particularly Senator ROBERTS and Senator KERREY for their outstanding work on this legislation. I hope we can move on this bill rather quickly, get this passed, and move forward to join with the House in a conference that can result in a strong, bipartisan piece of legislation to be sent to the President. I am enthusiastic about the product we have on the floor and hope we can take care of that quickly. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, it is with an enormous amount of pride and respect that I rise in support of this bill. Senator SCHUMER from New York spoke on this matter earlier today. I strongly endorse and support his words of support for this resolution. 
   I stand with a tremendous amount of pride to speak in favor of my favorite son. John Cardinal O'Connor is a Philadelphian, someone who has left his mark not only on the country but on Pennsylvania, where he served as Bishop of Scranton--I see Senator BIDEN who is a Scrantonian--where he served a brief time--less than a year--but with distinction and, prior to that gave tremendous service to this country as a chaplain in the U.S. Navy, serving during the Korean conflict and during Vietnam. 
   He was appointed Chief of Chaplains of the Navy with the grade of rear admiral and served for over 25 years in the capacity of a chaplain in the military.  
   From that, he came into civilian life to Scranton, PA, and served there for less than a year until he was picked by Pope John Paul II to be the Archbishop of the Catholic Diocese of New York, and then shortly thereafter was elevated to the rank of cardinal in May of 1985. 
   He has served as Cardinal O'Connor in the Diocese of New York and, as the leader of the Diocese of New York, also as the titular head of the Catholic Church in this country. He has provided tremendous leadership on a variety of humanitarian and moral causes, always standing up for the weakest among us and shepherding his flock in an extraordinary way with great principle, dignity, and character. 
   It is sad that as we speak today, Cardinal O'Connor is suffering from cancer and is gravely ill. Senator SCHUMER and I worked very hard to make sure this Congressional Gold Medal would be awarded to Cardinal O'Connor so he could be aware of it during this very difficult time in his life and know that the Senate, the Congress, and certainly all of us in Washington extend our best wishes to him and want him to know how much we appreciate the tremendous outstanding service he has given to the Catholic Church and to the people in the United States of America. 
   Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New York for his heartfelt comments. 
   I want to relate a small personal story. I had an opportunity, with my wife Karen, to meet and talk with the cardinal a few years ago when we were in New York. I had never had a chance to meet him, and he was someone whom I respected very much and followed his leadership. I had wanted the opportunity to meet with him. 
   We went by his residence and were hoping for about 5 minutes. An hour later, after a wonderful discussion of issues that I was working on and that he was interested in, and things he was working on that I was interested in, he gave me a tremendous amount of encouragement for work in public service. 
   He understood the importance of public service in his work as a chaplain and, obviously, in his work as the Cardinal of New York. That was, indeed, public service, also. 
   Senator SCHUMER mentioned many things he did outside the archdiocese and work that reached out into the community. He gave me great encouragement to continue to work, to fulfill what Catholic social teaching is, to care particularly for the poor and the most vulnerable in our society. 
   He gave me a lot of inspiration. He gave my wife a lot of inspiration. For that I will always remember and always thank him, and for the blessing and the prayers that he gave me that night. 
   Senator SCHUMER said--and I said earlier--he is gravely ill right now. But I know, as he spends these last few days on Earth, that many of us who know him and admire him will long remember him. Certainly, the comment, ``Well done, my good and faithful servant,'' will apply to John Cardinal O'Connor.

    Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the safe return of Song Yongyi to his home and family in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. Mr. Song, Librarian at Dickinson College, was recently freed from a Chinese detention center after a detainment of 172 days. 
   Mr. Song was born on December 15, 1949 in Shanghai where he attended elementary and middle school. During the Chinese Cultural Revolution, his education was interrupted and Mr. Song became a dockworker. In 1971 he was detained and labeled a ``counter-revolutionary'' for organizing a book club with four other young people interested in discussing political ideas. Mr. Song spent five years in detention under harsh conditions, where he was severely beaten, resulting in permanent damage to his health. After the Cultural Revolution, he was completely exonerated of all criminal charges. 
   In 1977 Mr. Song was part of an elite group of students who entered university as a result of a competitive, nationwide examination. He graduated from Shanghai Normal University in 1981. He taught Chinese literature for Shanghai educational television until 1987, at which time he became a full-time literary critic and widely recognized researcher. Mr. Song moved to the United States in 1989 and enrolled in graduate school at the University of Colorado, where his wife Helen (Xiaohua) and daughter Michelle (Xiaoxiao) joined him in 1990. After obtaining a second masters degree in library information science from Indiana University, the Song family moved to Carlisle, Pennsylvania, where Song Yongyi is employed as Librarian at Dickinson College. 
   Mr. Song's deep interest in the 1966-1976 Cultural Revolution and growing prominence as an expert in the field led him to make research trips to China in the summers of 1998 and 1999. As part of his research, Mr. Song collected documents concerning the Cultural Revolution, which are widely available in markets and curio shops. It was during this most recent visit to China that state security officials detained Mr. and Mrs. Song in Beijing on August 7. For about one month, Yongyi and  Helen were held in a detention center in Beijing and interrogated. They were not allowed to see each other or communicate with the outside world. Later they were moved to a facility where conditions were less harsh and were finally permitted to speak with each other. Helen was released from custody on November 16 and allowed to return home to Carlisle, but Yongyi remained in detention. On December 24, Song Yongyi was arrested and charged with the ``purchase and illegal provision of intelligence to foreign people.'' 
   Mr. Song's arrest generated an outpouring of support from scholars in the United States and abroad, as well as from politicians. As of result of the vigorous campaign to secure Mr. Song's release, the Chinese government announced their decision to free Song Yongyi. 
   On behalf of the many Pennsylvanians who diligently kept the Song family in their thoughts and prayers, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations and warmest wishes on the safe return of Song Yongyi.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I want to pick up where the Senator from Illinois left off. I think he hit the nail on the head with respect to our concern with a provision in this bill which will create an additional moratorium for the organ allocation regulations to go into effect. 
   There will be a 90-day moratorium. Senator DURBIN, Senator SCHUMER, Senator MOYNIHAN, Senator SPECTER, and I, and many others have some grave concerns about its impact on thousands of people who are on transplant lists across this country and their ability to get organs in what may be the last few days of their lives. That is, unfortunately, what is going to occur. We are going to delay a system being put into place which would put a priority on the health status of the person on the transplant list as opposed to the residency status of where that person happens to be in the hospital. 
   It is a battle. It is an economic battle in many respects. And certainly, from some perspectives, I have transplant centers in my State that support these regulations; I have transplant centers in my State that oppose them. I look at it from the unbiased position of, what is in the best interest of the patient? For me, as Senator DURBIN just said, when 3 of the 11 people who will die today because organs are not available, when 3 of them needlessly die because we are transplanting organs that would otherwise go to them into people who are healthier and would not die but for the transplant, then we have something seriously wrong in this country. We have something seriously wrong when geography trumps patient need. That is what the current organ allocation system has. 
   Why has that occurred? This was a system that was put in place well over 10 years ago, when there were fewer transplant centers and when organs could not survive as long after being harvested. So geography did play an important role because the organ that was harvested had to be quickly transported to a hospital and implanted into the donee. That has changed. Now organs survive for around 4 hours, according to our transplant surgeon, Dr. FRIST, who lectured us on this a little  while ago. Now we have the ability to more broadly spread these organs out so we can reach sicker people. Yet the organ allocation system developed well over 10 years ago still focuses on geography. It may have been applicable at one time. It doesn't work anymore. People are dying as a result of it. 
   We have 4,000 people on transplant lists; 1,000 will die. 
   And it is incredible to me that those will die unnecessarily--4,000 will die and 1,000 will die unnecessarily--because of our regulations. 
   We have gone through a moratorium on these regs. I know this is a very controversial issue. It is a controversial issue because of economics. There is no controversy anymore as to what is in the best interest of patients. Last year, when Bob Livingston was able to get a year delay as chairman of the Appropriations Committee, we said, well, the medical evidence will sustain their position that geography is the best way to do this. So we asked for a study--the study of the Institute of Medicine--to determine the findings of a nonpartisan, nonbiased organization. Let me tell you what they came back with:  
   On the basis of the analysis of this report, it seems apparent that patients on liver transplant----  
   That is what they specifically looked at----  
   waiting lists will be better served by an allocation system that facilitates broader sharing within broader populations.  
   The Institute of Medicine says ``broader sharing,'' with geography being a lower priority factor in the decision. 
   This question was also put forward: Will more people die if we continue this system? 
   Again, the Institute of Medicine was very clear:  
   Increased sharing of organs would result in increasing transplantation rates for status 1 patients, the sickest patients, decreasing pre-transplantation mortality for sicker patients, which is status 2(b), and decreasing transplantation rates for status 3 patients, without increasing mortality.  
   That is the key. Yes, status 3, the healthier patients, will get fewer organs, but they won't die as a result of that. Yes, status 1 and 2(b) patients will get more transplantations and will live as a result of that, where they otherwise would die. 
   So it is clear, again, from the medical evidence the Institute of Medicine has put forward that a broader geographic sharing is the way to go. That is what these regulations dictate--that the sicker patients should get these before they die, not healthy patients who would otherwise live or would live for a long period of time without transplants. 
   The other issue you will hear brought up is that we need geography to be a big factor because it increases the availability of organs, that people want to donate organs in their community. The Institute of Medicine looked at this and found no convincing evidence to support the claim that broader sharing would adversely affect donation rates, or potential donors would decline to donate because an organ might be used outside the immediate geographic area. 
   I have an organ donor card. I am someone who, upon my demise, wants to be able to give organs to someone else so they might live. I don't care whether it goes to somebody in Pittsburgh, or in Chicago, or in Alabama, as long as it goes to the person who needs it the most. 
   That brings me to my final point, on which I think we can all agree. This debate is contentious, and the reason for that is, we don't have enough organs. So I just say that we can all agree that we need to do more to encourage organ donation. People are needlessly dying because people and families have trouble at that moment of death--I know how difficult that can be--making the decision to donate the organs of somebody who is brain dead to someone else who can live as a result of that donation. Hopefully, through this discussion, we can also work on how we can broaden the availability of organs so this contentious issue of regional transplant centers will be minimized in the future. 
   Mr. President, with that, I yield back the remainder of my time.

   Mr. SANTORUM. I wish to clarify the language in section 413 of H.R..1180 pertaining to the implementation of the Secretary of Health and Human Service's final rule on organ procurement and the transplantation printed in the Federal Register on October 20, 1999, specifically to ensure that this language allows, but does not require, the Secretary of HHS to revise this rule after the 90-day period beginning on the date of enactment of this act.

    Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I would like to call to your attention a special event which will be occurring in Wyndmoor, Pennsylvania on Thursday, November 18, 1999. La Salle College High School will be celebrating the 50th anniversary of their Father/Son Banquet, sponsored by the ``Men of La Salle,'' otherwise known as the Father's Club. 
   La Salle College High School is a private, independent Catholic college preparatory school for young men of varied backgrounds and abilities. La Salle is dedicated to providing a challenging and nurturing environment for learning, inspired by Saint John Baptist De La Salle, and seeks to empower each student to accept responsibility and achieve his fullest potential. La Salle is committed to Christian values, academic excellence, spiritual fulfillment, cultural enrichment, and physical development. The Lasallian experience prepares young men who are dedicated to leadership, achievement, and service to help build a society that is more human, more Christ-like, and more just. 
   The Father's Club has a long history of doing good for the La Salle College High School and its families. Much of the money raised by the Men of La Salle College High School and its families. Much of the money raised by the Men of La Salle, for example, goes to help students at La Salle who find themselves in financial difficulties as a result of the death of an employed parent. This scholarship fund makes it possible for students who go through a family tragedy to stay at La Salle, and helps to foster a family-like atmosphere. The Father's Club also contributes to the financial growth and stability of La Salle, and provides a wholesome social climate through its various events and activities. 
   Once again, I would like to congratulate La Salle College High School and the Men of La Salle for the 50th anniversary of their Father/Son banquet, and thank them for the great work which they are doing. They are a tribute to Pennsylvania and should be recognized as a model organization to be emulated.

    Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a genuine hero, who paid the ultimate price so that a loved one might live. 
   John Edward Giovannini, born in 1958, was an employee of US Airways and a member of the Pennsylvania Air National Guard, stationed in Harrisburg, PA. He served in the Marines from 1976 to 1980, and joined the Air National Guard in 1985. 
   On September 13, 1999, while vacationing with his girlfriend and her family in Ocean City, Maryland, John was faced with a fateful decision. While enjoying a relaxing day on the beach, the calm was suddenly shattered by desperate cries from Kim, the 21-year-old daughter of John's girlfriend. Kim was swimming in the ocean when a riptide threatened to carry her out to sea. Without concern for his own safety, John immediately swam out to reach Kim before the current could carry her away. Being an exceptionally strong swimmer, John was able to reach Kim despite the riptide, and began towing her toward the beach. Before reaching shore, John became overwhelmed with exhaustion from fighting the strong current. He continued to struggle toward shore, and when unable to swim any further, John fought with all his might to keep Kim above water as he cried out for help. Kim's grandmother, Deanna, swam out to the pair and successfully helped Kim back to shore. Meanwhile John's friend, Ron, came to his aid and pulled John the remaining distance to the beach. By the time John reached shore, he was completely incapacitated, having expended all of his energy in his effort to save Kim. The lifeguard and medical technicians were unable to revive John, and he died while being transported to the hospital. If not for John's quick actions and refusal to put his own life before Kim's, she would surely have been swept away. 
   Words can not begin to adequately describe the ultimate sacrifice John made on that fateful September day. His selfless courage is rarely demonstrated today apart from storybooks and movies. John Giovannini is truly an American hero, and as I extend my heartfelt condolences to John's loved ones for their tragic loss, I would also like to express my sincere admiration for the courage which John displayed throughout this tragic event.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to discuss the amendment offered by Senator DOMENICI, Senator ABRAHAM, and myself to raise the minimum wage. I cosponsored this proposal because I believe it represents a fair, sensible compromise. 
   In raising the minimum wage, it is imperative that we do not hurt the very people we are trying to help. Increasing the minimum wage always carries the risks of hindering job growth, cutting off opportunities for entry level workers, or displacing current workers. These risks are a real concern to me. In my view, any increase in the minimum wage must be accompanied by measures that will negate possible unintended negative effects on workers and businesses. 
   I believe the Domenici amendment offers a reasonable way to help workers and businesses by coupling the wage increase with tax relief that will help small businesses offset the additional costs. I would like to highlight a few of the ways this amendment creates a win-win situation for workers and small businesses. First, our amendment provides a one dollar increase in the minimum wage, which will be phased in incrementally over the next three years. Currently, the federal minimum wage is $5.15 per hour. Our amendment raises the minimum wage to $5.50 per hour in 2000, to $5.85 per hour in 2001, and to $6.15 per hour in 2002. It also includes reforms to expand pension coverage, particularly for employees of small businesses. These provisions enhance fairness for women, increase portability for plan participants, strengthen pension security and enforcement, and streamline regulatory requirements. Likewise, our proposal permanently extends the Work Opportunity Tax Credit, which gives employers an incentive to hire people receiving public assistance. This program helps people who have fallen on hard times to move back into the workplace. A section of our proposal that I am particularly proud of allows self-employed individuals to deduct 100 percent of their health insurance costs as early as next year. Under current law, hard working men and women must wait until 2003 before they can fully deduct their health insurance costs. This measure puts small business owners, farmers, and other hard working men and women struggling to get their businesses off the ground on a level playing field with large corporations, who already enjoy full deductions for healthcare. I have fought for this parity throughout my tenure in Congress, and I thank Senator DOMENICI for including it in this amendment. 
   Mr. President, our amendment is a compromise package. It is a good faith attempt to help low-income workers without penalizing their employers or causing unintended job displacement. We believe the tax relief and pension reforms in this bill will help small businesses and mitigate possible adverse effects of raising the minimum wage. 
   Once again, I thank Senator DOMENICI for his hard work on this amendment.

    Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, it is with great enthusiasm that I rise today to join my friend and colleague, the senior Senator from Connecticut, CHRISTOPHER DODD, in introducing the Lyme Disease Initiative of 1999. This legislation is aimed at waging a comprehensive fight against Lyme disease--America's most common tick-borne illness. 
   I know that Mr. DODD shares my sentiments in believing that this legislation could not be more timely or necessary. Lyme remains the 2nd fastest growing infectious disease in this country after AIDS. The number of annually reported cases of Lyme disease in the United States has increased about 25-fold since national surveillance began in 1982, and an average of approximately 12,500 cases annually were reported by states to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from 1993-1997. 
   Every summer, tens of thousands of Americans enjoying or working in the outdoors are bitten by ticks. While most will experience no medical problems, others are not so lucky--including the 16,801 Americans who contracted Lyme disease last year. 
   According to some estimates, Lyme disease costs our nation $1 billion to $2 billion in medical costs annually. The number of confirmed cases of Lyme disease in 1998 increased 31.2 percent from the previous year--and that is only the tip of the iceberg. Many experts believe the official statistics understate the true number of Lyme disease cases by as much as ten or twelve-fold, because Lyme disease can be so difficult to diagnose. 
   And Lyme is a disease that does not discriminate. Persons of all ages and both genders are equally susceptible, although among the highest attack rates are in children aged 0-14 years. 
   The Lyme Disease Initiative is a five year, $125 million blueprint for attacking the disease on all fronts. In addition to authorizing the necessary resources to wage this war, this legislation outlines a public health management plan to make the most of our efforts on all fronts to combat Lyme disease: 
   The Lyme Disease Initiative makes the development of better detection tests for Lyme disease the highest research priority; 
   The Lyme Disease Initiative sets goals for public health agencies, including a 33 percent reduction in Lyme disease within five years of enactment in the ten states with the highest rates; 
   The Lyme Disease Initiative fosters better coordination between the scattered Lyme disease programs within the federal government through a five year, joint-agency plan of action; 
   The Lyme Disease Initiative helps protect workers and visitors at federally-owned lands in endemic areas through a system of periodic, standardized, and publicly accessible Lyme disease risk assessments; 
   The Lyme Disease Initiative requires a review of current Lyme disease prevention and surveillance efforts to search for areas of improvement; 
   The Lyme Disease Initiative fosters additional research into other related tick-borne illnesses so that the problem of co-infection can be addressed; 
   The Lyme Disease Initiative initiates a plan to boost public and physician understanding about Lyme disease; 
   The Lyme Disease Initiative creates a Lyme Disease Task Force to provide Americans with the opportunity to hold our public health officials accountable as they accomplish these tasks. 
   This legislation is the product of countless meetings that Senator DODD and I have had with patients and families struggling to cope with this debilitating disease. Although Lyme disease can be treated successfully in the early stages with antibiotics, sadly, the lack of physician knowledge about Lyme disease and the inadequacies of existing laboratory detection tests compound the physical suffering, which can include damage to the nervous system, skin, and joints and other significant health complications where patients go undetected, and hence untreated. Patients relate heart breaking stories about visiting multiple doctors without getting an accurate diagnosis, undergoing unnecessary tests while getting progressively weaker and sicker --and racking massive medical bills in the process. 
   Although Lyme disease poses many challenges, they are challenges the medical research community is well equipped to meet. This legislation will enhance efforts to discover new information on and establish treatment protocols for Lyme disease. Thanks to the scientific research being conducted here in the United States and around the world, new and promising research is already accumulating at a rapid pace. We have a unique opportunity to help re-build the shattered lives of Lyme victims and their families, and I look forward to working with Senator DODD, my colleagues, and the administration to accomplish this worthy public health goal.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New York for his amendment dealing with disclosure--as the Senator from New York talked about in his remarks--on credit card solicitations, as to what the real interest rate is that is going to be involved and all the other information that is necessary for consumers to make intelligent decisions as to whether to contract with a credit card company. 
   All of us get solicitations--I do every day--in the mail offering outrageously low rates of interest. I have looked through them and it is very difficult, even for somebody who is somewhat sophisticated in looking at this information, to find what the true interest rate is and the true terms of the credit card for which you may be signing up. 
   What the amendment of the Senator from New York does is put it in an obvious place, in clear and bold type, in a box, in a format that people are used to using, as a result of his legislation from a few years ago with respect to credit card statements. This would make it applicable to applications and to solicitations. I think it is a constructive amendment, a disclosure-oriented amendment. It is not something I think is unduly burdensome and it can be helpful to everybody, not just seniors and the others who may have difficulty reading the small print and understanding very complex legal documents but also the average consumer who wants to be able to make intelligent decisions. And what we are looking at in this bill is the failures as a result of credit card overpayments, as a result of decreased savings rates. This is the kind of commonsense type of thing we ought to be supporting.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues and the American people to carefully consider one of the most pressing public health issues which faces America, an issue about which far too few people are aware and which is ever so obliquely tucked into the many pages of the appropriations measure we are about to consider. 
   This issue has to do with the workings of our national organ transplantation and allocation system and by extension the lives of hundreds of Americans whose lives hang in the balance. 
   Ideally, our national organ transplantation and allocation system--which at its core is about saving lives--would be governed according to standard medical criteria whereby donated organs go to those who need them most. Sadly, though, this is not the case. Our current organ allocation system has evolved into a needlessly contentious debate where fragile life-and-death decisions are being reduced to economic--and many times geographic--factors. 
   If you are an American citizen who needs a liver transplant to survive, and you reside in Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, New York or Pennsylvania, you have much less chance of receiving a transplant than someone else with a similar level of illness who lives in another part of the country. That is the conclusion of the latest patient outcome data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). 
   Despite enhanced capacities to keep organs viable for longer periods of time and to make them available to those who would benefit most, many regional transplant centers are still attempting to keep donated organs in their own geographic area. These ``organ hoarding'' policies and practices contribute to the deaths of thousands of Americans whose lives could otherwise be saved. 
   Consider: While an estimated 62,000 potential recipients are waiting their turn to receive organs, only 20,000 transplants take place in a given year. More than 4,000 Americans die each year--at least 11 per day--while awaiting organ transplants. Of those, it is estimated that 1,000 Americans--more than 3 each day--might have been saved if the system operated more fairly. 
   Last year, HHS issued new regulations designed to reduce these inequities. The 1998 Final Rule contained provisions to make the national organ transplant system more fair. Its goal was to ensure that the allocation of scarce organs is based on medical criteria determined by physicians, and not on geography. But a rider to the 1998 omnibus spending bill delayed implementation of the regulations for a year--and required the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to study the impact of the Final Rule. 
   Whereas I opposed the moratorium that Congress passed just over one year ago because I was convinced that the HHS rule was in the best interest of patients, many of my colleagues ignored previous studies by the Office of the Inspector General and the General Accounting Office, among others, and were swayed by the rhetoric of this very emotional debate when they supported this one-year moratorium. Proponents of the moratorium then argued that we did not have sufficient evidence to conclude that the current system has inequities. So innocent transplant candidates had to wait at least another year for a sensible policy of broader organ sharing. 
   Yet, ironically, some of my colleagues' action of endorsing a moratorium reflected a bit of wisdom. If not for the provision in the Omnibus Appropriations bill of 1998 which called on the IOM to study these issues, we would not have such clear evidence in support of the rule, evidence that is void of partisan or special interest input. By its very nature, the IOM was able to distance itself from the pronouncements of those with vested interests and to undertake an academic, evidence-based review of the issues. To question the integrity of the report is to question the integrity of the Institute of Medicine, of our nation's greatest minds, and of the scientific process itself. 
   As charged by Congress, the IOM released its report on June 20, 1999. And the results were a vindication for patients everywhere and irrefutably argue for pressing forward with the HHS Final Rule with its call for broader organ sharing. The IOM report has five noteworthy highlights. 
   The first is waiting times. The IOM concludes that waiting time for liver transplantation is an issue only for the most critically ill patients. For patients who are less acutely ill, waiting time is not an appropriate criterion in deciding about the allocation of donor organs. The IOM suggests that equitable access to transplantation would be best facilitated by development of a system with objective criteria that reflect medical need. 
   The second is larger Organ Allocation Areas. The HHS Final Rule places priority on sharing organs as broadly as possible, within limits dictated by science and technology. The IOM report concurs with this approach, and specifically recommends establishing Organ Allocation Areas (OAAs) for livers. The IOM suggests that OAAs serving at least nine million people each would significantly promote equity in  access to transplantation, and be feasible with current technology. 
   The third is federal oversight. The IOM report recommends that HHS continue to exercise the legitimate oversight responsibilities assigned to it by the National Organ Transplant Act. The report further notes that strong federal oversight is necessary and appropriate to manage the system of organ procurement and transplantation most effectively in the public interest. The report also recommends the establishment of an Independent Scientific Review Board to assist the Secretary in these efforts. 
   The fourth is data collection and dissemination. The IOM report finds that current data are inadequate to monitor some aspects of the organ transplantation program. They suggest that the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network contractor should improve data collection, and make standardized and useful data available to independent investigators and scientific reviewers in a timely fashion. 
   The fifth is effects on organ donation and small transplantation centers. The IOM was also asked to consider whether the requirements in the Final Rule would decrease organ donation, or cause harm to small organ transplantation centers. It found no evidence to suggest that either of these concerns would be realized. The IOM concurs that changes in the organ transplantation system--along the lines proposed by the Secretary--would improve fair access to lifesaving transplantation services. 
   Mr. President, 20 years ago retaining local allocation of organs was a sensible policy because organ viability--the window of opportunity during which an organ can be successfully 
   transplanted--was not very long. But over the past two decades, the scientific knowledge and techniques for the retrieval, preservation and transplantation of donated organs have improved tremendously and have led to the development of organ transplantation as a means to save lives. These recent advances in science and technology now permit broader sharing of organs, with more focus on medical necessity and less restriction by geography as criteria for organ allocation. And yet, despite these enhanced capacities to keep organs viable for longer periods of time and to make them available to patients in parts of the country far from where those organs first may have been retrieved, many small regional transplant centers incredibly still fight to keep donated organs in their own geographic area. 
   The Final Rule reflects ongoing commitment by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), which I share with many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, to maintain the most equitable and advanced transplantation system and to reform the anachronistic allocation system which is needlessly costing lives. 
   The basic principles that underlie the 1998 Final Rule were supported by the conclusions of the IOM study. In late October of this year, HHS released a revised Final Rule, incorporating information and suggestions from the IOM and from the transplant community. This revised Final Rule is the culmination of the IOM study, four Congressional hearings, public hearings and consultations conducted by HHS, and nearly five years of public comment. 
   Today, proponents of the status-quo system of rank inequities have managed to include in this bill language which calls for yet another moratorium. They now say that any new regulations must be developed only after the National Organ Transplantation Act (NOTA) is reauthorized. This is an interesting change of argumentation now that the facts, as contained in the IOM report and other publications, have been publicized about how the current system in fact does not operate in the public's interest. 
   Whereas I certainly look forward to working with my colleagues to reauthorize NOTA, and most especially to the opportunity to develop a clear mandate and strategies for increasing organ donation, plans for future NOTA reauthorization should not be used as an excuse to perpetuate the current inequitable system which the Final Rule seeks to remedy. Additionally, the current NOTA statute does provide the Secretary with the necessary authority to immediately address the needs of those who are dying every day because of inequities in the system. 
   Currently, NOTA mandates that HHS and the transplant community share responsibility to govern the organ transplantation and allocation system. The he underlying principle on which Congress enacted NOTA back in 1984 to better coordinate the use of donated organs and to address the concern that the sickest patients receive priority for organ transplantation. As a result of this law, the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) was established. As you know, the OPTN's membership is comprised of organ procurement organizations and hospitals with transplant facilities. The primary function of the OPTN is to maintain both a national computerized list of patients waiting for transplantation and a 24-hour-a-day computerized organ placement center, which matches donors and recipients. Currently, the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), a private entity, holds the federal contract for the OPTN and establishes organ allocation policy. 
   I would like to assure my colleagues that under the revised Final Rule, development of the medical and allocation policies of the OPTN remain the responsibility of transplant professionals, in cooperation with the centers, patients and donor families represented on the OPTN board. Most importantly, in the revised Final Rule, HHS provides for the public accountability that is necessary for a national program on which so many lives depend. 
   The HHS regulations for broader organ sharing have been the subject of rigorous debate in Congress, within the transplant community, and on the pages and airwaves of the local and national media. While constructive discourse is the root of our democracy, what has concerned me over the past couple of years is that deceit and fear have characterized this particular debate. Even for those who are extremely close to these issues, it has become more and more difficult to distinguish the true facts. Indeed, this is the very reason that Congress stipulated the Institute of Medicine study this issue. 
   My greatest concern is for the lives of worthy, innocent transplant candidates which hang in the balance each day, each hour, each minute that we delay moving forward with these regulations. Please make every consideration to expedite the process so that the transplant community can move forward to improve the system so that more lives can be saved. 
   As my colleagues may know, the federal Task Force on Organ Transplantation (formed in 1986), in a critical decision, established that donated organs belong to the community, and it identified that community as a national one. Consistent with this decision, the new HHS regulations identify donated organs as a precious national, not local or regional, resource--thus helping to elicit what James Childress, a medical ethicist who served on the transplant task force, calls ``communal altruism'' or public commitment to organ donation. Childress, an authority on the subject of organ donation, states in a 1989 edition of the Journal of Health Politics, Policy and Law, ``Donations of organs cannot be expected unless there is public confidence in the justice of the system of organ distribution.'' 
   In order to maintain an effective system for the allocation of life-saving organs, we must first ensure that we have an adequate supply of those organs. An adequate supply relies on public generosity and commitment, which, in turn, relies on the public perception that the system for organ allocation is both publicly accountable and fair. 
   The HHS regulations have prompted debate in large part because they would change the allocation system from a local/regional one to one of broader organ sharing. They would allocate organs to the most medically urgent patients first, rather than to those residing in the same geographic area as where the organ was donated. And I emphasize, that while the HHS regulations call for a national system, they do not call for a national allocation system. They leave the specific policy decisions in the hands of the transplant community. 
   I have registered as an organ donor; when I die, I do not care whether or not my organs go to a resident of Pittsburgh; I hope they go to the person who needs them the most. The majority of Americans share my sentiments. According to the results of a Gallup public opinion survey released this past  June, most Americans--83 percent--want donated organs to go to the sickest patients first, regardless of where they live. 
   Not only do the HHS guidelines meet standards of effectiveness, in part, by helping to ensure broad public commitment to organ donation, they also meet the related standard of equity. By creating a process designed to lead to a broader geographic sharing of organs, these proposed regulations equalize waiting times among transplant centers, thus also--and effectively--save more lives. CONSAD Research Corporation has already identified a number of alternative policies that would equalize waiting times and save more lives. 
   The HHS regulations further require standardized medical criteria to be used when placing patients on the national waiting list and determining their priority among all patients needing organ transplants throughout the United States. They therefore call for equitable organ allocation throughout the country to ensure that the most medically urgent patients, within reasonable medical parameters, have first access to organs. 
   We know that there currently exists enormous disparity in waiting times for organ transplantation from region to region in the United States.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, these disparities were first brought into sharp focus in the 1997 Report of the OPTN: Waiting List Activity and Donor Procurement, and now even more so in this recently released HHS data. Why the median liver transplantation rate during one year for ``listed'' candidates in Chicago would be 23% and 83% in Milwaukee is unconscionable. Equally disturbing is that a patient of blood type ``O'' would have a median waiting time of 721 days in western Pennsylvania and just 46 days in Iowa. 
   As we can see from the facts under the current allocation system, often a critically ill patient in one region can go without a life-saving organ while a healthier patient in another region--one with a larger supply of organs--can be treated as a priority. 
   In meeting this standard of equity, the HHS regulations can help to prevent what has become an alarming and extremely parochial trend--that of states passing ``local first'' laws or resolutions. Kentucky, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Wisconsin, Arizona and Texas have either passed laws or resolutions or have proposed such laws that strive to keep organs in their respective states, while not necessarily allocating these organs to state residents. 
   This is a critical distinction: Patients often travel from other states for the high-quality care offered by large transplant centers, which generate considerable revenue. When states seek to retain organs in this manner, they are serving economic self-interest, not patient interest. And what of the patients who reside in states with no liver or heart transplant program? These patients, including those with Medicaid and Medicare, must travel to other states, where the access to organs and the waiting times can vary significantly. 
   The new HHS guidelines would better meet procedural and substantive standards of justice than does current policy. They would encourage more public participation in the policy making process and, therefore, more accountability, and they would equalize the treatment of medically similar cases. 
   In developing policies for the life-and-death issue of organ allocation, we should rise to broadly accepted standards of justice rather than acquiesce to narrowly defined regional interests. 
   Arthur L. Caplan of the University of Pennsylvania Center for Bioethics and Peter Ubel of the Philadelphia Veterans Affairs Medical Center wrote in The New England Journal of Medicare on Oct. 29, 1998, ``We believe that the United States should end policies that permit geographic inequities and move quickly to determine the best use of data on the efficacy of outcomes to create a more equitable national system of distribution.'' 
   Because I believe that any organ allocation system should be defined by, and accommodate, the moral principles of effectiveness and equity, I strongly support the proposed change to a national allocation system as outlined in the Department of Health and Human Services revised regulation. I firmly believe that the Secretary needs to exercise her authority so that a more equitable system based on uniform medical criteria can immediately move forward. Again, I will repeat for my colleagues that plans for future NOTA reauthorization should not be used as an excuse for delay while innocent Americans are needlessly dying. Further delay prevents more needy transplant candidates from receiving vital, life-saving organs. 
   Now, I realize that this body will likely adopt this conference report, despite its containing this controversial language for another moratorium. But let us bear in mind that the President has vowed to veto this legislation over this issue and other spending priorities contained herein. 
   Thus, it is not too late. When our leaders reconvene to negotiate budget priorities with the administration, I urge my colleagues to oppose another moratorium, and join me in ending a system that unfairly deprives patients of access to life-saving organ transplantation, and allow the regulations to go forward. This is an issue which transcends politics.

   Mr. SANTORUM. 
   Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation in response to the lack of progress in negotiations between the United States and the United Kingdom to open up competition through an open-skies treaty for air travel between our countries. International aviation travel is central to the continued growth of commerce and tourism, and every effort must be made to increase these opportunities. 
   This bill mandates that the United States and the United Kingdom come to an agreement that would grant all applications U.S. carriers currently have filed with the U.S. Department of Transportation for route access to the United Kingdom. The bill also mandates more access to London's Heathrow International Airport for U.S. carriers that do not currently have access to this airport. Congressman BUD SHUSTER, Chairman of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, has already introduced an identical bill, H.R. 3072, with the Ranking Minority Member, Congressman JAMES OBERSTAR, in the House of Representatives. 
   Under the current 22 year old bilateral agreement, known as Bermuda II, only two U.S. airlines, American and United, and two from Great Britain, British Airways and Virgin Atlantic, can fly between Heathrow and the United States. Under the current agreement, the British hold dominant rights to air travel between our countries in one of the most restrictive existing bilateral agreements for air travel. For example, British Airways is allowed to fly more routes to the U.S. than all U.S. carriers can fly to the United Kingdom combined. This present policy is unfair and is not in the best interests of American or British consumers. 
   This situation is illustrated by the recent announcement by British Airways that it would be ending its nonstop flights between Pittsburgh and London as of October 31, 1999. This means that a city which has had nonstop for over a decade will no longer have it. Under the current restrictive agreement, only the British can fly to and from Pittsburgh; American carriers willing to pick up this route are unable to do so. 
   The United States has open-skies agreements with over 36 countries which have been completed or are being phased in. Open-skies agreements allow a free market in air service in which airlines can fly where they want. It is inappropriate for the United States to lack a similar agreement with an historic ally and major trading partner such as the United Kingdom. 
   If an agreement is not reached within six months of the bill's passage, the Secretary of Transportation is required to revoke all current slots and slot exemptions held by British air carriers at Chicago O'Hare and New York Kennedy airports. In addition, if the United States and the United Kingdom do not reach an open-skies agreement by the end of 2000, the bill mandates renunciation of the current bilateral agreement. My goal is to provide a strong incentive for our two countries to negotiate a fair, long overdue agreement by increasing competition and choices for consumers and all interested carriers in both countries.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, let me respond to the comments of the Senator from California, Mrs. BOXER, about the constitutionality. The central point is that most of the cases have focused around the definition. I think she accurately described the concern some of the courts have, and the issue on vagueness, and that this procedure being outlined, partial-birth abortion, is not adequately defined so as not to outlaw other abortions at that time. 
   The interesting part of the argument is that you presume with the argument that it outlaws more than this. I think you can make the logical assumption that the courts might accurately only include this procedure, and that it would be constitutional, but what makes it unconstitutional is that it applies to more than this procedure. 
   In a sense, arguing for the unconstitutionality of this, if we were able to better define what a partial-birth abortion is in this legislation, we would make it clear that it does not ban any other type of abortion. Then the presumption I hear from the Court's own reasoning is that it would be constitutional. I think we need to look at that very carefully. 
   In a sense, in making their argument, they leave open the possibility that banning a particular procedure--as long as it doesn't ban all procedures or more than one procedure--the courts would be receptive to the constitutionality of such a piece of legislation. We are working right now with other Members to see if we can come up with a better definition, a more clear definition, one which would clearly pass constitutional muster with respect to vagueness. 
   I am encouraged. I think it is helpful that the Senator from California put the reasoning in the RECORD, because I think the reasoning clearly points to the fact the procedure itself could, in fact, be banned under Roe v. Wade. But the fact that the procedure is being defined in such a vague manner as to include other procedures is the reason they are finding it unconstitutional. 
   I think it creates an opportunity for us to craft in the eyes of the courts that have reviewed this to date a constitutional piece of legislation that does not create an undue burden on women because it only bans one particular procedure and not others. I see this as an opportunity. 
   I thank the Senator from California for laying that out. I think that is an important point of debate. We will get to that later in this debate as we get down to the end when we provide what I hope to be some technical amendments to correct this problem. 
   I find it interesting--I talked about it yesterday--what we are talking about now is Roe v. Wade. While I and others have stood up here time and time again and have said this is not about Roe v. Wade, one of the reasons we are bringing this bill to the floor is because we believe this is outside of the scope of Roe v. Wade's restrictions on Congress' right to limit abortion. I can go through the long list of that. 
   One, obviously, is the Texas Roe v. Wade case itself. It was brought before the Supreme Court. In that decision, part of the appeal was to strike a Texas law that prohibited killing a child in the process of being born. It is a Texas statute that was under review by the Supreme Court in the Roe v. Wade decision. The Supreme Court let stand the Texas law that prohibited the killing of a child in the process of being born. 
   That is exactly what we are attempting to prohibit in the partial-birth abortion amendment. 
   To make the argument we are trampling on Roe v. Wade with this bill, when the case itself upheld a law that said you couldn't do that, in other words, kill a child in the process of being born, I think is stretching Roe v. Wade far beyond its own face of what it actually did. 
   Again, it is a distortion that is not surprising. I understand why if you don't think you have the arguments on the merits you try to change the subject. That is what this vote is about today. It changes the subject. They want to turn this into a debate on abortion. This is not a debate on abortion. This is a debate on infanticide. This is why people on both sides of the abortion issue in both Chambers support this ban--because it is less about abortion and very much about infanticide. 
   I am not going to say much about the underlying amendment we are talking about--the Harkin amendment--but have a couple of comments about Roe v. Wade. You hear so much about first trimester, second trimester, third trimester, the State has an interest, and the State can do this. 
   I remind you that Senators who are talking about these restrictions and about the second- and third-trimester have never in their lives voted for any of those restrictions. Roe v. Wade is the law of the land today. For all the rhetoric that is around, it is there. You can have an abortion at any time, anywhere, and any place as long as you can find an abortionist to do it. Period. There are no restrictions. In reality, there are no restrictions. All you have to do is find an abortionist who will say the health of the mother is at stake and you can have an abortion. 
   I had a chart up here yesterday. We can get it. I will put it back up. Warren Hern wrote the definitive textbook on abortion and said, I will certify that with every pregnancy there is a risk of grievous serious physical health to the mother; injury to the mother. 
   What you have is, in fact, no restriction. In fact, that is what occurs today. There are no limits on abortion in America. That is why one in four children conceived in America die through abortion. One in four. One in four. 
   So your chances of surviving in the womb are 75 percent once you are conceived. Once you are born, your chances of surviving the first 5 years are 99.9 percent. If you can make it through to be born, you are probably going to be OK. But the biggest risk to children's health in America is abortion. 
   Roe v. Wade promised a lot of things. When people came up and argued about Roe v. Wade, they promised a lot of wonderful things would happen to women and to women's health and to children and to child abuse. The promises were made. Look at the debate. 
   There would be a reduction in child abuse because there would be less unwanted pregnancies. I don't think we have to look up a whole lot of record to see that child abuse has not been reduced since Roe v. Wade. In fact, it is over double since Roe v. Wade. 
   There would be a reduction in divorce. I don't think that needs any comment. Obviously, it did not happen. 
   There would be a reduction in spousal abuse. Obviously, that did not happen. 
   We would lower poverty among children. Obviously, that did not happen--all the promises that this would be a better world if we just got rid of these children who weren't wanted, that life would be better. 
   What we found as a result of Roe v. Wade is a desensitizing of our appreciation for life, and all the promises have turned into disasters. Now we are faced with a world where we have reached the point in America that a child who is 3 inches away from being protected by Roe v. Wade, being protected by the Constitution can be executed--executed, brutally executed by a partial-birth abortion. 
   The reason this is an issue I feel so passionately about is not because I believe we will reduce the number of abortions in America. We will not. I will say that categorically. This bill will probably not reduce the number of abortions in America with its passage. Hopefully, in the debate we will touch some hearts but in its passage we will not. 
   This is not an attempt to infringe on a woman's right. This is not an attempt to change or overturn Roe v. Wade. That is why I reject the Senator's amendment as irrelevant. 
   This bill attempts to draw a bright line between what is and is not protected. At least we should be able to draw the line so when a child is in the process of being born, it is too late to have an abortion. It is too late. 
   I asked the Senator from California this question: You allow an abortion if  the child's head is inside the mother? You can then kill the baby? I said: What if the baby came out head first and the child's foot was inside the mother. Would you still be allowed to kill the baby? She said: Absolutely not. 
   A pretty clear line, isn't it, depending on which way the baby is born as to whether you can kill the baby. We get to the slippery slope, and this is what concerns me for our culture--if we can kill a baby that is moving, one can see the baby, the abortionist is holding the baby in his or her hands, the baby is moving, and then they take a pair of scissors at the base of the skull and jam it into the back of the baby's head and suction the brains out. 
   This is where humanity has arrived in the United States in 1999. In the greatest deliberative body in the world, we can stand here and debate this is a proper procedure in America; this is legal in America; this is ethical in America; this is moral in America. This is not a debate about abortion. This is a debate about who we are as a society. 
   I know the abortion sides have lined up and want to make this an abortion line, where we draw the line in protecting humanity. If we don't draw it here, the next logical step is easy. From the New Yorker magazine last month, the September issue, an article by Peter Singer. Peter Singer is a philosopher --pop philosopher, I guess--who was just hired at Princeton University. 
   What does Peter Singer say? I will read part of the article. Viewers will say that guy is a whacko, this guy is out there on the fringe; he is at Princeton University, but he is out there on the fringe. No one can make this credible argument in America today. I argue that 40 years ago no one could make this credible argument that this procedure would be legal. But here we are. Put on your seatbelts, ladies and gentlemen. We are in for a ride, and the roller coaster is going down. I don't see the bottom yet. Let me describe how far down the roller coaster we can go when it comes to civility in America, when it comes to respect for life in America. 
   Peter Singer:  
   Killing a disabled infant is not morally equivalent to killing a person. Very often it is not wrong at all.  
   I remind everybody of these anecdotes I have talked about that have offended so many. What are the stories about? The backbone for the defense of this procedure given by the Senator from California, the Senator from Iowa, the Senator from Illinois. What is the subject of these tragic stories? In every instance, in every instance, these were pregnancies that had gone awry, where, in the course of fetal development, the infant became disabled, a problem developed--whether it was trisomy, hydrocephaly, some abnormality occurred, some disability occurred in the baby. 
   Is there an argument on any of these cases that the health or the life of the mother was endangered by carrying the baby itself? The answer is no. In none of these cases is the issue brought up that the health of the mother was jeopardized by carrying the baby. In all of these cases the point was made, the baby is going to die anyway or the quality of the baby's life is not going to be good; killing a disabled infant is not morally equivalent to killing a person. 
   We see how the slope gets slippery. We don't hear from the other side in defending partial-birth abortion--the cases of 
   healthy mothers and healthy women. They are not used to defending this procedure. However, 90 percent of the partial-birth abortions are healthy mothers and healthy babies. They don't use those as an example because they are not sympathetic examples to those who are within the sound of my voice. People won't sympathize with a healthy mother and healthy baby--aborting a baby late in pregnancy, killing her healthy baby. People don't see a rationale for someone to do that. 
   The folks here know when people hear about a deformed baby being killed, they are OK with that. Think about what they are doing by bringing these cases up. Think about what they are presuming people are thinking when they use disabled children as a legitimate reason to be killed under this procedure. They are assuming that America doesn't care as much; they assume they are not as worthy as a normal, healthy baby. 
   Do you know what. They are right. Absorb that, America. They won't use healthy mothers and healthy babies to defend this procedure because people will have no sympathy for that, people have no tolerance for that. Throw up a disabled child as the object of this execution, and then it is OK; then there is sympathy. 
   What a slippery slope when killing a disabled infant is not morally equivalent to killing a person. And you say that is outrageous. They are using it now to justify this position. It is not outrageous; it is today in America. It is the reason for this procedure to be kept legal. Open your eyes and see what they are doing. Open your eyes and see where we are headed. 
   Dr. Peter Singer:  
   When the death of a disabled infant will lead to a birth of another infant with better prospects of a happy life, the total amount of happiness will be greater if the disabled infant is killed. The loss of happy life for the first infant is outweighed by the gain of a happier life for the second. Therefore, if killing a hemophiliac infant had no adverse effect on others, it would, according to the total view, be right to kill him.  
   We will see family pictures of a mother and father who had a partial-birth abortion now being shown with another new baby. They will say, see, it is OK because this other baby is happy. 
   This is not craziness that is going to happen in the future. This is the roller coaster, folks, we are headed down. This debate should point Americans in the direction as clear as my finger is pointing to Senator VOINOVICH that we are headed toward Peter Singer's world. 
   Two or three Senators have quoted the oft-quoted paragraph out of Planned Parenthood v. Casey. 
   They use that to legitimize what they are doing. Let me read something for you. I want you to think about the logic behind what they are saying here. Listen, America. This is an abortion case.  
   At the heart of liberty is the right to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.  
   I am going to paraphrase that. I am going to use the words of somebody who all of you know because of some things that he did in the last year. I am going to use the words of Eric Harris, who wrote before he killed 13 children at Columbine:  
   When I say something, it goes. I am the law.  
   What this says is very simple: You are the law. What you say goes. You have the right to define, again ``one's own concept of existence,'' one's own concept of the ``meaning of the universe and of the mystery of life.'' What I say goes. 
   Fredrich Neitzsche would be proud of us all for this debate. Peter Singer is proud, I am sure, of this debate today being put forward in defense of something that he supports, the killing of little children if they are not perfect like you and me. Remember, you will not hear one word, you have not heard one word in three debates, in 5 years--you have not heard one word about the normal, healthy baby being killed by this procedure. You have not heard one word about a normal, healthy mother having one of these abortions. They will not use that case even though over 90 percent of the abortions that occur with partial birth are those cases. 
   They use the ones that tug at your heartstrings. Having lost a baby, they tug at mine. I know the pain of what these men and women who suffered through pregnancies that went awry--I know what they suffered through. I do not demean them when I talk about their cases. They are real and they suffered. But to use--and I emphasize the word ``use''--these cases to justify the killing of a baby, to use abnormal children--abnormal to whom, I might add? Disabled to whom? Imperfect to whom? Not to me. My son who died was not perfect in the eyes of this world, but he was perfect to me. He was perfect to my wife. Most important, he was perfect in God's eyes. 
   To abuse these cases, to pull at your heartstrings, to legitimize killing children 3 inches away from being born is beneath the dignity of the Senate and feeds into Peter Singer's view that ``killing a disabled infant is not morally equivalent to killing a person. Very often it is not wrong at all.'' 
   Peter Singer takes it even further. I said he supports this procedure. I am sure he does, but he thinks this is probably not the best way to go. Here is  what he thinks. You say this is absurd, Senator? Listen:  
   If a pregnant woman has inconclusive results from amniocentesis, Singer doesn't see why she shouldn't carry the fetus to term. Then, if the baby is severely disabled and the parents prefer to kill it, they should be allowed to. That way, there would be fewer needless abortions and more healthy babies.  
   In defense we almost do that with partial-birth abortion, don't we? We deliver the baby, get a chance to see the baby, and then we kill the baby. We have case after case now, several cases, of botched partial-birth abortions where babies who were to be aborted ended up being born before the doctor could kill the baby. There are three cases I am aware of, two in the last few months, where little children were born; not fetuses, not products of conception--which I think is another term that is 
   used to dehumanize what is a living human being. Is there anybody in the Senate or within the sound of my voice, any Senator, who would disagree that a fetus or baby inside the mother is a living human being? I do not think there is any question that is a living human being. But we try to dehumanize it by using ``fetus,'' ``products of conception.'' 
   In the case of a partial-birth abortion, you are talking about at least a 20-week-old living human being that is delivered feet first outside of the mother except for the head and then killed. The justification, the stories, the ``cases,'' all involve disabled children--never healthy children. 
   Let me tell you about some healthy children who were to be aborted using a partial-birth abortion. The first known survivor was a girl born in Phoenix, June 30, 1998, known as Baby Phoenix. The little girl was accidentally born as a result of a botched partial-birth abortion. How does a partial-birth abortion work? How could it be botched? 
   You present yourself to the abortionist. The abortionist says you are past 20 weeks. 
   By the way, when you are past 20 weeks and you deliver a child, the baby will be born alive, so we are talking about the delivery of a living baby. That baby may not survive for a variety of reasons, but the baby will be born alive, this little baby. This baby's mother did not want this baby to be born alive, so she went to an abortionist after 20 weeks and the abortionist said: Fine, we are going to do a partial-birth abortion. 
   Were there health concerns with this baby? Was the mother in physical problems? Was the baby physically deformed? The answer in both cases: No. Could she get an abortion after 20 weeks? The answer was yes. 
   Let me tell you how much after 20 weeks you can get an abortion in this country. Based on the sonogram performed at the abortion clinic, Dr. Biskind believed baby Phoenix to be 23 weeks, at least that is what he says. During the actual abortion procedure, the doctor realized the child was much older. He stopped the partial-birth abortion and delivered a 6-pound, 2-ounce baby girl. Baby Phoenix was actually 37 weeks. Both the 17-year-old biological mother and child were healthy. This was an elective abortion. 
   You don't hear the other side talk about elective abortions and healthy mothers and healthy babies, do you? Do you? There is no sympathy for them. Oh, but it is OK, it is all right. We have sympathy if the baby is not perfect--in our eyes. In our eyes. 
   Following delivery, Baby Phoenix was sent to a hospital across the street for treatment. She suffered from a fractured skull and cuts on her face as a result of the attempted abortion. Amazingly, there was no apparent brain damage. In October of 1997, by the way, the year before this happened, a Federal court struck down Arizona's law that would have prevented this brutality in the first place.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Today, Baby Phoenix lives in Texas with her adopted parents. The doctor who performed this abortion has since lost his license. 
   That was not the last victim of partial-birth abortions. Baby Hope, the second known survivor, survived an abortion attempt which began in the clinic of Dr. Martin Haskell who has been up here and has testified, who is one of the inventors of the procedure, who, in fact, testified in court cases. By the way, when he testified in those court cases and was asked the question, Is partial-birth abortion ever used to protect the life of the mother? The answer was no--from the inventor of the procedure. Is partial-birth abortion ever necessary or is it the only option available to protect the health of the mother? The answer by Dr. Haskell: No. 
   Baby Hope's biological mother underwent a dilation phase of a partial-birth abortion. What happens is: You present yourself to the doctor. The doctor gives you pills to dilate your cervix. In 3 days, you come back to the abortion clinic. Your cervix is dilated, and they can perform the abortion. 
   She dilated too quickly. She went to a hospital and was admitted for abdominal pain. The woman gave birth as she was being prepared for an examination. This was the point at which the hospital personnel first learned she was in the dilation phase of a partial-birth abortion. 
   On April 7, Baby Hope was born in the emergency room. She was 22 weeks old. An emergency room technician who was asked to remove the baby from the room noticed she was alive. Neonatal staff were called to examine her, and doctors did not believe the child's lungs were developed enough to resuscitate her, so they did not put her on life support. Hospital staff wrapped the baby in a blanket. The ER technician named the baby Hope and then rocked and sang to the little girl for 3 hours 8 minutes of her life. Hope's death certificate lists the cause of death as extreme prematurity secondary to induced abortion. 
   Ironically, the manner of death listed on the death certificate is ``natural.'' They do not talk about these cases. 
   The 22-week-old baby girl died tragically, but she touched the hearts of the people whom she touched in her life. If this partial-birth abortion procedure had been performed, she would have died a violent, barbaric, painful death. 
   A third case, Baby Grace. Four months after Baby Hope's death, another baby survived a botched abortion, again at Dr. Haskell's abortion clinic in Dayton, OH. Baby Grace was born August 4, 1999--just a couple of months ago. 
   Once again, the child's biological mother went into premature labor as a result of the dilation phase of the partial-birth abortion. As in the case of Baby Hope, the mother went to the hospital and delivered the baby. In this case, the child was between 25 and 26 weeks old. Baby Grace is still alive. She is being cared for at a hospital as a premature baby. The Montgomery County, Ohio, Children Services Board has temporary custody of her and plans to put her up for adoption. 
   Baby Grace is living proof of the horror of partial-birth abortion. She is not a footnote in case law. She is a real baby who would have died. You do not hear anyone talking about those cases. 
   What this amendment does has nothing to do with the underlying bill. The underlying bill is about banning a barbaric procedure that crosses the line of civility in America; at least I hope so. Let me assure you, if we do not draw that line, we will be having debates here, I hope with all my heart, when I am not here, about whether killing children is OK if they are not perfect in our eyes. We are 3 inches from having that debate right now. It is only a matter of time before those inches fade away. It is irrelevant, really, isn't it, whether it is 3 inches or not. God bless America. 
   The Senator from Ohio, I understand, wants to be recognized. How much time do I have remaining?

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, first off, I thank the Senator very much for his interest in an honest and open debate. I agree, this is one of the critical issues we have to address, and the courts have confronted this question of undue burden. 
   Underlying that are two issues; one is the center point: Is this medically necessary. Second, are there alternatives to this procedure so as not to have an undue burden. 
   That gets into a couple issues. Let me address the medical necessity issue. 
   I will present the evidence as best I can that supports, we believe, the fact that this is not medically necessary. We have, of course, the AMA which said it is not medically necessary. That is the American Medical Association. They have said in a letter and stand by it that this procedure is not medically necessary. 
   We have C. Everett Koop, obviously someone who has a tremendous amount of respect in this country, who has written directly this is not medically necessary. 
   We have an organization of 600--actually more than 600--obstetricians and gynecologists, many of them members of the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, many of them fellows, who have written without any hesitation this procedure is not medically necessary and is, in fact, dangerous to the health of the mother. They go one step further: It is never medically preferable, not only medically necessary. 
   On the other side of the issue--and I am trying to present it, and I know the Senator from California will present her side--what is used is the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology policy statement on the issue. Several years ago, they put together a select panel, and the select panel reviewed the procedure to determine whether there were cases in which it was medically necessary to perform this procedure. They came forward with a statement. This is what their statement said:  
   [We] could identify no circumstances under which this procedure ..... would be the only option to save the life or preserve the health of the woman ......  
   They went on to say--and this is where the Senator from California will come in and say, see, that is not the whole story, so I will go on. It says:  
   An intact D&X--  
   Partial-birth abortion--  
   however, may--  
   May--  
   be the best or most appropriate procedure in a particular circumstance to save the life or preserve the health of a woman, and only the doctor, in consultation with the patient, based upon the woman's particular circumstances can make this decision.  
   We have asked the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology to provide us an example of where this procedure may be the best procedure because what they say is it ``may.'' For 3 years we have asked them to provide us a factual situation where, in fact, this ``may'' would come into play, and they have not done so. 
   In fact, we have letters, and I would be happy to share them with you; there are dozens--in fact, there is a whole stack--from obstetricians and gynecologists throughout America who take issue with this statement, saying there are no circumstances where this would be the most appropriate procedure. 
   Dr. FRIST addressed that issue last night. He went through the medical literature and talked about it. I have asked him to come over, if he can, because I think, as a physician, as a surgeon, he may be better to answer this question than me.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Two comments. 
   First of all, the definition of ``partial-birth abortion'' is very clear. It requires an intent to do an abortion. So if you were going in, and you were having a delivery, and the delivery is breech, for example, that would not be covered under this. It is very clear. There is no court in the land, that has reviewed this, that has suggested that anyone who is in the process of delivering a child for the purpose of a live birth is covered under this definition because you have to have the intent to have an abortion. If there is no such intent, then you are not covered under the act.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Yes, I would be happy to. In fact, I shared with the Senator from Nebraska yesterday an amendment to the bill that I think directly is on point with what the Eighth Circuit decision had concern with, which is the vagueness of the definition, that it could cover more than one abortion. I think this refinement of the definition makes it crystal clear that we are only talking about this one procedure. 
   As I said to the Senator from California, Mrs. FEINSTEIN, when she was going through the Eighth Circuit decision earlier, the Eighth Circuit said our problem with this is it includes too much. Obviously, if you take the logic of that, they would probably not have a problem if it did not include too much.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I am about to send an amendment to the desk. The purpose of the amendment is a modification of the language that defines what a partial-birth abortion is in S. 1692. 
   The reason for the modification is in direct response to the Eighth Circuit decision where the court asserted the procedure defined--it was a similar definition to the one here--was unconstitutionally vague; that it could have included other forms of abortion and, thereby, was an undue burden because it would have eliminated other forms of abortion and would have, by doing so, restricted a woman's right unduly, according to the court. 
   I am not going to take issue with the court whether they are right or wrong. I do not believe they are right, but in response to that, I am going to be offering an amendment that makes it very clear we are not talking about any other form of abortion; that we are talking about just the abortion procedure that has been described over and over about a baby being delivered outside of the mother, all but the head, and then killed; not a baby that is being killed in utero and a part of the baby's body may be in the birth canal. That is what the court said they were concerned about.

   Mr. SANTORUM. That is similar to the language that is in the bill right now. But the amended language further specifies the fetus is partially outside the body of the mother. The court was concerned about a D&E performed in utero, but the baby 
   during this procedure could be partially delivered into the birth canal and that occasionally an arm or leg or something might be delivered, and that was the confusing part for the court. 
   This is clear that the living baby has to be outside of the mother before the act of killing the baby occurs; that the act of killing the baby is not occurring in utero, but occurring when the baby is outside the mother. I think it pretty well carves out any other form of abortion.

   Mr. SANTORUM. If you have some language that could clarify--but if you read the definition, it says:  
   ..... means deliberately and intentionally delivers into the vagina a living fetus, or a substantial portion thereof, for the purpose of performing a procedure the physician knows will kill the fetus. .....  
   That is, if you deliver for the purpose of killing the fetus, as this says, as opposed to delivering for the purpose of delivering a live baby where that may go awry and something may happen, and that would require the killing of a fetus. And that is not covered. I think it is pretty clear that is not covered. 
   If you have some language that would make you more comfortable with that, it is certainly not our intention--let me make it very clear--to cover any case where you have a birth where a complication arises and something has to be done.

   Mr. SANTORUM. I appreciate that. I state for the record this is part of the legislative history. Obviously, if there is some language that makes you more comfortable, that we need to be more clear here, it is certainly clearly the legislative intent not to include situations where the baby is in the process of being born and the process of a natural childbirth and a complication arises which forces the doctor to do things that result in the death of the child. That is clearly outside 
   the scope of this. It certainly is our intent for it to be outside the scope. We think the language here is clear that it is. 
   But, again, I would be willing to work with the Senator from Nebraska to make sure he is comfortable that that is clearly outside the scope of this.

   Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator from Nebraska. 
   Mr. President, I am going to be sending an amendment to the desk, which the Senator from Nebraska referred to in our colloquy, that redefines what a partial-birth abortion is--the definition section of the act. 
   Again, it is in response, as the Senator from Nebraska accurately pointed out, to the Eighth Circuit's concern about this provision in the bill as being unconstitutionally vague. In other words, it is a provision in the bill that defines the procedure, that the Eighth Circuit said could include other procedures. 
   As I described to the Senator from Nebraska, the most common form of late-trimester abortion is a D&E in which the baby is killed in utero. During that procedure, occasionally, I am told, a part of the body may enter into the birth canal. And the concern of the court, of other courts--not just the Eighth Circuit but other courts--is that the definition we have in place right now--and the definition states as follows: ``means an abortion in which the person performing the abortion partially vaginally delivers a living fetus before killing the fetus and completing the delivery.'' According to the court, it is unclear that we are talking about a baby outside the mother. 
   Of course, from the charts we have shown here, we described partial birth as the baby being outside of the mother and then killed. We do not say that in this underlying bill. So the courts have said: Well, it can mean partially delivered; it could be a body part in the birth canal. That could be seen as partially delivered; therefore, overly broad.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Louisiana for her amendment. It gets to the heart of the concern for people with disabilities. I think it reflects that we should open our arms to unborn children who are faced with disabilities and the difficulties they are going to deal with. I talked about it over and over again--how the debate for this abortion technique to be kept legal centered upon disabled children who were not wanted. There may be a percentage of those cases where abortion is done because of the financial concerns of parents in dealing with a disabled child. Those are real concerns and things people think about--whether they can provide a quality of life under the financial constraints of a child who may need a lot of care. 
   So to have an amendment that is a sense of the Congress that we should be open to helping and supporting life and affirming the decision of someone who wants to carry their child to term and accept them the way God has given that child to them is something I think Congress should do. 
   So I commend the Senator from Louisiana. I would be willing to accept the amendment, but I understand the Senator would like a recorded vote.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, thank you. 
   Mr. President, I want to make a couple of comments about my amendment and the attempt that I am trying to make to address the constitutional infirmities that the Eighth Circuit found in this language of the partial-birth abortion bill. The Arkansas statute is similar to the language that is in the bill presently. 
   The Senator from California talked about this not addressing the other constitutional issues that the Eighth Circuit brought up. 
   I remind the Senator from California. I am quoting from the case. 
   The district court held the act unconstitutional for three reasons.  
   Because it was unconstitutionally vague, because it imposes an undue burden on women seeking abortions, and because it was not adequate to protect the health and lives of women. We agree the act imposes undue burdens on women and therefore hold the act unconstitutional. And because we based it on undue burden grounds as we did in Carhart, we do not decide the vagueness issue or whether the act fails to provide adequate protections.  
   The Eighth Circuit did not address that issue. The only circuit court that addressed it, addressed it on the issue that we are addressing here, which is that this could include other procedures, would ban other procedures, and as a result it could be unduly burdensome because it would eliminate all forms of abortions late in pregnancy. 
   We are making it clear what the court said, and not what some say the court said. That is what the court said. That is the only circuit court to have ruled on the case. Now we have an amendment which clearly deals with the issues of the circuit court which we are concerned about. I think we have cleared that constitutional hurdle. 
   It is interesting that the Senator from California talks about we have to follow the Constitution. Nowhere in the Constitution is the issue of partial-birth abortion mentioned, as far as I can see. Nowhere in the Constitution is the right to privacy mentioned. Nowhere is it mentioned. It is created by the Supreme Court. 
   To be technically correct, the Senator from California should say that we need to follow the Supreme Court, and not the Constitution, because there is a difference. The Supreme Court has interpreted and legislated rights through their Court decisions. The Senator from California accurately reflects that the law of the land is the high court. But to suggest we are following the Constitution, which is clear about this issue as far as I am concerned because the Constitution says that we have the right to life. So if the Constitution speaks at all to this issue, it speaks on our side. 
   Again, the law of the land is--I think she would be correct if she phrased it that way. We need to comport with the law of the land as the Court has interpreted the Constitution. 
   I would like to get back to my amendment and go through my modification to the bill. I am trying to get my terms correct. It is not going to be an amendment. It will be a modification. I would like to get back to the modification of the underlying bill that will redefine partial-birth abortion, and again focus on the fact that this solves one of the two issues that are out there with respect to the constitutionality. 
   More importantly, in my mind, it deals with the two issues that I think concern Members of the Senate as to whether to support this bill. One is, is it an undue burden? Do we ban more than what we say we do? If people are concerned whether that is the case, I think we have solved that problem--that if this bill passes no procedure other than partial-birth abortion, when the baby is outside of the mom after 20 weeks, outside the mother, would otherwise be born alive, and then brutally killed, executed by having a sharp pair of scissors thrust into the base of the skull of the baby and then its brains suctioned out. That would be outlawed under this procedure. But no other procedure would.  
   I want to make clear Congress' regard as to what the intent of the Congress is. Again, I think the language is amply clear for the court to do so. 
   It was interesting that the Senator from California contacted ACOG, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and on an hour's notice, when asked about our amendment, ACOG was able to fax back to the floor of the Senate a response objecting to this provision. But those of us who have asked ACOG for 3 years, 3 years, to provide us a for instance as to when and under what circumstances this procedure would be a preferable or more proper procedure than other abortion techniques, they have yet to respond. It is interesting they can respond in an hour with great specificity about their concerns about this bill, about this modification. But in 3 years they have not been able to respond to a very simple question. 
   You state--and they did--that it ``may be'' the best or most appropriate procedure in a particular circumstance to save the life or preserve the health of the woman. We have asked for a ``for instance.'' We have asked for that for instance to be peer reviewed, to see whether their suggestion is, in fact, an accurate suggestion. In more than 3 years, in three sessions of Congress, they have refused to provide an example. 
   That, my friends, is the underpinning of the second objection to the people to this bill that it unduly infringes upon the health of the mother; that this is medically necessary to preserve the health of the mother under Roe v. Wade.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Any reasoned understanding of what I just said would lead one to believe I was not criticizing the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists for promptly responding to your request. I was comparing their swift response to your request to what could whimsically be considered a casual response to my request which has taken now 3 years on the core point, on the core question, as to whether this bill restricts or in any way inhibits the health of the mother. 
   Again, I will read their own report: We could identify no circumstances under which this procedure would be the only option to save the life or preserve the health of a woman. Then they go on to say it may be best or appropriate in some circumstance, but they give no such circumstance, no such evidence. 
   This is the only pillar upon which the other side stands, saying it is medically necessary. 
   I will read several letters from members of ACOG, fellows in ACOG, who dissect their policy statement and say this second sentence, it may be the best position, is hogwash. That is a medical term--it is hogwash. 
   Again, ACOG has not responded to a letter, now in, 2 1/2 years.  
   I would like to respond to the January 12th statement of policy issued by the executive board. I am a former abortion provider.  
   Let me repeat. This is an obstetrician, a member, a fellow of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists:  
   I am a former abortion provider and I would like to take issue with the ``Statement'' for a number of reasons. 
   First, I can think of no ``established obstetric technique'' that ``..... evacuat(es) the intercranial contents of a living fetus to affect vaginal delivery of a dead but otherwise intact fetus.'' The closest technique that I can imagine is a craniocentesis on a hydrocephalic infant to allow for vaginal delivery. There is no necessity that the infant be killed in this situation, and you must admit that there is a vast difference between craniocentesis for hydrocephaly and suctioning the brain of an otherwise normal infant who would be viable outside the womb. 
   Second, as to the number of abortions performed after 16 weeks, I do not trust the CDC's data on this since abortion statistics are at best, arguable. Abortion industry lobbyist Mr. Ron Fitzsimmons' recent admission of purposely misinforming the media and Congress on the statistical incidence of the procedure and its predominant usage (normal infants) should at a minimum demand an accurate audit of second and third trimester abortions in America...... 
   Finally, I'm sure there are many ACOG members who join me in reminding you that your stand on this issue, published as an official policy statement, does not reflect the views of many, if not most, ACOG members. However, the perception of the general public and the media is that you speak for all of us. Please recognize that you have a responsibility to all members of ACOG if not to stay neutral in sensitive areas such as this, to at least issue a disclaimer on such statement that the opinions of ACOG Executive Committee do not reflect those of its members.  
   This is signed by three members of ACOG. 
   I can go through another letter of a physician in Northern Virginia who writes in detail, a fellow of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, a letter to Senator TORRICELLI last year:  
   My name is Dr. Camilla Hersch. I am a board certified Obstetrician and Gynecologist, a fellow of the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, in private practice, caring exclusively for the health needs of women for thirteen years. I am also a clinical assistant professor of [OB/GYN] for Georgetown University. I have been involved with teaching medical students and OBGYN residents for fourteen years at two major medical teaching centers.  
   Not, by the way, compared to the inventor of partial-birth abortion. Not an obstetrician or gynecologist but a family practitioner who does abortions. That is who they are defending --a procedure not taught in medical school, not in any of the literature which Senator FRIST, Dr. FRIST, went through in detail last night. His thorough review of all the medical literature on the subject of abortion had not a mention of this procedure. 
   Back to the letter:  
   I have delivered over two thousand babies. On a daily basis I treat pregnant women and their babies. In my everyday work I am privileged to participate in the joy of healthy birth and the agony and sorrow of complications in pregnancy which can lead to loss of life or heartbreaking disability. 
   As a member of the Physicians' Ad Hoc Coalition for Truth, which now has more than 600 members, I strongly support and applaud the legislative efforts to ban this heinous Partial-Birth Abortion procedure. 
   Many of the members of PHACT, Physicians' Ad Hoc Committee for Truth, hold teaching positions or head departments of obstetrics and gynecology or perinatology at universities and medical centers across the country. To our knowledge, there are no published peer-reviewed safety data regarding the procedure in question. It is not taught as a formally recognized medical procedure. Proponents of partial-birth abortion tout it as the safest method available. Nothing could be further from the truth. There are in fact several recognized, tested, far safer, recommended methods to empty the uterus when it is medically necessary to do so. 
   There is no data in the accepted standard medical literature that could possibly support any assertion of the appropriateness of this procedure. 
   If you ask most obstetricians or family practice physicians about partial-birth abortion, they will tell they have never seen or heard of such a treatment for any reason in their educational training or practice. 
   Most physicians I have questioned are incredulous that anyone knowledgeable about Obstetrics and Gynecology would ever consider this procedure as any kind of serious suggestion, because it is so obviously dangerous. It has never been proposed or taught as the safest method to empty the uterus and end a pregnancy whether for purely elective reasons for abortion or in those grave instances when it is medically necessary to do so to save the mother's life. 
   Consider the grave danger involved in partial-birth abortion, which usually occurs after the fifth month of pregnancy, even into the last month of pregnancy. A woman's cervix is forcibly dilated over several days. This risks creating an incompetent cervix, a leading cause of subsequent premature delivery. It also risks serious infection, a major cause of subsequent infertility. In the event of a truly life threatening complication of pregnancy, the days of delay involved substantially add to the risk of loss of life of the mother. 
   The abortionist then reaches into the uterus to pull the child feet first out of the mother's body, up to the neck, but leaves the head inside. He then forces scissors through the base of the baby's skull--which remains  lodged just within the opening of the forcibly dilated cervix, because the baby's head is larger and of course harder than the remainder of the soft little body. 
   I think it is obvious that for the baby this is a horrible way to die, brutally and painfully killed by having one's head stabbed open and one's brains suctioned out. 
   But for the woman, this is a mortally dangerous and life threatening act. 
   Partial-birth abortion is a partially blind procedure, done by feel, thereby risking direct scissor injury to the mother's uterus and laceration of the cervix or lower uterine segment. Either the scissors or the bony shards or spickules of the baby's perforated and disrupted skull bones can roughly rip into the large blood vessels which supply the lower part of the lush pregnant uterus, resulting in immediate and massive bleeding and the threat of shock, immediate hysterectomy, blood transfusion, and even death to the mother. 
   Portions of the baby's sharp bony skull pieces can remain imbedded in the mother's cervix, setting up a complicated infection as the bony fragments decompose. 
   Think of the emotional agony for the woman, both immediately and for years afterward, who endures this process over a period of several days. 
   None of this nauseating risk is ever necessary, for any reason. Obstetrician-gynecologists like myself across the U.S. regularly treat women whose unborn children suffer the same conditions as those cited by proponents of the procedure. 
   Never is the partial-birth abortion procedure necessary: not for polyhydramnios (an excess of amniotic fluid collecting around the baby),  
   That is one of the cases given by the other side. Never is a partial-birth abortion procedure necessary--  
   not for trisomy (genetic abnormalities characterized by an extra chromosome), not for anencephaly (an abnormality characterized by the absence of the top portion of the baby's brain and skull), 
   Never is a partial-birth abortion necessary,  
   not for hydrocephaly (excessive cerebrospinal fluid in the head), 
   Water on the brain. Never is partial-birth abortion necessary,  
   not for life threatening complications of pregnancy to the mother.
   Sometimes, as in the case of hydrocephaly, it is first necessary to drain some of the fluid from the baby's head, with a special long needle, to allow safe vaginal delivery. In some cases, when vaginal delivery is not possible, a doctor performs a Cesarean section. But in no case is it necessary or medically advisable to partially deliver an infant through the vagina and then to cruelly kill the infant. 
   The legislation proposed clearly distinguishes the procedure being banned from recognized standard obstetric techniques.  
   We are even further clarifying it.  
   I must point out, even for those who support abortion for elective or medical reasons at any point in pregnancy, current recognized abortion techniques would be unaffected by the proposed ban.
   Any proponent of such a dangerous procedure is at the least seriously misinformed about medical reality or at worst so consumed by narrow minded ``abortion-at-any-cost'' activism, to be criminally negligent. This procedure is blatant and cruel infanticide, and must be against the law. 
   Mr. President, I would like to put in place as legislative history for this modification that I will add to the bill a colloquy. Senator DEWINE is here. We are going to go through a colloquy that will create for the court a clear understanding of what is meant by this amendment. 
   So I yield to the Senator from Ohio for a question.

   Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator from Ohio. 
   In the Michigan partial-birth abortion case, Evans v. Kelly, the Federal District Court found that:  
   [t]he doctors were.......unanimous in their understanding of the meaning of the term ``living,'' as used in the statute's definition of a ``partial-birth abortion'': A living fetus means a fetus having a heartbeat.

   Mr. SANTORUM. The word ``intact'' is used in this context to refer to the living fetal organism rather than a fetal part that has been removed from a fetus. Because of the use of the word ``intact,'' a person performing a partial-birth abortion would not fall under the prohibition that the law provides if, for example, he or she delivers a dismembered fetal arm or leg. To fall under the prohibition, the abortionist would have to deliver a living fetal body, functioning as an organism. 
   The use of the word ``intact'' is not, however, meant to allow the killing of a partially born fetus merely because some nonessential body part is missing. An abortionist cannot cut a toe of the fetus off before partial delivery and then claim in defense that the fetus killed after the partial-birth abortion was not intact.

   Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator. 
   The term ``overt act'' is used to mean some separate specific act that the abortionist must undertake to deliberately and intentionally kill the fetus, other than delivering the fetus into a partial-birth position or causing the fetus to abort. It does not mean the overall abortion procedure which typically begins with a living fetus and ends with a dead fetus. 
   Under the amendment, the abortionist must not only deliver the fetus in such a way that some portion of the body of the fetus is outside of the mother's body, he or she must also separately and specifically act to then kill the fetus while it is in the partially-delivered position, for example, by puncturing the fetal skull or suctioning out the fetal brain.

   Mr. SANTORUM. No. The bill would have two elements. First, the fetus must be delivered into the partially delivered position for the purpose of performing an overt act that will kill the fetus while it is in the partially delivered position. Second, the fetus must actually be killed; that is, it must die while it is in the partially delivered position. Neither of these would happen with the suction curettage. Removal of the dismembered fetal parts entailed in a suction curettage is not prohibited because the parts do not constitute an intact living fetus. Suction curettage also typically involves dismemberment and fetal death in utero, conduct beyond the scope of the bill. 
   In the extremely implausible event that an entire fetus was suctioned through the cannula and died after removal from the mother's body, then the bill would not apply either, since it requires that the fetus be killed while in a partially delivered position. 
   Even if one argues that a fetus might occasionally die in the cannula while partially outside the mother's body during the course of a suction curettage procedure, the fetus would not have to be deliberately positioned there for the purpose then of taking a separate, second step to end its life at that point. Nor is any such separate step ever taken. Rather, suction curettage involves a single continuous suction process that removes the fetus from the uterus through a cannula and out of the mother's body. The physician could not knowingly deliver an intact living fetus into the partially delivered position by this method because he would have no way of knowing that the fetus yet lived at this point when it was partially outside the mother's body. The abortionist would, thus, never knowingly cause fetal death to occur at the partially delivered stage because the physician would never know at what point fetal demise occurred. 
   Even State partial-birth abortion statutes that did not have the ``fetus partially outside the mother's body'' have been held not to govern suction curettage abortion, and that is the Federal district court in Virginia and Kentucky.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Absolutely not. In the conventional D&E procedure, the intact living fetus is never positioned partly outside the mother's body for the purpose of taking a separate overt act to end its life while it remains in that position. Moreover, the second step to end fetal life in that position is never taken. Also, once a physician has begun performing a conventional D&E dismemberment, he typically does not know when the fetus dies. Thus, he cannot meet the mens rea requirement of knowingly bringing an intact living fetus partially out of the mother for the purpose of performing a separate overt act intended to kill the fetus in the partially delivered position.

   Mr. SANTORUM. No. Physicians doing inductions never deliberately and intentionally deliver an intact living fetus partially outside the mother's body for the purpose of pausing to perform an act that they know will kill the fetus while it remains in a partially delivered position before continuing the delivery. 
   It is possible that rarely during an induction abortion, an intact living fetus could be trapped in a partially delivered position with complete delivery being prevented by entanglement of the umbilical cord or the fetal head being lodged in the cervix. In such circumstances, the physician may cut the cord or decompress the skull before completing delivery without being in violation of the bill because he did not intentionally and deliberately get the fetus in that position for the purpose of killing it while it was in that position. 
   Even State partial-birth abortion statutes that did not 
   have ``fetus partially outside the mother's body'' language have been held not to govern induction abortions, and again, Federal district courts in Virginia and Kentucky have so ruled.

   Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator from Ohio. 
   The Senator from Nebraska had questions about how this amendment from a constitutional standpoint would be perceived. This is very clear. With this colloquy, we very clearly address all the different aspects of different kinds of abortions which would not be outlawed by this procedure and why they would not be outlawed by this procedure. 
   For those who have suggested--and I know many have suggested--that what we are about here is the first step to eliminating abortions, I again state for the record that I cannot honestly say we will eliminate one abortion in this country if we pass this bill. I can honestly say that is not the thrust of what we are trying to accomplish. 
   I have said it once, and I will say it again and again: What we are trying to accomplish is to make sure that in a society where the lines are ever blurring, in a society where sensitivity to life may be at an all-time low, in a society where the Peter Singers of the world are running rampant with their talk of being able to kill children if they are not perfect after they are born, we need a bright line. And the bright line should be that if the child is in the process of being born, you cannot kill the child, you cannot do an abortion where the baby is in the process of being born. 
   That has to be the bright line, except, of course, to save the life of the mother. But to deliberately birth the baby for the purpose of killing the baby goes over the line. 
   In closing, I refer to what the Senator from California said when I said she defends a procedure in which the baby is born all but the head; that under those circumstances you can still kill the baby. But if the baby is born head first and all but the foot is still inside the mother, when I asked her, can you kill the baby in this circumstance, she said no, ``Absolutely not.'' 
   If that is a bright line to anybody in this Chamber, if that is where we want to stand, I will tell you, that is on shifting ground. In fact, that is on quicksand, and pretty soon the Peter Singers of this world who say, ``Killing a disabled infant is not morally equivalent to killing a person. Very often it is not wrong at all''--a professor at the University of Princeton. And you say that is outrageous? 
   Look at the examples the other side has given as reasons to keep this procedure legal. The examples are all about disabled infants. None of them concerns the health of the mother. They all concern a case where children were going to be born with profound abnormalities, disabled. The argument is, we need to keep this legal because disabled children are less entitled to protection than healthy ones. 
   You have heard no example. You will hear no example. You will hear no example of a healthy mother and a healthy child being used to legitimize this procedure. They won't dare do that. Why? Because it would shock you. Yet 90 percent of abortions performed under partial birth are performed on just those cases. What they will use is the disabled child, and the American public, incredibly, to me, will say: OK; that's OK; I understand; it's OK; if the child is disabled, of course you can kill it. 
   If that is what we are thinking, America, if that is a legitimate reason to keep this ``safe'' procedure--which, of course, it is not--how far are we from, killing a disabled infant is not morally equivalent to killing a person? How far away are we, America? If this Senate today upholds, by not passing this bill by a constitutional majority, that logic, then, Dr. Singer, come on down because you are next. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
   Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, while I have a few minutes, I want to continue building the record, not from RICK SANTORUM, not from other Senators who are not experts in the field, but building the record from physicians, obstetricians, and experts who comment directly, fellows of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, an organization that the other side uses as defense. 
   Again, this defense is a paper bag that simply needs to be tested. It is a facade. It will collapse. It will be punched through. 
   Let me strike a blow. This is a statement of Dr. Don Gambrell, Jr. M.D., with the Medical College of Georgia, again, a fellow of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. He is a clinical professor of endocrinology and OB/GYN. First sentence right out of the block:  
   Partial-birth abortion is never medically indicated to protect a woman's health or fertility.  
   You have heard several other comments I have made about obstetricians who have said the exact same sentence. Think about who is saying this. This is an expert. We have 600 such physicians. The American college itself, who is against this bill, said it is never the only option. So they even agree it is not the only option. What they say is, it may be preferred. But they give no case; in 3 years, they have given no case. Their own members say it is never medically indicated--never. 
   He underlined the word ``never.'' This is a doctor at a medical college. By the way, I have reams of letters here, all from physicians, all from obstetricians from all over the country who say the same thing. 
   Think about this he is a doctor. For a doctor to say ``never,'' put it in writing and stand behind it--in this case, this was submitted as testimony to the House of Representatives in Atlanta, GA--to put this in sworn testimony, to be able to stand up and, without flinching, to lead off, first sentence, ``never medically necessary.'' 
   What do we have on the other side of this medical necessity debate? I will read it one more time. The only factual evidence that supports the other side is this statement:  
   The select panel could identify no circumstances under which this procedure would be the only option to save the life or preserve the health of the woman.  
   They agree with us: Not the only option; it is not an undue burden; there are, in fact, other procedures that can be used that are as safe. 
   But they go on to say, however, it ``may be the best or most appropriate procedure.'' It ``may be.'' 
   Here is one of their members--by the way, there are at least five, six dozen members, their members, who have written, who have said ``never,'' letter after letter after letter after letter after letter, ``never.'' What did they respond to their own members? A deafening silence.  
   Their own members have asked: Give us a for instance. What has been their response? Nothing. 
   Then we are to defeat a bill based on no evidence and an assertion that it may be, without a shred of evidence to support that ``may be.'' 
   We have mountains of evidence, of expert opinion, of specific indications, of, as I just read from Dr. Hersh, where she went through specific abnormalities and said, not appropriate, not appropriate, not appropriate, not appropriate. 
   Why these abnormalities? Because they were all the abnormalities listed in their anecdotes, in their case histories, that said ``requires'' a partial-birth abortion or is a preferable procedure to perform under these circumstances. Again, experts on the record under oath--never. 
   Now they go further than that. These people say not only is it never medically indicated, it is contraindicated. It is more dangerous to do this. 
   I want Members to know, when they walk to this floor and vote on this bill this time, A, the medical evidence is crystal clear: Never medically necessary to protect the health of the mother. And anybody who walks outside this Chamber and asserts that is doing so against 100 percent of the record before us. 
   By the way, that won't stop people. It won't stop anybody. But look at the record; look at the facts. Anybody who walks out of here and says, I am opposed to this because it is unconstitutional, it is vague, it may cover more of this abortion, and it is an undue burden because of that, read the modification that has just been sent to the desk and adopted. It is crystal clear that no other abortion is banned by this bill now. I don't believe it was before, but if you had any doubt, it is not now. 
   Senator DEWINE and I entered into a colloquy that specifically listed instances and other abortion techniques used that are not covered by this bill. We explain in legal and medical detail why they are not. We say to the courts, that is not our intention; it is not covered. Here, legally and medically, is why it is not. 
   If you want to walk out here and tell your constituents that you voted against this because we needed to protect the health of the mother, ``check strike one, not true.'' You can say it. You might get away with it. But it is not true. They don't have a shred of evidence to say that it is. 
   They will put up pictures and tell stories about difficult decisions. Every one of those cases have been reviewed and every single one of them, experts in the field, 600 of them have said, not true. You may walk out this door and tell your constituents that I need to vote against this because it bans other procedures; it would be an undue burden; it would prohibit a woman's right to choose. Not true. It does not ban any other procedures. If it conceivably did, by some distortion of the words, which is what I think the courts have done, we make it crystal clear. 
   This bill, the new bill, the first time any Member of this Senate will be voting on this particular bill be careful, be careful, because all of the trees you can hide behind in the game of abortion politics are being cut down at the base. In fact, there aren't even stumps left to hide behind. There is no medical evidence to support what they suggest. There is no constitutional argument on undue burden left with this new bill. 
   So if you want to support this procedure, look your constituents in the eye and say: I believe abortion should be done at any time, at any place, in any manner, anyone wants to do it, and that includes 3 inches from being completely born and being protected by the Constitution. If you want to say that, then you are telling the truth; then you are being honest. 
   If you want to say anything else, then you are hiding behind what was a truth. It is gone. There is no protection. You will have to look your constituents in the eye and say: I am not concerned about the dividing line between what is protected under our Constitution and what is not; I am not concerned that this is a slippery slope, where if the head is not born, you can kill the baby, but if the foot is not born, you can't, and it doesn't concern me at all; it doesn't set a double standard at all; it doesn't cause a problem in our society where a baby 3 inches away from life can be executed. It doesn't bother me, America. I want you to know that, constituents. This doesn't bother me. It doesn't bother me that all of the reasons given by the other side as to why this procedure should be kept legal are because of disabled children who were either not going to live long, or live long with a disability.

   Mr. SANTORUM. So if you want to look your constituents in the eye and say: I am not concerned that we need to draw a bright line, and that the examples being used as to why this procedure should be kept legal--and the stories and the cases to legitimize this procedure all involve deformed babies; they all involve babies who were not perfect in someone's eyes--if you want to look at them and say we need to keep this procedure legal because of these cases, then you need to look them in the eye and say: Well, I don't mean what Dr. Singer says, that killing a disabled infant is not morally equivalent to killing a person. But if you say that, then you have to look them in the eye and say: By the way, I want this procedure to be legal to kill healthy children with healthy mothers because that is how 90 percent of these abortions are done. 
   So if you can look in the eyes of constituents and say a 25-week-old baby who is from a healthy mother, a healthy baby, which would otherwise be born alive, that may in fact be viable, can in fact be delivered, all but the head, its brains punctured 
   and suctioned out, and that is OK in America, and that doesn't bother us, and that doesn't create a slippery slope and create a cultural crisis--if you can look in the eyes of your constituents and tell them that, then come down here and vote no. Vote no, and you can do so with a clear conscience; you can do so with a clear conscience as to what you are saying. 
   I don't know about other aspects of your clear conscience, but know what you are doing because anybody who will take the time to read the RECORD of what happened over the last 2 days will have no doubt as to what you are doing. I know most folks don't read the RECORD. But you have, you listened, and your staff listened. You know the facts. You know what is at stake. You know the right thing to do.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I again appreciate the indulgence of the Senator from Illinois who has been incredibly patient now for 50 minutes. 
   Let me make a couple points first to the Senator from California. She seems to object to the term ``anecdote'' in referring to the cases that were brought here. I looked up the word ``anecdote'' in the dictionary right at the leader's desk, the Standard College Dictionary.  
   Anecdote: A brief account of some incident; a short narrative of an interesting nature.  
   I will put it over here and share it with the Senator from California, and if she finds that to be an offensive word in describing what she has presented, I think we have gotten rather touchy. 
   The Senators from New Jersey and California mentioned that the leading cause of death in California is gun violence among children. Wrong. The leading cause of death in California among children is abortion. The Senator from New Jersey said 13 children a day die of gun violence. Mr. President, 4,000 children a day die from abortions--4,000 children die a day--that some say they want legal, safe, and ``rare,'' 4,000 a day. 
   The Senator from New Jersey equates the medical procedure of partial-birth abortion to the equivalent of an appendectomy. That is not an appendix, I say to my colleagues.

   Mr. SANTORUM. I think the RECORD speaks for itself. 
   Mr. President, the Senator from California suggested this in her opening comments: Banning this procedure of taking a child who would otherwise be born alive, taking it outside of the mother and killing the child is an extreme view; banning this procedure is an extreme view in America. 
   Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio? This now defines ``extreme.'' Killing a child, a living being outside of its mother is now an extreme view in America. The mainstream view, according to the Senator from California, is the mother has the absolute, irrefutable right to destroy her child at any point in time for whatever reason. That is the mainstream view in America. 
   Our Nation turns its eyes to you, Joe. That is the mainstream view in America. So welcome to America; welcome to America 1999. Welcome to an America with which Peter Singer, the new prophet of America, who is from Australia, will feel most comfortable; Peter Singer, the philosopher who writes:  
   Killing a disabled infant is not morally equivalent to killing a person. Very often it is not wrong at all.  
   Welcome to America 1999 because this is killing an infant, and the reason given is because it is not perfect, and they say it is not morally wrong. And by the way, who are we to judge? Why is murder wrong if it is not morally wrong? Is it because we have a number of votes that ban murder? Is that the only reason, because the majority says we think murder is wrong? Not morally wrong because we can't make moral judgments; God forbid we make a moral judgment on the floor of the Senate. Oh, no, who am I to tell you that murder is wrong? I mean, how dare me. How can you tell me that murdering someone is wrong if it is not based on some moral judgment? 
   So, please, don't come down here and say I have no right to impose moral judgments. We do it every day in the Senate. How many speeches do I hear that it is immoral not to provide health insurance? That is immoral, this isn't. That is immoral and this isn't. 
   We can't judge anybody. We can't say that taking a child almost born outside of the mother, 3 inches from legal protection, and killing that baby in a barbaric fashion, we can't say that is wrong because that would be judging somebody else; we can't judge anybody here. Who are we to judge anybody? 
   Welcome to America 1999. Welcome to the mainstream America 1999. Welcome to the Peter Singers of the world. Read the New Yorker September 6 issue. Read it when he says:  
   If a pregnant woman has inconclusive results from amniocentesis, Singer doesn't see why she shouldn't carry the fetus to term. Then, if the baby is severely disabled and the parents prefer to kill it, they should be allowed to. That way there would be fewer needless abortions and more healthy babies.  
   Welcome to America because here you can find out if the baby is healthy or not. If you want to kill it, you can. If not, you can deliver it. Welcome to Peter Singer's world. 
   And you are not concerned about the lines drawn in America? You are not concerned we need to a have a bright line to prevent the Columbines in the future? When the Senator from California reads the Casey decision, doesn't she see Columbine in the Casey decision? What does the Casey decision say that she so proudly stands behind? ``At the heart of liberty is the right to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.....'' 
   A young boy in Littleton, CO, said the same thing just before he shot 13 people. He said: What I say goes; I am the law. 
   This is what the Casey decision says. It says each one of us has the right to determine our own reality. We are the law. We can do whatever we want to do. 
   God help us. God help us if that is the law of the land. God protect us, if that is the law of the land, from predators who think they can do whatever they want to do to us because they are the law; they can define their own meaning of existence. They can define their own meaning of the universe. They can define their own meaning of human life. God help us. 
   And where does this decision come from? It comes from the poisonous well of keeping procedures like this legal. Drink from it, America. Drink from it. I yield the floor.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, the amendment I offered to modify the language, directly on point, addresses the Eighth Circuit concern. It specifically talks about the baby having to be intact, living outside the mother, before the baby is killed. 
   The concern of the Eighth Circuit was that other forms of abortion that are performed in utero could be involved. This is absolutely, positively clear. We are not talking about that. We ban a particular procedure. All other procedures would be legal under this bill. So there is no undue burden. 
   Second, regarding the issue of health that Senator BOXER brings up, I have hundreds and hundreds of letters from obstetricians who say this is never, never medically necessary, and is never the only alternative, and it is never the preferred alternative. I have entered into the RECORD where the AMA has said that, and other organizations, 600 obstetricians. 
   On the other side is one organization, ACOG, which says, also, that it is never the only option, but says it may be necessary, or it may be the preferred procedure. For 3 years, we have asked for an example of when it would be the preferred procedure. They have never given us an example; never have they provided an example that backs up their specious claim that this is in some way, somehow, somewhere necessary. 
   It is not medically necessary. There is no health exception needed because it is an unhealthy procedure. This is the opportunity to draw the line in the sand about what is protected by the Constitution and what is not. A child three-quarters born deserves some protection. 
   Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, today the Senate will immediately resume debate on the motion to proceed to the partial-birth abortion bill. There will be 20 minutes of debate with a vote to occur at approximately 9:50 a.m. It is anticipated the motion will be adopted, and therefore debate on the bill will continue throughout the day. It is the hope of the majority leader that an agreement can be reached with regard to amendments so the bill can be completed by the close of business tomorrow. The Senate may consider any conference reports available for action. I thank my colleagues for their attention.

   Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, we will be voting on a motion to proceed to a bill that we have brought up in the Senate now for the third session of the Senate, third Congress in a row. I do not believe there is much controversy with respect to considering this bill. Obviously, this bill is going to pass, and it is going to pass by an overwhelming vote. 
   The concern that was voiced last night, and I think will be voiced today, is that we are moving off campaign finance reform to the partial-birth abortion bill. I am hopeful we can recognize that we had a good debate on campaign finance reform; amendments were offered; there were several days for those amendments to be offered; and it is apparent there is not enough votes to overcome cloture, to break a filibuster, if in fact that was going to be called for, and that it is time to move on to other business, whether it is partial birth or bankruptcy or appropriations bills and the like, and that a week, almost a week-long debate on the issue of campaign finance reform was, in fact, sufficient. 
   We know where the votes are going to come out. I don't think anyone is going to be changed by further debate and further amendments. It is time to move on to the other business at hand. I hope we can have some sort of comity here that would allow the business to continue. I think that would be good for all of us, particularly those of us who would not like to be here through the holidays for a long period of time, who would like to get back home after we finish our business to spend some time with our constituents in our States. 
   So, again, I think a fair debate was had, the votes are clear, and further debate will do nothing other than take up  the time of the Senate and delay action on important matters that we have to get to before we adjourn for the end of the year. 
   So with that, I am hopeful my colleagues, frankly, on both sides of the aisle will support moving off campaign finance reform. 
   With that, I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, again I ask my colleagues to join with me in voting to move to proceed to the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. It is a bill that is important business. It is something that has overwhelming support in the Senate. I hope we can move to this issue. 
   If there is a need to debate campaign finance reform in the future, then that is a matter for the leaders to work out, whether we want to come back to that issue. I think we have spent enough time on this bill. It is very clear where this issue is going. At least the issues of McCain-Feingold and Shays-Meehan do not have the necessary votes to pass in this Senate. Maybe there are other kinds of campaign finance that could, and maybe we could use this time over the next several months to find some middle ground to get a compromise.  
   We are not there right now. It is time to move on with the business of the Senate and the American people. 
   I yield the remainder of my time.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, we now, somewhat belatedly, begin the debate on partial-birth abortion. To review the actions of this body on this issue and the actions of the Congress, this is the third time this bill or some form of this bill has been voted on to pass the Senate. We passed this bill in 1995 and in 1997. Here we are again in 1999. We had two override attempts of the President's veto in 1996 and 1998, and I am fairly sure we will probably have another attempt on a Presidential veto override next year, in the year 2000. 
   Each time this bill has been voted on, succeeding Congresses picked up votes. In other words, we have gotten closer to the two-thirds necessary, 67 Senators, to override an anticipated Presidential veto. I am hopeful we will continue that trend. We started in 1995 with a vote of 55 or 56 Senators supporting banning this procedure. As of the vote last year, we were up to 64 Senators in this body agreeing this procedure is not necessary. It is, in fact, unhealthy and it is a threat to the health and life of the mother, as well as being a brutal and barbaric procedure. 
   I am hopeful through the course of this debate we can have a fair debate about this issue. Some have tried to turn this into a broader debate about abortions and view this as just the first shot at Roe v. Wade, an attempt to put a chink in the armor, intimating there is a grand agenda to try to chip away abortion rights that were given by the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade. 
   Let me assure my colleagues that is not my intention. This bill is a straightforward piece of legislation that deals with a specific procedure. 
   In fact, I am hopeful we will be able, through an amendment process, to make it even more clear we are referring simply to the procedure known as  partial-birth abortion. I will describe what that procedure is in a moment. But there is no such intent here. In fact, one of the reasons we are offering this amendment is because we believe this comports with Roe v. Wade; that this is a constitutional restriction and, in fact, it falls outside the concerns of Roe v. Wade because the baby is outside of the mother. The baby is no longer in the mother's womb. 
   So decisions have been made in the courts across the country. There have been several State bans that have been held unconstitutional, one that was held constitutional. So my guess is we will continue to see States deal with this issue, courts continue to be all over the map, some saying it is unconstitutional, some saying it is constitutional, until we get, finally, to the Supreme Court and they can look at it. I am confident it is constitutional. 
   Having said that, we just finished a debate on campaign finance reform where the very Members who stand before the body to say we cannot pass this because it is unconstitutional voted for campaign finance reform bills that are clearly unconstitutional, clearly in violation of the Supreme Court's edict on allowing unlimited soft money. But they come here and say: We think the Court is wrong and we are going to ban it anyway. This is directly on point with a Supreme Court decision. 
   In our case, with partial-birth abortion, where the baby is killed in the process of being born, the baby is outside the mother, under Roe v. Wade they let stand a Texas statute that was under appeal under Roe v. Wade prohibiting the killing of a child in the process of being born. 
   So in a sense we have a case on point in Roe v. Wade that says this kind of thing is, in fact, constitutional. Yet you will hear the arguments, I am sure, at length in the next day or two that we cannot pass this because some courts have said this is unconstitutional. I think at best that is an unclear argument. At worst, I would argue it is clearly constitutional because of the Roe v. Wade decision. 
   To make that argument the very day--or the day after, now--many of the Members making this argument vote for something that is clearly unconstitutional because they want to send it to the Court and have the Court take another look at it strikes me as a little disingenuous; that you would make one argument one day and do a 180 degree turn and say we cannot pass it because it is unconstitutional when the day before you pass what you know is unconstitutional and you hope the Court will change its mind. 
   I think now what I want to do is go through briefly what a partial-birth abortion is, how it is performed, when it is performed, who performs it, where it is performed, and why. If I could first start out with a chart that describes the procedure, you can see this is a baby. By the way, that is at least 20 weeks of gestation. During a 40-week gestational period, partial-birth abortions are performed on babies who are at least 20 weeks. So this is a late-term abortion. This is a second- and in some cases a third-trimester abortion. Let me start with how it starts. 
   First, the mother presents herself to the abortion clinic. The abortionist decides what procedure he or she wants to use to kill the baby. In a small percentage of second- and 
   third-trimester abortions, a partial-birth abortion is used. It is not the most common method of abortion in late trimester. In fact, it is relatively rare. We are not sure of the numbers. The reason we are not sure of the numbers is we have to rely on the abortion industry--which, by the way, opposes this bill--to give us their numbers on how many they say they do. The Federal Government does not keep track of the method of abortion used in the second and third trimester. In fact, they don't keep track of the method of abortion period. So we do not know from any Government statistics or any independent source how many of these abortions are performed. We only can go by what the opponents of this bill tell us is the number. 
   They originally told us there were just a few hundred. Then a report came out in a paper in northern New Jersey, the Bergen County Record, and they just happened to have a good reporter who thought maybe he would ask his local abortion clinic how many of these abortions were performed. He took the time, as reporters I think would want to do, to find out the accuracy of the story he was reporting. He contacted an abortion clinic in northern New Jersey and the abortion clinic there said they did 1,500 a year at that clinic. Where the national organization said they did 500 nationally, there were 1,500 done at that clinic. The person at the clinic who said they did 1,500 there said they had trained a couple of other abortionists who perform them in New York, in addition to the 1,500 that were done there. 
   So when I say a small percentage, that is what has been reported to us, again, by the people who oppose this and who realize the more they report the harder it is for them to defend. Because, again, what you hear the President and other advocates of this procedure talk about is this is a rare case--just to protect the mother's health or life, in the case of a severely deformed baby, so it is very rarely done. What we found is that is not the case. 
   I think it is clear and many have admitted since within the abortion industry, that is just not true. So what we have is a case where we do not know how many are performed but we believe, according to them, it is around 5,000 or more a year. I want to stop right there and pause for a minute. I want everybody to think if we heard about the murder of 5,000 children a year through a procedure or some act of violence--if we heard about 5,000 a year, people would be marching on Congress and saying: How can you let 5, much less 5,000, babies be killed in such a horrific way? But because we put it under the rubric of abortion, it is OK. 
   What I want to show today, looking at this procedure, is this is not like abortion. This is like infanticide. This is a baby who is all but born and then killed. So I think we need to look at it and have this debate focus on not the issue of abortion because there are plenty, as is evidenced by the numbers, of other procedures available to perform abortions. This is a rogue procedure that is infanticide. That is why Members on both sides of the aisle who are supporters of abortion rights have joined with us because they believe this is a step too far. We have drawn the line in the wrong place. Once the baby is in the process of being born, we have to say: Wait a minute; this baby is now outside of the mother, almost outside of the mother. This is not abortion anymore. 
   What happens is the mother presents herself to the 
    abortionist and the abortionist decides they would like to do an intact D&E, or a partial-birth abortion. What happens is the abortionist will give the mother pills to dilate the mother's cervix so the abortionist can then perform the abortion. Not immediately; this is a 3-day procedure. The mother comes back in 2 days. On the third day, after she has taken the pills the first day and the second day, she presents herself back to the abortionist with the cervix dilated. 
   I can get into all the health reasons why this is dangerous and could lead to infections and problems, and what we have seen, not just infections but it can lead to and, in fact, has led to babies being born as a result of the dilation of the cervix. The mothers go into labor and babies are born and born alive. In fact, we have cases in the last few weeks where a baby who was to have been aborted through a partial-birth abortion was born alive and is alive today. By the way, this is a perfectly healthy little girl. So when the argument is these babies wouldn't live or these babies are deformed or it is for the health of the mother, none of this is true. None of this is true. 
   Now we have cases--in fact, just in the last few weeks, a case where this baby is alive today. Another baby was born alive but not attended to by the abortionist, not attended to. They let the baby die. 
   Again, the point I am trying to make is, the line is a very important one. You can see from the case where the baby was allowed to die that once we begin to think of this little baby outside the mother as just a disposable item, then we have lost something. We have blurred the line, which I do not think we as a society want to allow to be blurred, about who is protected by our Constitution and our right to life. 
   Clearly, I hope we all believe that once a baby is born, that baby is entitled to life. Where we draw the line as  to when that occurs is significant. That is why many people who are, again, for abortion rights say: Once the baby is outside, I am a little uncomfortable saying you can kill the baby, as well they should. 
   The mother presents herself, on the third day of the cervix being dilated, to the abortionist. The abortionist uses an ultrasound to examine the mother and guide the abortionist to insert forceps in through the cervix, up into the uterus. 
   Those of you who have been involved in the birth of children know--we have six children--babies are usually at that age in a head-down position. They move around, but as they go further in pregnancy, the baby usually has its head in the down position. 
   They reach up with the forceps and grab the baby by the foot or the leg. Again, this is a 20-week-plus baby. We have plenty of documentation that this has gone on at 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, and even older--but rare as it gets older, I admit that. This is a fully developed baby that would otherwise, if delivered at this week of gestation, be born alive. 
   They take the baby and grab the leg with the forceps. Then 
    they turn the baby around in the uterus. Many of you are familiar with the term ``breech birth.'' When you present yourself for delivery of a baby and you are told your baby is in a breech position, bells and whistles go off. Obstetricians get very nervous because there are a lot of difficulties with delivering a baby in a breech position. There are a lot of complications, obviously for the baby, but also for the mother. To deliberately turn a baby into a breech position, by common sense, endangers the mother. Obviously, in abortion it dramatically endangers the baby. 
   They take the leg, and they pull the baby feet first out of the uterus through the birth canal. All of the baby is delivered except for the head. The entire baby is outside the mother with the exception of the baby's head. Again, we get back to the question, Is this an abortion or is this infanticide? 
   The reason this debate is so crucial is that it is where worlds intersect. It is the line we are going to draw. There are a lot of people who are for abortion rights who say: Look, the line is, the baby is inside the mother; the mother can abort the baby, period. And they say: But yes, obviously, when the baby is outside the mother, you cannot kill the baby. 
   This is where the worlds intersect because we have a situation where the baby is almost outside the mother. This baby would be born alive because this procedure occurs after 20 weeks. What the abortionist does is deliver the baby, all but the head. Why? Because the head is the largest part of the body at that age, so the most difficult to deliver. 
   There is also some question that if the baby comes out head first and once the head is delivered, will the Constitution treat it differently, if the head comes out first as opposed to the feet coming out first? Some have argued that once the baby's head is through the cervix, that is birth, so maybe they are under constitutional rights. 
   Do you see how fuzzy this line is, and do you see why some on both sides of this issue believe it is important to draw the line so we do not get into this rather difficult situation? 
   The baby is delivered, all but the head. The abortionist then does a barbaric thing. I even think those who support this procedure would argue and would agree with me that this is barbaric. This is a living baby, a human being. It is delivered outside of the mother. Its arms, its legs, its torso are outside the mother. The doctor, because they cannot see; it is a blind procedure--the baby is face down--feels up the spine to the base of the neck, base of the skull, top of the neck, finds the point at the bottom of the base of the skull, takes a pair of scissors, and jams it into the base of the baby's skull. 
   I do not have to tell you, a baby at 20-plus weeks has a fully developed--I should not say fully--has a developed nervous system and feels pain, acutely some have suggested, more than you would feel pain. A medical doctor takes a pair of scissors and jabs the baby in the skull. 
   Nurse Brenda Shafer, who testified before the Senate and House Judiciary Committees, described the reaction of one of the babies when this occurred. The baby threw out its arms and legs. If you ever held a little baby and you gently bounced them in your arms, they stick out their arms because they are not sure, they lose their equilibrium. She said it was just like that. The little baby lost its equilibrium and then fell down. 
   The baby is dead now. The abortionist has killed the baby that was 3 inches from being protected by the Constitution. Three inches more and everybody in America would say--everybody but a couple of people in Princeton--that baby should no longer be able to be killed. But for those 3 inches, that little baby is allowed to be executed in the most painful, brutal, insensitive, barbaric fashion of which I think any of us have heard. 
   To add insult to injury--let me put it a different way. To add insult to execution, they take the suction catheter, insert it in the hole made by the scissors, and they suction out the baby's brains. 
    And a baby's skull is soft. It has those plates that move, grow, allow the baby's head to expand. The baby's head just collapses as a result of the suction. And then this otherwise beautiful, healthy, normal baby--that would otherwise be born alive and, in a vast majority of the numbers, particularly after 22 weeks, would not only be born alive but would be viable outside the mother--is then extracted completely from the womb. 
   If you described what I just described as a procedure done on any human being in some foreign country as a way of torture, the American public would be aghast, they would be outraged, outraged that such barbarism could occur in a civilized country. But this barbarism occurs every single day in America. Thousands of times a year, little babies are killed in this brutal fashion. Why? I will get to that in a minute. 
   Who performs this? And where, by the way? Is this performed in hospitals? The answer to that is no. No hospital would do an abortion such as this. Is this in the medical literature? The answer is no. It is not taught in any medical school. It is not taught anywhere except by the developer and another person from Ohio who developed this procedure. 
   Is the person who developed this abortion technique a well-known obstetrician, someone who is board certified, someone who is an expert in internal fetal medicine? No. No. Not only is this person not board certified, not only is this person not an expert in internal fetal medicine, this person is not even an obstetrician. 
   The person who developed this procedure was a family practice doctor who, I guess, could not make it saving children so went into the abortion business and developed this procedure, not because this was a procedure that was in the best interest of anybody concerned, except the abortionist, but because this is a much simpler procedure in the sense it takes less time, so you can do more abortions during a day. It takes less time than other late-term abortions, so you can do more of them. And, of course, when you get paid for these, the more you can do, the more money you make. 
   Why is this procedure done? You will hear arguments today that this procedure is done to protect the life and health of the mother--that is what you will hear: life and health--and another thing which is health related: the future fertility of the mother. We will have a long debate about that. I am not going to take a lot of time in my opening statement about that, but I do want to address it briefly. 
   No. 1, life. There is a clear life-of-the-mother exception in this bill. If this procedure needs to be used to protect the life of the mother, it can be used. Having said that, the person who developed this procedure, the person who does, from what we know--again, we do not have good information--most of these kinds of procedures, a guy named Dr. Haskell from Ohio, has said under oath in a court of law--in a court of law, under oath--that this procedure is never used to protect the life of the mother. 
   Under oath, in a court of law, what would seemingly be an admission against his own interest, in one of these suits that challenges the constitutionality of this, he admitted, as, frankly, has everybody else--except a few folks on the other side of the aisle who have it in their mind that somehow this is needed to save the life of the mother--it is never used.  
   Do you know what we say? Fine. It is never used? We will 
    still put it in the bill. If there is some strange occurrence that no obstetrician I have heard of has come forward with to say needs to be used to protect the life of the mother, it is covered. 
   Think about this intuitively. This is why the doctor arrived and why everybody who has looked at this issue has arrived at the conclusion that this is never used to protect the life of the mother. 
   If you had a mother who presents herself in a life-threatening situation, would you give her two pills and say come back in 3 days? You do not have to be an obstetrician to figure this one out, folks. If someone is in a life-threatening situation, you do not give them two pills and say go home and come back in 3 days, and dilate their cervix during that 3-day period. 
   So the argument that this is somehow used to protect the life of the mother is as bogus as a number of other lies I will go through here in a minute that have been put forward by the other side to stop this procedure from being banned. 
   Second, health. Again, same doctor, same case. Different question: Is this procedure ever necessary to protect the health of the mother? Again, the abortionist who helped develop the procedure, who uses it more than anybody else, testifying in court, under oath: Is this necessary to protect the health of the mother? Answer: No. No. 
   But you will see people come to the floor and talk about, oh, how this is absolutely necessary, how this is an important health issue for women. We have over 400 obstetricians, most of them board certified, many of them specialists in maternal-fetal medicine, who have written letters, who have signed documents, including the AMA--which is not a pro-life organization, I might add--who have signed letters saying this is bad medicine; it is never necessary to protect the health of the mother to do this procedure. 
   Yet people will come down to this floor and say: Well, I can't be for this because I need a health-of-the-mother exception and put up ``cases'' where this was done and, as a result of this, the mother was able to have more children, was able to do other things; and if this procedure were not done, then they would not have this opportunity. 
   I would not argue that this procedure could result in a positive outcome for the mother's health. Certainly it could. But that is not the question. The question here is, Is it necessary--the answer is, no--to protect the health of the mother or the life of the mother. 
   And second, is it the best method? Clearly, given what we know about this procedure and its profound implications on who we are as a society, the answer has to be emphatically--I hope from this body, which is so concerned about the consuming problem of violence in our society--I think a group of people who stand up and complain about shootings at Columbine will look at this and say: Wait a minute. If we're saying this kind of brutality is OK, if the Senate and the President of the United States say this kind of brutality of our children is OK, then how in the world can we be aghast when other violence is done to our children? 
   If we can stand here, with straight faces, and with passion in some cases, and argue that this kind of execution is not only legitimate but preferable, proper, constitutional, necessary, how can we be even the least surprised that young 
   people, looking at what goes on in the world around them--obviously, they get a lot of bad messages from Hollywood and from the media, but they only need to look to the Senate and to this President to get their cue. The cue is violence is OK, as long as there is some purpose to be served. And the purpose is to make sure we don't have a chink in the armor of abortion rights. That is the purpose. 
   The question is, Why are they fighting this so hard? What is really the problem? Why are they fighting what is an abomination? It is uncomfortable to talk about it. I am sure for those listening it is very difficult to listen. This is not a pleasant subject. Why would you want to get up year after year and fight this issue? What is the great cause at stake that we have to draw the line in the sand? 
   They will argue it is the health of the mother. It is not true. That has never stopped them from arguing that. But when you have the people who perform the abortions saying under oath that it is not true, it is darn hard to come here and say this is why we want to do it, and for those of us who have to listen to it, to say: Is this really what is at stake? Is this really the issue? Or is there something else going on? Is there an agenda? 
   I can tell you what the agenda is on our side. The agenda is very simple. At a time when we are faced with senseless, irrational violence, with a culture that is insensitive to life and promotes death through our music, through videos, just a little beacon of hope, a little grain of sand of affirmation that life is, in fact, something to be cherished, not to be brutalized; that there are lines in our society that we can't blur, that we shouldn't cross, because when we do that, we throw in doubt, for millions of children and adults, the issue of, well, maybe this isn't so wrong. We cloud the issue, the issue of life for children that are 3 inches away from constitutional protection. Don't you think that is a good place to draw the 
    line? Don't you think that is a reasonable place to say, OK, enough is enough? 
   No one is standing here arguing overturning Roe v. Wade. In fact, I will make the argument, this is legitimate under Roe v. Wade. There is nothing here that will, even if it goes to the Court, overturn Roe v. Wade. It is not our intention with this act. 
   This act is an attempt, and I would argue a feeble attempt--many of you listening were around 30, 40 years ago. Could you imagine walking onto the Senate floor 40 years ago, turning on the television and seeing Walter Cronkite report on the debate on the Senate floor about whether this should be legal in America? Can you imagine 40 years ago that we would even have a debate in the Senate about whether this would be allowed in America? 
   There isn't a person in the Senate who, 40 years ago, would have said this is OK. They would have been appalled. Well, maybe in Nazi Germany or maybe in the Soviet Union, but in America, this? No. But how far we have come. How much more civilized we have become. How culturated we have become that now 40 years hence we can have these kinds of rational debates and people can come to the floor of the Senate and say that thrusting a pair of scissors in the base of the skull of a little baby is OK. How far we have come. How humanity has grown and developed. How sophisticated we are that we can find precise legal arguments that will weave us through this web of destruction and say, but it is OK. Americans go to sleep at night knowing that thousands of children, almost born, inches from reaching toward that constitutional protection, can be executed. We are all better for it. We are better as a society for this. 
   They will not say that, but underneath the argument is this: This being legal is better for America. When people come and cast their votes, you will have to cast the vote saying that allowing this to occur in America is better for us. It is preferable in the United States of America that this occurs. We want this to continue. We believe this is right. We believe this is just. We believe this is humane. We believe this is in the best spirit of America, liberty, and freedom. 
   How twisted, how twisted we have become. How we contort ourselves to find that path through rights to allow this to be the best that we are in America. We are better than that. This country stands for higher ideals and principles than that. A majority of the Senate will agree with me. A majority of the House will agree with me, a majority of Americans. But that is not enough. 
   So this contorted construction of freedom will continue to be legal. Can you envision our Founding Fathers with these charts in front of them saying: This is the product of liberty? This is the product of the high ideals that we suffered through in revolutionary, civil, and major world wars to preserve? This is what it has come to? This is the personification of liberty in America today? It is no wonder we are concerned when we tuck our children into bed at night and we see what kind of world is ahead of them. How much more will we be able to twist freedom and liberty to destroy their true freedoms? I tuck five little ones in bed every night. I wonder, I wonder what is in store for them, 
    if we continue as the Senate, the greatest deliberative body  in the world, to allow this wanton destruction of the most vulnerable in our society. Where are we headed? 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator very much for yielding. The reason I am going to ask the question is an article written by two Northwestern health care physicians from Northwestern University in Evanston, IL, who cited the same statement out of the select panel. They went on to say, after they quoted what you quoted in your letter:  
   However, no specific examples of circumstances under which intact D&X will be the appropriate.  
   In fact, in subsequent communications with ACOG and others, we have asked, give us one set of medical--any set of medical circumstances where you believe that this ``may be--whatever.'' 
   Never have we gotten any circumstance where that was the case. So they say it may be, but no one to date has provided any circumstance, as hypothetical as you want, where, in fact, it would be. 
   Just to say it may be without giving evidence of what it was, I think my question is--I think the next question to which you hopefully can get an answer, I can't--you say it may be. Give me a for instance. So far, we have not been able to get any for instance.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of the Senator, and I appreciate his good faith in offering this amendment. I am not going to discuss that amendment specifically right now, although I certainly will. 
   I have a couple of comments. First off, it has to be noted here that partial-birth abortions are performed--this is according to the people who perform them--well over 90 percent of the partial-birth abortions that are performed--and some have suggested much higher than 90 percent--on healthy babies and healthy mothers. Healthy babies, healthy mothers. A very small percentage are the cases that you have heard brought up here today. 
   The question is then posed: Well, who are we to make the decision about these tough cases? I think even the Senator from Illinois would say, if it is a healthy mother and baby and this procedure isn't necessary, I have some problems. I think a lot of Members who have voted against this bill have said, if it is that case--but there are these cases. I am happy to address those cases, but let me do it in a broader context. 
   The reason we inject ourselves is the same reason the Supreme Court has injected itself into the debate on second-  and third-trimester abortions. It is because we are not talking about removing a tumor. It is not where we are going to say you should not remove this cancerous tumor this way or that way or that appendix that way. What we are talking about here is killing a baby--from my perspective, particularly killing a baby in such a barbaric fashion--which is almost born and is almost protected by the Constitution. So I understand the concern that we should not be practicing medicine. No one is practicing medicine here. What we are doing here is drawing a very important line about what we will allow in our society when it comes to killing a living human being. I don't think anybody is going to question that the baby is living and it is a human being. So what we are talking about here is how can you kill a living human being? 
   What we are saying is you should not be able to kill a living human being that is almost born, especially in a brutal fashion. The reason is because of how horrendous this is. It creates some real slippery slopes when the Senator from California gets up and says, ``I want every child to be wanted.'' So now if you are not wanted, you are not protected by the Constitution and that is the way it works? If you are not wanted as a child, you don't get protection. What if you're not wanted as a Senator. Do you not get protection? I don't think we want to go down that road. 
   I am concerned, particularly as we talk about this procedure, where the baby is three inches away from protection from the Constitution, and when you get into this area and say, people have to have all the rights to do whatever they want. That is not what the Constitution says. That is not what we have said here. We have drawn a line because we think it is important for society to draw lines about what is, in fact, legal and what is not.

   Mr. SANTORUM. I understand that very well. I just say this. What we have been told by the overwhelming amount of medical evidence--and, again, it gets back to the discussion we had earlier about whether this procedure is the only appropriate procedure--what 
   we have been told over and over again is that this is never medically necessary. In this circumstance, this is not the only procedure that could be used, No. 1. 
   Again, we have overwhelming medical evidence saying that this is, in fact, not the safest--in fact, is the most dangerous. Even the person who wrote the textbook on second- and third-trimester abortions, a guy by the name of Warren Hern, who talks about this procedure--he does more second- and third-trimester abortions than any other abortionist in the country--says, ``I have serious reservations about this procedure. You really can't defend it. I would dispute any statement that says this is the safest procedure to use.'' 
   This is an abortionist from Colorado who does more third-trimester abortions than anybody in the country. 
   My point is not that we should say you can't have an abortion if that is what the person wants at that point. But there are other options other than an intact D&E. There are other abortion options, as the Senator explored in his statement. There is the caesarean section, depending on what the problem is. You have the Alan Guttmacher Institute which looked at statistics on abortion. They say that abortion is twice as risky to the life of the mother as is delivery in the second- and third-trimester.

   Mr. SANTORUM. We are very clear. I don't think this is a problem under Roe v. Wade. I think we are very clear, and are, frankly, working on making it clearer in the definition dealing with the issue of vagueness because that has been raised, as the Senator mentioned, in the court cases across the country. Even though one case held it to be constitutional, we are looking into ways in which we can tighten that definition. 
   To make sure, what we are saying is, look, if an abortion is what the mother chooses, or a family chooses, it is legal under certain circumstances in the second- and third-trimester, in almost all circumstances. But we are saying this procedure, because of the very difficult slippery slope of having an almost born child being killed, should not be allowed.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Because there are safer alternatives available according to all of the medical literature, and we have definitive statements from obstetricians, hundreds of them, as well as people from Northwestern--I will be happy to share the article with the Senator--from a fairly reputable medical school; I am sure the Senator would say one of the best medical schools. But we have overwhelming evidence that there are safer procedures to use, that this is a rogue practice. It is not used much. And, again, according to Warren Hern, he can't defend this procedure. It is something that should not be used. It is not safe. 
   I will show you arguments. I don't have it handy, but we will enter into the RECORD an analysis of the cases that you have made by obstetricians who will say under these circumstances there would have been a safer course, a better course than what was done by the physicians in this case. What we are saying is it is not the best medicine, period. It is not medically necessary, period. And it is a barbaric infringement on the rights of an almost born child. 
   I agree. This is a very narrow bill.

   Mr. SANTORUM. This is not commonly practiced. It is only practiced with a few thousand abortions a year. Given the fact there are 1.4 million abortions, a few thousand abortions, it is not something that is practiced in every abortion clinic. I think a lot of abortion clinics will say this is a rogue practice. That is not to say people do not practice medicine that is somewhat strange. There are a lot of people who do things in medicine that are not considered to be medically sound judgments. That doesn't mean that they aren't done. They are, in fact, done. This is a situation where we believe that is the case. This is a rogue procedure. Someone may be sued. I don't know. Maybe someone has. I am not aware of someone being sued. But, again, the person most likely to sue would be the child that is dead. I am not too sure that in the case of the mother that is necessarily a most common thing you will see. I don't think a lot of abortionists are sued, period. 
   I would like to address a couple of issues that the Senator from California brought up, and then the Senator from Illinois. 
   First, to state very clearly what the Senator from California said, talking about the murder of abortionists and snipers firing at people, I am against murder. I think everybody who supports this legislation--and, frankly, everybody in this Chamber agrees--believes that acts of violence against anybody on the issue of abortion is counterproductive to an effort that seeks to affirm life. Certainly, taking the law into their own hands is an outrage, is offensive to me, is wrong, and should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. There is no room in a movement that talks about nonviolence--and violence toward babies in utero--for condoning actions of violence of any sort, whether it is murder or attempted murder or destruction of property, et cetera. I don't stand here condoning that, and I would join with the Senator from California to condemn it and condemn it in the strongest words possible. That is no service to those who are trying to get the country's ear in defense of innocent human life. 
   I want to correct what the Senator from California said also about no court has found our language in this bill constitutional. That is not true. The court in Wisconsin has found this language to be constitutional. It is now being appealed to the Seventh Circuit. The law is enjoined upon appeal. But, again, we have a district court that has found this to be constitutional. 
   I would like to go through again, quoting from the Journal of the American Medical Association, an article printed in 1998, a year ago in August, by two obstetricians from Northwestern University, and go through again why this procedure--it keeps coming back to two issues, as the Senator from Illinois talked about. 
   One, the term is too vague. The definition is too vague. 
   I will be addressing that. Hopefully, in the next couple of days we will work on that, although I think, frankly, the definition is perfectly clear. We are willing to work and to see whether we can make it a little bit more definitive. 
   Second, that this may be necessary to protect the health of the mother, again, that is the discussion in which the Senator from Illinois and I were just engaged. 
   I want to restate again how overwhelming the evidence is of people who can definitively state without question that over 400 obstetricians around the country say it is never medically necessary. 
   C. Everett Koop--as the Senator from Illinois said, is never medically necessary. 
   It is a pretty strong term to say it is never medically necessary. 
   What do we have on the other side? We have some anecdotes about cases where it was used, but in no case do they state that was the only option or that was the best option. 
   On our side we have the abortionist, Dr. Haskell from Ohio, who probably does more of these abortions than any other person. He says it is never--underline never--medically necessary to protect the life of the mother and not medically necessary to protect the health of the mother. The abortionist himself says that. 
   On the other side, we have the statement from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. That is the argument on the other side. This whole debate on health is centered around an organization that is very pro-abortion that says they put together a select panel that:  
   ..... could identify no circumstances under which this procedure would be the only option to save the life or preserve the health of the woman.  
   This is an organization that opposes this bill. This is an organization they rely upon to hold on to the ``health exception.'' That is the cover behind not voting for this bill. 
   There are two arguments: Health of the mother--we need that, otherwise we can't vote for this if we don't have that--and it is too vague, the definition is too vague. 
   The organization they rely upon says they can:  
   ..... identify no circumstances under which this procedure would be the only option to save the life or preserve the health of the woman and that an intact D&X, however--  
   This is what they hold on to--  
   ..... may be the best or most appropriate procedure in a particular circumstance to save the life or preserve the health of the woman, and only the doctor, in consultation with the patient, based upon the woman's particular circumstances, can make this decision.  
   That is their rationale. It ``may be,'' and we should ``leave it to the doctor and the patient.'' ``May be.'' OK, fine. It may be. 
   We have asked this organization to provide one circumstance--just one. By the way, we have asked them now for 3 years to give one circumstance where we can have peer review by obstetricians, have them look at their circumstance where this ``may be'' the best option. Give a hypothetical; give an example we can actually examine. 
   What is the answer from that organization? Nothing. 
   They say it ``may be.'' We can't say how, we can't give any evidence of it, but ``it may be.'' Because it may be--which is not substantiated--that is the health exception they need. 
   It is pretty lame. If they cannot come forward and give facts, we need a health exception because it ``may be,'' but if we cannot give circumstances where that is the case, where is the health exception? 
   They admit it is not the only way. The AMA has said it is not good medicine; it is a rogue procedure, and the AMA is a pro-choice organization. That is what their board votes. 
   Again, it is hard for me to argue against ``May be's,'' without specifics. That is what we have. Members are hiding behind ``we need a health exception because it may be.'' This is a debate about facts. We have hundreds and hundreds of physicians who say it may be never the best option; it will never be the best option; there are always better alternatives. 
   From the point of view of someone who is on the Senate floor and whose job it is to look at all the information, to be able to make a judgment, don't hide behind a health exception that doesn't exist and is not substantiated. Just because it is substantiated by anecdotes of people who used them because it happened to save them, that doesn't mean there weren't better options at the same time. Just because this worked to save the health of the mother doesn't mean there weren't better options. 
   Mr. President, 400 years ago we used to bleed people, and it probably helped some people, but that doesn't mean there weren't better options. We are saying, what is the best option? Why do we want the best option? This is not removing a tumor. This is killing a baby that is outside the mother. That is why we don't like this procedure. 
   This is not practicing medicine and telling doctors how to do their business. If this were about an ingrown toenail, we wouldn't care. This is about  killing a living human being--about killing a living human being. I don't think anybody on the floor will argue with that. We are talking about killing a living human being. That is this far away from the Constitution saying ``no.'' This far. 
   I will read from this article the rationale given by these physicians as to why they believe this is not the best procedure for mothers from a health perspective.  
   There exist no credible studies on intact D&X--  
   This is a rogue procedure--  
   ..... that evaluate or attest to its safety. The procedure is not recognized in medical textbooks nor is it taught in medical schools or in obstetrics and gynecology residencies. Intact D&X poses serious medical risks to the mother. Patients who undergo an intact D&X--  
   Intact D&X is a partial-birth abortion as defined in the bill--  
   are at risk for the potential complications with any surgical midtrimester termination, including hemorrhage, infection, and uterine perforation. However, intact D&X places these patients at increased risk of two additional complications.  
   So a traditional late-term abortion has certain risks associated with it, according to these doctors from Northwestern University. But this procedure has two other complications in addition to the ones already inherent in a late-term abortion:  
   First, the risk of uterine rupture may be increased. An integral part of the D&X procedure is an internal podalic version, during which the physician instrumentally reaches into the uterus, grasps the fetus' feet, and pulls the feet down into the cervix, thus converting the lie to a footling breach. The internal version carries risk of uterine rupture, abruption, amniotic fluid embolus, and trauma to the uterus. 
   The second potential complication of intact D&X is the risk of iatrogenic laceration and secondary hemorrhage. Following internal version and partial breech extraction, scissors are forced into the base of the fetal skull while it is lodged in the birth canal. This blind procedure risks maternal injury from laceration of the uterus or cervix by the scissors and could result in severe bleeding and the threat of shock or even maternal death. 
   These risks have not been adequately quantified. 
   None of these risks are medically necessary because other procedures are available to physicians who deem it necessary to perform an abortion late in pregnancy. As ACOG policy clearly states, intact D&X is never the only procedure available. Some clinicians have considered intact D&X necessary when hydrocephalus is present.  
   Water on the brain.  
   However, a hydrocephalic fetus could be aborted by first draining the excess fluid from the fetal skull through ultrasound-guided.....[procedures.] Some physicians who perform abortions have been concerned that a ban on late term abortions would affect their ability to provide other abortion services. Because of the proposed changes in federal legislation, it is clear that only intact D&X would be banned.  
   I can and I will, throughout the course of the next couple of days, provide letter after letter signed by hundreds and hundreds of obstetricians, the best in their field, perinatologists, people who deal with maternal and fetal medicine, who say this procedure is dangerous, more dangerous to a woman. So the issue of health is a bogus one. It is a bogus issue. 
   Again I go back to Warren Hern, the author of ``Abortion Practice,'' the author who does more third-trimester abortions, I am told, than anybody else in America. He says:  
   I have very serious reservations about this procedure. You really can't defend it. I would dispute any statement that this is the safest procedure to use.  
   This is not a fan of this bill. So, again, all these comments and concerns about ``we have to protect health, we have to protect health''--if we outlawed this procedure, we would be protecting health. We would be protecting the health of women where doctors who do it do it for the convenience of the abortionist. 
   Do you want to know why it is done? It is done for the convenience of the abortionist, because they can do more in 1 day. That is why this procedure was developed. That is what they will tell you. That is, the doctor who invented this procedure, he will tell you that is why he did it. 
   On the other issue--and we will get to this a little later in the debate--the issue of vagueness, the Senator from California said every court in the country that has ruled on this has ruled it is vague or ruled it is unconstitutional. 
   First off, that is not true. Wisconsin ruled in fact it is constitutional. But I am willing to work with those who have genuine concerns about the issue of vagueness, to get a definition that makes people perfectly comfortable that we are not talking about any other form of abortion because it is not my intent, as has been ascribed to me, that what I am trying to do is eliminate all second- and third-trimester abortions. 
   What is clear about this debate and the debate that has been going on now for three Congresses is that we are not trying to do that. I think we have stood on the floor and said that is not our intent. Our intent is to get rid of a dangerous procedure. Yes, it is painful to the baby. Yes, it is dangerous to the mother. But it is also dangerous to our society, to be able to kill a baby that is this close to being born. I think it is something we have to stand up and draw the line on clearly, and that is what we are asking to do. 
   So to me it is pretty simple. We have no evidence this jeopardizes the health of the mother--none. We have 
   speculation, no facts. We have the vagueness concern. Again, I am willing to work on that issue. If that is a genuine concern that people have, I am willing to work on it to make sure we can make people comfortable that what we are talking about is only this procedure. 
   But once you get past those two concerns, I do not know what is left. I do not know why you defend this. I do not know why you defend killing a baby this far away from being born who would otherwise be born alive. I do not know how you defend it. 
   So I look forward to this debate over the next couple of days. I know the Senator from California feels very passionately about this, but I think the issue of where we draw the line constitutionally is very important. I am sure the Senator from California agrees with me. I think the Senator from California would say that she and I, the Senator from Illinois, the Senators from Arkansas and Kansas, we are all protected by the Constitution with the right to life. 
   Would you agree with that, Senator from California? Do you answer that question?

   I ask the Senator from California, again, you believe--you said ``once the baby comes home.'' Obviously, you don't mean they have to take the baby out of the hospital for it to be protected by the Constitution.

   Mr. SANTORUM. I was smiling at your characterization of my demeanor. I have not lost my temper. I think I am, frankly, very composed at this point. What I will say--and the Senator is walking away--is the Senator said, again, the baby is born when the baby is born. I said: If the foot is still inside the mother? She said: Well, no, you can't kill the baby. If the foot is inside, you can't, but if the head is the only thing inside, you can. 
   Here is the line. See this is where it gets a little funny.

   Mr. SANTORUM. It also involves--and that is the point I think the Senator from California is missing--it also involves when in the process--that is why people on both sides of the abortion issue support this bill, because it also involves what is infanticide and what is not. A lot of people who agree with you on the issue of abortion say this is too close to infanticide. This is a baby who is outside the mother. 
   Again, I will not put words in the Senator's mouth, but what I heard--and again I am willing to have that corrected by the RECORD and the Senator can correct me right now--what I heard her say is if the foot is inside the mother, no, you cannot kill the baby, but when the head is, you can. That is a pretty slippery slope.

   Mr. SANTORUM. If I can reclaim my time, first off, the Senator from California said this was an emergency procedure. Name me an emergency procedure that takes 3 days. That is what the procedure takes. That is one of the things that was put forward early in the debate, now risen again, that this is somehow an emergency procedure. It is not an emergency procedure. It is a 3-day procedure. 
   No emergency do you present yourself in an emergency condition and get sent home with pills for 3 days to present yourself back. 
   Again, I want to finalize, and then the Senator from Arkansas has been waiting for quite sometime, and I want to allow him to speak. This is not a clean issue. This is not a removal of a tumor. We are talking about drawing the line between what is infanticide and what is abortion, and that is why many of us are disturbed about this. No one is trying to reach in and outlaw abortions. 
   The Senator from Illinois and I were very clear about the limited scope of this bill. What we are saying is, this is too close to infanticide. This is barbaric. This fuzzies the line that is dangerous for the future of this country. And what you saw, as the Senator from California was hesitant to get involved in that because she realizes how slippery this slope is, that you can say the foot does, the head doesn't, maybe the ankle--folks, we don't want to go there. It is not necessary for the health of the mother, it is not necessary for the life of the mother, and if you don't believe me, believe the person who developed it because they said so. 
   I think we need to have a full debate, not just on narrow issues, but on the broader issue of what this means to the rights of every one of us born and unborn, sick and well, wanted and unwanted. I think the line needs to be a bright one. I yield the floor. 
   Mr. HUTCHINSON addressed the Chair.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   I am not going to debate the Harkin amendment. The Harkin amendment has nothing to do with the bill that is before us. The bill that is before us, as I have said over and over again, and I will say it again, is not about Roe v. Wade. One of the reasons we believe this bill is getting bipartisan support, as well as supporters on both sides of the abortion issue, is that it is outside the realm of Roe v. Wade. 
   I remind everyone that this is a baby in the process of being born. This is a baby who is almost outside of the mother except for 3 inches. 
   Again, I repeat that in Roe v. Wade, the original decision, which the Senator from Iowa was referring to, the Court let stand a Texas law that said you cannot kill a baby in the process of being born. 
   Again, we can have a vote on this. But we might as well be having a vote or another vote on the chemical weapons treaty. It is as related. This is not the subject. It is a completely different subject. If they want to have a vote on it, obviously the Senator has the right to offer an amendment. That is within the rights here in the Senate, and I certainly will stand by his right to offer that. 
   But to suggest somehow that the underlying bill is an assault on Roe v. Wade is again proof positive that when it comes to the real factual debate on what this procedure does, the response is: Well, let's change the subject. 
   I don't want to change the subject. Let's focus in on the facts. The facts are not anecdotes from people who aren't physicians about what happened to them. What happened in these cases you see and the pictures you see--I always believe, if 
   you argue the facts, argue the facts; if you can't argue the facts, argue the law; if you can't argue the law, then appeal to the sentimentality or emotion of the situation.  
   That is what this is. These are horrible situations, tragic situations, of pregnancies that have gone awry late in pregnancy. I sympathize with these people more than you know, to have something such as this happen for a child that you want desperately. I know the difficult decisions they have to make. I know what doctors tell you and how they influence your decision. 
   But the fact of the matter is, we can't in a legislative forum dealing with such an important issue deal with emotional stories as powerful as they are unless we look at the facts underlying those stories. The facts underlying those stories are very clear.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SANTORUM. They clearly state this was not medically necessary; this, in fact, was not in the best interests of the patient in this case; and this was, in fact, not good medicine. 
   Did it have a good result? Yes, it did in the sense the health of the women was not jeopardized. That does not mean there is a good result. It was the best practice. A lot of things are done that turn out OK that may not have been the best thing to do. I think that is what we are saying. More importantly, it is not medically necessary. In fact, it is medically more dangerous. 
   A group that said it ``may be'' necessary, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 3 years ago said: Clearly, it is not the only option. The proponents of partial-birth abortion are saying it is medically necessary. They want to keep this option open. If they don't, it is a violation of Roe v. Wade. 
   They stand behind anecdotes. In some cases, including the Viki Wilson case that Senator DURBIN brought up, it is clear from her testimony she did not have a partial-birth abortion. She says in her testimony the baby was dead inside of her womb and then the baby was delivered. If the baby dies inside the womb, it is outside the definition of the bill. The definition of the bill says a living baby is born. The baby was not living. 
   I don't want to pick apart the very tragic stories and make a very difficult situation even more difficult for these people because I understand the pain they have gone through. Our job is to not be clouded by personal anguish and tragic circumstances. Ours is to look at the underlying facts of what happened and what can happen in the future. 
   Again, we have over 600 obstetricians and gynecologists, specialists in perinatology, who say this is never medically necessary. The AMA says it is never medically necessary and is bad medicine. It is not a peer review procedure. It is not in the medical textbook. It is not taught in medical schools. It is not performed in hospitals. It is only performed at abortion clinics. Again, this is a rogue procedure. 
   They present case after case, as if this is some wonderful creation of medical science by some genius in obstetrics. I remind Members the person who created this procedure is not an obstetrician, much less a specialist in perinatology or difficult pregnancies. It is a family practitioner who only does abortions. 
   Again, I stress over and over again what seems to be the compassionate argument is a smokescreen. It is a smokescreen. It is not true. There is no compassion in allowing a procedure that is dangerous to the health of the woman to be continued any more than it is compassionate to prescribe any kind of medical treatment that is inappropriate. We have an overwhelming body of evidence saying it is bad medicine; it is inappropriate. 
   On the other side we have two things: One, stories, stories that turned out OK. In other words, the procedure was used--not in all cases; sometimes some of the people brought up in stories actually didn't have the procedure, and even those who did may have resulted in a good outcome--but it wasn't the proper course according to the overwhelming body of evidence. 
   The only thing counter, as far as factual comments by physicians, is the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. The pillar upon which they rest the 
   health-of-the-mother exception, the select panel they put together says they:  
   ......could identify no circumstances under which this procedure would be the only option to save the life or preserve the health of the woman.  
   It is not the only option. It is not the only option. 
   From the Wisconsin case that upheld the Wisconsin statute, quoting the judges: 
   Haskell, who invented the procedure, admitted that the D&X procedure is never medically necessary to save the life or preserve the health of the woman. 
   We have the person who invented it saying it is not medically necessary. 
   ACOG goes further and talks about whether it is preferable in some cases. Here is what they say:  
   An intact D&X [partial-birth abortion] however, may be the best or most appropriate procedure in a particular circumstance to save the life or preserve the health of a woman, and only the doctor, in consultation with the patient, based upon the woman's particular circumstances, can make this decision.  
   We have asked them to identify one of these circumstances. Give an example. They cannot say this may be the best thing for the health and life of the mother, may be preferable, and yet give no situation which can be reviewed by the medical community. That is what we have to base the judgment on. The medical community is saying it is necessary to protect the health of the mother. Yet they give no example, give no example as to when this, in fact, would be preferable. 
   We have a thorough smokescreen, anecdotes with many of the cases having nothing to do with partial-birth abortions; those that did, argued by hundreds of physicians as being bad practice of medicine, were an improper course of conduct. Then we have the only scientific group that says it is never medically necessary, never the only option, only that it ``may be'' the best thing. Yet they give no example and after repeated inquiry are still giving no examples. 
   Again, we come back to the health question. There is a dearth of evidence to support the position. 
   I am hopeful the Senator from Iowa can debate his amendment, saying somehow this is important vis-a-vis Roe v. Wade. I argue the opposite. This legislation has nothing to do with Roe v. Wade. I think when we are looking at specific amendments to deal with that issue, the constitutional issue of vagueness--again, that is not necessarily a Roe v. Wade issue, although it gets into the issue of undue burden. From my point of view, if we can tailor that definition narrowly to make sure we are talking about partial-birth abortion, it leaves open other methods of abortion to be used. It gets to the counterargument some have suggested, that all we are doing is trying to outlaw abortion, trying to restrict a woman's right. 
   No. All we are doing is, for gosh sakes, drawing a line about who is protected. When a baby is 3 inches from being completely born, that is too close. That is too close. We are going to get into a whole lot of issues when we start drawing lines. In fact, we have gotten into a lot of issues with respect to drawing the line. Now we are talking about assisted suicide. We talk about quality of life instead of life itself. 
   As the Senator from California said, we want everyone to be wanted. What if everyone isn't wanted? Is that license to get rid of them? It certainly is if you are in the womb. Now we are suggesting it certainly is if you are just outside the womb; it certainly is if you are within 3 inches of being born. If you are not wanted, too bad. If we draw the line that close, it is not a very long way to go to get where our new theologian at Princeton University, Dr. Singer, is coming from. He suggested that it is, in fact, the moral thing to do; that once the baby is born, if we don't like it, to kill it. 
   One might suggest this is outrageous; this could never happen in America. This is a professor at Princeton, 
   whose works, unfortunately, have been published in the popular press and hundreds of thousands of copies of this radical--I would consider it radical but on this floor maybe it is not radical. Maybe killing a baby after it is born, if it is not a healthy baby, is not a radical thing anymore. Certainly killing a  baby who is 3 inches from being born is not a radical thing anymore, so I don't know where 3 inches--maybe that does not make any difference. If you do not like what you have, then you can sort of exchange it. 
   But that is where we are. Someone suggests: Senator, this is outrageous. How can you make the comment that once a baby is born you can kill it? 
   I am not making that argument. But Dr. Singer is, and there are those who follow him. There will be judges who follow him. There will be judges who say the mother was distraught and she killed her baby, but it is sort of normal. If the baby was not perfect, it is probably better--we are probably all better off. 
   But what is the rationale given for partial-birth abortion, as extreme as that sounds, that Dr. Singer is proposing? What is the rationale for partial-birth abortion? Why do we need to keep it legal? Because we have pregnancies that have gone awry and these babies, they are not perfect. They might not live long. They may have cleft palate--in fact, yes, many partial-birth abortions were performed because the babies had cleft palate and mom and dad just didn't want the baby because it was not perfect. 
   So we have gotten to the point where the defenders of partial-birth abortion are defending it on the basis that things go bad in pregnancy and these children just do not deserve our protection because they are not normal like you and me. They should be given less rights. Because of their imperfections, they should be allowed--why would you bring a baby into this world who is going to die? Kill it first before it has a chance to die. That is the argument. It sounds rough. Let's cut to the chase. That is exactly what they are saying. 
   All we are suggesting is, first off, we do not stop you from doing that. This bill does not stop anyone who wants to have a late-term abortion from having it. If you want to have a late-term abortion, you can have a late-term abortion if this bill we propose passes. All we say is, don't have the baby outside the mother, don't have the baby 3 inches away from the protection of the Constitution, and then brutally execute the baby. That is just too close. That creates this nebulous area that the Dr. Singers of this world will gladly fill in. Because if we say 3 inches, then why not 3 inches later? What is the big deal? If the baby is not wanted, the baby is not wanted. 
   Many listening to this will say that is a ridiculous argument. There is no such slippery slope. Although, by the way, the people who oppose these often themselves provide a slippery slope argument. Certainly they do here. They say, if you restrict this right in abortion, it is a slippery slope; we are going to get rid of Roe v. Wade completely. That is why we have this amendment, to get at the Roe v. Wade amendment, to make sure we are not providing the slippery slope. Fine. Let's have a Roe v. Wade amendment to show we don't have a slippery slope. No problem. Let's have a vote. 
   But allowing a baby who is almost born to be killed, that is not a slippery slope? The Senator from 
   California--we were talking about what if the foot or the leg were the part not born, would it be OK to kill the baby? I have the transcript, by the way. I asked that question. I will read it:  
   What you are suggesting--  
   This is me talking.  
   What you are suggesting is if the baby's toe is inside the mother you can, in fact, kill that baby.

   Mr. SANTORUM. I am happy to yield to the Senator from New Hampshire. 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOCNO>106-santorum-pa-53-19991020</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator from New Hampshire. The Senator from New Hampshire is someone who deserves a tremendous amount of credit for his courage in coming to the floor 4 years ago, offering this bill, fighting for this, and beginning the battle in the Senate. And he continues to be a stalwart supporter and someone who deserves a lot of credit for the movement that has occurred already. 
   I will finish my charts, and that is, again, getting back to where this abortion procedure is ``rare.'' Ron Fitzsimmons on ``Nightline,'' in 1997, said that between 3,000 and 5,000 partial-birth abortions could be performed annually. They say they didn't even know because, again, they do not get reports--at least we are told they do not get reports as to how many of these late-term abortions are done in this manner. 
   The Centers for Disease Control does not track the method of abortion. So we know 1,500 are done in one clinic. And the people at that clinic said they have trained others to do it in New York City. So I hesitate to guess of the thousands upon thousands of living human beings--living human beings--who are brutalized in this fashion, 3 inches away. 
   As the Senator from New Hampshire just said, if that baby was born head first, even though a smaller portion of the baby's body is out, I think most people in this body would say: Well, you couldn't kill the baby then. 
   Isn't that funny? Isn't that funny in the sense that we draw these artificial lines that don't exist? We would say, it depends on which way the baby exited the mother as to whether you could kill the baby or not. Think about that. This is the bright line. This is the bright line that we will never cross in our society as to who deserves the protection of our Constitution or not. That is the issue, folks. That is the issue. 
   Who in this Senate Chamber, who within the sound of my voice is safe if that is the bright line? Who is safe from a group of Senators who think they are being compassionate, who decide that maybe we are better off drawing the line somewhere else, maybe drawing the line 
   that after the baby is born, if the baby isn't what we want. As, again, Dr. Singer, a noted professor at Princeton University, now suggests, why don't we draw the line afterwards? 
   There is not much difference, folks, is there? There really isn't. Let's get honest about this. What is the difference? It is just a couple of inches. We will be back someday. If we keep this procedure legal, we will be back someday. We will be back someday arguing whether that 3 inches really means anything. It is an artificial line. That will be the argument. Come on. ``What is the difference because it is 3 inches if the baby is really deformed? Let it die. Kill it. Put it out of its misery. This baby is going to die anyway.'' 
   The arguments you are hearing this very day about children who are not wanted because they are not perfect, in our eyes--I know whose eyes they are very perfect in. In the eyes that matter most in this; they are perfect little children. But to those on the Senate floor who argue that because of their imperfection we have to keep this legal, so we can dispose of unwanted, imperfect children--3 inches from legal protection--folks, when the issue is 3 inches, it might as well be 1 inch or half an inch and eventually it is no inches because the 3-inch line is the Maginot Line. It will be blown through at some point when it suits the majority of Americans that they do not want to be bothered with this burden--with this burden. ``It would be better off for this child,'' I am sure the argument will be, ``that we let this baby die or we kill this baby. Why let it suffer?'' That is the argument now--3 inches from protection. 
   Oh, how those 3 inches will shrink; mark my word. This is not a far-out debate. It is the mainstream of political debate right now that we can kill children 3 inches from birth because they are not perfect. That is the argument. That is the mainstream of thought in America right now. 
   On the horizon, the Dr. Singers of this world will say: Why quibble over 3 inches? I remind you, step back in your mind, those of you who were here on this Earth 40 years ago, and imagine--close your eyes and imagine--the Senate Chamber without television cameras, without the bright lights, without the microphones, and people on the Senate floor debating whether it is OK to kill a child who is almost born. 
   It would be beyond anyone's possible comprehension that that could have occurred in Manhattan, much less Washington, DC, here in the Senate Chamber. But here we are. Where will we go from here? The Senate can take a stand on that. So far it hasn't in the numbers necessary, but we are working on it. 
   Lie No. 5: Partial birth abortion is used only to save the woman's life and health and when the fetus is deformed. 
   Again, Ron Fitzsimmons said:  
   The procedure was used rarely and only on women whose lives were in danger or whose fetuses were damaged.  
   That was 1995. Fast forward to 2 years later. Ron Fitzsimmons admitted he lied through his teeth when he said the procedure was used rarely and only on women whose lives were in danger or whose fetuses were damaged. Yet that is the debate you continue to hear on the floor of the Senate, case after case after case after case of this. 
   But what did Ron Fitzsimmons say:  
   What the abortion rights supporters failed to acknowledge [the people on this floor] is that the vast majority of these abortions are performed in the 20-plus week range on healthy fetuses and healthy mothers. The abortion rights folks know it, the anti-abortion folks know it, and so, probably does everyone else.  
   Would you please inform the rest of the Senate, Mr. Fitzsimmons, so they can begin to discuss the facts of this case, not the smoke and the mirrors of this legislation. I guarantee my colleagues, we will have clouds and clouds of smoke hovering over this Chamber over the next 2 days in an attempt to obfuscate what really is going on. 
   Lie No. 6: Partial-birth abortion protects a woman's health.  
   I understand the desire to eliminate the use of a procedure that appears inhumane but to eliminate it without taking into consideration the rare and tragic circumstances in which its use may be necessary would be even more inhumane.  
   The argument that this protects a woman's health. 
   President Clinton, again, veto message of 1997:  
   H.R. 1122 does not contain an exception to the measure's ban that will adequately protect the lives and health of a small group of women in tragic circumstances who need an abortion performed at a late stage of pregnancy to avert death or serious injury.  
   A, there is a provision in the bill that says life of the mother is an exception to the ban. Factually incorrect. There is a life of the mother exception. I think it is agreed on all sides that that is not necessary because it would never be used, but we have a prohibition there anyway. 
   Going to the truth:  
   The American Medical Association endorsed the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. The AMA stated that partial-birth abortion is not medically indicated.  
   I have talked about hundreds of physicians, over 600 obstetricians, not medically necessary.  
   The partial-birth abortion procedure, as described by Martin Haskell [the nation's leading practitioner of the procedure] and defined in the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, is never medically indicated and can itself pose serious risks to the health and future fertility of women.  
   Over 600 obstetricians signed this, over 600, pro-life, pro-choice, signed this. 
   Those are the facts. This attempt by those who oppose this bill to change the subject to get to Roe v. Wade doesn't obscure those facts. 
   I will get back to that.

   Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, the Durbin amendment purports to ban certain kinds of abortion, and I wish that were true because I think that would be constructive. But it does not. 
   I do not question the motives of Senator DURBIN, Senator COLLINS, and many others, who, I think, are trying to find some ground where we might be able to meet. But the problem with this amendment is the problem with all these amendments that deal with the issue of health of the mother. 
   The courts have defined ``health'' so broadly that it includes everything. This definition in the amendment talks about serious, grievous physical injury, and it requires a second opinion. 
   Here is the second opinion. If I put the phone number on here, and if this bill were to become law, you could call Dr. Warren Hern, who performs many second- and third-trimester abortions, and he will say this: ``I will certify that any pregnancy is a threat to a woman's life and could cause grievous injury to her physical health.'' 
   See, the problem is there are lots of people in this country who would argue that pregnancy itself, following through with a pregnancy, can cause grievous physical injury. And in 
   fact, it could. 
   So signing a document that says if we did not do this abortion, grievous physical injury would occur, is, by definition, something any doctor--or at least any doctor, Dr. Hern would say--could sign in good faith. 
   So what you have is a loophole, a loophole that would make this prohibition void. So as good as it sounds--and I do not question the intentions. Senator DASCHLE had offered this amendment in the past, and I certainly did not question his intention. I think there is an honest attempt to say, and I take the speakers at their word, that they do not want to see these kinds of abortions performed. However, when you provide a health exception, in reality the health exception becomes the operation of the bill, which is: There is no limitation. 
   So as much as I would like to see what the Senator from Illinois purports to have happen with his amendment, his language does not accomplish what he purports to accomplish. So voting for something that, frankly, is hollow, is not effective. 
   Our bill would, in fact, ban a particular procedure, period, and that is with the life of the mother exception. 
   If the Durbin amendment was amended to just provide for the life-of-the-mother exception, it would be a different story. But it does not do that. 
   So as much as I, again, commend those who have signed on to this as an attempt on their part to try to search for some sort of middle ground, I do not think they have found it yet. I am hopeful that good faith and openmindedness will continue and that they will understand where I am coming from. 
   This is not a limitation at all, and to put forward such as a limitation would be misleading and I think not particularly constructive to getting at the real problem. 
   Again, I say--and my amendment that we will be voting on, which is a sense of the Senate, alludes to this--this is a debate about a procedure. And the reason we are debating this procedure is because it is the line in our society that we have drawn about who is covered by our Constitution and who isn't. 
   I think everyone will agree, once the baby is born, you have constitutional protections. When the baby is inside the womb, the Court has been very clear: you don't. The point is, when the baby is in the process of being born, it is almost completely outside of the mother. How can one suggest that that baby does not have some additional protection or full protection? 
   We heard the Senator from California say, if the foot was in the mother, they wouldn't be entitled to protection. What is the difference between the foot being inside the mother and the head being inside the mother? Why does one give protection and the other one doesn't? We are going to get into that very kind of fuzzy line. I am not too sure that is a line we want to say is our line of demarcation as to when rights begin or not. 
   I think we want to be very clear: Once the baby is in the process of being born, that is where the right to abortion ends and that is where infanticide begins. I am hopeful the Senate will make that choice today.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I will speak briefly. The Senator from Tennessee, Mr. FRIST, is here. I know he is planning to come and talk about this issue. Under our agreement, I agreed I would yield the floor when he gets here to make a speech. 
   I, first, thank the Senator from New Hampshire. I did not catch all of his remarks. I caught the last 45 minutes or so. He is talking about a very difficult issue. It is an amendment we will have to vote on tomorrow. It is not a difficult issue. It is a difficult issue to talk about. I think it is a rather simple issue. I am hopeful, again, this will be an issue where we put the politics of abortion aside and understand this kind of action should at least be looked into by some sort of study to determine whether this activity occurs and how pervasive this is. 
   What I would like to do tonight is share some thoughts in response to a discussion today about the anecdotes of cases that were presented in defense of partial-birth abortions. We heard about cases of women who needed this procedure to save the mother's health or the mother's life. I would like to review what the medical evidence is, again, and also bring up some cases where people took a different option and show how that option, as humane as the other side, with their wonderful pictures of husbands and wives and in some cases children, as warm and fuzzy as they would make it out to be, the fact is, in every one of those cases a child was killed. A baby was killed. That is a tragedy. 
   In many cases the baby would not have lived long, but the baby was killed before its time. Many of the people I am going 
   to talk about tonight understood their baby was not going to live long or might suffer from severe abnormalities, but they were willing to take their child's life for what it was, as we all do when we are confronted with it in our own lives. We find out a son or daughter is afflicted with a horrible illness. Our immediate reaction is, well, how can I put my child out of its misery? Or my child isn't going to live very much longer; how can I end it sooner? 
   I don't think that is the immediate reaction of mothers and fathers in America. But yet, when it comes to the baby in the womb, we have many people who believe that is the logical thing to do. I argue that it is not the logical thing. It is not the rational thing. It is not the humane thing. It is not in the best interest of the health of the mother. All those other things, in fact, in this debate don't matter. 
   What does matter in this debate is, is it in the best health interest of the mother? I will talk tonight about cases where people made a different choice and, I argue, from a health perspective, a better choice. When I say ``health,'' I mean not only the physical health of the mother but also the mental health of the mother. 
   We will talk about some of those cases. I will talk about some of the cases that were brought up today and explain why those cases, again, were not medically necessary to protect the health of the mother. There were other options available, even if they wanted to choose abortion. 
   Then I will share with you some things that have happened to me as a result of this debate and provide to my colleagues that, while we may not win all the votes, at times there are things even more important than that. 
   I see the Senator from Tennessee, Dr. FRIST, is here. I yield the floor to him.

   Mr. SANTORUM. I know the hour is late, and I will not take a lot of time. I appreciate the indulgence of the Senator from Kansas for his marathon stay on the floor and the Chair tonight. 
   First, let me thank the Senator from Tennessee for his expert testimony. We hear a lot from those who oppose this procedure and the fact there is no obstetrician here. I think someone with the surgical skills and the international reputation of Dr. FRIST, combined with the obstetricians who, in fact, are Members of Congress on the other side of this Capitol who oppose this procedure, who support this bill--I think we have the medical community of the Congress clearly on our side. I think as I stated before, we have the medical community generally on our side, hundreds and hundreds of obstetricians who have come forward and talked about it. 
   I want to talk tonight about a few cases. I do that for a couple of reasons. I want to articulate again that there are alternatives available to a partial-birth abortion. We heard Dr. FRIST talk about other abortion techniques that are available in the medical literature, techniques available for later in pregnancy if a mother decides to have an abortion. I want to share with people, because I think it is important and this transcends the partial-birth abortion debate, but I think it is relevant to discuss that there are other ways to deal with this that are as healthy, and, I argue, even more healthy, for the mother involved. 
   We heard the Senator from Illinois, Mr. DURBIN, today talk about Viki Wilson, Coreen Costello, and Vikki Stella. I entered into the RECORD those three cases. All these women came to the 
   Congress. They testified themselves. They brought their own stories forward. They are now being used by Members of Congress and have been used by Members for several years to support the claim this was the only method available to them and this saved their health and their future fertility. I will take them one by one very quickly, but I want to reemphasize that this was not the only option available to them. There were, in fact, more healthy procedures. 
   That does not mean if a certain procedure is performed--I am sure the doctor would affirm this--there is more than one procedure that can be used. Even if it is not the proper procedure, it may turn out OK with a good result. The point I am trying to make and I think the point the medical community is trying to make: It is not the best medicine, it is not proper, and it certainly isn't the only procedure available. 
   In the case of Viki Wilson, according to her own testimony, she didn't have a partial-birth abortion. She says in her testimony that the death of her daughter Abigail was induced inside the womb.  
   My daughter died with dignity inside my womb, after which the baby was delivered head first.  
   Partial-birth abortion, as we heard Dr. FRIST describe, is when the baby is delivered in a breach position alive, that all of the baby is taken out of the mother except for the head, and then a sharp instrument is inserted in the base of the skull, the baby is killed, and the brains are suctioned out. 
   That is not what happened. Yet we know that from her testimony, we have known that for several years, since 1995. Yet year after year after year, as we debate this bill, people come to the floor and hold up this case and say: Here is someone who was saved from health consequences by partial-birth abortion. It didn't happen. It didn't happen. 
   Let's take the cases where it did happen. I have two letters, one from a Dr. Pamela Smith who is at Mount Sinai Hospital in Chicago and another from Dr. Joseph DeCook who is at Michigan State University, discussing two different cases: First the Vikki Stella case, and second Coreen Costello. 
   It is very comfortable for me to stand here and talk about the very personal and tragic cases. I am sure it is very painful for those involved to hear their case being brought up by someone they disagree with in a very vociferous way. But if they are going to bring their case to support a conclusion that this procedure is medically necessary, then their story, their records, have to be examined to determine whether, in fact, it does support this medical determination, which has been arrived at by some, that this is a medically necessary procedure. 
   In the case of Miss Stella, she has proclaimed that this is the only thing that could be done to preserve her fertility. 
   This is what Dr. Pamela Smith writes:  
   The fact of the matter is that the standard care of that is used by medical personnel to terminate a pregnancy in its later stages does not include partial-birth abortion. Caesarean section, inducing labor with petosin or proglandins or, if the baby has excess fluid in the head, as I believe was the case with Miss Stella, draining the fluid from the baby's head to allow a normal delivery, all are techniques taught and used by obstetrical providers throughout this country. These are techniques for which we have safe statistics in regard to their impact with regard to the health of both the woman and the child. In contrast, there are no safety statistics on partial-birth abortion.  
   We heard Dr. FRIST say that. This is not a peer-reviewed procedure. We do not know from any kind of peer-reviewed study as to whether this is proper.  
   There is no reference on this technique in the National Library of Medicine database, and no long-term studies published to prove it does not negatively affect a woman's ability to successfully carry a pregnancy to term in the future. Miss Stella may have been told this procedure was necessary and safe, but she was sorely misinformed.  
   We all want to believe what our doctor tells us. We all put faith in our doctor. When our doctor says this is the only thing that could have helped you, I am not surprised that that is repeated by people who had the service performed on them. But what this doctor is saying, what 600 obstetricians have said, what Dr. FRIST has said, what Dr. COBURN in the House has said, what Dr. Koop has said--Dr. C. Everett Koop--what the AMA has said, is that this is not good medicine. So she was sorely misinformed. 
   One of the complicating factors here that Senator DURBIN brought up was that Vikki Stella had diabetes. And Dr. Smith addresses that. She says: 
   Diabetes is a chronic medical condition that tends to get worse over time, and it predisposes individuals to infections that can be harder to treat. If Miss Stella was advised to have an abortion, most likely this was secondary to the fact that her child was diagnosed with conditions that were incompatible with life. The fact that Ms. Stella is a diabetic, coupled with the fact that diabetics are prone to infection and the partial-birth abortion procedure requires manipulating a normally contaminated vagina over a course of 3 days, a technique that invites infection, medically I would contend that of all the abortion techniques currently available to her, this was the worst one that could have been recommended for her. The others are quicker, cheaper, and do not place a diabetic in such extreme risk of life-threatening infections.  
   Again, for all of the argument that we need this procedure to protect the health of the mother, and here are cases in which it was used to protect the life and health of the mother, the fact is it was not the best thing. The evidence is it was not the best thing. So the very cases we are to rely upon to make a judgment that this was in fact a case in point as to why this procedure is necessary do not substantiate the claim. These are their best cases. You don't bring out your worst cases. This is the best evidence.  
   This goes back to what Dr. FRIST just mentioned, what I have mentioned earlier in the day. We are still waiting to hear what case is necessary: In what case is this the best procedure? Give us the set of facts and circumstances where this is, in fact, a preferable option, where it has been peer reviewed, where there is consensus in the field that this problem with the child and problem with the mother, that combination, requires partial-birth abortion as the preferred method. 
   Organizations have said this may be the best. If you say ``may,'' then you have to come forward saying where can it be the best; tell me what circumstances. They have not. Yet, incredibly, with all of the evidence we have presented on our side of this issue, of how it is bad medicine, how it is not peer reviewed, how it is rogue medicine, how it was developed by an abortionist who was not an obstetrician, how it is only done in abortion clinics, how it is not taught in medical schools, it is not in any of the literature--all of this information is overwhelming that this is a bad procedure--the only thing they hold onto on the other side is, it may be necessary, with no instance, no hypothetical. 
   Pull out your worst set of facts for me, put them on paper, and tell me what it is. They will not do it. You have to wonder, don't you, if this is the evidence they want to use to claim that health is a necessary provision. It is bogus. It is bogus. 
   Coreen Costello--again, this is based on what she has revealed of her medical history of her own accord. Again, Dr. DeCook states that a partial-birth abortion is never medically indicated. In fact, there are several alternative standard medical procedures to treat women confronting unfortunate situations such as what Miss Costello had to face. 
   According to what she presented to us, the Congress, Miss Costello's child suffered from at least two conditions, polyhydramnios secondary to abnormal fetal swallowing and hydrocephalus. 
   In the first the child could not swallow the amniotic fluid and an excess of the fluid, therefore, collected in the mother's uterus. 
   The second condition, hydrocephalus, is one that causes an excessive amount of fluid to accumulate in the fetal head. Because of the swallowing defect, the child's lungs were not properly stimulated, and underdevelopment of the lungs would likely be the cause of death if abortion had not intervened. The child had no significant chance of survival, but also would not likely die as soon as the umbilical cord was cut. 
   The usual treatment for removing the large amount of fluid in the uterus is called amniocentesis. The usual treatment for draining excess fluid from the fetal head is a process called cephalocentesis. In both cases, the excess fluid is drained by using a thin needle that can be placed inside the womb through the abdomen, transabdominally or through the vagina. The transvaginal approach, however, as performed by Dr. McMahon on Miss Costello, puts a woman at an increased risk of infection because of the nonsterile environment of the vagina. Dr. McMahon used this approach most likely because he had no significant experience in obstetrics and gynecology.  
   Again, using a higher risk procedure. Why? This man was not an obstetrician; he was an abortionist.  
   In other words, he may not have been able to do as well transabdominally in the standard method used by OB/GYNs because that takes a degree of expertise he did not possess. 
   After the fluid has been drained and the head decreased in size, labor will be induced and attempts made to deliver the child vaginally. Miss Costello's statement that she was unable to have a vaginal delivery or, as she called it, natural birth or induced labor, is contradicted by the fact that she did indeed have a vaginal delivery conduct by Dr. McMahon. What Miss Costello had was a breach vaginal delivery for purposes of aborting the child, however, as opposed to a vaginal delivery intended to result in a live birth. A cesarean section in this case would not be medically indicated, not because of any inherent danger but because the baby could have been delivered safely vaginally.  
   We have heard testimony after testimony from hundreds of obstetricians saying there may be cases where separation has to occur between the mother and the child because of the health of the mother, because of the life of the mother. There may be a case--there are cases where the baby within the mother's womb is a threat to the mother's life and health. But what these doctors have said over and over and over again is, just because we have to separate the mother from the child does not mean you have to kill the child in the process. 
   In the case of partial-birth abortion--take Coreen Costello--fluid was drained. The baby could have been delivered. The baby could have been delivered and given a chance to survive. By killing the baby, you increase the risk to the mother. When you do a procedure inside of the mother that causes the destruction of the child through shattering the base of the skull, you are performing a brutal procedure, a very bloody, barbaric procedure inside of the mother that could result in laceration, and bony fragments or shards perforating that birth canal area. That is much more dangerous to the health of the mother than simply delivering the baby intact. 
   It seems almost incredible to me that in the overwhelming--overwhelming--status of the medical evidence presented on the floor we would have any question as to whether this is really necessary to protect the health of the mom. 
   My argument goes a little further because I think these doctors are saying that you may need to deliver the child prematurely, but you never need to kill the baby to protect the health and life of the mother. There is always a way to deliver the child. At least give this child the dignity of being born. 
   Remember, most of these abortions are done on healthy mothers and healthy babies. I think everyone looks at this debate and says: Oh, this is a debate; about sick moms and sick kids. It is not a debate about sick mothers and sick kids. This is a debate primarily about healthy mothers who decide late in pregnancy not to have a child, and the child is healthy. The child would be born alive if it were not killed by the partial-birth abortion. The child, in many cases, would not only be born alive but would survive that birth. We in the Senate say too bad; too bad. 
   I am going to talk now about the small percentage of cases where there are the difficult choices because that is the real powerful argument. That is why they make it because they believe it is the most powerful argument they have to keep this procedure legal. They do not want to talk about the 90 percent of the cases because they cannot defend that. You cannot defend a 25-week abortion with a healthy mother and a healthy baby where that baby would be born alive, survive, develop, and live normally. You cannot defend that. 
   And guess what. Surprise, surprise, nobody does. They do not talk about those cases. That is the norm here. That is the norm. That is what goes on out there. They do not talk about that. They want to bring in the sick kids and the sick moms and say: We need this for these small percentage of cases. 
   Again, let's get to the argument again. In every one of those cases where there is a maternal health issue, there is overwhelming evidence this procedure is not in the best interest of the mother, but they want to bring in the sick kids. 
   That bothers me because it assumes that you, the American public, out there listening to what I am saying, somehow look at sick children as less important, as less worthy of life, as disposable, as a burden, as a freak, as pain and suffering, not as a beautiful, wonderful gift from God. That is why they argue these cases, and they argue these cases because there are millions of Americans who, when they hear about this child who is deformed or not going to live long, see this child as a burden, as unwanted, as imperfect. 
   It is a sad commentary on our country if we look at God's 
   creations and see only what their utility is to our country, to our lives, to our world. And if their utility is not how we can quantify it in terms of what kind of job they can have, how smart they will be or how beautiful they will be, what they will add to the value of life in America, they are seen as less useful, less needed, less wanted, a burden. 
   The fact that the people who make this debate, oppose this bill, bring this up and talk about just these cases sends a chill down my spine, because they are appealing to the darker side of us when they do that. They are appealing to our prejudice against people who do not look like us, who do not act like us, who are not perfect like us, and yet they are the very people who will fight heroic fights. And I give credit to many who will fight the heroic fights to give rights to that disabled child after it  survives. But once the child is delivered and once it is alive, then they will fight the battle to make sure it gets a proper education under IDEA. 
   The Senator in the Chair, Dr. FRIST, was a great leader on that and worked with some of the opponents of this bill on ensuring disabled individuals have rights. But I wonder how they can justify using these cases to appeal to this dark side of us, the cultural phenomenon in this country that demands perfection, that is poisoning our little girls with what perfect little girls must look like, that is leading to disorder after disorder as a result of the striving for perfection that has permeated our culture, what you have to look like, what you have to smell like, what you have to wear. 
   They feed into that by saying these poor children are not quite worthy of life. While we will fight for them once they are born, I think what they are actually saying is: But we really hope they are not born in the first place. 
   That is very disturbing because I am going to share with you tonight some stories about parents who made a different choice, who, when they heard about the child inside, decided they were going to look at that child the way God looks at that child, as a beautiful, wonderful creature of God, perfect in every way in His most important eyes, and accepted children for as long or as short a time as their life was to be. 
   I am going to share with you a story first of Andrew Goin. 
   Last time we debated this issue on the override of the President's veto last year--it was last fall--I had this picture up here. We talked about Andrew. And I will do so again. But I have a little addendum to this story. 
   First, let me tell you about Andrew. That is Andrew. Andrew's mother is Whitney Goin. She had a feeling something was wrong 5 months into her pregnancy. When she went in for her first sonogram, a large abdominal wall defect was detected. She described her condition after learning there was a problem with the pregnancy:  
   My husband was unreachable so I sat alone, until my mother arrived, as the doctor described my baby as being severely deformed with a gigantic defect and most likely many other defects that he could not detect with their equipment. He went on to explain that babies with this large of a defect are often stillborn, live very shortly, or could survive with extensive surgeries and treatments, depending on the presence of additional anomalies and complications after birth. The complications and associated problems that a baby in this condition could suffer include but are not limited to: bladder exstrophy, imperforate anus, collapsed lungs, diseased liver, fatal infections, cardiovascular malformations .......  
   And so on. 
   A perinatologist suggested she strongly consider having a partial-birth abortion. The doctor told her it may be something that she ``needs'' to do--that she ``needs'' to do. He described the procedure as ``a late-term abortion where the fetus would be almost completely delivered and then terminated.'' 
   The Goins chose to carry their baby to term. But complications related to a drop in the amniotic fluid level created some concerns. Doctors advised the Goins that the baby's chances for survival would be greater outside the womb. So on October 26, 1995, Andrew Hewitt Goin was delivered by C-section. He was born with an abdominal wall defect known as omphalocele, a condition in which the abdominal organs--stomach, liver, spleen, small and large intestines--are outside of the baby's body but still contained in a protective envelope of tissue. Andrew had his first of several major operations 2 hours after he was born. 
   Andrew's first months were not easy. He suffered excruciating pain. He was on a respirator for 6 weeks. He needed tubes in his nose and throat to continually suction his stomach and lungs. He needed eight blood transfusions. His mother recalled:  
   The enormous pressure of the organs being replaced slowly into his body caused chronic lung disease for which he received extensive oxygen and steroid treatments as he overcame a physical addiction to the numerous pain killers he was given.  
   It broke his parents' hearts to see him suffering so badly. 
   Andrew fought hard to live. In fact, Baby Andrew did live. On March 1, 1999, Bruce and Whitney Goin welcomed their second child, Matthew, into the family. 
   Here is a picture of the two of them. 
   Contrary to the misinformation about partial-birth abortion that has been so recklessly repeated, carrying Andrew to term did not affect Whitney's ability to have future children. 
   This is that little boy who ``needed'' to be aborted, who was not ``perfect'' in our eyes. It is one of these ``abnormalities'' that we need to get rid of. What a beautiful little boy. What a gift he is to his parents. What a gift he is to all of us for 
   his courage and inspiration. What inspiration we get as a society from those who overcome the great odds and pain and strife. How ennobled we are by it. 
   Are we ennobled by partial-birth abortions? Would we be ennobled in this country today if Whitney Goin did what she ``needed'' to do according to the doctor? 
   Andrew Goin touched more than one life directly. 
   When I had this previous picture up of Andrew last year, I was here at about this time of night. At that time, Senator DEWINE was in the Chair. I was thinking, and I called my wife about an hour before, as I did tonight, and I said: Honey, I just have to get up and talk some more. I just feel it in me. I have to say more. I know it's not going to change anybody's vote, but I have to say it. I know there is nobody on the floor other than MIKE DEWINE--at that time; and now BILL FRIST at this time--who will be listening to what I'm going to say, but I have to say it. 
   So here I am again. I remember finishing that night a little after 10 o'clock. And it was after 10 o'clock, because the pages always encourage me, when I speak late at night, to speak until after 10 o'clock so they don't have to go to school in the morning. So congratulations, you are 3 minutes away from it. 
   So it was after 10 o'clock. And I remember closing down the Senate and Mike coming up here, and I just felt this sense that this was all for nothing--as much as I care about this issue and as wrong as I believe this is for our country--that all that was said that night was falling on deaf ears. 
   In fact, the next day we lost the override vote. So my feeling of futility, if you will, was compounded--until a few days later when I received an e-mail from a young man who said:  
   Recently my girlfriend and I were flipping through the channels, and we came across C-SPAN, and were fortunate enough to hear your speech regarding the evils of partial-birth abortion. We saw the picture of the little boy with the headphones on, who was lucky enough to have had parents who loved him and brought him into this world instead of ending his life prenatally. Both of us were moved to tears by your speech. 
   And my girlfriend confessed to me that she had scheduled an appointment for an abortion the following week. She never told me about her pregnancy because she knew that I would object to any decision to kill our child. But after watching your emotional speech, she looked at me, as tears rolled down her cheeks, and told me that she could not go through with it. 
   We're not ready to be parents. We still have a couple years left at college. And then we will have a large student loan to pay back. But I am grateful that my child will live. It is a true tragedy that the partial-birth abortion ban failed to override Clinton's veto. But please take some comfort in knowing that at least one life was saved because of your speech. You have saved the life of our child. May God bless you and keep you.  
   Fortunately for me, the writer of this e-mail stayed in touch. I received an e-mail a couple of weeks ago that reported back what had happened over the previous year. He says:  
   We reevaluated our ability to raise a child at this point in time in our lives, and we finally decided to put our baby up for adoption. I know that she is being raised by a loving couple that cares deeply for her. I often wonder if we did the right thing by putting her up for adoption, but I know we did the right thing by bringing her into the world. Every now and then I think that one day she is going to grow up and be a part of the lives of many people. Then I wonder what would have happened if I had just kept on clicking through the channels and not stopped to see you speaking on C-SPAN. A terrible thing might have happened and I probably would never have known about it. I will always have in my mind the thoughts about her life that she is living and the people that she is important to. Once again, thank you so much for your speech on C-SPAN that day. It is a terrible tragedy that you were unable to override Clinton's veto, what it meant to us, of course, our daughter and her adopted parents.  
   There is something ennobling about that story, something that touches all  of us, something that gives us hope. What I am saying is, I don't think partial-birth abortion does that to anyone. I don't think it is ennobling to kill a child 3 inches away from being born. I don't think it is inspiring. I don't think it is the better angels of our nature. I don't think it is going to go down in the annals of the Senate as one of our great compassionate civil rights votes or constitutional votes. 
   It doesn't lift up our spirits. It doesn't make us walk with that longer stride, with our head held high. It is sanctioning the killing of an innocent baby who is 3 inches away from constitutional protection, and it blurs the line of what is permissible in this country. If we can kill a little baby that would otherwise be born alive, 3 inches away from being born, what else are we capable of? 
   Unfortunately, we are answering that question every day, with the violence we see reported on television, with the insensitivity to life that we see occurring in our daily lives, with the calls for assisted suicide, with the calls for mercy killings, even with this debate, with the argument the Senator from California made earlier. She wants to make sure that every child is wanted. 
   Mother Teresa said it best at the National Prayer Breakfast a few years ago. ``Give me your children,'' she said. Give me your children. If you don't want your children, give them to me; I want them. 
   Tens of thousands of mothers and fathers who cannot have children want those children and will love those children. There is not a shortage of wanting in America when it comes to children. The most debilitating thing to think about is that the life of a child can be snuffed out, a life that could include 90 or 100 years. A little girl born this year has a 1-in-3 chance to live to be 100. So for those little girls who are aborted through partial-birth abortion, 100 years of loving and making a contribution to our society, finding the cure to cancer, of enriching our lives is snuffed out because for a period of time, a short period of time, your mother didn't want 
   you. How many of us in our lives today would be snuffed out or could be snuffed out because someone doesn't want you? 
   We have a chance to make a statement tomorrow in the Senate. We have a chance to stand as a body for these little children, these imperfect little children who the world and, unfortunately, Members of the Senate believe are somehow less worthy of being born because they may not live long or they may be in pain and it would be merciful to put them out of their misery. I am sure Andrew Goin would say, please don't show me that kind of mercy. In fact, we have lots of other children who were born who I am sure would say, please don't show me that kind of mercy. 
   A picture here of Tony Melendez. Tony was born with no arms, 11 toes, and severe clubfoot. That is little Tony. I am sure what he would say to you today is, please don't show me that kind of mercy because I am not perfect like you would like me to be. Tony didn't let all the prejudice that comes with having no arms, a clubfoot, 11 toes stop him from being one of the greatest inspirations we have had in our time. Tony is now a musician. Tony plays the guitar with his feet. He has performed for the Pope on three occasions, has traveled to 16 foreign countries, played the national anthem in game 5 of the 1989 World Series, on and on and on. 
   If you would listen to the debate today on the floor of the Senate, you would think it might be more merciful to let him die before he gets the chance to prove that he is worthy. 
   Donna Joy Watts. Donna Joy was here a couple of years ago. Donna Joy is an amazing story. It has been put in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD for a long time. We had it in here several times. Lori Watts, her mom, found out that her child had hydrocephalus, an excessive amount of cerebral fluid, water on the brain. She was told her daughter would virtually have no brain, that most of her brain would be gone. So the obstetrician, when she found out on the sonogram, said Donna Joy should be aborted, that a partial-birth abortion should be performed--yes, a partial-birth abortion. Mr. Watts said, ``No, we don't want to do an abortion.'' So they sent the Wattses to see a high-risk obstetrics group. They went to three hospitals in the Baltimore area. All three hospitals said they would abort Donna Joy, but they would not deliver her. Let me repeat that. They would perform an abortion, but they would not deliver her. So people are worried about safe access to abortion. We are getting to the point where we need safe access to birth. Finally, she found a team that would deliver her. Again, this group also advised an abortion but then agreed to deliver. She was born with severe health problems. 
   What the Wattses expected was that, as soon as the baby was born, a team would go into action to see what they could do to help save this little girl. They found out that they did nothing. They did nothing. They put the baby in a neonatal unit and kept it warm and they said to the Wattses, your baby is going to die. We are not going to do anything. This baby is so sick, has such a little brain, so many complications, we are not going to deal with it. Guess what. She didn't give up. She kept living. So now the doctors had this baby, now alive three days, and they don't know what to do with her. This baby keeps 
   living and she should have been dead. 
   Finally, three days later, they implanted a shunt to drain off the excess fluid. Of course, the shunt should have been in as soon as possible to minimize the damage, but they waited three days. What has happened ever since then has been remarkable. Yes, there were complications. The shunts haven't worked. They have had to go back in several times to fix that. They had trouble feeding her. And so her mother came up with an ingenious way of fixing a mixture of baby food and giving it by syringe, one drop at a time, because that is all she could handle eating. She had other complications. 
   Meningoencephalocele is another complication, and I can go on with epilepsy, sleep disorders, digestive complications. She has had a lot of problems. But she has survived them all. She has survived them all. 
   Donna Joy is about to celebrate, next month, her eighth birthday. And, yes, I have met her. She has been in my office. She walks and talks and plays with my kids. She takes karate and she goes around with her mom to various places. We are fortunate to have the Watts living in Pennsylvania. She provides living testimony to hope and to the horrors of partial-birth abortion, because she should not be alive today. She should not be in this picture. If you accept the arguments on the other side, it is probably better if she wasn't there. 
   I don't accept those arguments. I don't accept the arguments that because a child may not have the kind of life that you want, she cannot have a life worth living, because all life is worth living. 
   There are several other cases here that I would like to put in the RECORD. One I want to talk about, finally, is the case of Christian Matthew McNaughton. I talk about this because this is somewhat personal because I know the McNaughtons. They are a wonderful family. Mark is a State legislator up in Pennsylvania. Christian was born in 1993. Before he was born, the McNaughtons found, when Dianne went in for a sonogram, that Christian had hydrocephalus, water on the brain. By the way, in several of the stories we heard about why we need to have partial-birth abortion, the abnormality was hydrocephalus. So these are parallel cases. The radiologist said the baby seemed to have more fluid on the brain than tissue. They cautioned that it was possible the baby had no brain at all. They were told their prospects were dim, and they were advised that they could have an abortion. It would be preferable to have an abortion. In fact, they were offered a partial-birth abortion. 
   Again, as the doctor explained it, the baby would be partially delivered, the surgical instrument inserted into the base of the skull, the brains would be extracted, or what there was of the brain, and the rest of the body would be delivered. Of course, they rejected that option. One of the doctors said, after they rejected the option, that shunt surgery to relieve the pressure, the fluid on the baby's brain, would not be performed if the child's quality of life prospects did not warrant it. That goes back to the Donna Joy situation. 
   Christian was born in June of 1993. He required special medical care. A CAT  Scan revealed he suffered a stroke in utero, which caused excess fluid to build up in his brain. It showed that the lower level quadrant of his brain was missing. Within a week of his birth, he had the first shunt surgery to drain fluid, and he had a follow-up procedure in three months. He exceeded everybody's expectations. So a baby, which doctors initially believed was blind, had no capacity for learning, grew to a little boy who talked, walked, ran, sang, enjoyed playing baseball and basketball. He attended preschool. His heroes were Cal Ripken, Jr., Batman, Spiderman, and the Backstreet Boys. He loved whales and dolphins. His favorite movie was Angels in the Outfield. And he especially loved his baby sister, who was two years younger than he. Christian brought joy to all who were fortunate enough to know him. 
   In August, Christian began experiencing head pains. Here is little Christian in this photo, and this is his little baby sister. His shunt was malfunctioning, and it had to be replaced. 
   After surgery, Christian experienced cardiac arrest respiratory distress. He slipped into a coma. Fluid continued to accumulate on his brain. He fought hard to live. But he didn't. He died 2 years ago on August 8 at the age of 4. 
   If you think these kids don't matter, if you think this option is just all pain, ask Mark and Dianne whether they would trade the 4 years. They have those wonderful memories--difficult, sure; painful, sure. But they believed in their child. They loved him. They nurtured him. And he returned much more than they ever gave--not just to them but to all of us. 
   Do you want to know how they felt about their little brother? 
   Last year, on his anniversary, these are little ads taken out in the Harrisburg Patriot News by his sisters, his brother, his mom and dad. 
   His sister said:  
   Christian, we love you, we miss you, we wish we could kiss you just one more time.  
   His brother, Mark:  
   I have a poem for you. 
   Blue jays are blue, and I love you; robins are red, and I miss you in bed; sparrows are black, I wish you were back; I am sorry for the bad things I did to you, you are the best and the only brother I ever had, please watch over us and take care of us. Love Mark.  
   His mom and dad:  
   Our arms ache to hold you again. Our hearts are forever broken, but we thank God we had a chance to love you. We know your smile is brightening up the heavens, and that Jesus loves the little children. Please help us to carry on until the day we can all play together again.  
   What would be missed, as some would suggest, if we just take all of this pain away, and kill this baby before it would suffer through this horrible life? 
   The McNaughtons would not trade a minute. I think it is obvious they wouldn't trade a minute. 
   All of the stories are not happy ones. All of the sad stories do not have a bright side. Some are just tragic and tragic and tragic. 
   But I can tell you as a family who has gone through the loss of a child, and what we thought was a normal pregnancy didn't go the way we had hoped, accepting your child, loving your child, taking your children as they are, for as long as they are to be may be the hardest thing you can do. But it is the best that we can do--not just for the child whose life you have affirmed and accepted but in your life. 
   In the case of Mark, the little boy knew he was loved. He lived a couple of hours. Karen and I and our family have the knowledge that for those hours we opened up our arms to him, and during those 2 hours he knew he was loved. 
   What a wonderful life we could all have if that is all we had. 
   We have a chance tomorrow to draw a bright line. A bright line needs to be drawn for this country. If there is a time in our society and in our world when we need a bright line separating life and death, I can think of no better time. 
   This debate today and tomorrow is drawing that line, affirming that once a baby is in the process of being born and there is a partial-birth abortion outside of the mother, the line has been crossed. It is not a fuzzy line. If we perform that kind of brutality to a little baby who would otherwise be born alive, it is beneath us as a country. 
   History will look back at this debate, I am sure, and wonder how it could have ever occurred. How we could ever have done that to the most helpless among us? How did we ever cross the line? 
   But tomorrow those Members of the Senate will have a chance to tell a different story for history, to say that the greatest deliberative body in the world will strike a clear blow for the right to life for little children during the process of being born. 
   I don't think it is too much to ask. But I do ask it of my colleagues. I plead with them to find somewhere in their hearts the strength to stand up and do what is right for this country, what is right for the little children, and say no to partial-birth abortions. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

    Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, today I would like to call to your attention a very special anniversary which is taking place in my home state. Ten years ago, a group of emerging leaders from Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, hosted by the Eisenhower Exchange Fellowships, met in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to launch an exciting experiment in international cooperation. 
   The Eisenhower Exchange Fellowships is a private, non-profit, non-partisan organization created in 1953 by a group of prominent American citizens to honor then-President Dwight D. Eisenhower for his contribution to humanity as a soldier, statesman and world leader. Eisenhower Exchange Fellowships seeks to foster international understanding and productivity through the exchange of information, ideas and perspectives among emerging leaders throughout the world. The Eisenhower network numbers 1300 Fellows from 100 countries. Currently two Eisenhower Fellows are heads of government; over 90 Fellows have served at the cabinet level or above. More than 220 have become CEOs. 
   The Eisenhower Exchange Fellowships brought this group of fourteen Irish Fellows, consisting of seven Fellows from the North and seven from the South, to the United States for a two-month program. They came from all types of professional backgrounds, working in business, government, religion and law. They came from many perspectives and diverse political and personal beliefs. Through the auspices of the Eisenhower Exchange Fellowships, they met on common ground in Philadelphia in 1989, and they've been meeting and working together ever since. 
   They decided to commemorate the tenth anniversary of their Single Area program by returning to Philadelphia. There they will gather to look back on the last ten years and look forward to the next millennium. These Irish Eisenhower Fellows are to be commended for the contributions they have made to their region and to greater international understanding in the past decade--and they think of Philadelphia as their second home. 
   In the spirit of Dwight D. Eisenhower, in whose honor the organization was founded, the Irish Fellows work together in a pragmatic way to ensure understanding, respect, and reconciliation. Building bridges across cultural and political divides, they have played and continue to play important roles in the peace negotiations. They have made important contributions to economic growth, to the social welfare of their communities, and to more effective and efficient public administration. They have worked effectively towards a more dynamic economy, seeing the importance for their region to play a role in an evolving Europe and in the world. 
   By continuing to find outstanding new Eisenhower Fellows from a number of professional fields, they help to promote awareness and the exchange of ideas between Irish emerging leaders and their American counterparts. By sponsoring USA Eisenhower Fellows and bringing them to Ireland, they expand the horizons of emerging young U.S. leaders. In both these activities, they strengthen the bonds between our countries. 
   In the spirit of fellowship and unflagging curiosity about the world, they come together every nine months to confer on topical issues, to plan for future Eisenhower Fellowships, and to renew and strengthen their friendships, which cross national borders and historical differences. They serve, in effect, as a model alumni organization, which constantly renews its parent body through its energy and innovation. 
   I would like to commend their reunion weekend in Philadelphia, October 14-17, and wish them the best of luck in their continuing mission to establish friendships and improve understanding on a personal, local, national, and international level.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I thank all of those who have been involved in trying to clear this piece of legislation. This is a very important piece of legislation for the preservation of the Paoli and Brandywine Battlefields. There is money in the Interior Appropriations bill to help with the State and local funds to combine to purchase a piece of the battlefield that would otherwise be sold for development. It would be a real tragedy to lose a Revolutionary War battlefield because of inaction in the Senate. 
   I appreciate the bipartisan support we had to clear this particular bill because the deadline is tomorrow. The development contract would have been exercised, and we would not have been able to purchase this land by clearing this bill today in time to get that done. It is very important to the people in that community. 
   I thank the minority leader, Senator DASCHLE, Senator BINGAMAN, Senator JOHNSON, and many others who were involved in helping to clear this issue on the Democratic side, and I certainly thank Senator MURKOWSKI for his effort in putting that together on the Republican side. Obviously, the sponsors of the bill, Senator SPECTER and myself, are appreciative of the work that was done to take this bill out of what is a very big stack of bills that I know many Members want to have moved in the Senate and to treat this specially because of the time sensitivity. At a time when comity is short because of how difficult these last few weeks have been, people have put those kinds of differences aside and recognized what is in the best interest of all involved. That speaks volumes for both sides of the aisle. So I want to commend, in a time of difficulty, and maybe even rancor, the people who put their differences aside and did do what is right. It is a heartening thing to me personally, and it is certainly something that I will long remember and appreciate. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read the third time and passed, the title amendment be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   First, I would like to say that the senior Senator from Mississippi has one of the toughest jobs on Capitol Hill, along with the senior Senator from Indiana. Chairing the Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture and the Agriculture Committee in the Congress are just incredibly difficult tasks. The diversity of agriculture and the needs of agriculture are historic in this Chamber. 
   Trying to come up with a proper mix of how to solve the needs and the difficulties in farm country is complex. It is difficult. 
   I understand coalitions have to be put together to pass bills. In this case, a coalition was put together to pass a bill that, in my mind, did not represent the interests of my area of the country, particularly my State of Pennsylvania. I understand that. I appreciate the difficulty in doing it. 
   I understand that Pennsylvania has a very difficult time participating for one reason. We are a very diverse State agriculturally. We have a tremendous amount of richness in our agriculture. It is our No. 1 industry. Pennsylvania's No. 1 industry is agriculture. Most people don't know that. Most people don't know that the State of Pennsylvania, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, has the largest rural population of any State in the country. We take agriculture very seriously. Obviously, our rural population depends heavily upon agribusiness for survival. 
   We have been hit this year with an absolutely historic drought that has devastated our farm community. Throw on top of that, sort of adding insult to injury, a big chunk of our State was hit very hard by Hurricane Floyd. Not only did we have drought on top of drought and the crops burned up, but they had floods. We have a situation where in almost every county of our State crop losses are in the area of at least 30 percent, and in many areas and many counties it is 100 percent. 
   I looked at the bill we have before us in the Senate and the one that came out of conference. I was hoping we could focus more of the $8 billion that is in this bill on the area of the country that was affected most dramatically by weather this year. In my mind, it has not. I am not just speaking for Pennsylvania. I am talking about all of the Northeastern States  that were affected--the Mid-Atlantic States--by drought. The big chunk of this bill is for AMTA payments, which are payments to farmers who are program farmers. 
   Before we pass this bill, we are going to give $5.5 billion out to farmers who were previous to the Freedom to Farm bill in Government programs. The problem in Pennsylvania is we have a very small percentage of those farmers because of our diversity. We have very few program crops. We have a lot of specialty crops, livestock, and dairy. As a result, a very small percentage of our farmers participate in the AMTA payments. A very small percentage of, frankly, most of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern farmers participate in the AMTA program. 
   When you look at the $8 billion-plus that is in this bill and you see $5.5 billion of it going to AMTA, almost none of that is going to the area that is most affected by the drought. It is going to the area that is having bumper crops. 
   The reason we are providing ``disaster'' help, the disaster in most of the country is they have too much harvesttime. As a result, prices are low. So we are going to give them money because they have too many crops to sell at too low a price. 
   I can tell you my farmers in Pennsylvania wish they had something to sell. So I am a little frustrated when you look at where the bulk of the money is going. It is going to areas that are hardly hit by a disaster, and certainly no weather disaster. It is a disaster of richness, if you will, because of the tremendous amount of harvest that has occurred in that area, and, obviously, the world situation and the like. When you look at what is specifically targeted for my area of the country, the ``drought relief'' is $1.2 billion. Not all of it goes to drought relief. A lot of it is going to hurricane disaster relief. 
   I can tell you my Governor told us that just the preliminary numbers in Pennsylvania are approaching $1 billion in losses for drought. So $1.2 billion for drought and hurricane relief doesn't even begin to touch on what the problem is in Pennsylvania. 
   I know some have said we can do a supplemental appropriations bill in the spring to see what the problem is. My farmers can't wait until spring. They have to survive the winter. While some folks are getting double AMTA payments, $11.2 billion worth of money, my farmers are going to be told to wait until the spring. 
   Our area of the country has come to the table time after time after time after time as the Upper Midwest, the Southeast, and other areas of the country have suffered drought, pestilence, floods, hurricanes, tornadoes--I can go on and on--a disaster a year in those areas. We understand that. Our taxpayers and farmers have come to the table and been willing to put up money. We are a big country, and we will pitch in together to help. 
   When it comes to our farmers being hit with the worst drought in a century, the answer is: Wait until the spring. We may pass a supplemental if you need it. 
   That doesn't cut mustard. I understand we had a vote here yesterday on cloture and a group from the Northeast cast our votes on cloture. We were defeated. We will be defeated today. This bill will pass and will become law. I understand the need for getting assistance to farmers. I have to speak up and say what is in this bill is not enough to take care of the needs of the farmers in my State. 
   A couple of other things happened that were disconcerting. We had $134 million in specialty crop money that came out of this bill. We grow a lot of fruits and vegetables in Pennsylvania, specialty crops, important crops. We had $134 million for that. When it came from conference, the money was out and ``specialty crop'' was defined as only tobacco and peanuts. We don't grow a lot of tobacco and peanuts in Pennsylvania or New Jersey or a lot of other areas hit by the drought. 
   Again, that money was designated to help some of our farmers who are not the farmers who have been at the Government trough for years and years and years with program crops, but folks making it on their own, not coming to Washington asking for money. The one time we ask for money, the answer is no. I think that is a very sad commentary. We took the money for specialty crops, for fruits and vegetables--again, people who have never gotten Government subsidies--and we give them to two programs that are still getting Government support--tobacco and peanuts. 
   That is a misguided policy. I understand the dynamics of trying to pass a bill. I understand the power and the influence of the peanut lobby, the sugar lobby, and the tobacco lobby. I understand now we have the honey program back in place, and the mohair program is back. I understand all that. 
   I keep looking at what it does to those who have been paying the bills for a long time for agriculture in the northeastern part of the country. What I see is a neglect of a bunch of farmers who work just as hard as folks in other areas of the country who don't ask the Government to help very much. We hardly ever ask the Government to help in our agriculture. The one time we get hit with the drought of the century, the answer is: We will give you a little here, and wait until next year, and maybe we can give you some more. By the way, some of the other stuff we were going to give you, we will not. 
   I thank the chairman for the money for crop insurance. That is something I very much wanted. The $400 million to help 
   try to get farmers into the crop insurance business is very important. We need more farmers covered with risk management tools. Crop insurance is important. I urge the chairman of the Agriculture Committee, Senator LUGAR, to take that up quickly and move forward on crop insurance to put the money to good use. 
   I have to oppose this bill, reluctantly. I understand the difficult job the Senator from Mississippi had in trying to craft this to pass the Senate and get it signed by the President, but for me it doesn't do enough for my area of the country. 
   I will have to vote ``no'' on the bill.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to engage in a brief colloquy with our distinguished Chairman concerning the conference report that accompanies the fiscal year 2000 National Defense Authorization Act. It has come to my attention that page 526 of House Report 106-301 notes that the conferees to the bill agreed to authorize an increase of $25.0 million for the procurement of additional band 9/10 transmitters for the EA-6B tactical jamming aircraft. In reality, during conference negotiations, conferees agreed to authorize an additional $25.0 million for the procurement of modified band 9/10 transmitters.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that offers compassionate choices for women facing unplanned pregnancies. This bill, the Women and Children's Resources Act, establishes an $85 million formula grant program to provide pregnant women with alternatives to abortion. 
   The Women and Children's Resources Act (WCRA) is modeled after a successful program in Pennsylvania, Project Women In Need (WIN). This program was created under the Administration of former Governor Robert Casey and implemented during the current Administration of Governor Tom Ridge. Project WIN has filled a critical void for women seeking support during this confusing and uncertain time. The centers often receive 500 calls per week. 
   This legislation is designed to meet the needs of women facing one of the most important decisions of their lives. WCRA is intended to link women to a network of supportive organizations who are ready and willing to offer assistance in the form of pregnancy testing, adoption information, prenatal and postpartum health care, maternity and baby clothing, food, diapers and information on childbirth and parenting. Women can also receive referrals for housing, education, and vocational training. This bill seeks to provide compassionate choices to women; it is an effort to reach out to women and let them know they do not have to face this decision alone. 
   The bill directs federal funding to states through a formula based on the number of out-of-wedlock births and abortions in a state as compared to this sum for the nation. Upon receipt of this grant, states will select their prime contractors from the private sector to administer the program. The prime contractor will distribute Women and Children's Resources Grants to crisis pregnancy centers, maternity homes, and adoption services on a fee-for-service basis. Faith-based providers may also participate in the program, but they may not proselytize. Further, state-wide toll-free referral systems and other methods of advertisement will be established to make these services readily available to pregnant women and their children. Low-income women will be given priority for these services. 
   Because WCRA seeks to offer alternatives to abortion, contractors and subcontractors which receive funding under this bill cannot promote, refer, or counsel for abortion. Further, these entities must be physically and financially separate from any entity which promotes, refers, or counsels for abortion. 
   Mr. President, not every woman facing an unplanned pregnancy knows that supportive services exist. Many believe that the future they had planned is no longer achievable. They feel alone and abandoned. Often, they mistakenly believe that abortion is their only real choice. For this reason, WCRA offers compassionate, life-affirming choices and support. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that would establish the Schuylkill River National Heritage Area. This legislation recognizes the significance of the Schuylkill River Valley in Pennsylvania, and the role it played in the nation's economic expansion during the nineteenth century. 
   The Schuylkill River, and later the railroads, moved anthracite coal through the river valley to Philadelphia and beyond, fueling the industrial revolution that made this country great. It is important that we endeavor to preserve the historical and cultural contribution that the anthracite and related industries have made to our nation. The labor movement of the region played a significant role in crucial struggles to improve wages and working conditions for America's workers. The first national labor union was organized in this region and was the forerunner to the United Mine Workers of America. 
   In 1995, under the management of the Schuylkill River Greenway Association (SRGA), the Schuylkill River Corridor was recognized as a state heritage park by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Since that time, the SRGA has dedicated itself to restoring and preserving the historic Schuylkill River Corridor by encouraging enhancement and maintenance of the historic qualities of the river from its headwaters in Schuylkill County to its mouth at the confluence of the Delaware River. 
   The legislation that I am introducing today, with the support of Senator SPECTER, will enable communities to conserve their heritage while continuing to create economic opportunities. It encourages the continuation of local interest by demonstrating the federal government's commitment to preserving the unique heritage of the Schuylkill River Heritage Corridor. This bill will require the Schuylkill River Greenway Association to enter into a cooperative agreement with the Secretary of the Interior to establish Heritage Area boundaries, and to prepare and implement a management plan within three years. This plan would inventory resources and recommend policies for resource management interpretation. Further, based on the criteria of other Heritage Areas established by the Omnibus Parks and Public Lands Management Act of 1996, this bill requires that federal funds provided under this bill do not exceed 50 percent of the total cost of the program. 
   Mr. President, the anthracite coal fields of the Schuylkill River Corridor, and the people who mined them, were crucial to the industrial development of this nation. Through public and private partnership, this legislation will allow for the conservation, enhancement, and interpretation of the historical, cultural, and natural resources of the Schuylkill River Valley for present and future generations.

    Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, last year, for the first time in Philadelphia's history, the African American Rodeo came to that great city. It was a memorable occasion with approximately 8,000 school children attending the rodeo at the Apollo Stadium. While these children were entertained by the rodeo and re-enactments of life in the old West, they learned of the many contributions made by African Americans to our nation's history. 
   On October 8 and 9, of this year, the African American Rodeo is again coming to the City of Brotherly Love to present re-enactments of historical figures of the old West. Such performances are important because our history books and Hollywood have failed to give proper recognition of the great sacrifices and heroic deeds made by African Americans. 
   Mr. President, more than 200,000 African American soldiers served in the Civil War. After the war, many of these trained soldiers were sent west, forming two infantry and two cavalry units. The term ``Buffalo Soldier'' was given to them by the Native Americans whom they encountered. Those soldiers, their families, and thousands who were freed from slavery were among our early settlers, cowpunchers, and farmers in a number of the western states. 
   It is with pleasure that I salute the Minority Arts Resource Council, its founder and Executive Director, Mr. Curtis E. Brown, its board members, and its volunteers for once again bringing this great event to the city of Philadelphia. I urge my colleagues to join me in saluting the invaluable services and contributions of African Americans and the role that they have played and continue to play in American history.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, it isn't often I rise to talk about these kinds of issues because, by and large, these issues generally affect the West, and we in Pennsylvania do not have much direct involvement. But in this case we are directly affected in Pennsylvania. 
   We have a national forest in Pennsylvania, the Allegheny National Forest. What has been going on in the Allegheny National Forest over the past several years has been a very troubling thing to thousands of residents in my State; it has had a dramatic negative impact on the quality of life for the residents in northwestern and north central Pennsylvania, as the amount of timber harvests have continued to decline. 
   What we have seen, as a result of that, is a real damaging of the economy. It is a very rural area. Most people think of Pennsylvania and think of big cities and factories, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. But Pennsylvania has the largest rural population of any State in the country. I repeat that. Pennsylvania has the largest rural population of any State in the country. 
   That rural population, by and large, survives on agriculture and off the natural resources, whether it is coal mining or whether it is quarrying or whether it is timber or whether it is what we consider traditional agriculture. 
   The Allegheny National Forest is vitally important for several of our smallest counties. We have 67 counties in Pennsylvania. Our smallest county in population, oddly enough, is called Forest County. Forest County has about 4,000 or 5,000 people who live there. The biggest part of it is the national forest, the Allegheny National Forest. But there are other counties surrounding it that have bits and pieces of the national forest in their county: Warren County, McKean County, and Elk County. 
   In Elk County, PA--aptly named--we have about 600 elk, big ones, that have  come back over the past years and are thriving in our forests, almost to the point of being domesticated in some respects and causing problems. But that is another issue for another day. 
   But those four counties get a lot of revenue because big chunks of them are national forest areas. They get a lot of revenues from the timber sales that principally support their school districts. 
   I spoke to students at the Forest County schools a couple of weeks ago. The No. 1 issue that the kids asked me about was, what are we going to do about timber sales? Because they potentially will have to close down one of their schools because of cuts in the Forest Service budget, as well as lawsuits because of the Indiana bat, which, I guess, stays up in the Allegheny National Forest for a couple days a year, so there are all sorts of lawsuits tying up the Allegheny National Forest in harvesting. 
   The Allegheny National Forest is the single largest area for the harvesting of black cherry timber. You look at your black cherry veneer and you will see a lot of it comes from the largest black cherry stand in the country, which is the Allegheny National Forest. 
   The Allegheny National Forest, by the way, is a profitable forest. They make a lot of money in their timber sales because of high value trades. So they are not losing any money to anybody. They are making a lot of money. In fact, the less we harvest, the worse off we are financially. 
   It has been very deleterious to those counties. I will look at the timber receipts for the past several years. Even last year, which was not particularly a great year, we had $1.6 million for Warren County; $1.5 million for McKean County; $1.3 million--$1.3 million for a county of 4,000 people is a lot of money. 
   All these other counties range in the area of 20-, 30,000 people; Elk County, 1.26. All of them, every one of those counties, will have their revenues cut by more than half this year, by more than half because of legal roadblocks and cutbacks in the amount of timber sales as a result of Federal legislation. 
   The problems we confront are not just financial in terms of tax revenue. They are financial, but they are also financial with respect to our economy. Logging is a very important aspect of the way of life. Wood products: Because of our high-value black cherry and other species, we have a lot of high-value processing of that wood, which is resulting in very high unemployment. Many of these areas, in this very strong economy, are experiencing double-digit unemployment, and have consistently for the past couple of years. 
   We also have another concern which, again, when you go up and talk to the folks who live around the forests, is almost frightening, the kind of misinformation that is out there about our forests and the management of the forests. 
   I remember going to Gray Towers, which is outside of Milford, PA. Gray Towers was the home of Gifford Pinchot, who was the Governor of Pennsylvania and was a conservationist. Gifford Pinchot went on to be the first head of the U.S. Forest Service around the turn of the century. The Yale School of Forestry was actually colocated in Milford, PA, at Gray Towers, which was the mansion the Pinchot family lived in. Now it is a museum dedicated to forestry. I was up there looking at old pictures of Pennsylvania. It is remarkable. In picture after picture after picture, Pennsylvania was completely clearcut--clearcut. 
   I stood on the front porch of Gray Towers and looked out and saw the expanse. You can see literally for miles. I looked at the picture on the portico of roughly 100 years ago. It literally was stumps of trees for as far as the eye could see. Of course, now it is green as far as the eye can see, full of trees. 
   Pennsylvania is just remarkable. I fly over it all the time in small planes. It is just literally covered with trees, almost all of which, if not all of which--because I have been told it was completely clearcut--were not there 100 years ago. So the regeneration happens. In fact, the Allegheny National Forest is a valuable forest today because it was clearcut and because a shade-resistant strain of black cherry couldn't grow in those old forests. In fact, there are areas that are now dedicated to old growth in the Allegheny National Forest that have a lot less diversity. 
   People are worried about the health of the forest, environmental diversity. You get to some of these old-growth forests. You take the combination of the old growth and the fact that you have less vegetation, which puts pressure on your deer and everything else--we have a lot of deer. They completely decimate old-growth forests, where it is a desert there because of these high trees. You don't have a lot of younger growth. Whatever does crop up, because there isn't much else around, the deer take it right out. 
   So we went, in this area called the heart of the forest, when they dedicated it to old growth, from 37 varieties of plants down to 4. I don't know about you, but I am not too sure that is protecting the environment or the health of the 
   environment. 
   I am an easterner. I am not one of these guys who understands public lands and forests and all that stuff. I grew up around the city of Pittsburgh and didn't know too much about forests. But I remember hearing people say: We have to manage the forest. You say: Forests manage themselves pretty well. What do you mean? Well, yes, forests manage themselves pretty well, but they manage themselves not in a way that you and I would consider them. They manage it through, in a sense, a boom-and-bust cycle, growth and then destruction and then growth and then destruction. That is pretty much how forests grow if you leave them alone. That is OK, I guess. But it doesn't provide what is, I think, in the best interest of the animal life and the plant life and certainly the community for recreation. The economic resources that are derived from the forest are not maximized when you allow this kind of wild and unmanaged forest generation and regeneration to occur. 
   I trust the Forest Service. I don't always agree with them, but I trust the Forest Service will work to maintain forests and wisely manage them, using sound science to provide the best environment for stable growth of the forest as well as for the indigenous animal species that are there to feed. It is very serious--it is the No. 1 issue in about 5 or 6 counties in my State--that we allow the timber harvesting program to continue. It is the economic lifeblood of those counties. 
   I felt compelled to give a little different perspective, as someone who doesn't talk to these issues very much--and maybe it is best I don't--but who has a real sensitivity as to what sounds good. As I have told people about what sounds good in suburban Philadelphia, saying leave these trees alone, we love the trees, don't hurt the trees, a little knowledge is dangerous sometimes and no knowledge is downright lethal. And in the case of dealing with forest management, a lot of folks don't have a darn bit of knowledge. And it is killing people. It is killing their economy. It is killing their school districts. It is killing the forests. 
   That is not something we should allow to go unchallenged in Congress. Just because it makes a good TV commercial, just because it sounds as if you care more, you don't care more if you understand the facts involved in forest management. 
   I am an enthusiastic opponent of this amendment. I must tell you, when I first got to Congress, I was not. But the more I have learned about forest management and the impact of timber sales on not only the health of the forest but the health of the economy related to the forest, it is an absolute must for me to stand here and oppose this amendment. I urge my colleagues to do likewise. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of National Payroll Week 1999, which has been designated as September 13-17. 
   National Payroll Week was founded by the American Payroll Association in 1996 to honor the men and women whose tax contributions support the American Dream and the payroll professionals who are dedicated to processing those contributions. 
   In particular, the Susquehanna Valley Chapter of the American Payroll Association represents 200,000 residents and 25 businesses in Pennsylvania. These taxpayers contribute millions of dollars to the federal and state treasuries through payroll taxes each year. These taxes help pay for important civic projects including roads, schools, crime prevention, and national defense. In addition, taxpayers and payroll professionals are partners in maintaining the Social Security and Medicare systems. 
   I ask my colleagues to join me in commending the taxpayers and payroll professionals who, through the payment, collection, and reporting of payroll taxes, have helped make our nation great.

    Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, this year marks the 250th anniversary of York County, Pennsylvania. Today, I rise to recognize the establishment and storied history of this county which contributed greatly to the founding of our Nation. 
   Established in 1749, York had formerly been a part of neighboring Lancaster County. The citizens of York had petitioned for their own county so that they could establish a courthouse in closer proximity to their jail. With the granting of the petition, York became the first county in Pennsylvania west of the Susquehanna River and the fifth county in Pennsylvania overall. Since that time, the county has developed rich and dynamic civic, social, political and economic institutions, including both durable agricultural and industrial bases, and serves as a model for communities across the Commonwealth and the Nation. 
   Mr. President, from September 1777 through June 1778, York served as the capital of our Nation. As British General Howe's army occupied Philadelphia, our early government, the Continental Congress, was first moved to Lancaster, Pennsylvania. After one day, the Continental Congress sought to place further distance between it and the British, so it crossed the Susquehanna river at Wrights' Ferry and resumed session in the Colonial Courthouse in Center Square, York. 
   Mr. President, it was during the time that the York hosted our nation's government that the Marquis de Lafayette made the famous ``toast that saved the nation.'' With this toast, Lafayette proclaimed his continued support for, and espoused the attributes of, General Washington at a time when certain factions were calling for the General to be replaced. This toast has been credited as saving George Washington's position as our first Commander in Chief. It was also during the time that the Continental Congress convened in York that it adopted the Articles of Confederation. This important document was the precursor to the Constitution and marked the first use of the term ``United States of America.'' 
   Mr. President, the people of York County are proud of their history and their traditions. I am proud to join York in this celebration and ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating York on its 250th anniversary.

   Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Chair and thank the chairman for yielding me time. 
   I, too, rise, as the Senator from Nebraska just did, in strong support of returning to the American public what they have overpaid. And that, to me, is good business practice. If a business gets overpaid, we think they would be honest enough to see that they have been overpaid and give back the money to the person who paid more money than was needed for what they were buying. In fact, if business did not do that, you would think they were ripping you off. 
   It is somewhat incredible to me to imagine how the American public, when they see they are overpaying their taxes--we have more money than is needed to pay for the needs of Government, which are immense; $1.9 trillion, some pretty big need--the American public, at least through the polls, are saying: Well, keep it. We really don't need it. We don't really need a tax cut. At least that is what the polls would have you believe. I do not believe that. 
   I do not believe it is good business for the Government to keep money that it does not need because what the Government will do is what a business would do. They will take it and use it to benefit themselves, not benefit the customer. 
   I think that is what we are seeing happen already this year in Washington with the surplus projected for  next year to be some $14 billion. People are just banging down the door to spend that money. We spent half the surplus last night. The projected surplus is half gone. If we pass the Ag appropriations bill in the form it passed last night, it will be half gone. My guess is the House, and others, will want to pass even more than that. 
   So what my big concern is--I think the Senator from Nebraska hit the nail on the head--if we leave the money here, it will be spent. It will not be spent to benefit the broad economy. It will not be spent to benefit the average taxpayer in America. It will be spent to benefit those who are loud enough or politically powerful enough to get that money set aside for them. 
   That is not the way things should operate when, you, the taxpayer have paid more than you should, that we are going to take that money and give it to someone who screams the loudest to get that money here in Washington, or who has the political clout to get that extra money here in Washington. No. 
   What we have done in this modest tax relief package--everyone says how big this tax relief package is. This is modest tax relief. This is incremental tax relief. This phases in over a 10-year period of time. This is tied to meeting our surplus targets. In other words, if our debt payments do not go down as projected, guess what. Most of this tax cut, or a big portion of it, does not even happen in the future years. 
   So what is being talked about is this calamitous idea that we are going to give all this money--this horrible thing--back to the people who overpaid it. And at the same time, many are standing up saying: Look, we need this money to spend on all this. We need it here. Of course, the American public doesn't need it. You have more money than you need back home. 
   As someone who is raising four children, and one due in a month and a half, I can tell you that raising a family is very expensive. I am not too sure anybody would, if you think about it, mind having a couple extra hundred dollars to be able to do some things to help them and their family. 
   That is what we are talking about. It is not a huge tax cut. I wish it were. I wish we could reduce taxes more, give more surplus back. I wish we could cut Government spending, pare down the growth of this Government. But we are not even talking about that. We are talking about letting Government continue to increase its spending, letting the entitlement programs continue to flourish, and just giving a little bit of what is overpaid back. 
   I am excited about this particular package. There are lots of goods things in this package--reductions in rates, the marriage penalty tax relief, and one particular provision I want to speak about for a minute or two is the American Community Renewal Act. 
   The American Community Renewal Act was not in the bill that passed in the Senate. I entered into a colloquy with Senator ROTH, and he agreed he would look at what was included in the House package. He did. And included in this bill out of conference is a bill that does not just provide tax relief, which is what we talked about, but a provision that helps those people in poor inner-city and rural communities who are not being lifted by the rising tide of this economy with incentives, such as the zero capital gains tax within these renewal communities. 
   One hundred of them would be designated. Twenty percent of them at least would have to be in rural areas, with a zero capital gains rate to help businesses start in those communities; to provide help for home ownership; expensing of businesses would be increased; wage credits; real powerful incentives for employment opportunities to happen within these communities, housing opportunities to happen within these communities, to see a real transformation, using, again, the private sector, not public-sector programs, not the Department of Housing and Urban Development, but, in fact, private sector incentives for private sector development and home ownership, which is the real key to success in America.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to speak about the need for the federal government to share in the cost of much-needed disabled access improvements at the Benjamin Franklin National Memorial in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. As my colleagues may know, this National Memorial was designated as a National Park Service Affiliated Area by Public law 92-551. 
   The Benjamin Franklin National Memorial is located in the rotunda of The Franklin Institute Science Museum in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The Memorial Hall was opened in 1938 and features a 20-foot high marble statue of Ben Franklin sculpted by James Earle Fraser, as well as many of Franklin's original possessions. 
    Mr. President, I was very appreciative earlier this year when the distinguished Chairman of the Interior Subcommittee, Senator GORTON, joined me in a visit to The Franklin Institute to see first-hand the need for disabled access improvements in the National Memorial Hall. I believe that he saw for himself that the 1938 design of the facility does not lend itself to easy access for anyone in a wheelchair or with other disabilities. The legacy of Benjamin Franklin is one that should be treasured and understood by all Americans, which is why I salute the Franklin Institute for embarking on a major capital development campaign to pay for, among other things, some of the costs associated with these renovations. 
   To date, the Institute has spent over $6 million of its own funds in the ongoing maintenance of the Memorial Hall. Since Congress bestowed national memorial status on this facility, and since it is important to ensure that all Americans, regardless of physical ability, can benefit from learning more about Benjamin Franklin, I want to encourage Chairman GORTON to continue working with me to providing funding for this purpose. I am advised that in Fiscal Year 2000, $1 million in federal funds would be a significant first step toward meeting the anticipated $6 million cost of rehabilitating and updating the National Memorial and its exhibits.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I have also sought recognition to express my support for a project of historical, academic, and economic importance at Gettysburg College in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. I believe that this project is a perfect candidate for funding under the Save America's Treasures grant program. 
   Stevens Hall, named for prominent Gettysburg citizen Thaddeus Stevens, was the fourth major building erected on the campus of Gettysburg College, in 1867. The building currently serves as a dormitory for undergraduate students. Renovation of the structure is necessary to preserve the building's exterior and modernize the electrical and fire prevention systems. 
   Gettysburg College plans to restore and rehabilitate Thaddeus Stevens Hall and transform the building into a center for the study of history and the Civil War era. Stevens Hall will eventually house the College's Civil War Institute. Located adjacent to Eisenhower House and just blocks from the Gettysburg National Military Park, this project will not only restore a distinguished example of 19th century architecture, but will attract students of the Civil War nationwide. The College has already committed substantial resources to this important project, securing $2.5 million in private funding for preservation work. 
   I understand that the committee did not include funding for the Save America's Treasures program; however, federal funding is crucial to the timely completion of restoration work on this historical structure. I urge the Chairman of the Subcommittee, Senator GORTON, to continue to work with me to identify appropriate federal funding for this important preservation initiative.

   Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the distinguished former chairman of the House Ag Committee and obviously one of the most knowledgeable people on agriculture in this country. It has been a pleasure to work with him. 
   To pick up on the point he just made, I will speak to Senators who do not come from areas which have program crops, places such as Pennsylvania, many of them, places such as Pennsylvania, New York, and Maryland, and most of the New England States, where previous emergency packages had very little to offer for those of us who have farmers experiencing difficulty in that area of the country. 
   Obviously, we are experiencing horrible difficulties with the drought that is occurring in the Mid-Atlantic region. I did not vote for either of the packages yesterday because I didn't think they offered anything of real value to the farmers that I represent and to the region of the country that I try to represent on the Agriculture Committee. But this package does. 
   Three things the Senator from Kansas just mentioned: No. 1, the money for specialty crops--most of the crops that are grown in Pennsylvania are specialty crops; they are not program crops--$300 million; $400 million for help with crop insurance premiums. We need to get more people in the Crop Insurance Program in Pennsylvania. If my farmers said one thing to me overwhelmingly, it was: Of all the things you can do to help us, give us some money to help us begin to get into crop insurance, to begin to insure ourselves against these losses and against the fluctuations of the market. 
   Farmers want to be self-sufficient. They don't want disaster payments. They don't get AMTA payments. What they want is some mechanism where they can begin to control their destiny and ensure some income for their family. That is what we are trying to do, to help them in transitioning. 
   Finally, $400 million, as the Senator from Kansas just mentioned, for disaster assistance for this year's 1999 crops. Obviously, we have no idea what the extent of the drought is going to be and the damage, but it is going to be extensive. It is going to be very tough on our farmers in Pennsylvania and throughout the Mid-Atlantic States. 
   I say to all those Senators who represent that area of the country, you now have a bill you can vote for that is going to do something meaningful for your farmers. I hope we can get bipartisan support for this amendment and get this acted upon quickly. 
   I thank the former chairman and distinguished member of the Agriculture Committee for his terrific work on this amendment.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the issue of farmland preservation. I have an amendment that was filed. It is amendment No. 1094. I will not call up that amendment, but I do want to speak on it for a couple of minutes. 
   The reason I will not call the amendment up is the amendment is now subject to rule XVI. It is on farmland preservation, which was an authorized program under the farm bill in 1996, but because the program was so successful, all the money has been used in the authorization. So while I would very much like to see more money be appropriated for this program that shares very broad bipartisan support, the job  before us is to get this program authorized. Since legislating on appropriations bills is now not the order of the day, and I support that, we are going to have to work through the authorization process. 
   But the Farmland Preservation Program, I think, has probably been shown to be one of the most successful pieces of legislation in preserving open space and critical farmland that we have seen in this country. In fact, last year, $7 billion of farmland protection money, preservation money, was approved via voter referendum throughout the country. That is an enormous commitment on the part of States and localities to preserve this vital agricultural land and at the same time preserve a way of life and preserve vital open space in places where the pressure for development is extremely high. 
   The area of my State that is under the most development pressure is the southeastern corner of Pennsylvania. The counties there, from Lancaster County to Chester County, Bucks County, York County, and others, have done a great job in their 
   own programs. In fact, all those programs I mentioned, county programs, were started long before the Federal Government ever even thought of participating in helping them acquire land. In fact, we have helped. The $35 million--that is all it was, $35 million--from the Federal level which was spent over the first 3 years of the farm bill preserved over 127,000 acres of land that is under great pressure of development on 460 farms. 
   In Pennsylvania alone, we have a 10-year backlog, a 10-year waiting list of farmers who voluntarily want to preserve their land and preserve, as a result, the family farm to be able to pass it on from generation to generation. States and localities, in partnership with the Federal Government--and as I said, in some cases without the Federal partnership--have bought these development rights so they can get some money to help keep this farm within the family. In fact, in a third of the cases--and we will be dealing with the tax bill tomorrow--these development rights were sold by farmers so they could pay death taxes, they could pay inheritance taxes, estate taxes--call them what you want. They sold their development rights on the farm so they could keep the farm in the family because of what the Federal Government has done in taxing their estates upon death. 
   That is a remarkable situation. Hopefully, if we can get the President to sign the tax bill we will pass tomorrow, we can go a long way toward avoiding that kind of use for these development rights. These development rights can then be used to modernize, to upgrade, and to make more competitive these agricultural lands that are under this intense development pressure. 
   I am disappointed we are not going to be successful in agreeing to the $10 million that is in this amendment. It would go a long way to relieve that backlog, not only in Pennsylvania but in the 19 other States that have participated in the Federal program. Since the Federal program was enacted, many more States have passed laws--in fact, 52 jurisdictions in States and localities have adopted some sort of farmland preservation program that would dovetail very nicely with the Federal effort. 
   This is an important issue to the people, particularly in the eastern part of the State of Pennsylvania. It is an important issue, I know, to my colleagues all throughout the Mid-Atlantic and New England States, many of whom are cosponsors of this legislation; also in California, where Senator BOXER and Senator FEINSTEIN worked to pass the original farmland preservation amendment back in 1996. 
   I am hopeful that the Agriculture Committee on which I serve will bring up this legislation and reauthorize it for the remaining part of the farm bill so we can include this in the Agriculture appropriations bill next time. I commend and thank Senator LUGAR who, a couple of weeks ago, held a hearing in the Agriculture Committee about this subject. We had some very enlightened testimony. It shows how incredibly popular this program is across the country and how important it is to preserve a way of life in rural America, particularly those areas that are threatened by development pressure. 
   I am hopeful, again, while we will not be able to accomplish it here today, that soon in this session of Congress we will pass a reauthorization of this program and be able to fund it in future appropriations bills. 
   Mr. President, seeing no one else seeking the floor, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise to discuss one of my amendments, No. 1476, offered with Senator ABRAHAM and Senator DEWINE, to establish renewal communities and encourage charitable giving to those organizations which make a lasting difference in the lives of people. 
   The amendment creates 100 renewal communities where businesses will have the incentive to stay and locate to provide economic opportunity for some of the most disadvantaged communities in America. The amendment also allows states to utilize federal block grant funds, if they choose to, in order to offset any revenue loss associated with offering a targeted state charity tax credit for individual donations to charities working predominantly to alleviate poverty. 
   Mr. President, I will continue to work with the chairman of the Finance Committee in order to see that these  critical provisions for expanding opportunity and transforming lives are included in the conference report. The Renewal Community provisions were included in the House of Representatives tax relief package and I look forward to working with the chairman to see that these provisions are included which unleash the power of the private sector and American charitable and faith-based resources to renew our commodities.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from Michigan and Senator DOMENICI for their great work on the Social Security lockbox issue. 
   Before I get into our amendment, I will address the Senator from Montana. First he says there is no money, not a penny, not a nickel, available for Medicare under the Republican bill. As the chairman of the Budget Committee will show in his big charts--I don't have one of those big charts with me, but I have a smaller one--this yellow area is $505 billion for domestic spending programs. 
   If we want to--and that is the second point I want to make--use the on-budget surplus to fund Medicare, which is not an on-budget program, it is a separate program like Social Security, by the way--it is a separate program--one of the things I hear from seniors most: Keep Medicare and Social Security separate. That is what the lockbox is trying to do with Social Security. There is money there if we want to take money from the general fund and use it for Medicare. 
   So the idea that we don't lock it up is ridiculous. The money is there. Then we can decide where we want to spend that money. It is a matter of priorities. 
   I will make this argument: I don't know if the Senator from Montana has ever voted to spend general fund money on Medicare. I don't think there has been a vote I am aware of in the Finance Committee to actually--there have been resolutions, a sense of the Senate, we should save Medicare--fund a Medicare program out of general fund revenues, Medicare Part A Program. 
   That, to me, is a dangerous precedent. We have a separate dedicated tax for Medicare--a separate tax. What is now being talked about is that we have to grow Medicare by using the on-budget surplus. 
   Let me say this: If Medicare was a program that was financially sound, that was doing a very solid job in the sense of providing efficient services, was the kind of coverage that seniors are really looking for, then you might make the argument that it is a well-run program and is doing everything it should be doing, and instead of raising taxes on people to fund Medicare, we should take that money out of the surplus. The problem is, we have a fairly strong bipartisan agreement that there are a lot of problems with Medicare. The Senator from Montana will agree there are serious problems. No. 1, it doesn't cover even half of health care costs of seniors. Here is the major health care program for seniors, and it doesn't even cover half of their costs for health care. 
   What we are saying is--and we said on a bipartisan basis--let's fix Medicare, make it more efficient, let it meet the needs of seniors, including prescription drug coverage. Why? Because when Medicare was put together 35 years ago, drug therapies weren't that common or well used; they were a very different game. Well, today is different. So we need drug therapy as part of a basic benefit because it is the way we treat people more often. So this idea that, somehow or another, our lockbox is not sufficient because we don't lock up Medicare is ridiculous. We have money to do it, A; and, B, we have to question first whether we should throw more money at Medicare before we fix what is fundamentally flawed with Medicare, in making it a better program. Those are the things I would like to address on Medicare. 
   With respect to our lockbox, I always find it unbelievable that when we have an issue here with broad consensus--in this case, or in most cases, the issues pushed by our side of the aisle--all of a sudden we have agreement. We have agreement in the House, 416-12. The President says he wants a Social Security lockbox. We come to the Senate and we have agreement. Probably if I talk to seniors around the country, the first thing they will tell me is: If you quit raiding that money out of the Social Security trust fund, Social Security would be OK. We have an agreement. 
   So we come to the floor with an agreement to fix the Social Security problem. Let's lock that money up so only Social Security money can be used for Social Security. Well, sometimes, as the song in Oklahoma says, a  girl can't say no. These are the girls who can't say yes on the other side of the aisle. These Democrats just can't say yes. 
   We have an agreement, we have something that we all agree on. America is overwhelmingly agreeing with it, but they can't come around to saying let's get this done. No, they are going to change the subject. Well, that Social Security thing, we agree with you; but you don't do enough and therefore we can't let you do this. We can't let you do your Social Security. They throw up this phony red herring with Medicare. I am trying to say the public is tired of this. They want us to be able to find things we have consensus on and do them, instead of playing political games. 
   What is going on in the Senate on this issue, for six cloture votes, over a several-month period, is political gamesmanship. We have agreement that Social Security moneys 
   should only be used for Social Security, and we can't get one single Democrat vote to pass that measure. We have 80-plus percent of the American public who want it done. We have their President who said: Send me only a Social Security lockbox--only. We have 416 Members of the House who say ``Social Security lockbox,'' and we have 45 obstructionists--45--who would rather play politics because they think they can win the election on making the Republicans bad guys on Medicare. So they throw the Medicare herring out. We don't have the Social Security herring this time. These are the two red herrings that are chronically thrown at Republicans at election time. We have lost the Social Security card, so let's play the other card to muck things up so we don't get things done. 
   People are sick of that. I can tell you, as a Republican Member who is working hard to preserve Social Security, I am sick of it. We can get this done tomorrow. We can pass a lockbox that says to every Social Security recipient in America: Your money is not going to be spent on other Government programs. We can make that assurance. The President said he would sign it, and 45 people on the Democratic side of the aisle are saying, no, we are not for getting anybody any political wins because we only think of politics. We don't want to give you this political win. We want you to be the do-nothing Congress, so we are going to throw this red herring out. Medicare. Oh, the bogeyman on the Republican side; they don't have a nickel or a penny or a quarter for Medicare. 
   Garbage. The issue is not Medicare. This is a Social Security lockbox, which the Democrat President--their President and our President--wants. We are ready to give it to him. What is the response from the other side? The response could be, should be: OK, let's do Social Security. We all agree on it. We have broad bipartisan consensus. We have public approval. Let's do Social Security. 
   But, no. Let me tell colleagues on the other side of the aisle, the Medicare issue is going to be here a little while longer. I don't know of anybody who thinks Medicare is going to go away, or the problems in Medicare are only temporary. That issue will be here, and it is an important issue, one that should be fully debated. But it should not be used to obstruct something that is desperately needed to protect the Social Security trust fund, and that is the political game that is going on. We should call it what it is; it is an absolute red herring. 
   Social Security can be--should be--must be--protected from raids by the general government and by the very same people, I might add--we saw the Democratic leader come forward this week and say we need $10 billion more for agriculture. May I ask the Senator from Montana where that money is coming from? 
   Let me answer that question. The Social Security surplus. So is it really that they want to do the Social Security lockbox as they say? Is it really that they want to put all that money aside to make sure Social Security is solvent for the next generation? Or is it really because they just can't help themselves; they want to spend it? 
   They don't want a lockbox because a lockbox keeps their fingers out of the Social Security trust fund, which they love to raid. They just can't help themselves. They just love to stick their fingers in there and get that money out that is just sitting there. It is just sitting there. It is similar to a sailor on leave, sitting there with a shot on the bar and he is staring at it and he can't leave it alone. 
   All I am saying is: Leave Social Security alone. Pass the lockbox.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to express my support for the Harbor Gardens economic development project. I have requested funding in the Economic Development Administration (EDA) account for this worthwhile initiative in the Manchester neighborhood of Pittsburgh. 
   The mission of Harbor Gardens is to continue to help in rebuilding the economic, physical, social, human, and cultural infrastructure of one of Pittsburgh's most distressed communities. The project consists of a state-of-the-art urban greenhouse for the benefit of students and city residents. Horticulture is the fastest growing segment of agri-business, and therefore, the skills which program participants gain can translate into well-paying jobs. The project will ensure the education of its graduates in the horticultural industry, including advance greenhouse production technology and landscaping techniques. The Business and Industrial Development Corporation is partnering with the Pennsylvania State University, the School District of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh Civic Garden Center, Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Center, Zuma Canyon Orchids, and Pittsburgh Cut Flowers. Rare plants will be grown to be purchased for resale, and tours, seminars, plant auctions, and festivals will all contribute to maximizing revenues. 
   Federal funding crucial to the completion of this innovative approach to economic development, and an EDA grant will play an important role in meeting that federal commitment. 
   I look forward to working with the Chairman of the Subcommittee, Senator GREGG, to ensure that this project receives funding.

The Senator from New Jersey said, ``This side,'' meaning the Democratic side, ``gets no votes.'' Does the Senator from New Jersey realize that this is a cloture motion on the amendment? This is not a cloture motion on the bill. The cloture motion on the amendment simply says that we get a vote on our amendment. After the amendment is adopted or rejected, the bill is still there, and it is open for amendment. The amendment which we adopt, if we adopt it, will be open to amendment. The Senator can amend it. He can substitute it. He can eliminate it. He can do whatever he wants. He will get all the votes he wants.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, reclaiming my time, the Senator knows, once we put the amendment in the underlying bill, it is then open and subject to amendment which the Senator can offer. In fact, he has an unlimited right in the Senate to offer amendments to the underlying amendment. All we are doing is asking to put in this budget bill an underlying amendment for the membership to then amend to its heart's content, vote as many times as the Senator from New Jersey wants to vote. 
   As we have seen in the last 4 days, we had multiple amendments. We had, what? We had an underlying bill. We had an underlying bill that was a Democratic bill and an underlying bill that was a Republican bill. All I am saying is let us put our underlying bill in place, and then my colleagues can have all the fun they want in trying to craft different amendments to that or substituting their own version of it. 
   The Senator from New Jersey said: All we want is an honest debate. We are trying to get an honest debate. 
   Let's put the measure in the underlying bill and have at it. Let's have a full and open debate. Maybe we can get a unanimous consent agreement to be on this for a couple of days and allow amendments on both sides. That is the way we do things in this body. All of us are willing to do that. I am certainly willing to do that. I am certainly willing to give the Democrats the opportunity to put forward their lockbox proposal and willing to put forward amendments to our lockbox proposal. 
   I welcome an open, honest, and fair debate, but we cannot get there, as the Senator from New Jersey knows, unless we have a bill with which to start. We cannot start amending nothing. We have to amend something. What we are trying to do is put something in place to start the ball rolling. 
   I understand the Senator would like to have a Democratic bill start the process. I understand that. As he knows, we have to start somewhere, and putting our bill up first, as the majority, is not an irrational thing to suggest as a starting point, as long as we give you the right to amend, which we do. 
   This vote does not limit your rights at all. It limits no rights on your side. You have all the full rights that a Senator has and that the minority has under the current set of rules. So this idea that this side has no votes or this side has no amendments is not factual. You have unlimited amendments and unlimited rights to amend this proposal. 
   This proposal simply says: Every dollar coming into Social Security should be used for Social Security. The Senator from New Jersey said: Well, the House tax cut uses Social Security money. If it does, guess what. We will have a vote right here on the Senate floor in which 60 Senators will have to say: We want to spend Social Security for that tax cut. 
   I do not think you will get 60 votes. I know you will not get 60 votes. This Senator will not vote for it. I know a lot of Senators over here who will not vote for using Social Security surplus funds for any tax relief. 
   I am perfectly willing--in fact, advocating--to use the onbudget surplus to give relief to the taxpayers of America. In fact, giving them that relief will help to buy the food and the medicines and other things the Senator just talked about. It is important to do that. We do not have to do everything for everybody. We can actually let people keep their own money and do it themselves. I think people would have the preference of doing it that way. 
   As to the idea that we have the power right now to stop raids on Social Security, we do not. We do not. We saw that last October. What happened last October was that the President got together with the leaders over there, and they raided the surplus, the Social Security surplus. We did not have the courage or the opportunity with a vote to stop it. 
   If we pass this lockbox proposal, any Senator has the right to ask for a vote, and 60 Senators would have to get up and say: I would rather spend that money on whatever program or spend that money, in a sense, on tax relief. And you need 60 votes. That is a real protection for Social Security. 
   I, for the life of me, cannot understand why the Senate Democrats are now the only group of people in Washington, DC--and I daresay the country--who are opposing this. You have the President of the United States, a Democrat, who wants this. You have 99 percent of the Democrats in the House of Representatives who voted for it. You have every Republican who is supporting it. 
   The only group of people in the country, that I can see, who are against having Social Security money for just Social Security are 45 Members on the other side of the aisle. I am not too sure they understand what the American public wants and what everybody else has figured out is the right policy for America. 
   So I encourage the Senator--maybe his staff did not give him the correct information--to look at what this cloture motion does. It limits no rights for the minorities--none. You have unlimited right of amendment after this cloture motion is agreed to and we vote on this amendment. Then we can have the full and fair debate. 
   I am sure our majority leader, who cares very deeply about this bill--Social Security is very important to him--would devote as much time as necessary on the Senate floor to have that kind of debate, to get the kind of measure that can pass and be signed by the President, and we can begin the process of protecting Social Security. 
   I reserve the remainder of our time. 
   Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, before I yield to the Senator from Missouri, one of the sponsors of this legislation, I remind the Senator from New Jersey and the Senator from South Carolina, the President spoke in favor of the Social Security lockbox. He said he wanted a Social Security lockbox, period. He didn't talk about Medicare. 
   Nobody is talking about Medicare. No one in this town has talked about commingling two separate trust funds. I don't know what kind of great admission the Senator from Pennsylvania supposedly made. It is something that is obvious to every taxpayer. There are two separate trust funds, one for Medicare and one for Social Security. 
   To suggest that we should commingle those funds is a very dangerous suggestion. I think that is what the Senator from New Jersey is intimating. That is not what the President wants. That is not what the House wants, Democrats and Republicans. It is certainly not what we want. 
   If the Senator from New Jersey is suggesting that, I think he is alone on a very dangerous suggestion and one that is not healthy for either fund. That is certainly something we will not allow to have happen in the Senate. 
   I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Missouri.

   Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, the Senator from New Jersey said we should have Medicare included in this lockbox proposal. The President of the United States said: I can't believe the Republicans don't want to include it. He just finds that incredulous. 
   The Senator should talk to his own President. His own President doesn't want Medicare included in this lockbox proposal. The President has been clear. 
   Social Security money should be used for Social Security, and once you say it can be used for Medicare, it can be used for Medicare, it can be used for education, or for whatever. 
   I can tell you that Social Security recipients want Social Security to be used for Social Security. They do not want to expand the program to include other things. In fact, one of the biggest complaints I hear from seniors is that if you would quit taking money out of Social Security for every program that comes down the line, Social Security would be OK. 
   I think if we took a poll it would be overwhelming not to include any program--any program--other than Social Security in Social Security. 
   I also find it incredulous that he said there is a hole in the Social Security lockbox. 
   We wrote a provision in this bill; if we were in a recession, because we hold the debt limit, there could be a default on the credit of the United States. Is the Senator suggesting we should allow the United States to default? Isn't that what the provision says? I ask the Senator from New Mexico if he can explain that.

   Mr. SANTORUM. So the issue is not whether you can sue your HMO. That is not why we are so adamantly against the provision in the Kennedy bill. It is not to be able to sue your HMO. I do not have any problem with your being able to sue your HMO. What I do have a problem with is what this bill does; it allows you to sue your employer. It allows you to sue the employer for a decision made by an HMO, by an insurance company. What will that mean? 
   You heard the Senator from Oregon, who is a small business owner, say--and, by the way, I have talked to dozens of employers who have said this: 
   If you are going to open up the books of my corporation--I make widgets or I make steel or I make desks or I make pencils--you are going to open up my books for my employees to sue me for a decision my insurance company, that I hired, made. I cannot afford it. I am not in the business of health care. I am not managing these health care decisions. I hired someone to do that, but I am going to get sued for their decisions? Sorry, as much as I would love to provide group health insurance to you, I cannot allow the corporation--our corporation, our effort--to be jeopardized by a decision made by someone outside of what I do. 
   I cannot let it happen. They will drop their insurance. I ask for 30 additional seconds.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I thank Senator NICKLES for his outstanding leadership on this task force. We would not be where we are today, passing what I believe is a very useful and precise way to respond to a very complicated problem. Senator NICKLES shepherded this task force with great skill. He deserves a great amount of the credit for what is being accomplished today. 
   With respect to the comments that this bill is dead, it is not going anywhere, the President is going to veto it, I would say this: Of all the criticism I heard about the Republican bill, most of it is it just does not go far enough. It is not that what we are doing is not right or it is not in the right direction; it just does not do enough. 
   I do not know about you, but I have watched Congress for a long time. I have seen a lot of things happen in this institution, where sometimes it is good just to do something in the right direction, that we all agree is in the right direction. I do not think anyone is saying what you are doing is absolutely antithetical to good health care, you say internal/external--no. We need more of that, we need a tougher one, but not to say what we are doing is bad. It just is not enough. I am hopeful people will say doing something that is good should not be the enemy of what some believe is the best. 
   So I am hopeful we can get together, the House has to act, they are going to pass a different bill, and then we can sit down with the President and our colleagues on the other side of the aisle and do something that is good. Let's do something on which we can agree. Let's do something that can move the ball forward and work together so we can go out and say: We, in fact, did protect patients. We did improve the quality of health care. Maybe not as much as some would suggest we could--I differ with that--but we did do something positive. We did improve access to health insurance. We did not blow a hole and increase costs dramatically to drive people out from health coverage. That is what we need to do, to move forward and do something good.

   Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I, too, congratulate all those who have spoken. I do not want to repeat what has been said. They said it well. In the Republican bill we are not leaving 100 million people uncovered. The fact of the matter is, the States that have the authority under the law, under the Constitution, and under the McCarran-Ferguson Act, to regulate insurance do the job and do it very well. 
   What this is all about, in my mind, is arrogance. This is about people walking around in Washington, DC, thinking: This is the center of the universe, and unless we decide what is best for all of you, you cretins out there in central Pennsylvania or in Wyoming or in Tennessee, you folks just do not understand what we, the enlightened in Washington, know what is best for you. So we are going to impose on you, State legislators, insurance commissioners, what we think you should be doing, even though you have gone through the process, an exhaustive process. 
   Pennsylvania went through an exhaustive debate in the House and the Senate and with the Governor on what kinds of patient protections they were going to provide for the people who were covered by State insurance, those 100 million people who are ``uncovered.'' 
   For the people in Pennsylvania, rest assured, there was a fine Patients' Bill of Rights passed by the Pennsylvania Legislature and signed by Governor Ridge. In fact, I spoke with the sponsor of that bill over the weekend. He came up to me and said: Rick, please, please, don't pass a bill that is going to wipe out what we so carefully crafted that we believe is in the best interests of Pennsylvania. 
   Dr. Tim Murphy, the sponsor of the bill in the Pennsylvania Senate, someone who I think cares deeply about the concerns of children and concerns of the well-being of Pennsylvanians, said: Please, don't undermine what we have done. Don't put a layer of bureaucracy, the Health Care Financing Administration, overseeing the kinds of patient protections we have passed in Pennsylvania. Please, let us do what we do well, and if there are problems, we will deal with them, we will come back, and we 
   will revisit this issue--just like the issue here is not over. But give us some credit that we know what is going on in our own States. We care about the people in Pennsylvania more than Senators from California or from Louisiana or from Massachusetts. We care about our people because they are our constituents. 
   We see a lot of examples of arrogance in Washington, of the ``we know best'' attitude in this town. This is an amendment that says: Washington knows best. What goes on in State capitals is irrelevant because they do not really care about their constituents. If I am in Massachusetts, I care more about what goes on in Pennsylvania than the Governor or the State legislators, State senators. 
   That is ridiculous. The fact of the matter is, the States are engaged actively. Frankly, they are much more active than we have been in the Congress. They have been actively engaged in dealing with the problems in their States, and we should let the States do what they do best, and we should do--and the Republican bill does--what only we can do, and that is to regulate ERISA plans, with patient protections and, I add, a lot more. 
   The one thing that really sort of irks me about this whole debate is that it is not just about protecting rights with HMOs. What our bill does is much broader and deals with issues of quality and choice, giving people alternatives to HMOs, not just locking them in and trying to fix something that may or may not be broken. 
   We say you can fire an HMO, go somewhere else, and get health care in a different way. The Democrats will not let you do that. We do. 
   We provide tax breaks for the self-employed which, again, increases access to the system. They do not. We have not only quality assurance; we have choice; we have access. The thing we do not do--and I am very proud we do not--we do not drive up cost and drive people out of the insurance market. They do. 
   On all four counts of what health care reform is supposed to be about--choice, quality, access, and cost--we are the winners, not the other side.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, the issue of access to specialty care is very important. Many of us represent, as I do, hospitals that are very intensive tertiary care facilities with lots of specialists. Those of us who have had young children have had experience at children's hospitals and have dealt with specialists and recognized the need for that. 
   I can tell you as a father of four young children and a child who is due in September, I am not going to stand here and say we are not going to provide access to the kind of specialty care for children, or anybody else, that is needed. I am confident that the bill before us does exactly that. It does exactly that. It provides access to specialty care when it is necessary to save or help improve the life of a young child or anybody else. 
   As an example, if you have a baby who is born with a rare heart disease and the pediatrician recommends that a pediatric cardiologist treat the baby, the claim is made and it is denied initially, and it goes through the internal review process. Specialty care is covered under the contract. Remember, we are dealing with covered benefits, so obviously if it is not a covered benefit, that is a different issue. But if it is covered--and, of course, most HMOs cover some sort of specialty care--it is covered. 
   But in this case, say the network doesn't have a pediatric cardiologist. So you have, in a sense, what is laid out by the other side, the worst case scenario. The network doesn't have a specialist, and therefore they just won't give this specialist treatment because there isn't a pediatric cardiologist available to treat this. So a regular pediatrician would have to do so. 
   Well, that is not the case in our bill. Our bill says that this particular denial is eligible for review by an independent external reviewer. The dispute is about who should provide the specialty care. That is an element of medical judgment. Therefore, if it is an element of medical judgment, it is eligible for review. If it is an independent review and the reviewer says yes---- 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>106-santorum-pa-3-19990714</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SANTORUM. If I can get through this first. It is eligible for a review. An independent reviewer, under our bill, will look at all of the facts in the case and determine whether, in fact, the pediatric cardiologist is necessary in medical judgment to, in fact, perform this procedure. They make an independent medical determination based on all of the information that is reviewed, including the recommendation of the doctor, the original pediatrician, including the recommendation by the internal reviewer. They look at all of the information, they get all of the relevant facts, and they put this together--as has been listed many times here--a laundry list of factors to consider, and they make an independent judgment as to whether a pediatric cardiologist is necessary. If it is necessary, the denial is overturned. The specialist outside of the network is selected to provide the care for this child within the HMO. 
   That is in our bill. That is covered under our bill. So all of this talk about we are not going to have this kind of access is not carefully reading this bill. I give a lot of credit to Senator FRIST and Senator JEFFORDS and those on the health committee. They have done an excellent job of looking through and making sure all of these kinds of situations where you have limitations--and in many cases you do have limitations, and the networks don't have a lot of specialists. But you can go outside the network if an independent reviewer determines that is what is medically necessary in that case.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I wanted to respond to the Senator from New Mexico. My time had run out. My understanding is that the provision in the bill says the network has to provide access to specialty care. We define in the report language clearly what access means as far as cost sharing is concerned:  
   When the plan covers a benefit or service that is appropriately provided by a particular type of specialist not in the network, the benefit will be provided using the in-network cost-sharing schedule.  
   In other words, no additional costs. Only in cases where it is a preference to go outside the network for a specialist, other than somebody in the network, where it has not been referred by the plan or determined by a reviewer, is that additional cost borne. As long as an independent reviewer or the plan refers out of network, the cost sharing is the same.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, will the Senator from Oklahoma yield for a question? As a matter of fact, we have some information just provided to us that under the Kennedy legislation, S. 6, with 1.9 million people no longer being insured, you would have 188,595 fewer breast examinations. If people had their routine breast examinations, of those 1.9 million, a certain percentage would be women, that would be the number of breast exams that would no longer take place if this legislation passed. 
   We hear so much talk about ``in human terms,'' and they say this argument does not cut. These people are going to lose insurance. They will lose insurance. They will not get coverage so you do not have to worry about covering them for a mastectomy. They are going to find out, in many cases, unfortunately, far too late for even those kinds of treatments to be helpful. That is what we are trying to prevent in not passing a bill that drives up costs dramatically which drives people out of the insurance area.

No. 1, it establishes 100-percent deductibility for the self-employed, something for which I know many Members of both sides of the aisle have been striving. One of the things we have said about our health care proposal is that ours is much more comprehensive than the Democratic plan. It looks at the issue of access.

   Mr. SANTORUM. As I said, our bill is much more comprehensive. We looked at the question of access and making health insurance more affordable to cover more people, to bring them into the insurance market. Our bill, with this amendment, does that. 
   The other thing we do is we emphasize that we do not want the Federal Government, the Health Care Financing Administration, to oversee State-regulated plans. Almost all 50 States have passed a Patients' Bill of Rights. They traditionally regulate health insurance. They are doing a very good job. We do not need to impose HCFA regulations and HCFA control over every State insurance department. It is the wrong approach. It is Washington getting its teeth into the State pie. That is unnecessary.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I have to comment on the statement of the Senator from New Jersey. 
   One of the more vexing problems we have in political debate in America is who is telling the truth. What I am going to tell you is 180 degrees from what the Senator from New Jersey just said. What he repeatedly said is true is, in fact, not true. 
   What the Senator from New Jersey said is that the Democrats would not be able to offer amendments on the Social Security lockbox as a result of the cloture votes that were taken on April 22, April 30, and June 15. That is not true. 
   Let me state that again, emphatically, to the Senator from New Jersey and to the American public: What the Senator from New Jersey just said, which is that Democrats were blocked from offering amendments on the issue of a Social Security lockbox, is not true. So the entire speech we just heard was, in fact, a statement which had no basis in fact. That is true. 
   The Senator from New Jersey could have opposed cloture and offered all the amendments he wanted on the Social Security lockbox. We could have had hours, days of debate on a Social Security lockbox. We wanted to have those kinds of debates. They refused.

   Mr. SANTORUM. The April 22 vote was a vote on cloture on the first-degree amendment. The tree was not filled. It was a first-degree amendment vote on cloture, No. 1. We wanted a vote on that particular amendment, yes. 
   After that amendment would have passed or failed, you were then available to offer all the amendments you  wanted on Social Security. You could have offered your own Social Security lockbox. You could have taken the Abraham bill and changed the wording in it, and we could have had a vote on that, but you did not want to do that. You did not want to have that debate. You refused us even getting into a vote. All we wanted to do with these cloture motions was to say: Give us a clean vote on this particular proposal. After that, you are free to amend it. You are free to offer your own; you can do whatever you want. You can offer a Medicare lockbox. You can do whatever you want. Just give us a vote on our proposal and then you are welcome to do whatever else you want. You said emphatically, unanimously, three times: No.

   Mr. SANTORUM. All I say to the Senator from New Jersey is that all we asked for is to give us a clean up-or-down vote on our amendment. After that amendment, you could have amended that thing, you could have offered your own, done anything you wanted. All we wanted to make sure of was that we had a clean vote on our amendment to start this debate, and after that, you could have done anything you wanted. 
   By the way, if you look at the statement you just read into the RECORD, you said exactly the opposite of what I just said. You said you could not have offered amendments when, in fact, you could have. You still had the right to, and you chose not to because you didn't want to enter into this debate. 
   We see a wonderful willingness on the part of the Democrats now, after the President joined our side in saying we want a lockbox, to open up and debate this and offer amendments, when you had the very same opportunity four times to do the same thing. 
   I welcome that. I welcome that we are going to have an opportunity to focus in on what I think is one of the most important things--not just for Social Security but important things for the long-term fiscal future of this country, this government; that is, putting in place a provision that says if you are going to spend more money on new government programs, or even if they are going to spend money on tax cuts, you are not going to spend it on Social Security unless you stand up before this Senate and before the American public and say: We are going to take Social Security dollars. We believe it is more important to do tax cuts. We believe it is more important to do funding for education or funding for defense than it is to provide money for Social Security. 
   That is the vote we are looking for. That is the vote of accountability that we want every Member of the Senate to have to cast. That is the fiscal discipline, when people have to make that choice, and it is clear to everybody what the choice is. We have lots of points of order and procedural things, but then everybody sort of walks out of the room and spins it their way. In this case, with the lockbox vote, where it says you have to vote on a motion that says we will spend Social Security money for X or Y or Z, you have to tell the American people that you believe that is a higher priority than Social Security. 
   We have no such vote today. But if we pass a lockbox, then the American public will know what your choices are. There may be a situation where we need to spend Social Security money. Frankly, I can't think of one, but there may be one--an emergency, a true emergency, where our national security is at risk. There may be a situation where we want to spend Social Security dollars, but it has to be voted on. That is the most important thing. That is what the other side never wanted to have happen. 
   I thank the President for breaking the logjam over there. The House Democrats did a pretty good job; they passed a Social Security lockbox bill. But it was the folks on the other side who stood as the dam to this current that was flowing through the Congress. I thank the President for getting the beavers to work, getting them out of the way and making sure we can have a full, fair, and open debate--as we could have three or four times previous to this. We could have had a full, fair, open debate in the Senate about a very important issue, yes, for Social Security but just as important to the fiscal discipline of the U.S. Government in the future. 
   I thank the Senator from Michigan and the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. ABRAHAM and Mr. DOMENICI, for their excellent work on this issue.

   Mr. SANTORUM. The Senator from Washington was saying we are restricting someone's right by not paying for an abortion, which posits the interesting question that right now comes with a guarantee that the Government will pay for that right. We have freedom of speech guaranteed in the Constitution. Does the Government pay for someone who wants to speak? Do the taxpayers pay to put them on television if they want to speak?

   Mr. SANTORUM. That is the obvious question. 
   A right is a right, but it does not include the right of the Government to pay for the exercise of that right. 
   In fact, there could be complications--there is a separation of church and state--if the Government were to get involved in enforcing those rights in this kind of way. 
   I think we set a very dangerous precedent when we elevate a right to the point where the Government now has to pay for the access of that right or for the enforcement of that right. I think that is a dangerous standard that the Senator from Washington has posited and one I hope the Senate will reject tonight. 
   I thank the Senator.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to express my support for Courthouse Construction funding for the U.S. federal courthouse in Erie, Pennsylvania. This courthouse is in dire need of repair, and the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts has placed the Erie Federal Courthouse on its priority list, and the General Services Administration is in the final stages of completing the design for the refurbished complex, which will be ready for construction in FY2000. Specifically, this project involves the alteration of the existing Erie Federal Building, the acquisition, repair and alteration of the adjacent Erie County Library building for the bankruptcy court and court of appeals; and the construction of a new courthouse annex for the district court. The current courthouse provides inadequate space and is not consolidated in a single location, presenting logistical and security concerns for jurors, judges, attorneys, and the public. The project, which will be a major step in the revitalization of downtown Erie, will rely substantially on the rehabilitation of existing structures as opposed to more costly, new construction. 
   I understand that the President's budget did not include funding for courthouse construction for the third consecutive year. This failure to provide funding for the needs of our judicial system is a serious oversight that should not stand in the way of the safety and security of my constituents in Erie. 
   I look forward to working with the Chairman of the Treasury and General Government Subcommittee, Senator CAMPBELL, and my colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator SPECTER, to ensure that this project receives funding as soon as possible. In the meantime, I urge the General Services Administration to take any necessary actions to rectify safety concerns or logistical problems that may result from this lapse in funding.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the cloture motion on the motion to proceed to the issue of steel quotas. 
   Senator ROCKEFELLER, who is my counterpart on the Democratic side leading this debate, and I are not people who have come to the floor of the Senate in favor of quotas. In fact, we think we are driven to this point as people who believe in free and fair trade, to ask the Senate to consider imposing quotas on the dumping of steel in this country by foreign nations. 
   It is remarkable what has occurred. It is unprecedented what has occurred in the steel industry over the past 2 1/2 years. We have seen the level of steel rise, as far as imports into this country, two, three, four, five times the amount from some countries in the past 2 1/2 years--and it continues. 
   One of the mantras I hear from the administration, which is lobbying against this bill, is that the crisis is over. I can say that in the case of China, for example, the world's largest producer, just in the first 4 months of this year their dumping was up 80 percent--their imports were up 80 percent. 
   So if the crisis is over, why then was the largest steel manufacturer dumping more steel into our market in the first 4 months of this year? 
   We have a continuing problem. What Senator ROCKEFELLER and I, and others who have joined us in this cause, are suggesting is something, frankly, that is very modest. We are suggesting a quota for 3 years to stop this outrageous and, I might add, illegal dumping. 
   We have won or are winning every single dumping case in the international arena. Every single case we are winning because of the illegality of what is being done by our foreign competitors in the steel industry. 
   What we are asking is not to go to a low rate of imports; what we are asking is to go to a rate of import into this country, a share of imports in the domestic market equal to a level that has only been reached four times in the past 30 years. So arguably we are setting the bar very high. 
   We are not going in to protect an industry that is inefficient or that is uncompetitive. The steel industry today is the most productive, competitive, and efficient steel industry in the world. Yet they are being wiped out by subsidized, illegally dumped steel, costing us thousands of good-paying jobs and thousands of families not going home with paychecks to support their children. 
   I am very hopeful that we can get a bipartisan vote today to at least move to proceed to the bill. That is all this vote does. It says let's put this issue front and center in the Senate, let's point out to our competitors around the globe that the Senate is not going to step aside and allow this illegal dumping to continue, that we are going to debate it, that we take this issue very seriously, and that we are not going to allow this kind of illegal action to continue. 
   I know my 3 minutes are up. I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I want to pick up where the Senator from West Virginia left off, and that is to make very clear what we are voting on today. We are not voting on a steel quota bill. We are voting simply to bring the issue to the floor of the Senate for open debate and discussion and amendment. I do not think anyone in this Chamber can say what has gone on in the steel industry has been good for America. I have heard from some of the speakers--incredibly so--that somehow or another this was good for American jobs; we create American jobs when people illegally, against our trade laws, being subsidized by foreign governments, dump product into this country--that somehow that is good for America. 
   I do not think it is good for America. We have laws that are in place to stop that because we think it is unfair. We think that is illegal. So when I hear these arguments that we have to let the marketplace work, the fact is the marketplace is not working. The administration is not working in enforcing our laws. So what we are saying is, the Congress needs to get to work. Congress needs to get to work, to talk about how we can put this together. 
   The Senator from Michigan talked about the bill that came out of the Finance Committee. That could be an amendment to this bill. 
   It could be a substitute to this bill. If you want a vehicle to have a fair and honest debate about what our steel policy should be, what our trade policy should be, this is the vehicle to do it. Let's vote on the motion to proceed. Let's bring up this matter. It is an important matter, as the Senator from West Virginia said, to at least 16 States. It has impacted tens of thousands of workers across this country. It is a very serious, desperate situation for many major companies in the United States. All we are asking for out of this vote is to let us be heard on the floor of the Senate. If you do not like the solution, as the Senator from Delaware said--the junior Senator from Delaware said he does not like the solution--fine. Bring up another measure. Bring up an alternative. We will have a debate on that. We will have a vote on that, and we will work our will in the Senate to address an issue that needs to be addressed. That is all we are saying. 
   Please, let the folks back in Akron, OH, in Pittsburgh, PA, and Weirton, WV, the people in the Senate care about what is going on in their lives. Let them know we are not deaf to the pain they are going through in losing their jobs. Let them know by just giving us a chance to debate this bill and do something about the crisis in the steel industry in this country. 
   I yield the floor.

   Ms. SANTORUM. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for yielding me time. I congratulate him and the entire working group on the Republican side of the aisle--Senators JEFFORDS, COLLINS, FRIST, and GRAMM for putting together what I believe is a bill that this Senate should embrace. I think America, if they were given the choice between what is being offered on the Democratic side and what is being offered on the Republican side, would quickly embrace this plan for many reasons. 
   No. 1, it is a much more comprehensive plan. This is the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus. It is not just some consumer protection measures which Democrats have put forward--and we have, to some degree, done the same--but it goes much farther. By looking at the health care picture in America, on a comprehensive basis, we took a step back and said, what can we do to improve quality, to improve access, to reduce costs--not responding to hot button poll issues? 
   It seems to be the popular move around here--when something polls well, we rush out here and try, with legislative fixes, to pass something that sounds good to the American public. 
   We did not take that approach. We took the approach of how, from a public policy point of view, we are going to solve 
   real problems in America--not real problems that maybe poll well but real problems that solve structural problems, structural problems in the health care system, which will end up benefiting millions of people. 
   One such area is that of access. Much has been talked about in relation to patients' rights. We have not heard a lot of talk on the other side about access to insurance. There are a couple of components to that. 
   No. 1, keep the costs down. We have heard a lot of talk about how the other bill, the Kennedy bill, dramatically increases costs. Our bill does not do that. So in that respect, we already, by virtue of not driving up health care costs, improve access. But we do more than that. 
   We do two specific things in the tax portion of this bill. First, we increase the deductibility of insurance for the self-employed up to 100 percent. So we put them on an even playing field with those who have employer-provided health care. We give 100 percent deductibility, thereby increasing the desirability of owning health care insurance, of buying that insurance for yourself as a self-employed individual, thereby getting more people into the health care system, which is something everybody believes is necessary and desirable. 
   Second, we provide for medical savings accounts. Medical savings accounts have gotten, from a public policy perspective, a little bit of a bad rap based on what was passed here a few years ago. What was passed here a few years ago was a program that was designed to fail. Those who designed it got exactly what was predicted--failure. 
   It is a program that is very limited. Very few taxpayers can participate in it. It is time limited. It does not allow you to carry contributions from year to year. It is a program that has very little in the way of a design that would be attractive. In fact, what would attract people to MSAs is the ability to control their own health care costs, which is the ability to profit personally--instead of the insurance companies managing your health care, doing things that keep you healthy. Those are some of the attractions of MSAs that are the control element, all of which are forfeited under the existing MSA proposal. 
   The bill that we are offering removes all these restrictions--artificial--to dampen the enthusiasm for the program, to make it less attractive and less workable, and allows a full-blown medical savings account proposal to go forward and to put it into the mix of health care delivery options, insurance options, again, creating more choices, creating, in this case, a high deductible insurance option that is very attractive to people who we have a very difficult time bringing into the insurance system but are very important to get in there, and those are younger workers, in particular. 
   We have a very difficult time convincing younger uninsured people that it is maybe worthwhile to go out and buy insurance coverage. Most young people think they are infallible, that they cannot be hurt, that they do not need insurance. What we do is create a savings component to health insurance which is a very attractive thing, particularly for younger people and yet, at the same time, very useful for everyone--once people understand how the dynamics of medical savings accounts work. 
   So it has the dual components of attracting those very desirable people into the insurance pool--younger workers who 
   have, in fact, less health care costs--and at the same time provides the kinds of choices and quality and the proper incentives to the rest of the population in the health care system through these medical savings accounts. 
   So I am very excited that what we have been able to accomplish in this bill is not just to provide some hot button issues with regard to HMOs which poll well--and I understand that----

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I will respond to the Senator from New Jersey. The Senator from New Jersey knows if we get cloture on this bill, germane amendments would be allowed. So if what he is concerned about is Social Security and debating Social Security, germane Social Security amendments will be available. What will not be available are spurious amendments to make political points that have nothing to do with Social Security, such as what is being discussed by the Senator from North Dakota who wants to take non-Social Security money, non-Medicare money, and create a lockbox of general fund revenues for Medicare. 
   As the Senator from New Jersey knows, that has nothing to do with Social Security. It has nothing to do with lockboxing Social Security. It has nothing to do with lockboxing the Medicare trust fund. It is a tangential amendment aimed at making political points, having nothing to do with Social Security, as are the bulk, from my understanding, of the other amendments. 
   So in sincerity, I say to the Senator from New Jersey, if he really is concerned about Social Security and having an honest debate about Social Security and the amendments thereto, vote for cloture because he will have ample opportunity to have a plethora of amendments that deal with the issue of Social Security and the lockbox thereon. 
   So the demagoguery we have heard that somehow we are precluding debate on the most vital issue of the day is false. We are, in fact, providing a forum for a limited and narrow and focused discussion, absent political demagoguery, to talk just about Social Security. 
   So, if the Senator is truly concerned with the issue of Social Security and the preeminence of it as a policy issue, then he has the opportunity before him right now to vote for cloture so we can focus the agenda and the discussion on that very issue. 
   Second, I want to respond to the Senator from North Dakota who I think has offered a very reasonable concept, although I am not sure his charts follow through with that concept. The Senator from North Dakota suggested that we need to lockbox Medicare and suggested there were $650-some-odd billion to be lockboxed for Medicare. I do not know where he comes up with $650-odd billion that is in the Medicare fund surplus in the future. In fact, between the years 2000 and 2009, the net surplus in the Medicare trust fund is $14 billion. In the next 5 years the surplus will be $53 billion, but then it goes negative, from 2006 to 2009 $39 billion. 
   I am willing right now to coauthor a bill with the Senator from North Dakota to put a lockbox on the Medicare trust fund similar to the Social Security trust fund. But that is not what the Senator from North Dakota is saying. He would lead you to believe that is what he is saying, that we need a similar lockbox for Medicare as we have for Social Security. 
   Remember, the Social Security lockbox said Social Security money must be used for Social Security. A similar Medicare lockbox would be very simple: Medicare taxes must be used for Medicare. 
   Is that what the Senator from North Dakota has asked for? No, he has not. What the Senator from North Dakota said is all of the surplus in the future--the non-Medicare surplus, the non-Social Security surplus, the general fund surplus--has to be used for Medicare. That is what the Senator from North Dakota did. That is not what he told us, but that is what he did. 
   Why does he want to do that? Because he wants to take the general fund surplus--which many believe, if we have more money in the general fund than we need, we should provide tax relief to those who overpaid--and use it for Medicare. 
   I believe in the integrity of the Medicare program and the integrity of the Social Security program. They are funded specifically by taxes and spent within that trust fund. That is how we should fix Medicare, and that is how we should fix Social Security. We should not be borrowing from other areas any more than on the general Government side we should not be borrowing from Social Security and Medicare. It is honesty in budgeting. What happened a few minutes ago on the floor was not exactly the most forthright explanation of budgeting in this area. 
   What we are proposing is very simple. We have a surplus in Social Security, and if we do not lock it up and create hurdles for spending that money, there will be those, incredibly enough, who will use that money for other things such as, oh, wonderful things, including tax cuts. There may be some who want--I do not want to do tax cuts with Social Security money; I will not do tax cuts with Social Security money. You will not find any tax cut I will not vote for. I will vote for all of them, but I will not use Social Security money. 
   It puts constraints on us on this side of the aisle who would love to see tax cuts but will not use Social Security, contrary to what the Senator from New Jersey just said. You cannot use it for tax cuts and spending increases. That is all we say. 
   Let's make a downpayment on Social Security reform by not spending the money. It is as simple as that. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I compliment the Senator from Missouri for his excellent work on the Small Business Committee in a very important area--the dramatic growth in electronic commerce and the ability of small businesses to participate in that. We hear so much about the family farm and the small business community being in jeopardy. As we transition in this economy, to have a chairman of the Small Business Committee who is on top of that and working to integrate the advances in electronic commerce with our small business community, and to make those advances available to them is very important. I congratulate him on that, and Senator MACK and Senator BENNETT of the Joint Economic Committee for a series of hearings this week in the area of technology and its impact and continued potential impact on our country and on our economy and the world economy. 
   These are the things, frankly, we do not do enough of around here, looking at the future to see how we can adjust our public policy to alleviate not just what the problems are or what the problems were that have been with us but how, through innovation, we can form the future to alleviate those problems. 
   So I am very pleased we are focusing in on the future as opposed to just dealing with the current important problems; not looking through the rear-view mirror instead of looking in front at the opportunities ahead us.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, finally I want to comment on the vote we just had on the lockbox. I have to say I am puzzled and disappointed at the unanimous opposition by Senate Democrats to a proposal that passed with 416 votes in the House. Obviously, almost every House Democrat--all but 12--voted in favor of this measure, a measure which obviously has broad bipartisan support and, as many have stated in the House and the Senate, one that is a first step toward dealing with the long-term problems of Social Security. 
   The first step is very simple. We have a surplus. Do not spend it on things other than Social Security; save it for Social Security. We are eventually going to have to do Social Security reform. We are going to have to strengthen it and save it for future generations. It runs out of money in the next 15 years, so we are going to have to do something. We have surpluses building up which are now just being borrowed by the Government and spent on other things. We have had that happen for the past 20 years. 
   We are now in a unique position. We are close to an on-budget surplus. We are not quite there, but we are very close to an on-budget surplus, non-Social Security surplus. So we have the Social Security money which will go to save Social Security by reducing the Federal debt unless we spend it. In a sense, all this lockbox does is say: Don't spend the money. Don't come up with new ideas and new ways to spend Social Security. 
   We are not asking anybody to cut anything. That is one of the most remarkable things about it. We are not asking the other side to cut money to make sure the money is there for Social Security. All we are saying is don't spend more. That is why it received bipartisan support in the House. 
   We hear so much talk on both sides of the aisle about how we have to save Social Security first, how Social Security is the highest priority, how we have to make sure money is there for future generations. In fact, in the budget vote just a couple of months ago, we had a 100-to-nothing or 99-to-nothing vote that we need to save Social Security; we are not going to spend that money in the trust fund. That was just a sense of the Senate. In other words, the first had no binding effect in law. 
   Now the mechanism comes along that says if we are going to pass a bill that is going to spend Social Security surpluses, we have to have a separate vote where we have to stand up before the clerk and say: Yes, I will spend the Social Security surplus on this. 
   There is no such vote that has to be cast right now. This will set up a point of order where every Member of the Senate has to say to the people back home: I want to spend Social Security money on this, because I think it is more important than Social Security. That is all this point of order does. 
   There are points of order out there on spending, but there is nothing clear. There are points of order whereby you can challenge something if it breaks the budget point of order or this and that, and people run out and say it is really not Social Security. You can dance around it. You can spin it back home. There are lots of folks very good at spinning. The wonderful thing about this provision is you cannot spin it. It is what it is. It is a vote that says we will spend the Social Security surplus on this. That will have, I believe, the 
   greatest impact--in this body and the other body, and in particular the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, the President--on controlling our willingness to raid the Social Security trust fund for the demands of spending today. Or, for that matter, the demands of tax cuts today. I want to add, it is not just a governor on those, principally on the other side, who want to spend more. It is also a governor on those on this side who want to cut more taxes. 
   As I said before, there is no tax cut I will not vote for, just about. But I am not going to do it out of the Social Security surplus. We will do it out of the general fund where the taxes are paid in. If people are paying in too much in the general fund, give them a tax cut, if we can. I will vote for it. If we can cut spending in the general fund to pay for a tax cut, I will vote for it. But I will not fund a tax cut out of Social Security funds, and that is what this says. 
   While on the first vote on cloture many Democrats will vote no as a matter of principle, I am hopeful they will understand this is a bill that has consensus, that can be signed, that can put real restraints on our ability and the President's ability to spend the Social Security surplus and, hopefully, we will reach a point where we can have bipartisan consensus on this, because Social Security is simply too important to continue to play political games. 
   I think what we have seen here is all the rhetoric says: Yes, we agree; yes, we agree. But when it comes down to casting the vote, what we have is this spurious argument, ``You are not letting us amend it,'' which I find is quite remarkable because, if you look at the amendments, they have virtually nothing to do with Social Security. 
   In fact, I have not seen all the amendments, but those I have been made aware of have absolutely nothing to do with Social Security. They all have to do with what we do with the general fund surplus, and that is the non-Social Security, non-Medicare surplus. 
   We have on a bill, which is focused on Social Security, on how we save Social Security, an attempt to bring in a whole lot of other issues to clog up this issue, to bog it down, and, in my mind, to try to destroy any chance of this ever becoming law.

   Mr. SANTORUM. I will respond to that. It is a far 
   different thing to put a Government program--and I do not know of any Government program that exists, with maybe the exception of defense, but defense has changed over time--in the Constitution of the United States and say we are going to set up this Federal program that must be, in a sense, left alone when future Congresses, as I certainly hope will occur, will be making adjustments to that program. 
   In fact, 200 years from now, who knows what this country is going to look like. It may, in fact, want to do something completely different than what we have in mind today. I think that was the concern of a lot of us. If we were going to start enshrining Government programs in the Constitution, that is a fairly dangerous precedent, and I think a lot of us had real concerns about that. 
   At the same time, there was broad sympathy that we do need during this time of surplus, because it is not going to be forever that the Social Security surpluses will be there, as the Senator knows because, again, things change--for this time period, we can lock this away and do it by legislation, in this case a point of order. 
   As the Senator knows, 15 years from now, that provision in the Constitution would work almost in some respects against Social Security because they would be running a deficit. As the economics of Social Security change, enshrining that in the Constitution I do not think is in the best interest of Social Security. Here we can react to  what is a surplus situation and make sure that it is protected from raids. 
   What will happen in the future is that it will be a deficit situation, and there may be a different dynamic that goes on with respect to that, which I do not think the Constitution would provide for.

    Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Elizabeth Burke, who has been chosen as a 1999 Community Health Leader by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation for her efforts to combat domestic violence. As one of 10 outstanding individuals selected each year to receive this distinguished award for finding innovative ways to bring health care to communities whose needs have been ignored and unmet, Ms. Burke's work on behalf of domestic violence victims has become a national model. 
   A former victim of domestic violence, Elizabeth Burke was hired to start up the Domestic Violence Medical Advocacy Project at Mercy Hospital in Pittsburgh in 1994. The project is a joint effort between Mercy Hospital and the Women's Center and Shelter of Greater Pittsburgh, and since its start five years ago, the hospital has increased the identification of domestic violence victims by more than 500 percent. Women are offered counseling, education, shelter and employment programs in the 24 hour, 40 bed facility. The Center screens all women who are admitted into the hospital, identifying domestic violence victims at a point when they are most receptive to help. 
   Ms. Burke is responsible for training hundreds of physicians, nurses, social workers as well as others in prevention diagnosis, treatment and advocacy for victims of domestic violence. Since coming to the project she has successfully bridged the gap between the domestic violence and medical fields to create a comprehensive response to victims of domestic violence. From emergency room screenings to follow-up services to an extensive prevention network, she ensures that abused women get help before the violence destroys their lives. 
   Ms. Burke's efforts don't stop there. She also chairs the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence and makes presentations on domestic violence to a broad community. In addition, she serves as adjunct faculty at the University of Pittsburgh, University of Missouri and West Virginia University. 
   Mr. President, many victims of domestic violence have been touched by Elizabeth Burke's compassionate spirit. I ask my colleagues to join with me in commending Ms. Burke for her extraordinary contribution to the Pittsburgh community and to all victims of domestic violence.

    Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Antonio J. (Tony) Palumbo, a coal miner from Western Pennsylvania who humbly represents the generous spirit of community. 
   President and owner of the New Shawmut Mining company, Mr. Palumbo was born in Pennsylvania on June 14, 1906 and actively serves as a Trustee for La Roche College, Duquesne University, Carlow College, Gannon College, the Villa Nazareth School in Rome, Italy, and the Mayo Clinic Foundation for Medical Education and Research. He has also developed unique relationships with the Catholic Diocese of Erie, Elk County Christian High School, the Nicaraguan-American Nursing Collaboration, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, the Holy Family Institute and the Boy Scouts of St. Marys, PA. 
   Throughout his years of involvement at these institutions, Mr. Palumbo has gained the admiration and respect of the many students that he has come in contact with. His influence in their lives will be felt for many years to come. 
   Mr. Palumbo was recently presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award by the National Society of Fund Raising Executives. His efforts have helped build educational and health care facilities, endow research, provide scholarships, deliver care to the poor and support community initiatives. As varied as each of these causes are, they all reflect Tony Palumbo's compassion for the needs of others and his commitment to using his time and talents to enrich the lives of those around him. 
   Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join with me in commending Tony Palumbo for the leadership and compassion that he has portrayed, as well as the platform that he has created for motivating the stewardship of others.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I think the fine representatives from the State of Missouri, Senators BOND and ASHCROFT, addressed the issue of the F/A-18E/F adequately on the merits. Frankly, I will not address that because that is not what this amendment does. 
   This amendment has nothing to do with the merits of the F/A-18E/F. This  has to do with a cost cap on a fixed price contract. Frankly, I was willing to accept this amendment because a fixed price contract is a fixed price contract. Putting a cost cap on the fixed price times the number doesn't really have any impact. 
   What we are going to pay for this is already in law. What his amendment did, which I objected to, was that it did not allow any increase in money for what is called technology insertion. What does that mean? Well, if we come up with a better radar system in the next few years while we are procuring these F/A-18E/Fs, and if we want to put a new radar system in, which would cost more money, under the Feingold amendment we can't do that. 
   The Senator from Wisconsin talked about how we have an obligation to our naval aviators, to make sure they have the most competent equipment to be out there flying. I agree. That is why I can't support this amendment. If we put this in, we would be denying those very aviators a technology insertion that would be important in improving the survivability of the aircraft, or their ability to locate targets, or whatever the case may be. 
   This is a dangerous amendment. It threatens our naval aviators who are going to be flying these aircraft because we are not going to allow the insertion of technology for an additional cost that may increase the efficacy of that aircraft. 
   One other comment. This was in response to the comment of the Senator from Wisconsin that we should not be approving this multiyear contract, which we do under this bill, without having the operational evaluation of testing go on, which could fail. 
   I say to the Senator from Wisconsin, if it fails, under our bill, there is no multiyear contract. We spell out specifically in this legislation that it has to pass OPEVAL. If it doesn't, there is no multiyear. 
   We have taken care of the Senator from Wisconsin in that if there are problems--and the Senator lists a variety that he believes exist--and if that is what is determined by the Department of Defense and the Bureau of Testing, we will not have a multiyear contract. So the Senator will get his wish. 
   So I think, in the end, the Senator's amendment is superfluous at best--if he would agree to the amendment I suggested--but it is dangerous now because it doesn't allow for technology insertion. So I will move, at the appropriate time, to table the Feingold amendment.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes. 
   In response to the amendment of the Senator from Wisconsin, it is an additional hurdle to begin production of the E and F. This says that we cannot move forward with production, full-scale production, of this aircraft without a successful operational test and evaluation. That will be done by operational test pilots, maintenance people, experts in evaluating aircraft. They do the testing. They will do the report. The commander of operational test forces will issue the report, determine whether there was a successful test, and then that report will be given to the director of operational test and evaluation, who, under normal circumstances, will then make the decision that a successful test has been conducted. 
   So all of that will have to be done. After that, again, according to normal procurement, he would send that recommendation on to the Defense Acquisition Board, which would review all of the tests to determine whether it was successful and make the decision to go ahead and procure the aircraft. 
   Under our bill, we put in an additional step. We say that after the director of operational test and evaluation reviews the report, they have to then get a certification from the Secretary of Defense that this program has successfully completed operational test and evaluation. We have put an additional step in that is outside the course of the normal procurement area before the decision for acquisition is made. So we have already put in one additional step. 
   What the Senator from Wisconsin wants to do is put an additional step in. This is somewhat dangerous in this  respect: He includes no time limit. GAO can take 2 years if they want to. They can take whatever amount of time they want, hold up a $2.8 billion contract, hold up what is a needed requirement for the Navy to determine when a bunch of people with ``green eye shades,'' as the Senator from Missouri said--to make the determination as to whether auditors believe that the test pilots and the maintenance people and the Secretary of Defense and the director of operational test and evaluation, the defense acquisition board, they were all wrong--all the experts were wrong, and congressional auditors are really the best determinant as to whether this aircraft meets its requirements, is needed, and should be procured. 
   I don't think we want to do that. I think that sets a very dangerous precedent. Frankly, it raises some constitutional questions as to whether the Congress can, in fact, do that. 
   I can say to the Senator from Wisconsin, the junior Senator from Missouri had me out to St. Louis. I went through and reviewed extensively, spending the better part of a day at the facility in St. Louis. This is a program of which I think everyone will be proud. They are using state-of-the-art manufacturing techniques. They are, as the Senators have said, ahead of schedule, meeting every single benchmark. They have 4,000 hours of flight time, more than any other aircraft that has been tested in history. 
   I think this is an additional hurdle that is unnecessary and potentially dangerous. That is why I will at the appropriate time move to table the amendment of the Senator from Wisconsin.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, the F/A-18E/F is a fixed-price contract. It is a fixed-price contract for the extent of the contract. What the Senator from Wisconsin does is put a price cap on a fixed-price contract. Fine. I am willing to accept that. But what he did not include in his amendment was a provision for technology insertion. 
   In other words, if we come up with a new radar system that can improve the quality of the aircraft, under his amendment we could not buy that improvement and put it on the aircraft. I was willing to accept his amendment, if he would allow for that technical improvement insertion provision. But he refused to do so. 
   So, unfortunately, while I think the amendment is somewhat meaningless because it is a fixed price contract, I have to oppose the amendment, and would ask, for the sake of our naval aviators to make sure they have the best equipment to fly, that my colleagues join in supporting the motion to table.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise to support my amendment. The amendment is offered to address a problem in this country which we have talked a lot about here, which is the short amount of time that people serve  in prison and, in fact, are sentenced to prison for the most violent of crimes in our society. 
   The chart says the average prison time served for rape in this country is only 5 1/2 years, and that, by the way, is a slight increase over the past dozen or so years. Average prison time served for child molestation is 4 years; 4 years for child molestation. The average time served for homicide is just 8 years. 
   These statistics are for time served. Time sentenced, in many cases, is just a little bit more than that, but not significantly more than that. 
   It is a very serious problem, particularly in the area of raping and sexually molesting a child, where the recidivism rate is very high, where we are putting back on the street to terrorize our citizenry, people who should be incarcerated for a much longer period of time. 
   A group of Members, MATT SALMON in the House of Representatives, and I in the Senate, have introduced a bill called Aimee's law, named after Aimee Willard, a victim of a horrible rape and murder in the city of Philadelphia by a man, Arthur Bomar, who was released from prison in Nevada--released after murdering someone in Nevada, released after not serving his full sentence. By the way, he was violent in Nevada and had assaulted a woman while in prison, but Nevada let him out early. Unfortunately, Arthur Bomar found Aimee Willard and Aimee was brutally murdered and raped. 
   Aimee's mom, Gail Willard, has put together a group of people who said it is time to get people who are convicted of these horrible crimes to serve out their sentences and to send a message to States--many States in this country have very light sentences for many of these crimes--to send a message to States that we want tougher sentencing laws on the books for these violent crimes and violent criminals.

    Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the efforts of the Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Association of Lehigh Valley in fighting Chronic Fatigue and Immune Dysfunction Syndrome (CFIDS), or Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS). 
   Through a tireless effort, the CFS Association of Lehigh Valley is committed to finding a cure for CFIDS, increasing public awareness and providing support for victims of this disease. Public education is an integral part of the association's mission, and the Lehigh Valley organization works to raise awareness through the International CFIDS Awareness Day, which  is held on May 12 each year. In addition, the Lehigh Valley organization is actively involved in CFS-related research and regularly participates in seminars to train health care professionals. It is also important to note that the CFS Association of Lehigh Valley received the CFIDS Support Network Action Award in 1995 and 1996 for their public advocacy initiatives. 
   Although some progress has been made in the study of CFIDS, this condition is largely still a mystery. With no known cause or cure for the disease, victims experience a variety of symptoms including extreme fatigue, fever, muscle and joint pain, cognitive and neurological problems, tender lymph nodes, nausea and vertigo. The Centers for Disease Control has given CFIDS ``Priority 1'' status in the new infectious disease category which also includes cholera, malaria, hepatitis C and tuberculosis. The Lehigh Valley organization will persistently continue its research and education campaigns until this disease is obliterated. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in commending the Lehigh Valley organization and in supporting the following proclamation: 
   Proclamation 
   Whereas, on May 12, 1999 the Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) Association of Lehigh Valley joined the Chronic Fatigue and Immune Dysfunction Syndrome (CFIDS) Association of America, the largest organization dedicated to conquering CFIDS, in observing International Chronic Fatigue and Immune Dysfunction Syndrome Awareness Day; and 
   Whereas, CFIDS is a complicated disease which is characterized by neurological, rheumatological and immunological problems, incapacitating fatigue, as well as a number of other symptoms that can persist for months or years and can be severely debilitating; and 
   Whereas, estimates suggest that hundreds of thousands of American adults already have CFIDS; and 
   Whereas, the medical community, as well as the public should receive more information and develop a greater awareness of the effects of CFIDS. While much has been done at the national, state and local level, more must be done to support patients and their families; and 
   Whereas, research has been enhanced by the efforts of the Centers for Disease Control, the National Institutes of Health and other private institutions, the CFS Association of Lehigh Valley recognizes that there is still much more to be done to encourage further research so that the mission of conquering CFIDS and related disorders can be achieved; 
   Therefore, the United States Senate commends the efforts of the CFS Association of Lehigh Valley, as well as those battling the disease and applauds the designation of May 12, 1999 as CFIDS Awareness Day.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise as a member of the Banking Committee to, first, express my support for the bill. I think the chairman has done an admirable job in trying to fashion a bill that takes what was a very complicated, overly complex measure last year and simplified it and streamlined a lot of the organizational structures and dealt with things in a much more straightforward fashion. I think as a result, we have a much cleaner and much better, more understandable, from an administrative point of view, proposal than what we were dealing with last year. I commend the chairman for that. 
   Just like every other Member here, there are certain parts of the bill of which I am less supportive. In fact, some parts of the bill I am not supportive of at all and feel it is an obligation of mine to come forward and do what I can to make some of those changes. 
   One section of the bill that I do not support is section 304. Section 304 extends for 3 years the differential that savings institutions, thrifts, have to pay vis-a-vis banks on what are called FICO obligations or FICO bonds. That is the Financing Corporation bonds that were issued to resolve the Federal Savings and Loan Corporation during the savings and loan crisis a few years ago. 
   These bonds were necessary. The industry that was involved--more responsible, some will argue--the thrift industry, was assessed a higher assessment to pay those bonds. The banking  industry, which had less problems, was assessed a lower assessment, five times lower. Without this bill, in a year's time, the amount of money, the amount of assessment would equalize. Instead of the thrifts paying 6 basis points and the banks paying 1.2 basis points, both the banks and thrifts would pay 2.2 basis points. 
   I think that is fair. It should be equalized. Certainly the thrifts have paid their fair share, and then some, with respect to resolving the crisis that occurred in their industry. To continue this competitive disadvantage I think is not wise, given, in particular, the fact this bill has a lot in it for large banks, has a lot in it for the banking industry, and a lot of my small banks and thrifts have said there really is not much in it for the smaller, more community-oriented banks and for thrift institutions. 
   While we are providing more opportunities for the larger banks, under the chairman's bill, the committee bill, we keep this additional disparity between savings institutions and banks. 
   So I think it is a fair way to move forward given the state of play. 
   The problem is that I do not think it is fair enough. Striking that section--I know there are several amendments out here to strike that section and allow the equalization of the assessments to go on--I think is a good step but, frankly, it is not a step that goes far enough. And the reason I say that needs a little explanation. 
   Right now the interest that we need, the amount of money that we have to pay for the FICO bonds, the Financing Corporation bonds, that runs about $780 million a year. That is to pay the obligations on the FICA bonds. That money is paid by this assessment on thrifts and banks. 
   Thrifts and banks also historically have another assessment that paid money into a reserve account, as is prudent, so we have a reserve fund that can pay on the guaranties for deposits in banks and savings organizations. 
   That capital fund is overcapitalized. There is more money in that account than is necessary to meet the reserve requirement of 1.25 percent of deposits. And so as a result, the assessments on banks and savings institutions have been basically eliminated with very few exceptions. But they continue to be assessed to pay the FICO bonds. 
   What I have found, in looking at these accounts, is that there is far more money in the reserve accounts than is needed to meet the 1.25 percent of deposits that we need in that reserve account. In fact, that reserve account, that money that was paid to capitalize the reserve account, is invested in Government bonds--should be invested, of course--and it is invested in Government bonds. 
   The interest on that reserve account, through the investment in Government bonds, is about $2 billion a year. That is about how much interest we are bringing in and adding to the reserve account every year. And it is growing, by the way. Every year it continues to grow. We are adding about $2 billion a year in interest. So the reserve account, which is already overcapitalized, continues to grow. 
   In fact, if you look at where this account has grown--remember, we are supposed to have in this reserve account 1.25 percent of deposits. In 1996, it was 1.3 percent; in 1997, it was 1.36; in 1998, it was 1.39. That is in the SAIF fund, which is the savings account fund. In the BIF fund, which is the bank, it is 1.34; it is going up to 1.38 in 1999. We are seeing a growth in both of those funds, and that is projected to continue to grow. 
   You may ask the question, Why are we letting it continue to grow? Well, because there are no failures in banks. We are not having to insure the deposits and pay the money. But it is well in excess of the amount that we need. And it is earning $2 billion a year, thereby growing. 
   What I am saying is that we have more than we need in this account; it is growing at a rate of about $2 billion a year, and yet we are still assessing banks and savings institutions money to pay FICO bonds. Why don't we use the interest that is being spun off from the investment in the reserve account to pay the FICO bonds and that way eliminate the assessment on banks completely, which is basically a $780 million tax, when we have a fund that is growing far in excess of what we need in the reserve accounts? 
   That is what my amendment would do. It would basically say 
   that there isn't any reason to continue to assess banks and savings institutions to use that capital to pay FICO. Let the capital stay with the banks, stay with the savings institutions, be used to lend, to create more money, more capital available for more credit. 
   It is estimated that with my amendment next year alone it would make $10 billion of credit available--$10 billion of new credit available if we pass my amendment. That money, again, which has already been generated in excess of what we need, would be used to pay the FICO obligations. 
   I sort of like what is going on here with respect to the deposit insurance funds, the reserve funds, what goes on in a lot of trust funds in Government. We had almost the identical situation with the highway trust fund, and we had the courage, through the leadership of Chairman SHUSTER over in the House, to stand up and say, ``Look, we're paying all this money in gas taxes. It is going into the highway trust fund. But we are only appropriating a fraction of the money that is actually coming in.'' In other words, consumers--taxpayers--were paying much more money in taxes going into the trust fund than was ever going to be used in the trust fund. 
   What was happening to the difference? What was happening to the difference was we were just building up this highway trust fund money that we would never use. Why would we want to do that? 
   The same question here is, if we already have enough money to pay the FICO bonds with interest on the reserve accounts, why do we need to continue to assess banks? Well, there is only one reason why we continue to assess banks and savings institutions. It is because it counts as money to the Federal Government and it scores for the budget. 
   Wait a minute. What does that mean? What that means is that we can show a lower deficit because we have $780 million coming in. That money will never be spent. It will never be spent. It will just continue, in some way, to grow within the reserve account, which money will never be used because we have far in excess of what anyone has anticipated. By the way, that number continues to grow. 
   So we have in a sense here in the banking bill the identical situation as we had in the highway trust fund; which is, we are assessing somebody, ultimately the consumer, because they ultimately pay these taxes or these assessments, we are assessing them $780 million a year to go into a fund that does not need the money, that is used purely--purely--to hide the deficit so we can spend money somewhere else. So what we want to do is say, let's do here what we did with the highway trust fund. 
   The reason I am withdrawing my amendment--this is a good amendment. It is what we should do. This is truth in budgeting. We always talk about truth in budgeting and the Social Security trust fund and the highway trust fund. Here is another, in a sense, trust fund that we are putting money into that is never going to be used, simply to hide the deficit. But if we take that money out of the revenue stream, there will be some who will come down here to the floor and say, ``Aha, you're going to raise the deficit and thereby take money out of Social Security or thereby not have enough money for us to do a tax cut or thereby not have enough money to do whatever else we want to do.'' 
   The fact is, this is money that we should not 
   be assessing because there isn't the need to assess it. But it is there. It is a tax. It is a tax going into a trust fund that does not need the money. But we are going to put it in there anyway because then we can issue bonds. 
   Does this sound familiar to Social Security? We do not need the money in Social Security. We have enough money to pay, but we continue to charge people higher FICA taxes, higher Social Security taxes. We have a surplus. And what do we do with that surplus? We buy Government bonds. What does that surplus do? It hides the real deficit. 
   What are we doing here with this FICO? It is interesting--FICA-FICO. What are we doing with FICO? We are  charging banks and savings institutions more money than is needed. To do what? To buy Government bonds. To do what? To hide the deficit. To do what? So we can spend the money somewhere else. 
   The trust fund scams that go on here in Washington, when we set up these separate accounts--but we count them in the general fund. We count them in the overall budget calculations and create some very troubling policies. 
   It is a policy that we fixed when it came to gas taxes in the highway trust fund. It is a policy we are going to try to fix when it comes to Social Security. It is a policy that we should fix when it comes to banks and savings institutions, although it is very difficult to come to the floor and say, we should reduce taxes on banks and thrifts because they are paying too much in taxes. 
   It is not a very popular tax cut, if that is the way you are going to look at it. But this is not a tax cut; this is an assessment to make sure there is adequate money in reserves to pay the guarantee. These are banks putting money in there to make sure there is money available to pay insured deposits. That is what this is about. There is more money than we need in there right now, far in excess of the requirements, and yet we continue to assess it. 
   That is wrong. That is not a tax to pay for government. That is not a tax to pay for something else. It is an assessment to do a specific thing. There is more money than we need to do that specific thing. Yet we continue to assess. Why? Because it counts in the general budget, and we do not want to reduce the amount of money coming into the general budget, even though that money doesn't go to the general fund; it goes to this trust fund. The trust fund then buys bonds and then we use the money. 
   That is wrong. We should not allow that to happen. I will support the motion to strike section 304 because it is all we can accomplish, but I will continue to work, not just with this trust fund but with the other trust funds we have here in Washington that have been integrated into this budget, that hide the real cost of government. That is what we are dealing with here. We are hiding the real cost of government. We are making banks, savings institutions, pay money that there is no need for them to pay to hide the cost of government. 
   That is wrong. That is not truthful budgeting. If we want to tax banks more money, if we want to go out there and tax them, say you are not paying enough in taxes, we are going to tax you $780 million a year so we can have more money in 
   Washington, then let's be straightforward. Let's just go tax them and have a debate on that. But to continue to have them pay this assessment--don't call it a tax; it is an assessment--when there is plenty of money in there that would alleviate the need to pay that assessment is wrong. 
   I am very disappointed that this amendment is subject to a budget point of order, which means I would have to get 60 votes to allow this amendment to go in. Why is it subject to a budget point of order? Because this assessment counts as revenue to the Government and would throw the budget out of balance, if we passed my amendment. 
   Some will claim, you are going to take this money out of this, or this, or whatever. The fact is, this is not a tax; it is an assessment for a particular purpose, to capitalize a reserve fund to make sure there is money there to pay guaranteed deposits. 
   There is more money. The reserve requirement is 1.25 percent. In the current accounts, it is almost 1.4 percent. There is almost a billion dollars more in the accounts than is necessary to pay to meet the minimum reserve requirement, yet we continue to assess more and more and more. 
   Again, I can't tell you how disappointed I am that we continue this fraudulent budget practice. It is certainly my intent, while we will not be successful today with this amendment, to fight this battle and other battles for truth in budgeting where fraudulent trust funds are used to subsidize other government spending. That is not right. It is not right to this industry. It is not right to those who want available credit, because we are driving credit by having these assessments. It is certainly not right with respect to Social Security and the other trust funds that are being abused by the general government to hide deficits for this country. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Senate Banking Committee's bill, the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999, S. 900. 
   As a new member to Banking Committee, I am pleased to be part of the Committee's effort to bring this bill to the floor. First, let me commend the Chairman for his hard work and heavy-lifting in crafting a bill that will frame the way financial activities are conducted as we move into the next century. The Chairman began this effort during a very busy and trying time for this body at the beginning of the 106th Congress, and I appreciate his leadership in keeping the Committee focused on our priorities and the work at hand. 
   Considering the scope of activities covered by a financial services modernization bill, crafting a piece of legislation to update 60 year old laws while allowing flexibility for forward-thinking products is a Herculean task. At the heart of the bill is the matter of addressing structure and regulation of financial services firms. Even a casual observer has taken notice of the changing face of our domestic financial sector over the past several months. While merger-mania has dominated the news, other forces such as changing regulation, court decisions, and market innovation have outpaced current law. And although S. 900 is a work in progress, with accommodations to be made by all interested parties, I believe the time is ripe to pass legislation that allows for the affiliation among the various sectors of the financial services industry. This legislation provides a constructive framework to tackle the issue of financial services modernization while also including appropriate safeguards. 
   As with most major legislative initiatives, this bill has not been without controversy. Specifically, there has been an ongoing debate about provisions in the bill pertaining to the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). As many know, the Community Reinvestment Act was enacted by Congress in 1977 and required federally-insured banks and thrifts to make loans in their service areas, including low- and moderate- income communities, consistent with safe and sound banking practices. Compliance with CRA requirements can encompass loans made for the purposes of mortgage lending; business lending; consumer credit; and community investments. The benefit of capital investment and financing in such communities has strengthened parts of our nation that may not have otherwise known their current prosperity. To date, CRA lending has surpassed the $1 trillion mark for investment in low- and moderate-income communities while private sector lending has increased 45% from 1993 to 1997. As I have heard from many community reinvestment groups located throughout the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, there has been one very positive additional benefit that numbers can't quantify: the relationships formed between members of the banking community and those advocating on behalf of their neighborhoods and communities. These working relationships now aim to meet the mutual goal of jumpstarting the economic viability of urban and rural regions across the United States. 
   For those very reasons, I chose not to support the amendment offered during mark-up of S. 900 that would have exempted small, rural banks with less than $100 million in assets from CRA requirements. I certainly appreciate the very real concern of added regulatory and paperwork burdens that banks assume to comply with this law. In fact, reforms made in 1997 to the CRA recognized this very problem and streamlined the examination process for small banks with less than $250 million in assets. However, I could not support a wholesale exemption from this Act. 
   As the Chairman outlined from the beginning of the process of developing a financial services modernization bill, the role of the CRA will be further examined by the Committee in a separate forum. I suspect that a thorough evaluation of CRA successes and shortcomings will be addressed within the context of oversight hearings, and I look forward to participating in that process. While CRA has made significant contributions to the empowerment of marginalized communities, I  believe we still need to find the right balance to ensure prosperity for low- and moderate- income neighborhoods and the flexibility for lenders to meet community needs. 
   Mr. President, while the future of this bill has been linked to the resolution of certain issues, like the CRA, I believe the heart of the debate, financial services modernization, is larger than partisanship. The time has come to make commonsense reform of our nation's financial structure a reality in order to remain the strong competitive force in world markets that our country has so capably demonstrated.

    Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Pennsylvania's top two youth volunteers for the 1999 Prudential Spirit of Community Awards program, a nationwide program that honors young people for outstanding acts of volunteerism. Jessica Miley, a junior at McDowell High School in Erie and Dustin Good, a seventh-grade student at Pottstown Intermediate School were named State Honorees, an honor conferred on only one high school student and one middle-level student in each state, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. 
   Jessica is being honored for her extraordinary efforts to save the lives of at-risk youth. Certified by the Erie County Department of Health as a Prevention Educator to teach students in local high schools and middle schools about preventing HIV and AIDS, she designs her own programs around topics such as abstinence, sexual risks, peer pressure, self-esteem and the dangers of drugs and alcohol. Jessica spends 12 to 15 hours a week on her efforts during the school year and 40 hours a week during the summer. 
   Dustin is being recognized for his role in ``Project Reach-Out,'' a group comprised of students who want to make a difference in their community. As part of this effort, Dustin spent many hours promoting the group's activities to his student body, recruiting volunteers, attending planning meetings and working on special events. Among these events was a prom for residents of a local nursing home, as well as an ``adoption'' of a needy family in the community. Through fundraising efforts, the group provided the family with food, clothes and toys. 
   It is vital that we, as individual communities, encourage and support the kind of selfless contributions that these young people have demonstrated. People of all ages need to think more about how, as individual citizens, we can work together at the local level to ensure the health and vitality of our towns and neighborhoods. Young volunteers like Jessica and Dustin are inspiring examples to all of us and are among our brightest hopes for a better tomorrow. 
   The Prudential Spirit of Community Awards program was created in 1995 by The Prudential Insurance Company of America, in partnership with the National Association of Secondary School Principals, to impress upon all youth volunteers that their contributions are critical and to inspire other young people to follow their example. In only four years, the program has become the nation's largest youth recognition effort based solely on community service, with more than 50,000 youth participating. 
   I commend Jessica Miley and Dustin Good for the leadership they have demonstrated in seeking to make their communities better places to live. I would also like to salute the following eight young people in Pennsylvania who were named Distinguished Finalists in the program; Eric Ford, Havertown; Drew Harris, Dresher;  Tiffanie Hawkins, Newtown; Anne Heller, New Holland; Kari Knight, Sugarloaf; Tabitha Kulish, Lancaster; Jennifer Michelstein, Kingston; and Lisa Podgurski, Washington. 
   These youth have exhibited a level of commitment and accomplishment that is truly extraordinary, and they deserve our sincere admiration and respect. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in commending these fine young people who have demonstrated that young Americans can, and do, play important roles in their communities and that America's community spirit continues to hold tremendous promise for the future.

    Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution recognizing Jim Thorpe as the Athlete of the Century. 
   Born to an impoverished family on Sac-and-Fox Indian land, Jim Thorpe overcame adverse circumstances to excel as an amateur and as a professional in three sports; track and field, football and baseball. Thorpe, who was voted ``Athlete of the First Half of the Century'' by the Associated Press almost fifty years ago, is the only American athlete ever to excel at this level in three major sports. 
   As a student at Carlisle Indian School in Pennsylvania, Thorpe prooved his athletic ability early on. One anecdote recalls how the 5-foot-9 1/2 inch, 144-pound Thorpe almost single-handedly overcame the entire Lafayette track team at a meeting in Easton, Pennsylvania, winning six events. Also while attending the Carlisle Indian School, Jim Thorpe established his amateur football record playing halfback, defender, punter, and place-kicker. In 1911, he was named an All American. 
   In 1912, he represented the United States and the Sac-and-Fox Nation in the Olympic Games in Stockholm, Sweden. To this day, Thorpe is the only athlete to win gold medals in the pentathlon and decathlon. After his Olympic feats in Sweden, Thorpe retured to Carlisle's football team and was named an All-American again. 
   In 1913, Thorpe left amateur athletics and signed a $5,000 contract to play baseball with the New York Giants. As an outfielder with the Giants, and later with the Cincinnati Reds and Boston Braves, his best season was his last one, when he batted .327 in 60 games for Boston. 
   In 1915, Thorpe agreed to play professional football for the Canton Bulldogs. Thorpe went on to become a key part of this team as it was recognized as the ``world champion'' in 1916, 1917, and 1919. Thorpe's professional football career later included stints with Cleveland, Rock Island, the New York Giants, and the Chicago Cardinals. In 1920, Thorpe became the first president of the American Football Association, which was later to become the National Football League. Today, he is recognized as a founding father of professional football. 
   Recently, I had the privilege of attending a luncheon honoring Jim Thorpe's daughter, Grace, at the Jim Thorpe Memorial Hall in the Carbon County, Pennsylvania, a town named for the great athlete. Grace Thorpe has traveled around the country asking people to sign petitions declaring her father athlete of the century. She plans to send the petition to cable sports networks and national sportswriters. As Jim Thorpe Area Sports Hall of Fame president, Jack Kmetz has noted, Thorpe unfortunately missed out on the modern-day media blitz that surrounds popular athletes today. Nonetheless, I promised Ms. Thorpe and the people of Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania that I would introduce this resolution which I hope will raise awareness of this true legend's achievements and give him the recongnition he deserves.

    Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate one of the many employers in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania which, through innovation and dynamic business planning, has recently received prestigious recognition. The W. Frank Barton School of Business at Wichita State University and the University of Nebraska at Omaha Aviation Institute have ranked US Airways number one in their annual ``Airline Quality Rating'' study. 
   I congratulate the over 16,000 Pennsylvanians who work at US Airways on  their dedication and hard work. I also make special note of President and Chief Executive Officer Rakesh Gangwal, whose ongoing commitment to excellence has had a major impact on this airline, to the great benefit of our Commonwealth. 
   In my eight years of service in the U.S. House and Senate, I have watched as US Airways (formerly USAir) has struggled through some very difficult times. For this airline to be recognized as number one in quality only a few years after its financial struggles is a true testament to the energy and skill of its workforce and executives. An indication of this is Mr. Gangwal's first comment after learning of the quality rating, ``While we are very proud of our No. 1 ranking and its reflection of accomplishment, there is more to be done in meeting the needs of the traveling public and we are focused on achieving this goal.'' 
   Again, I offer my congratulations to US Airways and its many employees. I look forward to continued work with its executives, management teams, and labor unions.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act. This bill is identical to the legislation endorsed by the American Medical Association (AMA) and vetoed by President Clinton in October, 1997. This bill is narrowly written to prohibit one particularly gruesome, inhumane, and medically unaccepted late term abortion method, except when the procedure is necessary to save the life of the mother. 
   Also known as Intact Dilation Evacuation or Intrauterine Cranial Decompression, a partial birth abortion is performed over a three day period during the second or third trimester. After the cervix is dilated over a two-day period, the doctor begins the actual abortion on the third day. Once the doctor turns the baby into the breech position, he delivers all but the head through the birth canal. At this point the child is still alive. Then, the doctor stabs the baby in the base of its skull with curved scissors and uses a suction catheter to remove the child's brain. This procedure kills the baby. After the skull collapses, the doctor completes the delivery. 
   Partial birth abortions are performed as outpatient procedures in clinics. They are usually done on healthy 20-25 week olds with healthy mothers. Estimates suggest as many as 5000 are performed annually in the U.S. We know of 1500 per year in one New Jersey clinic. 
   The American public finds this procedure repugnant. A growing consensus in the medical community considers it unnecessary and even unethical. Yet the reason this horrific procedure is still legal in the United States is because President Clinton has twice vetoed legislation that would have outlawed partial birth abortion, except in cases of maternal life endangerment. 
   The lies propagated by proponents of partial birth abortion have taken on a life of their own. First, we were told--and by we I mean Congress--there was no such thing as partial birth abortion. Three years after Dr. Martin Haskell, a pioneer of this technique, described it to the National Abortion Federation (NAF), the NAF sent a letter to Congress denying its existence. Then Congress was assured the fetus feels no pain during the procedure because anesthesia given to the mother induced ``neurological fetal demise.'' Such was the testimony of Dr. James McMahon, another pioneer of the partial birth abortion, to the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution. After pregnant women across the country started refusing necessary surgery, Dr. Norig Ellison, President of the American Society of Anesthesiologists, testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee to set the record straight. He told the Committee women would have to be anesthetized to the point where their own health was endangered to achieve ``neurological demise'' of the fetus. By the way, ``neurological demise'' refers to the ``brain death,'' not literal death. Not to be deterred, proponents of partial birth abortion circulated a third lie--anesthesia kills the fetus. Yet we know from Dr. Ellison's testimony and Dr. Haskell's own statements that the baby is alive during the procedure. Lie number four asserted partial birth abortions were ``rare.'' Then, a small newspaper in New Jersey discovered that 1500 of these ``rare'' procedures were performed each year in one clinic. This one clinic was performing three times the supposed national rate of partial birth abortions. Ron Fitzsimmons, executive director of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers, suggested as many as 5000 could be performed annually. Another egregious lie asserted this technique was only used in cases where the mother's life or health were at risk, or when the fetus was deformed. Ron Fitzsimmons helped spread this misinformation. He would later admit that he ``lied through my teeth.'' 
   The last lie, which the President continues citing in defense of this procedure, proports that partial birth abortion is necessary to protect women's health. A group of more than 600 doctors, most of whom are OB-GYNs or perinatologists, call this lie the ``most serious distortion.'' In reality, partial birth is never medically necessary. That is the opinion of doctors across this country. The AMA says it is ``not medically indicated,'' ``is not good medicine,'' is ``ethically wrong'' and ``is not an accepted `medical practice' ''. Former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, who has 30 years of experience in pediatric surgery, has publicly denounced this procedure. Dr. Warren Hern, who wrote the most widely used textbook on performing abortions admitted he ``*.*.* would dispute any statement that this is the safest procedure to use.'' The Physicians Ad Hoc Coalition for Truth (PHACT), a group of over 600 doctors, emphatically states that partial birth abortion is never medically necessary and ``should be banned in the interests of women, their children, and the proper practice of medicine.'' 
   There is absolutely no evidence that partial birth abortion is a safe procedure. There are no peer reviewed scientific studies. It is not mentioned in medical textbooks or taught in medical schools. The facts, as reviewed by doctors, suggest this technique is in fact dangerous for women. Because of the deliberate breech positioning and the blind procedure of stabbing the baby at the base of its skull, partial birth abortion subjects women to risks beyond those normally encountered in conventional late term abortions. Furthermore, it could not be used in the two most common life endangering conditions during pregnancy, infection and hemorrhage, because it puts women at greater risk for both.  
   Conditions such as hydrocephaly, trisomy, Downs Syndrome, and development of the organs or brain outside the body have been cited as instances in which partial birth abortion was recommended to preserve a woman's life, health, or future fertility. There are tragic situations that require separation of the child from the mother. But it is never necessary to kill the child during that separation to preserve maternal health. 
   I have met families who were advised to have a partial birth abortion after their child was diagnosed with a disability. These mothers faced many of the same struggles, such as concerns for their other children, concerns about whether they would be able to care for a handicapped baby, and finding a doctor who was willing to deliver the child. As the Senate considers the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act, I will tell the stories of these families and the children. 
   In closing, I ask my colleagues to examine this issue with their hearts. We know of two baby girls, one born in Phoenix and the other in Ohio, who survived this brutal procedure. Baby Phoenix overcame cuts and a skull fracture sustained during a partial birth abortion procedure. Today, she lives with her adopted parents in Texas. Baby Hope lived only three hours and eight minutes. She was born prematurely during the first dilation stage of a partial birth abortion. Her life was short, but she personalized this issue for the hospital staff who gently nursed her for those few hours. I ask that my colleagues consider whether these little girls deserved to be subjected to partial birth abortions. I ask them to consider that these children were not catch phrases, slogans, or concepts. These babies, and other candidates for partial birth abortions, are human beings. They are being killed with a procedure that would not be legal for use on animals. I ask my colleagues to do the right thing and vote to outlaw this horrific procedure. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1999 be inserted into the RECORD.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that would establish the Lackawanna Valley American Heritage Area. This legislation recognizes the significance of Pennsylvania's Lackawanna Valley, the site of the first state heritage park in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. 
   Nearly nine years ago, people in the Lackawanna Valley pursued their vision to recognize the cultural, historical, natural, and recreational values that existed within the region. As such, partnerships were formed among federal, state, and local governments, in addition to local business interests, to move this idea forward. As those partnerships evolved, that cooperation produced ``The Plan for the Lackawanna Heritage Valley.'' 
   With the credo of ``community development through partnerships,'' the LHVA began developing a wide agenda of community projects that would come to define the term ``heritage park.'' Specifically, the LHVA was instrumental in creating the National Institute of Environmental Renewal, a ``living laboratory'' founded with the intention of identification and clean-up of the Lackawanna Valley's scarred industrial landscape. Through an adaptive re-use of a former school building, there now exists a 100,000 square foot Education and Training, Research and Development, and Technology Transfer Center. 
   Other projects taken on by the Authority include: construction of the Lackawanna Trolley Museum; designation of the Lackawanna River Heritage Trail; development of the Olyphant Elementary School housing project; and the ``Young People's Heritage Festival.'' One of the most significant undertakings by LHVA partners has been a research document commissioned by the National park Service and the PA Historical and Museum Commission. The study, ``Anthracite Coal in Pennsylvania: an Industry and a Region,'' concludes that, ``the anthracite industry of northeastern Pennsylvania played a critical role in the expansion of the American economy during the second quarter of the nineteenth century.'' 
   The legislation that I am introducing today, with the support of Senator SPECTER, encourages the continuation of local interest by demonstrating the federal government's commitment to preserving the unique heritage of the Lackawanna Valley. It would require the Lackawanna Heritage Valley Authority to enter a compact with the Secretary of the Interior to establish Heritage Area boundaries, and to prepare and implement a management plan within three years. This plan would inventory resources and recommend policies for resource management interpretation. Further, based on the criteria of other Heritage Areas established by the Omnibus Parks and Public Lands Management Act of 1996, this bill requires that federal funds provided under this bill do not exceed 50 percent of the total cost of the program. 
   Mr. President, this legislation is a culmination of the hard work and diligence of many parties interested in preserving the cultural and natural resources of the Lackawanna Valley. I believe this bill represents the positive impact public and private institutions can have when given the opportunity for collaboration.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce four pieces of legislation I introduced in the 105th Congress. Building on the support I've received for these bills, I look forward to passage this Congress of much needed liability protection for those who donate goods and services to charities. 
   Over the past thirty years, courts have consistently expanded what constitutes tortious conduct. Regrettably, fault is often not a factor when deciding who should compensate an individual for damages incurred. This has had an impact on charitable giving. Today, individuals and businesses are wary of giving goods, services, and time to charities for fear of frivolous lawsuits. 
   This legislation is designed to free up resources for charities by providing legal protections for donors. Generally, these bills raise the tort liability standard for donors, whereby they are liable only in cases of gross negligence, hence eliminating strict liability and returning to a fault based legal standard. By allowing businesses to once again become good Samaritans, I look forward to seeing a massive increase in the donation of goods and services to charities. 
   Specifically, I have introduced four bills, each of which accomplishes one of the following four objectives: first, to limit the civil liability of business entities that donate equipment to nonprofit organizations; second, to limit the civil liability of business entities that provide use of their facilities to nonprofit organizations; third, to limit the civil liability of business entities that provide facility tours; and fourth, to limit the civil liability of business entities that make available to nonprofit organizations the use of motor vehicles or aircraft. 
   Clearly, where an organization is grossly negligent when providing goods or the use of its facilities to charity, that organization should be fully liable for inquiries caused. These bills merely require this to be the standard in cases arising from certain donations to charities. 
   In late 1996, the Good Samaritan Food Donation Act was passed into law. This law now protects donors of foodstuffs to charities from liability except in cases where the donor was grossly negligent in making the donation. I was proud to join Senator BOND in passing this Act. The bills I introduce today draw from my successful work with Senator BOND years ago. Each of these bills is modeled on the legal framework of the Good Samaritan Food Donation Act. I hope my distinguished colleagues who supported the Food Donation Act will help further these efforts by supporting the Charity Empowerment Project.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation pertaining to the federal excise tax on beer. 
   Many people are not aware that they pay enormous hidden taxes when they purchase any number of consumer products. The beer tax is one significant example of such a hidden tax. Bearing a disproportionate tax burden, forty-three percent of the cost of beer is comprised of both state and federal taxes. 
   The federal government doubled its tax on beer eight years ago. Today, though it is one of the more regressive taxes, the 100 percent beer tax increase remains as the only ``luxury tax'' enacted as part of the 1991 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act. While taxes on furs, jewelry, and yachts have been repealed through subsequent legislation, the federal beer tax remains in place with continued far reaching effects, including the loss of as many as 50,000 industry jobs. My legislation seeks to correct this inequity and will restore the level of federal excise tax to the pre-1991 tax rate. 
   Mr. President, I offer this bill as companion legislation to H.R. 1366 introduced by Representative PHIL ENGLISH.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that would bring common sense reform to the federal peanut commodity program. This legislation would phase out the peanut quota program over three years, with the quota being eliminated in crop year 2002. I am joined today by several colleagues in this reform effort. 
   Under this legislation, the price support for peanuts that are grown for edible consumption is gradually reduced each year from the current support price of $610 per ton to $500 per ton by 2001. In the year 2002 and ensuing crop years, there would be no quotas on peanuts, and the Secretary of Agriculture would be required to make the non-recourse loan available to all peanut farmers at 85 percent of their estimated market value. This measure is consistent with the non-recourse loan programs available for other agriculture commodities. 
   Another component of this peanut reform bill would allow additional peanuts, those produced in excess of the farmer's quota poundage, to be used for sale to the school lunch program. 
   Mr. President, the federal peanut program, born in the 1930's during an era of massive change and dislocation in agriculture, is sorely out of place in today's agricultural sector. Other farm commodities are seeking new export opportunities abroad, building new markets and helping to improve our national balance of trade, however, the peanut industry is building new barriers to protect itself. The quota system stifles freedom for farmers, and it fosters a set of economic expectations that cannot be sustained without continued government intervention. Moreover, failure to reform this program costs consumers between $300-500 million annually, adding to the cost of feeding programs for low-income Americans. 
   In short, this program must be changed. As we have learned from changes made to other commodity programs, reform does not happen overnight. This proposal provides for a fair transition that will enable farmers and lenders to adjust their expectations to the marketplace. Following completion of the phase-out period, the peanut program will operate like most other agricultural commodities. 
   Mr. President, I am pleased to have many of my Senate colleagues join me today as cosponsors of this measure, including Senators CHAFEE, DEWINE, FEINGOLD, GREGG, BROWNBACK, SPECTER, and COLLINS.

    Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Jim Thorpe as he is being considered in the selection of Athlete of the Century. Pennsylvania has a historic affiliation to this great man, of whom a borough in Carbon County Pennsylvania is named for. 
   Jim Thorpe is the only American athlete to ever excel, as an amateur and as a professional, in three major sports; track and field, football and baseball. 
   As an amateur in track and field, Thorpe won the pentathlon and the decathlon at the Amateur Athletic Union's (AAU) National Championship Trials in Boston, prior to the 1912 Olympics. He went on to represent Sac, Fox Nation and the United States in the 1912 Olympic Games in Stockholm, Sweden, and became the first U.S. athlete to win the decathlon and the only athlete in the world to win both the decathlon and the pentathlon during one Olympic year. These athletic feats and the subsequent worldwide publicity helped to establish the viability of the Olympics. 
   Thorpe's major league baseball career consisted of playing with the New York Giants, the Cincinnati Reds and the Boston Braves, in which he ended the 1919 season with a .327 average. 
   His amateur football record was established while he was a student at the Carlisle Indian School in Pennsylvania and was chosen to Walter Camp's First Team All American Half-Back in 1911 and 1912. A founding father of professional football, Thorpe became the first elected president of the American Professional Football Association, now known as the National Football League. He was voted America's Greatest All-Around Male Athlete and chosen as the greatest football player of the half-century in 1950 by an Associated Press Poll of sports writers. He was also named the Greatest American Football Player in History in a 1977 national poll conducted by Sport Magazine. 
   Because of his outstanding sports achievements, Thorpe was inducted into the National Indian Hall of Fame, the Helms Professional Football Hall of Fame, the Professional Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio, the National Track and Field Hall of Fame, and the Pennsylvania and Oklahoma Halls of Fame. 
   Mr. President, Jim Thorpe's immeasurable sports achievements have long been an inspiration to America's youth, as well as to the youth of Pennsylvania. I ask my colleagues to join with me in paying tribute to Jim Thorpe for his renowned accomplishments, as he is considered for Athlete of the Century in 2000.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   First, I ask that Senator TORRICELLI be added as cosponsor to the resolution. 
   Mr. President, this is an amendment that is a sense of the Senate to extend reauthorization for the Farm Preservation Program. Senator BOXER and I were able to put in an amendment for $35 billion for farmland preservation in the Freedom to Farm bill 3 years ago. That authorization of $35 billion was supposed to last 5 years. It lasted 3. There is no more money for this program, and there is a tremendous need. The backlog of applications is immense. Nineteen States have participated in this. We have saved over 123,000 acres of farmland. 
   We have so much debate about urban sprawl. This is an amendment to do something in a responsible way by preserving farmland and preserving agriculture communities that are under stress from urban sprawl and development. 
   I hope we will have a resounding favorable vote.

    Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to address the suffering of victims of repeat offenders. 
   My legislation, ``Aimee's Law,'' is named after Aimee Willard, a college senior from suburban Philadelphia who was raped and murdered by a man released from prison in another state after serving time for a similar offense. This tragedy has made me aware of some very disturbing facts about sentencing and recidivism. For instance, more than 14,000 murders, rapes and sexual assaults on children are committed each year by felons who have been released after serving a sentence for one of those very same crimes. Moreover, convicted murderers, rapists and child molesters who are released from prisons and cross state lines are responsible for sexual assaults on more than 1,200 people annually, including 935 children. Furthermore, recidivism rates for sexual predators are the highest of any category of violent crime. Despite this, the average time served for rape is only five and one half years and the average time served for sexual assault is under four years. Also troubling is the fact that thirteen percent of convicted rapists receive no jail time at all. 
   With this in mind, I propose to use federal crime fighting funds to create an incentive for states to adopt stricter sentencing and truth-in-sentencing laws. Specifically, Aimee's Law will redirect enough federal crime fighting dollars from a state that has released a murderer, rapist, or child molester to pay the prosecutorial and incarceration costs incurred by a state which has had to reconvict this released felon for a similar crime. Indeed, laws regarding the horrific crimes of murder, rape and sexual assault are best enacted at the state level. However, the federal government bears a responsibility to ensure that federal taxpayer dollars are spent in such a manner as to reflect national views on national issues. This legislation uses federal monies to create incentives without intruding into a state's right and need to legislate on the problem of repeat offenders. 
   Representative MATT SALMON introduced this legislation last Congress and earlier this Congress. Representative SALMON's bipartisan bill currently has 66 cosponsors, including Majority Whip TOM DELAY and Democratic Caucus Chair MARTIN FROST. Moreover, it has been endorsed by Ms. Gail Willard, Aimee's mother, and numerous organizations such as the National Fraternal Order of Police, the National Rifle Association, the KlassKids Foundation, Justice For All, the National Association of Crime Victims' Rights, the Women's Coalition, and Kids Safe. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and help protect our communities from repeat offenders.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that would reauthorize the Farmland Protection Program that was originally authorized with passage of the 1996 Farm Bill. 
   Every year more than one million acres of our nation's most productive farmland is lost to urbanization. This is land that produces three-quarters of America's fruits and vegetables, and more than half of our dairy products. While state and local governments have taken the lead in preservation efforts, the demand for assistance continues to grow. 
   Considering the importance of agriculture to our nation, and to generations of families throughout our country, I was proud to take a lead role in the United States Senate to assist farmers and communities in confronting the obstacle of growing pressure on the use of farmland. As such, I, with the support of many Senate colleagues, established the Federal Farmland Protection Program to stem the loss of valuable farmland, and to provide states with adequate tools to accomplish that goal. Those efforts resulted in a $35 million authorization in the 1996 Farm Bill. 
   This money has been used to help states leverage dollars in order to purchase development rights, and keep productive farmland in use--all through voluntary efforts. In just three short years, the funds were exhausted due to the overwhelming response by farmers and state governments. In fact, by the end of fiscal year 1997 the original $35 million authorization had been spent, and the demand outstripped funding availability by 900 percent. 
   The legislation that I'm introducing today, the Farmland Protection Act of 1999, would provide a $50 million per year authorization for the much-needed funds to carry out the important work of farmland preservation. In addition, my bill would allow non-profit organizations to participate in the program--where there is no established government program--as they are currently precluded from doing so in certain states. 
   Mr. President, I am proud to introduce this legislation that will enable us to take another giant step forward in protecting a valuable resource to many Americans. To date, nineteen states have capitalized on this opportunity to augment their preservation efforts, and hopefully, the Farmland Protection Act of 1999 will give more states the tools to assist their local farming community.

    Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Michael A. Napp from Milton, Pennsylvania for achieving the honored rank of Eagle Scout. Scouting is recognized around the world as one of the premiere citizenship and leadership training activities. I am proud of the young people in Pennsylvania, like Michael, who go the extra mile to achieve this honorable rank. 
   Eagle Scouts learn valuable lessons in leadership, honor and pride in their communities. Since joining the scouts as a Tiger, Michael has served in several leadership positions including Senior Patrol Leader and Historian. In addition to his involvement in scouting, Michael has assisted in a cleanup day in the borough of Milton and participated in an Adopt-A-Highway program. He is also active in high school track and field and a member of the Junior National Honor Society, the National Spanish Honor Society and the Key Club. 
   Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join with me in commending Michael Napp for his outstanding community involvement. He has provided an excellent example for youth in Pennsylvania, and throughout the country.

   Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to return the compliment to my colleague from Colorado, Senator ALLARD, who has been magnificent in introducing legislation, working with Senator ENZI from Wyoming, and coauthoring a letter with myself and sending a correspondence a couple of weeks ago complaining about this regulation. 
   He mentioned a couple of the concerns. Actually, an interesting concern was brought up yesterday. If you are not aware or are you aware, Mr. Hawke, who is the head of the OCC, testified before the House Committee on the Judiciary, Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law, yesterday and raised a concern. These are his regulations, but he raised some concerns, from all the feedback he had received, that he believed that these regulations were inadvertently undermining confidence in the banking system, because it violated the trust and the right of 
   privacy between the banker and the customer. There are serious consequences to this. It is not just moving it from your bank to your savings and loan, but literally, it undermines the customer-banker relationship and that privacy relationship that is expected.  
   I will quote Mr. Hawke:  
   Law-abiding citizens ..... will understandably be apprehensive that their banks will report any transactions that may be the least out of the ordinary .....'' 
   A widespread loss of confidence in the privacy of bank accounts could lead to widespread withdrawals and ``do lasting damage to our banking system. .....''  
   That is from the regulator who has proposed these. I think he has now understood. Over 140,000 people have written, with, to my understanding, 33 in favor, and the other 139,900-plus were against it. I can tell you, in my office we have received 200 to 300 letters, all against, and almost all from individuals. The few thrifts and banks that have written us did not write us to complain about the regulatory burden, but wrote us to reflect all the complaints they are getting from their customers about the invasion of privacy here. This has some serious constitutional issues, and, I think, very serious ramifications for the banking industry. I would like your comment on that.

   My understanding is the other side objected to bringing that bill up. So you have had to offer an amendment to the Ed-Flex bill to try to get the Senate on record in opposition, because there will be some decision--the end of the comment period will be, I think, on Monday; is that correct?

    Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, the month of February has been designated as African-American History Month, however, African-American history is American history. The contributions of African-Americans to America encompass almost every area of American life. African-Americans are recorded in America as early as 1619, one year before the Mayflower landed at Plymouth Rock. The oldest established African-American family are descendants of William Tucker, born in Jamestown, Virginia in 1624. 
   Unfortunately for many of our youth, African-American role models are limited to those known for their achievements in the world of sports and entertainment. Although their accomplishments in this field are substantial and important, few of our youth know, for instance, about the many African-Americans who, throughout history, displayed tremendous courage and honor in times of war. Cripus Attuk, an African-American, was killed in the Boston Massacre in 1770, becoming the first casualty of the American Revolution. Most of the 5,000 blacks that fought in the Revolutionary War were slaves that fought in place of their owners. After the war had been won, they were immediately put back to work on their plantations, still slaves. More than 200,000 African-Americans served in the Civil War. After the Civil War, many of these trained soldiers were sent west and were reorganized as the 9th & 10th Cavalries, where they were called the ``Buffalo Soldier'' by the Indians they were fighting. The Tuskeegee Airmen of World War II, an air squadron, had the most impressive war record in their theater of action, never losing a bomber they were assigned to escort. Against almost insurmountable odds and racial discrimination, African-Americans have faithfully served America. 
   Significant in another aspect of America's history are the African-Americans whose endeavors helped fuel  the industrial revolution, contributing to the economic prosperity and standard of life all Americans enjoy today. George Washington Carver discovered over 500 products with the peanut, the sweet potato, and corn. Many important inventions were made by African-Americans with thousands of patents made that have benefitted not only America, but the world. Jan Matzeliger invented the first shoe making machine. Elijah McCoy had forty-two patents, most for lubricating different types of steam engines and machines, as well as the first graphite lubricating device. Garrett A. Morgan invented the three-way traffic light which he sold to General Electric. Frederick McKinley Jones invented a workable way to refrigerate trucks and railroad cars, as well as manufactured movie sound equipment. George R. Curruthers invented image converters for detecting electromagnetic radiation. He was also one of the two people responsible for the development of the lunar service ultraviolet camera/specter graph. Dr. Charles R. Drew is credited with the discovery of blood plasma which supplants blood in transfusions, as was the first person to set up and establish blood banks. Dr. Daniel Hale Williams is the first doctor to successfully perform open heart surgery. 
   Some of the people mentioned played an important role in America's past wars. Many African-Americans I encounter today, however, are the unsung heroes of a different kind of war. They battle for the hearts and minds of our inner city youth. For example in Philadelphia, The Reverend Herb Lusk, and ``People for People,'' are providing welfare to work training, after school tutoring for grade school children, as well as GED and computer training for the poor and disadvantaged. The Reverend Dr. Ben Smith's Deliverance Church, which owns and operates a shopping mall and sixty-five outreach ministries, has long served the greater community. C. Delores Tucker currently organizes the largest Martin Luther King Center for Non-violence in the nation. One of the many things she does for the community is to arrange for many to gather and celebrate our great Civil Rights leader on his birthday at an annual luncheon. 
   It is fitting that all Americans salute the invaluable services and contributions of African-Americans and the role that they have played and continue to play in American History.

    Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the Women's Resource Center of Lackawanna and Susquehanna Counties in Pennsylvania for providing more than 20 years of shelter and counseling to adults and children who have been victims of violence at the hands of family members, partners or someone else they know. 
   The Center will display a memorial exhibit, ``An Empty Place at the Table,'' in the Rotunda of the Senate Russell Building on February 24 and 25 to ensure that the brutal deaths of women and children are not forgotten. 
   In the United States a woman is beaten by her partner or former partner every 12 seconds, and, according to the FBI, 26 percent of all female murder victims are killed by their husbands or boyfriends. 
   The Women's Resource Center, established in 1977, has demonstrated a commitment to their community by providing more than 18,000 hours of crisis services. These services include a 24 hour hotline, an emergency shelter, crisis counseling and advocacy to more than 2,000 adults and children each year, as well as numerous hours of educational programming with the legal system, schools, businesses, professionals and faith communities on the dynamics of abuse and assault. The Center provides their services under the strictest confidentiality and free of charge and discrimination. 
   Mr. President, the Center's memorial exhibit reveals how violence undeniably leaves an empty place at the table. I ask my colleagues to join with me in commending the Women's Resource Center for its leadership and commitment to restoring the fundamental right to live free from fear in our own homes.

    Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, on January 29, the World War II Historical Preservation Federation will dedicate a monument to Veterans of the Battle of the Bulge. This monument will honor 600,000 Americans who, in World War II, fought three German armies in the Ardennes Forest of Belgium and Luxembourg and won the largest land battle ever fought by the U.S. Army. 
   Veterans of the Battle of the Bulge is an educational veterans organization made up of veterans who fought in the battle as well as their families and history buffs. The organization was founded to perpetuate the memory of the sacrifices involved during the battle, to preserve historical data and sites relating to the battle, to foster international peace and good will and to promote friendship among the battle's survivors and descendants. 
   Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join with me in saluting the veterans who fought through the fog, snow, rain and ice in the bitter cold winter of 1944-1945, in what Sir Winston Churchill deemed an ``ever-famous American victory.''
