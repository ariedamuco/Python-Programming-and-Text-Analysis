   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, many on the Senate Armed Services Committee have been quite distressed over some of the uncertainties, some of the things that happened in conjunction with the tragedy of the U.S.S. Cole. Even though it is a delicate thing to talk about, there are people still around who believe that the President took some actions, such as sending the cruise missiles into Afghanistan and the cruise missiles into Sudan, without consultation with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, without consultation with the Intelligence Committee, the Senate Armed Services Committee, the House Armed Services Committee, something that was done and nobody knew it was going to happen. There are a lot of people who believe that might have been politically motivated. 
   I think it is very appropriate tonight to urge the President that if something should happen that we would have to take some kind of action in the next few days, in that there are only 13 days until a national election, make sure there are no suspicions out there. I want to get on record urging the President to work closely on any proposed action that could take place as a result of the U.S.S. Cole tragedy, to work closely on the matter, in full consultation with all members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, with the top service commanders in chief, as well as the members of both the Senate Armed Services Committee, the House Armed Services Committee, and the Intelligence Committees. By doing this, we could preclude any types of suspicions, allowing us to participate in what would have to be a major decision.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Missouri has addressed similar questions before the conference on this legislation was convened, but now that we have the actual text of the statement of managers before us, I would like to clarify a section in the statement of managers. The language directs EPA to take no action to initiate or order the use of certain technologies such as dredging or capping until specific steps have been taken with respect to the National Academy of Science report on sediment remediation technologies, with limited exceptions. It is my understanding that in directing that the report's findings be properly considered by the Agency, the conferees are not directing any change in remediation standards. However, the conferees are directing EPA to consider the findings and recommendations of the forthcoming report, in addition to the existing guidance provided by the Agency's Contaminated Sediments Management Strategy, when making remedy selection decisions at contaminated sediment sites, and as the Agency develops guidance on remediating contaminated sediments.

   Mr. INHOFE. It is also my understanding that in providing for an exception for urgent cases, we anticipate that the EPA will use the four part test set forth in previous committee reports, namely that (1) EPA has found on the record that the contaminated sediment poses a significant threat to the public health to which an urgent or time critical response is necessary, (2) remedial and/or removal alternatives to dredging have been fully evaluated, (3) an appropriate site for disposal of the contaminated material has been selected, and (4) the potential impacts of dredging, associated disposal, and alternatives have been explained to the affected community.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, in fiscal year, FY, 2000, some 54 federal departments and agencies and over 130,000 federal employees spent over $18.7 billion writing and enforcing federal regulations. 
   The number of full-time positions in regulatory agencies reached an all-  time high during the Clinton/Gore Administration. The era of big government is not over. In fact, it is in its hey day. In FY 2000, bureaucratic staffing set a new record, exceeding the previous all-time high of 130,039 in FY 1995. 
   Rochester Institute of Technology's Professor Thomas Hopkins estimates that the total cost of federal regulation will be $721 billion in 2000, which is equal to about 40 percent of all federal spending--representing a hidden tax of more than $6,800 per year for each American family. This represents direct compliance costs, not indirect costs such as the cost of lost productivity, increased cost of goods and services, as we are seeing with gas prices right now, and lower wages--among others. 
   These figures are very important for us in Washington to keep in mind--when we are developing laws and regulations. When considering the entire federal budget, $6,800 per year may seem like peanuts, but $6,800 is a great deal of money to millions of hard working Americans. 
   To put Professor Hopkins' estimates in perspective, current regulatory costs are about 40 percent of the size of the federal budget--which stands at an estimated $1.9 trillion in FY2000--and represent about 8 percent of America's gross domestic product. Moreover, Hopkins' estimates of annual U.S. regulatory costs exceed the entire 1998 GDP of such countries as Canada, $604 billion; Spain, $553 billion; Australia, $364 billion; and Russia, $275 billion. 
   Beyond the cost of regulations and the size of the federal bureaucracy, a very troublesome trend is occurring in the regulatory arena right now. In its last few days in office, the Clinton/Gore Administration is currently pushing through a number of new rules--particularly in the environmental arena. This last-minute regulatory push, also known as ``midnight-regulation,'' serves two purposes for the Clinton/Gore administration: (1) to pander to the special interest groups and (2) to make regulatory decisions more difficult for the next administration. 
   This administration is playing a zero sum loss game with the regulatory process. While special interests and bureaucrats are winning, the American people are losing. When well thought out and reflecting consensus, regulations can certainly provide benefits to the American people. However, what is most disturbing is the fact that this administration will promulgate these regulations at any cost--at the financial cost of the American people--at the cost of making a mockery of rulemaking due process--even at the cost of environmental protection. This isn't just my opinion, other experts agree. Wendy Gramm, former Administrator of OMB's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, and Susan Dudley--both of whom are with George Mason University's Mercatus Center-- recently wrote in an article in The Atlanta Journal, ``when regulations are rushed into effect without adequate thought, they are likely to do more harm than good.'' 
   Eighty-eight rulemakings are in the process at the EPA. 
   On August 25, 2000, a Washington Post article's byline read, ``[m]indful that Republicans could occupy the White House in less than six months, the Clinton administration is working feverishly to issue a host of new regulations supported by environmentalists and other liberal leaning groups .....'' The article goes on to state that, ``[a]t the EPA alone, officials have listed 67 regulatory decisions looming before Clinton's second term expires in January.'' 
   In response to the Washington Post article, the National Manufacturers' Association requested this list of 67 pending ``regulatory decisions.'' However, NMA's request was denied. Thanks to the leadership of Representative DAVID MCINTOSH, the Clinton/Gore Administration submitted the 
   list of regulations. Representative MCINTOSH discovered that it was not 67 regulatory decisions--but rather 88! This does not include the numerous interim final regulations, policy statements, and guidance documents, which EPA is pushing through. 
   In fact, the average pages of regulations in the Federal Register is currently sky-rocketing. Currently, the Clinton/Gore Administration is averaging 210 pages of regulations per day in the Federal Register. The last time that the American people experienced such a flood of regulations was at the end of the Carter Administration--when the Federal Register had an average of 200 pages of regulations per day. Mr. President, there is a graph of the average number of regulations in the Federal Register during election years since the Ford Administration. 
   Here are some examples: 
   The Clinton/Gore administration's ``Total Maximum Daily Load'' or ``TMDL'' Rule. 
   The now final TMDL rule drew more than 30,000 public comments and has been the subject of 12 congressional hearings. An overwhelming majority of these citizens, including environmental, community, state, labor union, and business organizations, expressed their opposition to the rule. Their concerns have included such issues as the rule's effectiveness, costs, technical and scientific feasibility, and basic structure. 
   On June 30, 2000, in response to the testimony and thousands of letters that I and other Members of Congress received in opposition to EPA's proposed TMDL rule, Congress included a provision in the FY 2001 Military Construction Appropriations Act that would prohibit EPA from implementing this rule. This provision was a bipartisan attempt to direct the EPA to take a step back and address the concerns of the American people--not a sneak attack on the environment as many extremist environmental groups tried to portray it.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I join in the remarks that were made by the Senator from Kansas about the U.S.S. Cole, the tragedy that took place. We are all so saddened to hear about that. It was a complete surprise to all of us. Also, his comments about our chairman--our chairman, the Senator from Virginia, has done just an incredible job of leading the way and getting this bill done. 
   I see this bill we are about to vote on as turning the corner. After 7 years of neglecting our military, we are actually starting to improve some things. We have some things in this bill that I think are long overdue. In our readiness funding, the conferees add more than $888 million to the primary readiness accounts. That included areas of neglect: $125 million to the war reserves and training munitions. We have places where they actually do not have enough bullets, enough ammunition to train with; $222 million for spare parts--that is not nearly enough, but there is a trend going up in the right direction now. 
   I go around as chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee to quite a few of the places around the country and around the world and find the cannibalization rates, getting spare parts out of engines. I have seen them open up a new, crated F-100 engine just to pull off spare parts. That becomes very labor intensive. As a result of that, we are having terrible retention rates. 
   We hear about the pilots, but we don't hear about the mechanics and some of the other MOS, military occupational specialties, where we really are having a crisis. 
   This bill also goes a long way to try to get us back into opening up the live range on the island of Vieques.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I appreciate very much getting that into the RECORD because that testimony came out in our committee meetings. The Senator from Kansas is right. Sometimes when you sit in a committee meeting in Washington, everything is filtered. You do not really get the truth you find in the field. 
   This bill is going to put $449 million in real property and maintenance. The RPM accounts are accounts that are mandatory that we have to get down, and yet I have been down to Fort Bragg during a rainstorm. Go into the barracks and one will see our soldiers are actually covering up their equipment with their bodies to keep it from rusting. It is a crisis. We are addressing that crisis with this bill. It is a start. We should be doing more than we do with this particular bill.

   Mr. INHOFE. I thank the chairman. Also I thank the ranking member, Senator LEVIN, who was very helpful on this whole issue. I believe we addressed it properly in this bill. 
   If we let an agreement go that had a financial motivation for the 9,000 residents of the island of Vieques to vote to kick out the Navy forever and lose that as a range, that had to be changed. This bill does that. We changed it so that the western land is not going to the Governor of Puerto Rico but to the people of Vieques. 
   A lot of people do not realize that Vieques is like a municipality in Puerto Rico, and the people of Vieques are very fond of the Navy. I am the first one to admit the Navy had some PR problems, but I say to our chairman, they have worked very hard, and I see a change in attitude there. 
   I was recently in Vieques meeting with a group of people. I left firmly convinced that if we have this referendum and if the referendum has a motivation for them to vote right--and that is to accept the Navy and the live firing range--then I believe they are going to do it. 
   The other day, I was on a talk show and someone called in. Actually, it was someone who was on the other side of this issue. They said: How would you like to have a live range in your State of Oklahoma? 
   I said: Let me tell you about Fort Sill.

   Mr. INHOFE. That is exactly right. My concern has been, I hope and I will go on record right now and I am already on record saying, if we have this referendum, this will be the last time that we should allow a referendum to take place on closing a live range. When one stops and thinks about the domino effect this will have on other places, such as Capo Teulada in Sardinia or Cape Wrath in northern Scotland, it would be a real crisis if we lose those, and yet they logically ask the question--I have seen it in print in Scotland: Wait a minute, if they do not allow the training to take place on land they own, why should we let them come here to our country and bomb it?

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Virginia, who is the ranking member on the Readiness Subcommittee, for the contributions he has made. The Senator from Virginia is in the same position I am in, having live ranges in his home State. 
   I can recall going out on one of the carriers before one of the deployments from the east coast to the Persian Gulf. They have this integrated training on the island of Vieques. They have F-14s and F-18s doing air work; they have the Marine expeditionary, with which the Senator is familiar, since he was a marine, doing their work, and at the same time they have live Navy fire. They say they can get that training elsewhere but not at the same type of place. The analogy was called to my attention by someone who was on one of the deploying battle groups. It is like you have the very best quarterbacks, the very best offensive line, and the very best defensive line. If one is training over here, one is training over here, and one is training over here, but they never train together. On the day of the big game, of course, they lose. The integrated training is necessary. 
   I believe the language in this bill is going to offer the self-determination of the people of Vieques to support the Navy live range, and I have every expectation that is exactly what is going to happen. American lives are at stake. 
   I want to make one last comment. I have mentioned several times we should have probably gone further with this bill. I have been concerned about our state of readiness, and we outlined some of these things in the real property and maintenance accounts and others. 
   But I was reading, the day before yesterday, in the Wall Street Journal, an editorial by Mark Helprin. Mark Helprin is a contributing editor to the Journal but is also a senior fellow of the Claremont Institute. He talks about the crisis that we are going to have to take care of, and that we should not be talking about the fact that we right now, today, are better equipped than we have been. We are not better equipped than we have been before. He goes on to talk about the fact that in Kosovo, 37,000 aerial sorties were required to destroy what Gen. Wesley Clark claimed were 93 tanks and 53 armored fighting vehicles. That is approximately 8 percent and 7 percent, respectively, of which Milosevic actually had. 
   He goes on to say:  
   Twenty percent of carrier-deployed F-14s do not fly, serving as a source of spare parts instead. Forty percent of Army helicopters are rated insufficient to their tasks. Half of the Army's gas masks do not work.  
   It goes on and on.

   Mr. INHOFE. Lastly, let me just say I am glad that defense has become prominent in this Presidential election. We have had a degradation in what has happened to our defense. We have great troops, but right now we are operating at roughly one-half the force strength we were during the Persian Gulf war. And that can be quantified. 
   So often when people stand up politically and say we are stronger now than we were, or as strong as we were back during the Persian Gulf war, that just isn't true. We are approximately 60 percent of where we were in terms of force strength. That can be quantified. 
   I am talking about 60 percent of the Army divisions, 60 percent of the tactical air wings, 60 percent of the ships floating around, going from a 600-ship Navy to a 300-ship Navy. It is true some of that was from the previous administration. The Bush administration wanted to go down from 600 to 450 ships. But now we are far below that. 
   I think this administration has done a bad job the last 8 years. We are going to have to turn that around and do a massive rebuilding in the next administration. I think we are probably going to do it. I think we are going to see our Defense authorization committees of the House and the Senate do that. As well the Appropriations Committees are primed and ready, as is evidenced by the bill we are discussing today that we are going to pass. We are going to turn that corner and start rebuilding America's defense again. 
   With that, I yield the floor.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill by request of the members of the Cherokee, Choctaw, Chickasaw, Creek, and Seminole Nations, historically referred to as the ``Five Civilized Tribes,'' who still own individual Indian restricted land or ``restricted property.'' 
   The proposed bill would repeal aspects of the Stigler Act of 1947--the 1947 Act--and the Act of June 14, 1918--the 1918 Act--which subject the transactions of restricted property to the jurisdiction of Oklahoma's district courts and leave such lands open to adverse possession. 
   By way of background, the issue of individual restricted Indian lands has had a long legislative history. Between 1906 and 1970, Congress enacted numerous laws dealing specifically with the individually allotted lands of the ``Five Civilized Tribes.'' Collectively, these laws have created a complex system of Indian land tenure in eastern Oklahoma. These laws are unique to eastern Oklahoma and are not applicable either in western Oklahoma or elsewhere in the United States. 
   Due to these laws, thousands of acres of Indian lands in eastern Oklahoma have gone unprobated for years, causing ownership of these lands to be increasingly fractionated and more difficult to manage for the benefit of the devisees or undetermined heirs. Indian allotments elsewhere in the United States, on the other hand, are generally held in trust under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Interior. The goal of this legislation is to provide the remaining restricted Indian allotments in eastern Oklahoma, to the greatest extent feasible, with the same kind of protections as are afforded trust allotments in western Oklahoma and all other reservations in the United States. The bill would also include these lands in the national efforts to alleviate the growing problem of fractionated ownership. 
   Notwithstanding these goals, great lengths have been taken to draft the bill so that it would be ``tax neutral'' as to the county tax rolls. The bill is written to help preserve what is left of the individual Indian restricted land base, reducing the rate at which the current inventory of restricted property in eastern Oklahoma passes out of restricted status. The bill would not allow Indian members of the Five Civilized Tribes to simply acquire fee land and have it placed in restricted status. 
   With time very limited in the remaining days of the 106th Congress, I do not intend to rush this bill through Congress, denying adequate hearings and oversight, but simply to demonstrate to all interested parties that this legislation is a serious effort to reform the 1947 act. This bill has been through many drafts in recent months and much progress has been made to achieve a workable bill. I am hopeful that Congress can enact this reform next year.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise to make some brief comments. 
   I was listening, while I was chairing the session, to the very distinguished Senator from Vermont talking about how many appointments and how many nominees should be acted upon. He was very passionate in his appeal to just have a vote; let's just vote up or down. He named nominee after nominee and how many days they have been under consideration. 
   I was tempted to go back and get the history as to some of the problems we are having with this administration and the fact that, yes, I am guilty of putting holds on judicial nominees and doing the same thing that, back in 1985, Senator BYRD did when Ronald Reagan was President of the United States. 
   But rather than go into that, I will only say this--I don't want to take much time; I want the Senator from Iowa to have his time--we have acted upon President Clinton's nominees. In fact, it is my understanding that he is only five short of having an all-time record of having nominees being confirmed in a period of time. 
   Even though the Senator from Vermont was quite eloquent in talking about all of the judicial nominees who were left without final action being taken, either to confirm or not confirm, if we quit right now and didn't confirm these four we are discussing today, at the end of President Clinton's term, that would leave a total of 67 vacancies. It is my understanding that 61 is considered to be a full bench. 
   Let's say 67 vacancies are there. Back when President Bush was President, when he left office at the end of 1992, there were 107 vacancies. 
   The bottom line there is the Democrat-controlled Senate at 
   that time was able to stop or was stopping more of the nominations than the Republican-controlled Senate is today. 
   Seeing that the Senator from Iowa has left the Chamber and no one else is asking for time, I will go ahead at this point and proceed to the history behind this. 
   Back in 1985, when Ronald Reagan was President of the United States and the Senate was controlled by the Democrats, a lot of the conservative appointments--not just judicial nominations but others--by the President were not acted upon by the Democrat-controlled Senate. Consequently, President Reagan did something he should not have done back in 1985. He started making recess appointments, and he made many recess appointments. The majority leader at that time, the very distinguished Senator from West Virginia, Mr. BYRD, wrote a letter to President Reagan. 
   In this letter, he reminded him as to what the senatorial prerogative was in accordance with the Constitution. At that time he said: You have violated the Constitution with these recess appointments, and you have done so to avoid our confirmation or lack of confirmation. Therefore, if you have any more recess appointments, I will put a hold on all nominees, not just judicial nominations but all nominations. 
   Consequently, after a short period of time, President Reagan wrote a letter back to Senator BYRD and said: You are right; it was a violation of the Constitution. And he recited that the Constitution had a provision for recess appointments only in the cases when the appointment occurs during the time we are in recess and that that was not the case when he made his recess appointments. 
   Fifteen months ago, when we found out that President Clinton was making excessive recess appointments, I found the old letter that BOB BYRD had sent to President Reagan, and I sent that same letter to President Clinton, saying the same thing: If you continue to do recess appointments, we are going to put holds on all your nominees, except, I said, just judicial nominees. Consequently, President Clinton, after a period of 3 or 4 weeks, wrote a letter back and said that he would agree to the same terms Ronald Reagan had agreed to back in 1985. Then when President Clinton violated his word, I put holds on nominations. This was 15 months ago. 
   As we all know, there was a vote to override my holds after a few months, and that was successful. However, for all judicial nominations that have not gone through the process since President Clinton did have 17 recess appointments during the August recess, I have renewed that hold on all future judicial nominations. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I was very honored to have the opening prayer given by my pastor in Tulsa, OK--a church where my wife, who is present today, and I were married 41 years ago--when he was a very small baby, I might add. It is kind of unique, Mr. President. You know Oklahoma quite well. Oklahoma wasn't even a State until 1907, and yet the First Presbyterian Church started in 1885. For the first 15 years, the congregation was made up entirely of Cree Indian. It is an unusual type of church. I might also add that in all those years--that would be what, 115 years--there have only been six pastors of the First Presbyterian Church of Tulsa. Dr. Jim Miller is the sixth pastor. So once they come, they do not want to leave. 
   We are honored also to have with us his wife Diana and two of his children, David and Courtney, who are in attendance with my wife. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. INHOFE. I appreciate the comments of my colleagues from Florida. I have worked in the Armed Services Committee of the Senate to protect and defend the base closure and disposal process from political manipulation. I would agree that the resolution in the legislation before us today should not be read to mean the Air Force should delay its decision on the disposal of Homestead Air Force Base or otherwise alter its decision making process. The law is clear on how surplus military facilities in this country are disposed and it is my intent that this law be followed and adhered to by the Air Force. I note the presence on the floor of the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee on the floor. I yield to Senator WARNER.

   Mr. INHOFE. I thank the leader. First of all, there are no two people I respect more than the two Senators from Florida. They certainly have done a very good job on the Everglades portion of the bill. 
   However, I have to get on record. I will oppose the bill because of these elements that have been introduced. This is of great concern to me. Looking at the fiscal end, I see four reasons we should not have this on the bill. First of all, if we do this, and we have already done it--and on the Everglades portion I pleaded with everyone it should have been a stand-alone bill because it is too big to be incorporated into this resources bill--this will be the first time we have actually had projects without first having the Chief of the Corps of Engineers give a report. That has been something we have said is necessary. 
   Second, we are looking at questionable technology. Everyone has admitted this. Certainly, the chairman of the committee, the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire, was very honest about it and straightforward. He said he felt strongly enough about it that we will have to try some things that perhaps have not been proven. This is unprecedented. 
   Third, the amount of money we are talking about is open ended. We say this will be $7.8 billion in 38 years. But when we first started Medicare, approximately the same length of time ago, they said it would cost $3.4 billion, and this year it is $232 billion. 
   A major concern I have is changing a precedent that has been there for 16 years; that is, that the operation and maintenance costs should come from the States. Now we are absorbing those costs, or at least 50 percent of those costs, operation and maintenance, by the Federal Government. 
   I think we are opening up something here. Yes, it is popular. There is a big constituency. It is open ended. It could end up costing us a tremendous amount of money. 
   I wanted a chance, Madam President, to explain why I have to vote against this bill.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Warner amendment. In my dissenting view on S. 2797, the ``Restoring the Everglades, An American Legacy Act,'' I outlined my concerns with this legislation. I would like to submit my dissenting view for the RECORD. 
   While I recognize the Everglades as a national treasure, S. 2797 sets precedents, which I cannot, in good conscience, condone. 
   I would also like to reiterate my objection to the marriage of the Everglades and WRDA legislation. I know many advocates of this plan argue that the Everglades should be a part of WRDA 2000. However, the Everglades plan is hardly a typical WRDA project. Because of the scale and departure from existing law and policy of the Everglades legislation, it should be considered as a stand alone bill--not a provision in the Water Resources Development Act of 2000. This is a precedent setting bill. With other plans of this nature in the works, the Everglades will be a model for how we handle these enormous ecological restoration projects in the future. We are entering new and, in my opinion, dangerous territory. 
   No. 1. This legislation violates the committee policy concerning the need for a Chief of the Army Corps of Engineer's report before project authorization. This legislation authorizes 10 projects at a cost of $1.1 billion with no reports of the Chief of Engineers on these projects. Since 1986, it has been the policy of the Committee on Environment and Public Works to require projects to have undergone full and final engineering, economic and environmental review by the Chief of Engineers prior to project approvals by the committee. This process was established to protect taxpayer dollars by ensuring the soundness of all projects. While I understand that, under this legislation, no appropriation can be made until a ``Project Implementation Report'' is submitted by the Corps, this legislation is still breaking committee policy--it is authorizing projects without a Chief's report. 
   No. 2. Everglades restoration is based on unproven technology. I have serious concerns about the wisdom of a federal investment in unproven technologies--particularly a $7.8 billion investment. The project approval process, described above, was established to prevent exactly what is happening with this legislation--a gamble with the American taxpayers' money. 
   No. 3. The open-ended nature of costs of this project. The total cost of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan is estimated at $7.8 billion over 38 years. This is the current estimate. I have serious concerns about this potential for cost over runs associated with this project. GAO agrees with me. In a report--released today--GAO stated, ``Currently, there are too many uncertainties to estimate the number and costs of the Corps projects that will ultimately be needed .....'' As with almost all federal programs, this project will probably cost much more at the end of the day. For example, in 1967, when the Medicare program was passed by Congress, the program was estimated to cost $3.4 billion. In 2000, the costs of the program are estimated to $232 billion. No one could have foreseen this exponential growth! The future cost of projects of this magnitude must be taken into consideration by Congress before we pass legislation. Once projects like these get major investments, they are funded until the end--no matter what the cost. There should be a cost cap on the entire Everglades project--not just on portions. 
   No. 4. This legislation sets a new precedent which requires the federal government to pay for a major portion of operations and maintenance costs. The Warner amendment will remedy this problem. 
   Since 1986, water resource projects, including environmental, navigation, flood control, and hurricane restoration are financed partially by the federal government and partially by the local and state governments. And all of the costs of operations and maintenance of the projects has been the non-federal entities--usually state or local governments responsibility. We should not forget that this critical cost-share policy was a key factor in breaking a 16 year stalemate on water resources development authorization legislation. 
   This Everglades legislation splits the cost of operations and maintenance of the Everglades-- 1/2 to the federal government and 1/2 to the State of Florida. The O&M expenditures for these prematurely authorized projects is expected to cost $20 million, and, according the Corp, when the Everglades project is completed, O&M costs are projected to be in excess of $170 million a year. 
   At the end of FY 2000, there will be a $1.6 billion backlog of federal O&M costs nationwide of which $329 million is considered ``critical'' because, if O&M is not performed on these facilities, they will not be able to maintain current performance. In the Tulsa district, which includes Oklahoma, there is a $80 million backlog in O&M. The $170 million needed for O&M of the Everglades--which is almost half of the this year's critical backlog--will drain resources--creating a larger backlog around the rest of the nation. How can we fund local O&M expenses when we can't fund federal O&M expenses. 
   States and localities have enormous backlogs of operations and maintenance costs due to lack of funding. The precedent, which the Everglades legislation sets, could open a pandora's box--having the Federal Government take on expenses for the operations and maintenance of many projects. There are a number of Oklahoma projects that could use federal funds for operations and maintenance costs. My hometown of Tulsa pays in excess of $3 million a year in O&M costs. 
   The Everglades legislation is also unfair because the Corps will be conducting annual inspections on all flood control projects turned over to the local sponsors for 100 percent O&M. Though they try very hard, many localities, which cannot afford O&M costs, will not be able to keep their projects properly maintained. When it comes time for more Federal projects, they will not be favorably looked upon. the Federal Government will say, well, if the local sponsor cannot afford the current cost-share agreement, how could they afford a new one--even if the community desperately needs the new project. How can the Federal Government fund Florida's Everglades O&M bill; while other community's projects are denied because they can not afford proper O&M and we will not help them? How is this fair? 
   Again, I recognize the Everglades as a national treasure--as I do many treasures in Oklahoma. As Congress considers the Everglades restoration legislation, all I ask is that Congress play by the rules. 
   Mr. President, to reiterate, I commend the Senator from Virginia for bringing to our attention what is happening here. I am concerned. This is a major piece of legislation. As I said yesterday in committee, it would be my preference not to have it as part of the water bill but to have it as a stand-alone bill. Because of the size, the magnitude, and nature of it, it should be. It is true what Senator WARNER has said about how this violates both the letter  and the intent of what we decided in 1986. I remember when it happened. But it is not just in this area. Let me mention briefly three other areas where we are having the same problem. 
   First of all, this legislation violates the committee policy concerning the need for the Chief of the Army Corps of Engineer's report before project authorization. This was decided back in 1986. To my knowledge--and I had my staff research this--we have not gone forward with any other projects that have not had a recommendation and a report completed by the Chief of the Corps of Engineers.

   Mr. INHOFE. I can see what is going to happen after this because every time something comes up they are going to say: Wait a minute, you didn't require it then. They are overworked. So why should we require it now? 
   We have two right now in the State of Oklahoma, in my State, awaiting those reports. 
   The second thing is the unproven technology. If you go back to 1986, repeated again in 1996, we said we will only use proven technology when these projects are authorized. Admittedly, during the committee meeting they said--in fact even the chairman of the committee said--we know a lot of this technology is not proven. 
   The third thing is it is open ended. I want to mention we are talking about $7.8 billion over 38 years. Yesterday, the GAO came out, and after pressing on this, said it could be higher. How much higher? It could be as high as $14 billion. I am old enough to remember--I think there are a couple of us in this Chamber who might remember, too--back in 1967 when we started out on the Medicare program. They said at that time it was going to cost $3.4 billion. I suggest to you this year it is $232 billion. I do not like these open-ended things. They say we are only talking about the first year. Once you start, you are committed. 
   The last thing, of course, is what this amendment addresses. I believe very strongly that when we open up the O&M accounts, the operation and maintenance costs will be borne by the Federal Government. It is not just going to be that on future projects that come up we will say we don't have to worry about O&M accounts because 50 percent of it can be provided by the Federal Government; there is now a precedent for it. Not only that, I can see right now coming back on existing projects and saying: Look, we are undergoing that as a State expense. Why should we do that when we are not doing it for this particular project? 
   I think the amendment is very good, but I think the amendment should be broadened to cover these other violations of both the intent and letter of the 1986 law.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, there is an issue that needs to be addressed in WRDA that is not addressed by this bill. On June 12, 2000, the Administration sent us a report on the management of the Corps of Engineers' hopper dredge fleet. It says that efforts initiated by Congress in WRDA 96 have been successful. That legislation moved more of the routine maintenance dredging to the private sector and increased the Corps emergency response capability. In their report, the Corps recommended a plan that would move a little more work to the private sector while rehabilitating the oldest federal hopper dredge for emergency response purposes. While it may be questionable whether or not the benefit of this federal investment is worth the cost, I am willing to implement the Corps recommendations in order to get the management and emergency response improvements that are described in the report to Congress. After receiving the report, I requested legislative language from the Corps that they provided to me. I have been attempting to work with interested members to get this language, or possibly other compromise language, adopted in this legislation. I do not understand why the Corps recommendation is not considered a victory by the supporters of this federal dredge. The Corps strongly believes that their recommendation is a win-win for the nation's ports and the ports along the Delaware River as well as the nation's taxpayers. While I am not offering an amendment here today, I want my colleagues to know that this is an issue that I am going to pursue. I hope that we will be able to work something out in the conference committee. Thank you very much. I look forward to working with my colleagues on this important national issue.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I will add to my friend's thoughtful analysis. This is yet another example of the President's apparent lack of concern for the rule of law. All year long, the administration has berated the Republican majority for not doing enough on controlling gun violence. Yet at the same time, by releasing these terrorists, he has set aside 36 specific Federal firearms convictions pertaining to: 
   Possessing an unregistered firearm;  
   Possession of firearms during the commission of seditious conspiracy; 
   Transport of firearms with intent to commit seditious conspiracy; 
   Possession of firearm without a serial number; 
   Conspiracy to make destructive devices. 
   Let there be no mistake, these were not people merely exercising their first amendment right of freedom of speech. They are responsible for the deaths of six Americans and the injury of at least 84 others. 
   One has to wonder why the administration will not simply enforce existing law. The record shows the Clinton-Gore administration has not enforced Federal gun laws, and more disturbing, they have conveniently forgotten the law if it suits their political ends. I believe the President's efforts for these terrorists were just that.

   Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, national security must take precedence over trade. Granting permanent trade favors to China in the face of its openly threatening actions of recent years is unconscionable. 
   We cannot allow the pursuit of dollars to blind us to certain realities about the ruling communist regime in China, including: repeated threats against the United States and Taiwan; massive military modernization and buildup; its proliferation of dangerous weapons to rogue states; theft of U.S. nuclear secrets; demonstrated strategy to exploit commercial relationships to acquire advanced military technology; attempts to corrupt the U.S. political system; violation of international agreements; and brutal repression of dissidents. 
   To ignore these actions in the belief they can be separated from what we do in our trading relationship is dangerously misguided. China's trade surpluses are helping to finance the regime's military buildup and aggressive foreign policy, while strengthening its hold on economic and political power. 
   Similarly, to suggest that increased trade is by itself going to reverse China's negative behavior is belied by recent history. Trade with China has been steadily increasing for the past decade while its behavior in these security areas has grown substantially worse. 
   America should require from China some measure of permanent normalized international behavior as a prerequisite to permanent normalized trade relations. Otherwise, it is predictable that the favors we grant to China will be exploited to enhance its military buildup, while the market-opening favors and prosperity we expect from China will be much less than many in our country anticipate. 
   I want to emphasize that I am not philosophically opposed to free trade. I voted for the recent Africa-Caribbean trade bill and I am a strong supporter of a measure to end the use of agricultural trade sanctions as a means to achieve policy goals. 
   I am very skeptical about the extent to which China will actually open its markets to U.S. products. Despite tariff-lowering measures in trade agreements, China has--in the past--sought to erect other complicated trade barriers to block imports. Especially with regard to agricultural products, China is unlikely to offer the wide-open market some in the U.S. are anticipating. China will go to great lengths to protect its own huge labor-intensive agricultural sector, because of the difficulty of absorbing displaced agriculture workers in scarcer city jobs. 
   Permanently opening the U.S. market to China now--in the face of its bullying at home and abroad--would be viewed by Chinese leaders less as an act of friendship than as an act of weakness. It would signal to them that there is going to be no meaningful consequence to their bad behavior and that America is content to put the pursuit of dollars ahead of any obligation to protect its own values and security. 
   The following are examples of the major national security issues that must be considered in the debate over PNTR for China: 
   Threats to the United States: In recent years, China has issued direct military threats against the United States of a kind that even the Soviet Union largely avoided in the darkest days of the Cold War. These included a threat to destroy Los Angeles with nuclear weapons; other threats to launch missile strikes on the United States and neutron bomb strikes on U.S. aircraft carriers if we should intervene to defend Taiwan. In 1998, the CIA confirmed that at least 13 of China's 18 land-based ICBMs were targeted on American cities. In Dec. 1999, China's defense minister, reflecting well-documented military thinking in China, stated, ``War (with the U.S.) is inevitable. We cannot avoid it.'' 
   Threats to Taiwan: China has openly threatened military action against democratic Taiwan. In 1996, China fired M-9 missiles off the coasts of Taiwan in an attempt to intimidate voters during its presidential election. In Feb. 2000, it issued a ``white paper'' openly threatening ``all drastic measures, including the use of force'' if Taiwan delayed reunification talks, a threat previously reserved only for a Taiwanese declaration of independence. In 1995, China had 40 M-9 missiles targeted on Taiwan. By 1999, it had deployed at least 200 such missiles and the number is increasing at a rate of 50 per year. The Pentagon estimates that by 2005, China could have 800 missiles targeted on Taiwan. 
   Military buildup: China is engaged in a massive long-term military modernization largely designed to counter U.S. power projection capabilities. In March 2000, China announced a 13 percent increase in military spending, which U.S. analysts believe is probably a lot less than the true number. China's new JL-2 submarine-launched ICBM will be able to hit the United States from Chinese territorial waters. China's new DF-31 truck-mounted mobile ICBM was test-fired in August 1999 and described by U.S. Air Force analysts as ``a significant threat not only to U.S. forces ..... in the Pacific theater, but to the continental U.S. and many of our allies.'' In January 2000, China signed a multibillion dollar deal to purchase weapons from Russia, adding to what it has already purchased, including: 4 heavy destroyers armed with SS-N-22 ``Sunburn'' nuclear-capable cruise missiles designed specifically  to attack U.S. aircraft carriers; 200 SU-27 jet fighters, which are more capable than the U.S. F-15; 40 SU-30 jet fighters with precision guided weapons; 4 Kilo-class (quiet) attack submarines; 24 Mi-17 assault helicopters; and 50 T-72 tanks. China is also purchasing up to 4 Airborne Warning and Control System--AWACS--aircraft. In addition, China is employing all means--legal and illegal--to purchase improvements in a whole range of advanced military technologies, including: computers; lasers; space launch and space control systems; cyber-warfare; stealth; and chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. 
   Proliferation: China is doing more than any other country to spread dangerous weapons and military technology to rogue states around the world. In recent years, China has transferred technology on such items as missiles, nuclear weapons, and chemical and biological weapons to North Korea, Iran, Pakistan, Libya, Iraq, and Syria, among others--often in direct violation of commitments to refrain from such behavior. 
   Thefts and compromises of nuclear secrets: In 1999, the Cox Report revealed that China had stolen or otherwise acquired advanced U.S. technology on ballistic missiles, nuclear weapons, reentry vehicles, high performance computers, anti-submarine warfare techniques and much more. It confirmed that China had acquired information on our most advanced miniaturized nuclear warhead, the W-88, helping to 
   give China MIRV capability--multiple warheads on a single rocket. 
   As I reported in a major speech on the Senate floor on June 23, 1999, what we learned is that 16 of the 17 most significant major technology breaches to China revealed in the Cox Report were first discovered after 1994--during the Clinton-Gore administration. And that at least 8 of these actually occurred during the Clinton-Gore administration. 
   I have compiled this important information in a chart that clearly illustrates what the Clinton-Gore administration has been trying to cover up for over 5 years. 
   It helps reveal the fact that Clinton and Gore have not protected national security in our relations with China; that their appeasement of China has extended to selling, transferring, and overlooking the theft of some of our most sensitive nuclear and missile-related secrets. Coupled with their receipt--in the 1996 campaign--of hundreds of thousands of dollars in illegal campaign contributions from China, this is a scandal of huge proportions. 
   The American people need to know the truth, but they are not going to get it by listening to the self-serving spin being spewed by this President and his equally culpable and subservient Vice President. 
   Exploitation of commercial arrangements to acquire technology: The Cox Report also revealed the massive efforts China is making to acquire advanced military technology through its dealings with U.S. companies in the commercial sphere. For example, it confirmed that through its arrangements to launch satellites for U.S. companies such as Loral and Hughes, China acquired technology which improved the accuracy and reliability of its long-range military rockets which are targeted at the United States. 
   Attempts to corrupt U.S. political process: During the 1996 election cycle, people with close ties to the Chinese government funneled hundreds of thousands of dollars in illegal campaign contributions in an attempt to influence U.S. elections. The full extent of this scandal is not yet known. But we do know that the FBI director, Louis Freeh, and the hand-picked Justice Department investigator, Charles LaBella, believed it was serious enough to require the appointment of an independent counsel to fully investigate. Serious questions remain about the activities of John Huang, Charlie Trie, James Riady and a host of others who were involved. One of the important critical questions is whether national security was compromised in return for campaign cash. Neither China not the Clinton Administration has cooperated in these investigations. 
   Violations of agreements: China has failed to abide by international agreements it has made in the past. For example, despite promises to abide by the norms of the multilateral Missile Technology Control Regime, China has repeatedly engaged in weapons proliferation activities. 
   Human rights--repression of dissidents: The U.S. State Department confirms that China's record on human rights has deteriorated in recent years, that it has engaged in such activities as arrests and repression of political dissidents, persecution of religious expression, exploitation of slave labor, and forced abortions. China has never repudiated its actions in brutally crushing China's democracy movement at Tiananmen Square in 1989 or its ethnic cleansing in Tibet. 
   These issues cannot be ignored or swept under the rug in an exclusive pursuit of trade. Our first obligation is protecting national security. We will not do it by evading the truth. Granting China permanent normal trade status without any progress on these issues is appeasement. Granting it in the naive hope that it is going to bring about such progress is a delusion. 
   Madam President, once again, I support the Thompson amendment. I think most of the people who are supporting it also support PNTR. I am going to be opposing PNTR. However, I think he is addressing one of the many areas where we have a problem with proliferation. 
   As I have said, I think national security must take precedence over trade. Granting permanent normal trade status to China in the face of its openly threatened action in recent years is, I believe, unconscionable. 
   While Senator THOMPSON is correct when he talks about the problems with proliferation, there are many other problems, too, which include China's repeated threats against the United States and Taiwan; China's massive military modernization buildup; China's proliferation of dangerous weapons to rogue states; China's theft of U.S. nuclear secrets; China's demonstrated strategy to exploit commercial relationships to acquire advanced military technology; China's attempts to corrupt the U.S. political system; China's violation of international agreements, and China's brutal repression of dissidents. 
   I think to ignore these actions in the belief that they can be separated from what we do in our trade relationship is dangerously misguided. China's trade surpluses are helping finance the regime's military buildup, while strengthening its hold on economic and political power. Similarly, to suggest that increased trade by itself is going to reverse China's negative behavior is belied by recent history. Trade with China has been on the upswing. We are trading more with them: Yet their behavior in security areas has grown substantially worse. 
   I believe America should require from China some measure of permanent normalized international behavior as a prerequisite to permanent normalized trade relations. Otherwise, it is predictable that the favors we grant to China will be exploited to enhance its military buildup, while the market-opening favors and prosperity we expect from China will be much less than many in our country anticipate. 
   I emphasize that I am not philosophically opposed to free trade. I did oppose NAFTA in 1994. In fact, I did it for two reasons. One was that I knew what was going to happen to our infrastructure as a result of allowing trucks from Mexico to go through our corridors--being from Oklahoma, we are pretty close to it, and the occupant of the Chair being from Texas, she understands this--without having to comply with our environmental standards, wage and hour standards, and safety standards. The competition isn't open. It is not a level playing field. We know that. The other reason is, it seemed to me it would damage our trade deficit. If you will remember, in 1994, we had a trade surplus with Mexico of $1.3 billion. It is now a $22 billion trade deficit. 
   On the other hand, I voted for the recent Africa-Caribbean trade bill. I am a strong supporter, along with Senator ASHCROFT, of exempting agricultural products from the sanctions. I am very skeptical about the extent to which China will actually open its markets to U.S. products. Despite tariff-lowering measures in trade agreements, China has in the past sought to erect other complicated trade barriers to block imports--especially with regard to agricultural products.  
   I think it is very unlikely that China is going to go to great lengths to protect its own huge labor-intensive agricultural sector because of the difficulty of absorbing displaced agricultural workers in scarcer city jobs. I had a chance to visit the other day with Wei Jing Sheng. He was a dissident who was imprisoned for some period of time in China. He is exiled now; he is here. He said it made perfectly good sense. Why would we expect China to import wheat grown in Oklahoma or someplace in the United States, when all that would do would be to take the very labor-intensive, antiquated technology that they use in their agricultural programs in China and then move those people to the cities where they can't absorb it? This individual was absolutely convinced that would be the end result. 
   Permanently opening the U.S market to China now--in the face of its bullying at home and abroad--would be viewed by Chinese leaders less as an act of friendship than as an act of weakness. It would signal to them that there is going to be no meaningful consequence to their bad behavior and that America is content to put the pursuit of dollars ahead of any obligation to protect its own values and security. 
   The following are some examples of the major national security issues that I think should be considered in the debate over PNTR to China. Of course, this amendment only deals with one of them. 
   First of all, the threats to the United States. 
   In recent years, China has issued direct military threats against the United States of a kind that even the Soviet Union in the midst of the cold war would never have made. These include a threat to destroy Los Angeles with nuclear weapons. Another threat was to launch missile strikes on the United States; neutron bomb strikes on U.S. aircraft carriers if we should intervene to defend Taiwan. 
   In 1998, the CIA confirmed that at least 13 of China's 18 land-based ICBMs were targeted on American cities. We knew it a long time before that. But somehow there was a leak, and I believe the Washington Times was able to disclose that. 
   In December of 1999, China's Defense Minister said war with America was inevitable. 
   I hesitate to say this, but I remember so well when we were warned by Senator Bob Kerrey, a Democrat Senator from Nebraska. Some of you may not know it. In 1992, before the election of Bill Clinton to the White House, he said Bill Clinton is an awfully good liar. He was very prophetic. 
   I think of all of the things this President has said that are untrue, probably the one that inflicted the most damage on the United States is the one he repeated 133 times. Keep in mind that at the time he said this, he knew the Chinese were targeting American cities. He said: For the first time in the history of the nuclear age, there is not one--I repeat, not one--missile aimed at an American child tonight. Everybody cheered. Yet we knew at that time that missiles from China were aimed at American cities. They still are today. We know that. It is not even classified. 
   China is engaged in a massive, long-term military modernization largely designed to counter U.S. power projection capabilities. In March 2000, China announced it was going to have a 13-percent increase in military spending. Most of our U.S. analysts believe that is far from the true figure; it is really far greater than that. China's new JL-2 submarine-launched ICBM will be able to hit the United States from Chinese territorial waters. China's new DF-31 truck-mounted mobile ICBM was test-fired in August of 1999 and described by U.S. Air Force analysts as ``a significant threat not only to U.S. ..... forces in the Pacific theater, but to the continental United States and many of our allies.'' 
   In January of 2000, China signed a multibillion-dollar deal to purchase weapons from Russia adding to what it already had purchased, including four heavy destroyers armed with SS-N-22 ``Sunburn'' nuclear-capable cruise missiles designed specifically to attack U.S. aircraft carriers; 200 SU-27 jet fighters--this is a jet fighter that we know now is better than any air-to-air combat vehicle we have, including the F-15--40 SU-30 jet 
   fighters with precision-guided missiles; 4 Kilo class, quiet class, attack submarines; 24 MI-17 assault helicopters; and 50 T-72 tanks. China is also purchasing up to four airborne warning and control systems--AWACS systems--that they are purchasing from Israel. In addition, China is employing all means legal and illegal to pursue improvements in a whole range of advanced military technologies, including computers, lasers, space launch and space control systems; cyberwarfare; stealth, chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons. 
   Let me repeat: On the SU-27 and SU-30, I was very proud of Gen. John Jumper a few months ago when he had the courage to stand up and tell the American people the truth. 
   There is this myth floating around, particularly among people who are anti-defense to start with, that there is no threat out there--that America has the best of everything. We don't have the best of everything. Gen. John Jumper, the air commander at that time, made the statement that Russia, in the position of manufacturing their SU-27s, SU-30s, and SU-35s and selling them on the open market to countries such as Iran, Iraq, Syria, Pakistan, and North Korea--this is something they have. The proliferation is going on and on. They already have more modern equipment and better equipment in some areas of combat than the United States has. 
   China is doing more than any other country to spread dangerous weapons and military technology to rogue states around the world. In recent years, China has transferred technology and such items as missiles, nuclear weapons, and chemical and biological weapons to all the countries I just mentioned--North Korea, Pakistan, Libya, Iraq, Iran, Syria, and other countries, which is a direct violation of commitments to refrain from such behavior. 
   I guess what I am saying is China has been working. It is not a matter of what they have and how you trust China. It is the same with Russia. They are trading technologies and trading systems with these other countries. That is compromising nuclear secrets. 
   The 1999 Cox report revealed that China had stolen or otherwise acquired advanced U.S. technology on ballistic missiles, nuclear weapons reentry vehicles, high-performance computers, anti-submarine-warfare systems, and much more. It confirmed that China had acquired information on our most advanced miniaturized nuclear warhead, the W-88, helping to give China a MIRV capability--a multiple warhead on one single rocket. 
   In fairness to China, I have to say that they have had a lot of help. The administration has been very helpful to China. 
   By the way, I have frequently said things about the President that other people do not say. I would suggest to you, Mr. President, that Teddy Roosevelt said ``patriotism means to stand by your country.'' It doesn't mean to stand by the President or any other elected officials to the exact degree that he himself stands by his country. It is unpatriotic not to oppose a President to the same degree that he, by inefficiency or otherwise, fails to stand by his country. I believe President Clinton has failed to stand by his country. 
   As reported in a major speech on the Senate floor in March and again on June 23rd, what we learned, as revealed in the Cox report, is that if you take away these other 17 compromises of our nuclear secrets--the first one, the W-70 warhead, you can forget about that. It happened in the Carter administration. It is obsolete. So it doesn't matter. These 16 do--at least 16, including the W-88 warhead I just referred to, which is our crown jewel. The first of these happened perhaps in a previous administration. The second eight all happened during the Clinton administration. These happened on Bill Clinton's watch. As far the first ones are concerned, the W-88 warhead technology, W-87 warhead, W-78 warhead, W-76 and W-62 warheads--all of these happened perhaps in a previous administration. 
   But we found out in the Cox report that there was a Chinese ``walk'' into a CIA office where they said that in 1994 they informed the administration the Chinese had all of these secrets. These are from perhaps other administrations. But the President knew about it.  The President covered it up. Berger and the rest of them covered it up until the Cox report, through their investigation in January of 1999, discovered that in fact these were discovered 5 years before. It was a coverup until 1999. 
   I think it is an appropriate place to bring this up again just for the purpose of discussing this because we have got to remind the American people exactly what happened. All of this talk about what has happened in our energy lab, all the talk about passing laws that something such as this cannot happen again--I can tell you right now, if you have a President of the United States such as President Clinton who willfully goes out and stops the security at these laboratories--one of his first acts after becoming President--of course there is going to be a problem. This is what this President did. In 1993, when he first got into office, he removed the color-coded security badges that had been used for years by the Department of Energy's weapons labs. They were removed as being discriminatory. 
   We don't want to hurt anyone's feelings, so we can't have color-coded badges. 
   Second, he stopped the FBI background checks. In 1993, the FBI background checks for workers and visitors of the weapons labs were put on hold, dramatically increasing the number of people going into the labs who had previously not had access. 
   Third, he overturned the DOE's security decision. In 1995, the Department of Energy personnel action revoking the security clearance of an employee found to have compromised classified information was overturned, giving him back his classification after it was proven he compromised secrets. 
   No. 5, he rejected the FBI request for wiretaps. Since 1996, four requests for wiretaps on the prime suspect in the investigation of the loss of information on the W-88 warhead technology were rejected. The suspect was allowed to keep his job before being fired in the wake of news reports in 1999, the Cox report. 
   No. 6, he leaked classified information to the media. In 1995, a classified design drawing of the W-87 nuclear warhead was leaked to and represented in the U.S. News and World Report magazine. The leak investigation was stopped when it pointed directly to the Secretary of Energy and this administration. 
   No. 7, President Clinton or the Clinton-Gore administration thwarted whistleblowers. Career Government employees, such as the Energy Department's former Director of Intelligence, Notra Trulock, and its former security and safeguards Chief, Ed McCollum, who tried to warn of security concerns, were thwarted for years by political appointees. We had hearings in the Intelligence Committee on this, and the Readiness Subcommittee, which I chair, of the Senate Armed Services Committee. 
   No. 8, the administration switched export license authority. They did this in 1996, from the State Department to the Commerce Department. This was over the objection of both the State and the Defense Departments. 
   No. 9, he granted waivers allowing missile technology transfers. You may remember the most notorious. President Clinton took a signed waiver to allow the Chinese to buy the guidance technology to put on their missiles that was made by the Loral Corporation; their CEO was the single largest contributor to the Clinton-Gore campaigns. 
   No. 10, he ended COCOM. In 1994, the Coordinating Committee on Multinational Export Controls, called COCOM, the multinational agreement among U.S. allies to restrict technology sales to China, he dissolved that. 
   The list goes on and on. China had a lot of help in getting virtually everything that we had. 
   Exploitation of commerce, commercial arrangements to acquire technology. The Cox report revealed engagement of a massive effort by China in acquiring advanced military technology through its dealings with U.S. companies. We have talked about that. 
   China has it all. In the first chart, there were 16 compromises. We don't know what they have done with this information. I don't think our intelligence knows. We now know that all 16 compromises took place and China has the technology. What they have built with this technology, we don't really know for sure. 
   In the attempt to corrupt the 1996 election cycle, people with close ties to the Chinese Government funneled hundreds of thousands into illegal campaign contributions in an attempt to 
   influence U.S. elections. 
   Remember the pictures of Al Gore at the temple? This full extent of the scandal is not yet known, but Louis Freeh, the Director of the FBI, as well as the hand-picked Justice Department investigator, Charles LaBella, believed it was serious enough to require the appointment of an independent counsel to fully investigate the Clinton-Gore scandal. Serious questions remain about the activities of John Huang, Charlie Trie, James Riady, and the list goes on and on. Of course, Janet Reno has refused to appoint counsel. I don't think we will hear more from this administration. 
   China has failed to abide by international agreements it has made in the past. For example, despite promises to abide by the norms of the multinational missile technology control regime, China has engaged in weapons proliferation. The distinguished Senator from Arizona, Mr. KYL, was talking about this a few minutes ago. 
   Lastly, the U.S. State Department confirms that China's record on human rights has deteriorated in recent years. It has deteriorated, not gotten better. Trade has increased but the relationships have deteriorated. They have engaged in such activities as arrests, repression of political dissidents, persecution of religious expression, exploitation of slave labor, and forced abortions in China, and have never repudiated its actions in brutality curbing China's democracy movement in Tiananmen Square in 1989. 
   These issues cannot be ignored or swept under the rug exclusively, pursuant of trade. Our first obligation is to protect our national security. We will not try to do it by evading the truth. Granting China permanent normal trade status without any progress in these areas is appeasement. An appeaser is a guy who feeds his friends to the alligators hoping they will eat him last. 
   No man survives when freedom fails, the best men rot in filthy jails, and those who cry ``appease'' are hanged by those they try to appease. 
   In October of 1995, when we were preparing to intervene when they were doing the missile tests to try to influence the elections in Taiwan, China's top official said: We are not concerned about the United States coming to the defense of Taiwan because they would rather defend Los Angeles than defend Taipei. 
   That is, at the very least, an indirect threat at a missile coming to the United States of America. 
   Just a few weeks ago, the Defense Minister of China said war with America is inevitable. 
   When we are talking about giving a country such as this preferred status, we will not be doing it with my vote.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, in 1985, when we had a conservative Republican in the White House by the name of Ronald Reagan, we had a Senate that was dominated by the Democrats. At that time, the Senate majority leader was a very distinguished Senator from West Virginia, Senator BOB BYRD. 
   We found Ronald Reagan was violating the Constitution with recess appointments. Let me go back and give a little background of this. In the history of this country, back when we were in session for a few weeks and then they got on their horse and buggy and went for several days back to wherever they came from, if some opening occurred during the course of a recess, such as the Secretary of State dying, the Constitution provides that a President can go ahead and make a recess appointment and not rely on the prerogative of the Senate to confirm, for confirmation purposes. This is understandable at that time.  
   Since then, Republicans and Democrats in the White House have, when they were philosophically opposed to the philosophy of the prevailing philosophy in the Senate, made recess appointments. 
   Ronald Reagan was doing this. I loved him, but he was violating the Constitution. 
   Senator BYRD read and studied the Constitution. He sent a letter to the White House that said: If you continue to do this, then I can assure you we will put holds on all of your nominations. It wasn't just judicial nominations but all of them. I read from Senator BYRD:  
   In the future, prior to any recess breaks, the White House will inform the majority leader and (the minority leader) of any recess appointments which might be contemplated in the recess. They would do so in such advance time to sufficiently allow the leadership on both sides to perhaps take action to fill whatever vacancies might take place during such a break.  
   Those were for anticipated vacancies. 
   President Reagan agreed with this and sent a letter back to Senator BYRD saying he would do it. 
   In June of 1999, the President made a recess appointment of someone who had not even gone through the committee process, had not given all their information to the appropriate committee in order to become an ambassador. He went in and appointed him anyway. I felt that was a violation every bit as egregious as anything Ronald Reagan had done. 
   I took the same letter that Senator BYRD had sent to Ronald Reagan, and I sent it to President Clinton. 
   I got no response until finally he realized I was putting holds on all these nominations. On June 15, 1999, President Clinton wrote a letter saying:  
   I share your opinion that the understanding reached in 1985 between President Reagan and Senator Byrd cited in your letter remains a fair and constructive framework which my administration will follow.  
   I wrote a letter back thanking him and was very complimentary to him for taking this action. 
   A short while later--we were going into recess--along with 16 other Senators, I sent a letter to the President because we had heard rumors he was going to make several appointments, recess appointments. In fact, that is exactly what happened.

   Mr. INHOFE. I would like to say we made it very clear to this President on two of the recesses since that time, that if he did not live up to the standards as were put in the letter by Ronald Reagan and to which he agreed, that we would put holds on all these nominations. 
   Obviously, I had holds on these nominations. I have to admit it was not the Democrats; Republicans were not a lot of help to me at that time. They voted and overruled the hold that I had. 
   I would say the Senators who voted with me at that time to uphold the Constitution were Senators SHELBY,  MURKOWSKI, ALLARD, CRAIG, CRAPO, GRASSLEY, MCCONNELL, BUNNING, GRAMS of Minnesota, BURNS, SMITH of New Hampshire, GREGG, DOMENICI, HELMS--as I said, INHOFE--THURMOND, GRAMM of Texas, THOMAS, and ENZI. 
   In spite of the fact that that happened, they went ahead, the President went ahead and has continued to make recess appointments. The last time he did was during our August recess between the 3rd and 31st. He granted 17 recess appointments in just an arrogant defiance of the Senate's prerogative of advice and consent for confirmation purposes. 
   Even though it is kind of an empty threat now, I will do it --I am announcing tonight I am going to put a hold on all judicial nominations for the rest of his term, not that there are that many, because if we stopped right now, there would still be fewer vacancies than were there at the end of the Bush administration. But when we took office, we swore to uphold the Constitution and the Constitution is very specific. Today I am making this announcement that we are going to hold up all judicial nominations. I am doing exactly what Senator BYRD would do under the same circumstances. I yield the floor.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce legislation which will remedy a long outdated statute which impedes economic development for the Five Civilized Tribes of Oklahoma. For years tribes have been required to seek approval by the Secretary of the Interior before they may engage in contracts. Section 81, as it is known, provides that a contract `relating to Indian lands' is not valid unless it is approved by the Secretary. This statute was enacted with good intentions but unfortunately has outgrown its usefulness. Today this provision constitutes a confusing legal obstacle for tribal development. 
   Early last year, Senator BEN NIGHTHORSE CAMPBELL introduced comprehensive legislation to address the current problems associated with this statute. That legislation has passed the Senate and now awaits action before the House. However, the Five Tribes have often been treated with separate statutes unique to eastern Oklahoma. The legislation I propose simply corrects a technical oversight which affects only the Five Civilized Tribes of Oklahoma which is commonly referred to as Section 82a. Without this correction, the Five Civilized Tribes of Oklahoma would be the only tribes in the nation which may still be required to seek Secretarial approval for these contracts. I urge my colleagues to join me in correcting this oversight.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill that will modify the relationship between the Cherokee Nation in Oklahoma and the Shawnee Tribe in Oklahoma. These two tribes were joined together by an Agreement entered into between them on June 7, 1869. This bill will allow the Shawnee Tribe to have an independent government, elect its own officials and do those things it believes necessary to protect its language, culture and traditions. Since the two tribes will continue to operate in the same territory, the bill sets forth the conditions which shall govern those operations. 
   This legislation will have the effect of modifying the Cherokee-Shawnee agreement by allowing the Shawnee tribe to operate independently of the Cherokee Nation. The Shawnee Tribe will be governed by a separate constitution currently in existence. Membership of Shawnee Indians will continue to be permitted within the Cherokee Nation, although Shawnee Indians who so elect will become members of the Shawnee Tribe exclusively. 
   The bill also sets forth the manner in which the Shawnee Tribe will conduct its business within the Cherokee Nation and both Tribes have concurred in this legislation through tribal resolutions of their respective governing bodies. Although the Shawnee Tribe will be operating within the jurisdictional territory of the Cherokee Nation, the Shawnee people believe it is in their best interest to have a separate tribal governance to protect and enhance their culture, language and history and to pursue the goal of self-sufficiency for their own Tribe. 
   It is important to note that in changing the agreement between these two tribes there is no new tribal territory created nor is it proposed that any additional land be taken into trust for either Tribe as a result of the changes. The jurisdictional area of the tribes remains as before so that there are no impacts on communities within the Cherokee Nation. The proposal is also revenue neutral as to the United States. Tribal members of either tribe now receiving services will continue to receive those services as they have in the past. 
   The Shawnee Tribe was never terminated nor can the Bureau of Indian Affairs cause the Tribes to be separated through the Federal Acknowledgment Process. The Agreement of 1869 between the two tribes was ratified by the President and can only be amended by this proposed action of Congress. 
   In summary, this bill would recognize the long standing policy of the United States to respect the sovereignty of every tribe and to respect the desire of the Shawnee people to be governed independently of the Cherokee Nation so that Shawnee people can identify with their own Tribe and work to maintain their culture, language, heritage and traditions.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise to ask my friend, the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, for clarification on the language in the Defense appropriations conference report concerning the Crusader program. The language states that fifty percent of the funding for the Crusader program cannot be obligated or expended until thirty days after the Secretary of Defense submits the Congress a comprehensive Analysis of Alternatives (AOA) on the Crusader program. I would ask the Chairman, is this language intended to delay the continuing development of the Crusader program?

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I believe that it is not the intent of the conferees to require that the Department of Defense prepare a weapon system analysis AOA as required for the Department of Defense Directives for system milestone reviews. Instead, I believe what is needed is a quicklook analysis that evaluates the capabilities and costs of Crusader and comparable weapons system alternatives to support the Army's Transformation Initiative to include the counterattack corps and brigade combat teams.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, after watching my colleagues and the depth of concern and personal passion they have at the loss of PAUL COVERDELL, I want to tell them of an experience I had last night. Something came to me when I was at a dinner and we had just heard the news. It was the seventh Beatitude:  
   Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the sons of God.  
   It occurred to me that this was really PAUL COVERDELL; he was the ultimate peacemaker. It was impossible for PAUL to walk into a roomful of people, whether Democrats, Republicans, liberals, conservatives--hostility, anxiety, it all subsided when PAUL came in. 
   I remember when I was first elected from the House into the Senate in 1994. PAUL had just arrived here. He didn't give the first impression as being a dynamic person, even an articulate person. You had to know him and know him well. But after you did, he was unlike anyone else we have been exposed to here in this body. 
   I thought last night about all the things we deal with here in the Senate. It was articulated in Matthew 9, starting with verse 35. It says:  
   Jesus went through all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and sickness. When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.  
   This is kind of the way we are. We are dealing with the problems of poverty, the problems of crime--a multitude of problems. So somebody has to be the one to take on those responsibilities. 
   I read the following verse:  
   Then he [Jesus] said to his disciples, ``The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out laborers into his harvest field.''  
   When I, last night, thought of that verse, I thought, really, PAUL COVERDELL is the laborer who was sent, was raised up to deal with these problems, and all the problems we deal with on a daily basis, in his own unique way. So I would just say our prayer for PAUL COVERDELL right now is the last verse of the 23d Psalm:  
   Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the rest of my days; and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.  
   Amen.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am pleased to speak today in favor of passage of the Disaster Mitigation Act of 1999. As the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee with jurisdiction over FEMA, I have been working on this legislation for the last couple of years. Senator GRAHAM and I introduced this legislation last fall and have been working diligently on it ever since. We can both attest to this process being long and arduous, with many unforeseen pitfalls. However, the final result has been a piece of legislation that while changing the scope of disaster assistance, continues to assure that FEMA will have the resources and the capability to deliver disaster assistance when called upon. 
   As we all know, the Federal government, through FEMA, has been there to help people and their communities deal with the aftermath of disasters for over a generation. As chairman of it's oversight Subcommittee, I want to ensure that FEMA will continue to respond and help people in need for generations to come. 
   Unfortunately, this goal is becoming increasingly difficult since the costs of disaster recovery have spiraled out of control. For every major disaster Congress is forced to appropriate additional funds through Supplemental Emergency Spending Bills, another of which we will be discussing at some point later this year. This not only plays havoc with the budget and forces us to spend funds which would have gone to other pressing needs, but sets up unrealistic expectations of what the federal government can and should do after a disaster. 
   For instance, following the Oklahoma City tornadoes on May 3, 1999, there was an estimated $900 million in damage, with a large portion of that in federal disaster assistance. In the aftermath of hurricane Floyd in North Carolina, estimates of $1 billion or more in damage have been discussed. This problem is not just isolated to Oklahoma City or North Carolina. In the period between fiscal years 1994 and 1998, FEMA disaster assistance and relief costs grew from $8.7 billion to $19 billion. That marks a $10.3 billion increase in disaster assistance in just five years. To finance these expenditures, we have been forced to find over $12 billion in rescissions. 
   The Bill we are passing today will address this problem from two different directions. First, it authorizes a Predisaster Hazard Mitigation Program, which assists people in preparing for disaster before they happen. Second, it provides a number of cost-saving measures to help control the costs of disaster assistance. 
   In our bill, we are authorizing Project Impact, FEMA's natural disaster mitigation program. Project Impact authorizes the use of small grants to local communities to give them funds and technical assistance to mitigate against disasters before they occur; but this is not just a federal give-away program. Local communities are required to have a demonstrated public-private partnership before they can become a Project Impact community. 
   Too often, we think of disaster assistance only after a disaster has occurred. For the very first time, we are authorizing a program to think about preventing disaster-related damage prior to the disaster. We believe that by spending these small amounts in advance of a disaster, we will save the federal government money in the long-term. However, it is important to note that we are not authorizing this program in perpetuity. The program, as adopted, is set to expire in 2003. If Project Impact is successful, we will have the appropriate opportunity to review its work and make a determination on whether to continue the program. 
   This forward thinking approach is revolutionary in terms of the way the federal government responds to a disaster. We all know it is more cost effective to prevent damage than to respond after the fact. I should note that in my state of Oklahoma, which has recently been hit by severe flooding, one of the affected communities, my home town of Tulsa, was a Project Impact community. While the community suffered some damage, the effects could have been much more severe had the community not undertaken preventative mitigation measures.  
   In passing this bill, we are also allowing states to keep a larger percentage of their federal disaster funds for state mitigation projects. Under current law, states can only retain up to 15 percent of their post disaster assistance funds for state-wide mitigation programs. We are now increasing that percentage to 20 percent. Too often states have run into the program of too many mitigation projects, with too little resources. 
   For example, in Oklahoma, the state used its share of disaster funds to provide a tax rebate to the victims of the May 1999 tornadoes who, when rebuilding their homes, build a ``safe room'' into their home. Because of limited funding, this assistance is only available to those who were unfortunate enough to lose everything they owned. The ``safe room'' program in Oklahoma is a prime example of giving states more flexibility in determining their own mitigation priorities and giving them the financial assistance to follow through with their plans. 
   An additional problem we remedy with the increase is the lack of comprehensive state-wide mitigation plans. Under current law, states are required to submit mitigation plans to FEMA, at which time they are routinely approved. However, as a condition of receipt of increased funding, states are going to have to do a better job at bridging the gap between state and local mitigation plans by developing comprehensive mitigation plans so that in the aftermath of a disaster, states know what their most vulnerable areas are and can take appropriate preventative measures. 
   While we are attempting to re-define the way in which we respond to natural disaster, we must also look to curb the rising cost of post-disaster related assistance. The intent of the original Stafford Act was to provide federal assistance after States and local communities had exhausted all their existing resources. As I said earlier, we have lost sight of this intent. 
   To meet our cost saving goal, we are making significant changes to FEMA's Public Assistance (PA) Program. One of the most significant changes in the PA Program focuses on the use of insurance. FEMA is currently developing an insurance rule to require States and local government to maintain private or self-insurance in order to qualify for the PA Program. We applaud their efforts and are providing them with with some parameters we expect them to follow in 
   developing any insurance rule. 
   While FEMA's progress in this area is commendable, it has come at the considerable opposition from States and local governments who fear the impact of any new insurance regulation. Instead of ignoring the concerns of the stakeholders, we have sought to work with them and bring their views to the table early in the regulatory process. As FEMA continues its work towards an insurance regulation, States and local governments are now assured that the final rule will encompass their concerns. 
   Second, we are providing FEMA with the ability to estimate the cost of repairing or rebuilding projects. Under current law, FEMA is required to stay in the field and monitor the rebuilding of public structures. By requiring FEMA to stay afield for years after the disaster, we run up the administrative cost of projects. Allowing them to estimate the cost of repairs and close out the project will bring immediate assistance to the State or local community and save the Federal government money. 
   In all, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects our bill to save approximately $238 million over five years. I personally feel this is an underestimate. CBO, because of budget rules, is unable to take into account any savings that occur outside the initial five-year window. Yet, CBO says in its analysis that long-term savings are likely as a result of the predisaster mitigation measures included in the bill. CBO also says it cannot quantify the savings associated with the implementation of any future insurance rule. Yet, common sense tells us that if public buildings have some level of private insurance, federal spending under the Public Assistance Program will be reduced. 
   Mr. President, we have spent months working closely with other Senators, FEMA, the States, local communities, and other stakeholders to produce a bill that gives FEMA the increased ability to respond to disasters, while assuring States and local communities that the federal government will continue to meet its commitments. Our bill has the endorsement of the National League of Cities, the National Emergency Managers Association , and FEMA. 
   In closing, I want to thank Senators GRAHAM, SMITH, and BAUCUS for their help and the leadership they have taken on this important issue. I would also like to thank Senators VOINOVICH, GRASSLEY, DEWINE, and BOND for their support of this legislation. Without their help, input, and insight this legislation would be little more than an idea. I look forward to continuing to work with them as this bill moves to conference to make this legislation a reality.

   Mr. INHOFE. I appreciate the Senator bringing this matter to the Committee's attention and working with us to come up with a clear policy on PNP irrigators. As he knows, during the mark-up in February, the Committee adopted the Crapo/Baucus/Bennett amendment to solve this situation. However, as we later learned, the amendment was insufficient in the eyes of FEMA to resolve this issue. I think that the language contained in the legislation unequivocally addresses the issue and there can be no ambiguity in the wishes of the Senate concerning FEMA's policy affecting private nonproit irrigators in the states. Therefore, I reiterate my commitment to enacting legislation that creates equity for PNP irrigators in the implementation of FEMA policies.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding. 
   I agree with the statement of the very distinguished Senator from Montana. Reasonable people can disagree, and they can use the same statistics and come to different conclusions. We do that every day in this Chamber. 
   I wonder, after listening to the debate--whether it is Montana, Minnesota, or whatever the State being  represented by the other side of the aisle--how Montana could be so different from Oklahoma. 
   Eleven months ago, I did a tour of very small areas in Oklahoma--Shattuck, Boise, and Gage--places you probably never heard of, with very small populations. These people are not wealthy. They are small family farmers and ranchers. In that part of Oklahoma, they normally have three sources of income. It is either small grain or cattle or oil. When all three are down, we have real devastation out there. We have a lot of family farms that are not even making enough money to break even. 
   I remember going out there and talking about the various agricultural programs. I talked about crop insurance. I talked about transition payments. But when the subject of estate taxes came up, they forgot about all of the other Government programs having to do with agriculture. They said: It would be the greatest thing in the world for us to be able to survive as a family institution and pass this on to the next generation. 
   These people live day to day. They are not wealthy people. They have to really save to buy halfway modern farm equipment. They say: The greatest single thing you could do for us would be to allow us to pass this on to the next generation. 
   I think that dwelling on the small percentage of total estates subject to the death tax isn't really an adequate reflection of the damage inflicted by the death tax, which is about 1.9 percent out of the approximately 2.3 million deaths each year, and 4.3 file a return; that is, 98,900. Not all of these are taxable. There is an effect in Oklahoma on small businesses and farms. 
   If you look at the ``1995 White House Conference on Small Business Issue Handbook''--we had several people there as part of that group who made this handbook--more than 70 percent of all the family businesses do not survive through the second generation, and fully 87 percent do not make it to the third generation. 
   I ask the Senator from Wyoming about the source of some of these figures which we hear, such as the loss of $40 billion in tax revenues. I don't know where they come from. I certainly question them. 
   The current Federal death tax accounted for only $23 billion in 1998, or a meager 1.4 percent of $1.7 trillion in total Federal receipts, a level that has remained fairly stable over the years. 
   I suggest there are two factors that are not being considered. One is the cost of compliance and one is the economic impact. 
   There are some studies which illustrate that we could actually end up increasing tax revenues by altogether eliminating the death tax.

   Mr. INHOFE. After going through that rather lengthy amendment of the Senator from Illinois, there should be a little relief that this amendment should not be controversial. This amendment takes the amount of money that was increased--increased--to the National Endowment for the  Arts and transfers that to a fund for Indian diabetes. It is the Indian Health Service for Diabetes. 
   Probably the least understood illness in this country is that of diabetes among Indians. It is a chronic disease. It has no cure. There are two different types. Type II is what we are addressing, diabetes among adults. Among American Indians, 12.2 percent of those over age 19 have diabetes. This is the highest risk of any ethnic group. 
   One Pima tribe in Arizona has the highest rate of diabetes in the world, about 50 percent of the tribe between the ages of 30 and 64. In Oklahoma, a lot of people are not aware, during the 1990 census, preliminary figures show the largest percentage of Indian population and the largest number of Indians of any of the 50 States. We spent a lot of time talking to our Indian population and looking at the problems that are peculiar to that population. 
   Not long ago, I spent some time at an Indian hospital in Talihina, OK, operated by the Choctaws. Case studies include one young male patient I talked to, 20 years of age, who already has been partially blinded with diabetes. He is already suffering from renal failure. He has a 40-year-old father who has gone blind. They recently had to amputate his leg, and probably the other one will go next. In one family, the father and mother both have type II diabetes. The mother is going to start dialysis next month. The son, who is 20 years old, has eye and kidney damage. The daughter is 17 years old and suffered a stroke, requiring weekly medical care. She has a 3-year life expectancy. The average life expectancy of the American Indian patient with diabetes is only 45 to 50 years. 
   It is very peculiar to the Indian population. It is very clear to see our money is better spent there and we can actually try to do something through research, through medication, through programs, to get the Indian population where they can be treated, where they know how to deal with infections they don't know how to deal with now. 
   It is unacceptable that, nationwide, 12.2 percent of the Indian adult population has type II diabetes. There is no cure. It is not a lot of money but will go a long way toward saving lives, not just in Oklahoma but in the Indian population all over the country.

   Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator from Washington for his comments. I do not agree, obviously. I do think, though, I find two reasons to disagree with his arguments: One, to use percentages, as to what percentage this represents that would be decreased from the NEA as opposed to increase for diabetes because of the seriousness of this; the second thing is why carry this into a discussion and a debate on the merits of the National Endowment for the Arts. 
   If we were to do that, I would be glad to join in that debate. In fact, I voted many times to defund the National Endowment for the Arts. However, that is not this amendment. Right now they have, from last year, $97 million, the NEA, and they are talking about not keeping it level but increasing it by $7.3 million. I am saying the $7.3 million is going to end up saving lives, particularly lives of Indians with diabetes, as opposed to rewarding and increasing the appropriation to the NEA. 
   I think we need to look at it in that light. As I said, it is just incredible for  people to comprehend the seriousness of this affliction among the Indian population. Yes, I am prejudiced. Yes, the State of Oklahoma has the largest number of Indians of all 50 States, and there are a lot of States that do not have that concern. I can tell you right now, we are going to do everything we can. 
   What the Senator from Washington says is true. We have increased it by some $30 million and it is going to be increased again over the next 4 years. However, every incremental increase is going to have a very positive effect on the research and the treatment of the Indians with diabetes. So I am going 
   to ask for the yeas and nays on this for a vote. 
   Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, this is a very simple, straightforward, easy-to-understand amendment. It merely takes $7.3 million and puts it into the Indian Health Services for diabetes. It does take that out of the National Endowment for the Arts, but all it does is take it out of the increase. Last year they had $97 million. They are increasing it this year to $105 million. All I am asking is to take that $7 million, instead of increasing the National Endowment for the Arts, and to put it into the Indian Health Services' diabetes program. 
   I am prejudiced because I come from the State that has in terms of percentages, the largest Indian population. However, I can tell you this, that of the national Indian population, 12.2 percent of them have diabetes because of the environment in which they live. It is an unhealthy environment. There are cases where they have all kinds of infections that set in where they are unable to keep from having amputations. So it is a very serious thing. 
   You will hear from the other side an argument that says we are hurting the National Endowment for the Arts. I want Senators to remember, when you cast your vote, this does not take any money away from the allocation they had last year; it merely freezes that allocation in for the coming year. Even with the increase of $30 million that is currently in this program, that still is less than 10 percent of the amount of money that is spent for research on cancer and AIDS.

   Mr. INHOFE. It is exactly the sort of arrangement which you have outlined that the language in Title III is intended to promote. It is the committee's hope that additional government facilities will pursue such initiatives in order to increase their efficiency. The ARMS act was intended to breathe new life into facilities for which the Army might otherwise have less use. It is a model program and we are trying to incorporate those aspects of the ARMS program which make sense in a government owned, government operated industrial facility. This is indeed a win/win situation for business, for the Department of Defense, and for the American taxpayer.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of Senator LANDRIEU. I look forward to working with her and others on this important issue in conference. As you noted, as chairman of the Readiness and Management Support Subcommittee I have spent considerable time looking into this matter and I believe that this facility is essential to the readiness of the Navy and Marine Corps. 
   I understand the concern raised by some that a failure to transfer the western land as requested by the President would frustrate the long-term goal of rebuilding relations between the Navy and the people of Vieques and resuming live-fire training on the island. However, I recently visited Vieques and spoke with some of the local residents who were not as enthused by the proposed transfer of land as the Governors's office has led us to believe. Furthermore, they asked that if any land is transferred, that it be transferred directly to the people of Vieques rather than to the Commonwealth Government. However, I understand that this may not represent the views of all residents of the island and I will continue to look very seriously at this issue during the conference and will continue to speak with the residents of Vieques before I make a final decision. 
   I also want to ensure that whatever approach we take, we do not undermine the chances of the resumption of live-fire by providing a reverse incentive. I strongly support the Navy and Marine Corps' goal of resuming live-fire training in Vieques. As stated by the senior officers of the Department of Defense, this training is critical to our readiness. I will continue to speak with these officers on the issue, including the impact of not transferring the western land, as we proceed through  conference. I am committed to resolving this matter in a way that maximizes our opportunity to provide our military personnel with the training they need to ensure they are not unnecessarily put at risk when they are deployed into harm's way.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am pleased to come to the Senate floor today to introduce a resolution to declare the week of September 24-30 ``National Amputee Awareness Week.'' When passed, this resolution will designate a specific time around which the Nation's amputee community can rally. Too often, we lose sight of many of those who are right in front of our very eyes. By dedicating this week to their cause, we will make certain that we no longer forget both the accomplishments and problems of the large and diverse amputee community. 
   The loss of limb can strike anyone, at any time. Each year 156,000 people lose a limb. This equates to 13,000 amputations per month, 2,996 amputations per week, 428 amputations per day and 18 amputations per hour in the United States alone. People from all backgrounds have had to deal with the hardships associated with amputation. Over half of amputations in the United States occur among elderly citizens as a result of vascular deficiencies. From childhood to middle adulthood, the most common cause of limb loss is from traumatic injuries. Other major causes can include primary bone malignancies and congenital limb defects. 
   Although there have been great strides in prosthetic research, many people are still limited by the financial burdens associated with acquiring an artificial limb. A new prosthetic device can cost between $8,000 and $70,000. These limbs must often be replaced every few years, adding to the burden placed on an amputee. Even when insurance does cover the cost of these new prosthetic devices, it is often a one-time reimbursement. This leaves the amputee to deal with any further care or replacement devices that are necessary. 
   The prosthetic device is not the only cost incurred by the amputee. There are many secondary factors that must be considered. Over 25,000 people are readmitted to the hospital each year due to complications resulting from their amputation. Amputees must deal with both the physical and emotional consequences of limb loss. Physical therapy must be undertaken to learn how to perform the most basic tasks with a new, foreign limb. They must often also look for alternate occupations once limb loss has made their current occupation infeasible. As a result, amputees must often undergo counseling to help them come to terms emotionally with their altered lifestyle. 
   According to the Amputee Coalition of America, amputees hope to one day see the elimination of barriers to their full participation in all aspects of life. In addition, they hope to see improvements in artificial limbs and prosthetic research. Finally they hope to see improved outcomes for amputees in the areas of chronic post-amputation pain and depression. 
   There are countless locally-based organizations in the United States who provide services to amputees with very little recognition. One of those such organizations is located in Oklahoma. The Limbs of Life Foundation is a nationwide non-profit organization established in 1995 in Oklahoma City to meet the needs of the amputee community. They do this in part by providing limbs at a free or discounted rate to individuals who would not normally be able to afford such devices. To date they have provided over 4,700 amputees with a prosthetic limb. 
   However, Limb for Life's efforts are not limited to limb provision. They also seek to raise awareness of the amputee cause. Each year this foundation holds a bike ride from Oklahoma City to Austin, Texas to raise funds for their efforts. This year's ``Project 50-2000'' will provide funds to purchase limbs for those in need and will bring national attention to the amputee community. This is the type of effort that National Amputee Awareness Week is designed to spotlight. 
   Mr. President, declaring the week of September 24-30 ``National Amputee Awareness Week'' would serve many purposes. At this point in time amputees have only a fragmented network through which to address their concerns. This week would provide them with a point of cohesion during which all amputees can come together in response to and in recognition of their common cause. Not only will amputees benefit from this week, the general population would also have the opportunity to be informed of the unique needs and problems faced by the amputee community. The amputee community and the general population would both gain from increased interaction that this week would bring. 
   In closing, I hope all of my colleagues will join me in creating this important awareness and outreach opportunity for the amputee community.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, this amendment addresses a subject with which we are all very familiar. In the early fifties, we put together a very good and effective Federal program to reimburse the States for revenue that was lost because of Federal activities--whether it was a military base or Indian reservation--anytime those properties were taken off the tax rolls. Yet that particular type of activity brought in additional students. It was set up to reimburse the local school districts. 
   It is called impact aid. It is one of the oldest Federal education programs dating back to the fifties. The rationale for compensation is Federal activity deprives local school districts of the ability to collect sufficient property and sales tax, even though the school district is obligated to provide free public education.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, my language would actually fully fund impact aid to all school districts in the country by fiscal year 2004. The effect it would have this year would be approximately $78.2 million. In discussing this with both the majority and the minority, I realized the offset we are suggesting; that is, to take it out of administrative overhead, is something that has already been done. I recognize that once they get to conference, they are going to have to shuffle these things around and see what actually can be done. 
   While I recognize that in the House and Senate bills there is an increase in impact aid, it does not have anything in the future that will reach full funding. I have a list here. Not one of the 50 States is 100 percent. Yet these are funds taken from the States due to Federal activities. 
   What I would like, perhaps with the understanding and the agreement of the chairman of the committee and the ranking member, is to go ahead and adopt this amendment which says, in the 4-year period, impact aid will be fully funded; however, there is to be an understanding it has to go into conference along with some other requests to see what actually can be worked out. 
   I want to have a colloquy with the chairman of the committee so we can have this understanding. The State of Pennsylvania is actually at 11 percent of being fully funded, which is not nearly as well as Oklahoma, which is at 37 percent. This is something that is an equity issue. It is not a distinction of 50 percent or 60 percent of full impact aid funding or 10 percent. It is an equity issue.

   Mr. INHOFE. Let me reclaim the floor, if I may, and respond to the Senator from Iowa. 
   For the first 30 years of this program, it was fully funded. I do not believe the Senator was in the Chamber when I first started talking about it. This is a reimbursement back to the States of money they have been deprived of as a result of Federal activity. That is a distinction between this and other programs. 
   For the Senator's State of Iowa, for example, you are getting 20 percent of what you would get if it were fully funded. It is an equity issue. Certainly, I have the understanding from the chairman--and I talked to the Senator from Nevada--and I recognize that when this gets into conference, there is going to be a problem weaving and sorting. But I cannot imagine any other program that would have a higher priority than this, to ultimately say it is our intent to get this fully funded back to where it was prior to the 1980s. 
   For that reason, I believe it has merit above some of the other programs that are coming. This is a reimbursement we agreed to back in the 1950s.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr President, I am pleased to come to the floor of the Senate today to speak in support of the Enzi amendment to the Labor-HHS Appropriations bill. As my colleagues know, the Enzi amendment is necessary to prevent the Occupational Safety and Hazard Administration from enacting a costly regulation without adequate scientific understanding of the very problem they hope to prevent. 
   As chairman of the Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Clean Air, I have seen first hand how this administration refuses to conduct the proper scientific study of regulations they propose to promulgate. The reason, I fear, its rather simple: the scientific evidence does not support their political agenda. Based on my observations, the rule of thumb with this administration is ``if the scientific evidence does not support the goal, ignore the evidence.'' In this instance, we've been asking OSHA to do due diligence concerning the science behind this rule for five years. 
   I am not necessarily opposed to an ergonomics rule, I am simply opposed to this rule because it is not backed by sound science. I find it very interesting that the National Academy of Sciences is set to release its findings on ergonomics early next year. Why then the rush. The answer is obvious, OSHA fears the science will not support its proposal and wants to rush this into effect before the NAS finishes its work. 
   The speed at which OSHA is moving on this regulation is unprecedented; this is the single largest regulatory effort to date and OSHA appears to be bending over backwards to avoid congressional scrutiny, which of course is not new for this administration. In addition to dodging congressional scrutiny, OSHA is ignoring the over 7,000 public comments concerning the rule. 
   In addition to the process related flaws with this rule, another problem is its unrealistic cost estimate. OSHA estimates the rule will cost approximately $4.2 billion per year which is dramatically lower than all other estimates. For instance, the Small Business Administration estimates the cost is $60 billion per year or 15 times that of OSHA's estimate. The disparity of these figures alone should give plenty of reason to rethink this rule. 
   Yet another reason to oppose this rule is the effect of the rule on Medicare/Medicaid patients. OSHA has repeatedly stated that business should simply pass on the cost of compliance to consumers. Now, as I mentioned above, conservatively that cost will be in excess of $4.2 billion annually. Some of these ``businesses'' OSHA believes should pass on the cost of the rule are hospitals, nursing homes, home health care agencies, and other Medicare/Medicaid dependent health care providers. No where in the rule, has OSHA mentioned how these health care providers should deal with the newly imposed costs. They cannot simply pass on the cost as OSHA has stated so cavalierly. 
   Medicare/Medicaid providers in my state have been very clear about the existing problems associated with recent cuts in Medicare/Medicaid. I can only image what this new burden will mean for our health care providers. 
   In all fairness, OSHA has apparently thought about the cost to Medicare/Medicaid because they have done an estimate on the first year compliance cost of the rule. They estimate it will cost about $526 million for nursing and personal care facilities. Now, I don't know about my colleagues, but from the stories I've heard from my constituents, that $526 million could be much better spent providing care to patients. If OSHA implements this rule, we are setting the stage for a greater health care crisis in the country. Are health care providers going to be forced to choose between complying with OSHA regulations or providing health care for patients? I, for one, hope this is not the case. 
   Another of the significant problems with this rule is its vagueness. In fact, the rule's lack of clarity has prompted the Washington Post, clearly not a mouthpiece of conservative thinking, to say, that the rule is too vague and will cause problems. 
   There are many unanswered questions that OSHA readily admits it cannot answer and in all probability will never be able to answer. Among these now unanswered questions are: What is a definable ergonomics hazard? How can these undefined hazards be fixed? How will these undefined hazards be enforced? 
   Since OSHA cannot determine what the potential hazards are or how they can be fixed, it admits that actions that employers take to remedy supposed problems may actually make those problems worse. Since OSHA itself does not know what the extent of the problems are, it should come as no surprise that this is the only rule OSHA has ever put forward that does not provide employers some guidance for implementing appropriate measures to prevent injuries. Instead, the rule, as drafted, only sets forth penalties for employers if they fail to remedy these undefinable dangers. 
   Given these uncertainties, it is clear that the rule is flawed and should be stopped as is our prerogative. We have no choice. We must reject this rule and demand that OSHA conduct its due diligence before promulgating another.  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting the Enzi amendment.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, S. 2522 contains $934.1 million for Plan Colombia, a counternarcotics initiative. A portion of that is earmarked for the investigations of human rights abuses. Certainly a part of the drug culture that this bill is attempting to address is the abduction of individuals by paramilitary groups who either hold their hostages for ransom or use the abduction as a means of intimidation against law enforcement. Frequently we hear of witnesses, prosecutors and judges being taken from their homes, offices or off the street in broad daylight in an attempt to stop the prosecution of drug kingpins. However, innocent civilians, not involved in the war on drugs, are targets as well. The amendment I am introducing addresses the latter. 
   My colleagues may not be aware but currently there are three American citizens who are being held hostage by FARC, a narco-guerilla group in Colombia. Many have been involved in obtaining their release but the 7 plus years of their captivity has complicated those efforts. 
   On the evening of January 31, 1993, a group of armed guerrillas entered the village of Pucuro Panama. Once control of the village had been secured, the guerrillas went to the homes of the Mankins, Riches, Tenenoffs, three missionary families with New Tribes Mission who were invited to live in Pucuro by village leaders to teach reading and writing and provide medical care to villagers. David Mankins, Mark Rich and Rick Tenenoff were tied up and their wives instructed to prepare small packages of clothing for them. The guerrillas then forced the men toward a trail that leads to the Colombian border. 
   Shortly after the kidnaping, FARC made contact with New Tribes Mission, claimed credit for the abduction and demanded a $5 million ransom. The mission refused to pay the ransom and shortly thereafter contact ceased. Since then there has been many rumors and reports, but not proof on their whereabouts. 
   David Mankins, Mark Rich and Rick Tenenoff have the dubious distinction of being the longest held American hostages. Their families have lived the last 7 years without knowing whether they are dead or alive. 
   My amendment condemns the kidnaping; urges members of the European Community to assist in the safe return of these men by including in any dialogue with them the objectives of the safe return of these missionaries; and appeals to the United Nations Commission to pressure FARC to resolve this situation. 
   I am proposing this amendment for a couple reasons: first, FARC has aggressively courted a dialogue with several in the European community. In fact, I understand that in the upcoming weeks there will be representatives of FARC in Europe looking for support of their ``revolution.'' I fear any recognition would be viewed as legitimizing the illegal and cowardly activities of FARC and thereby compound efforts to either gain release of these Americans to learn of their fate. 
   Secondly, Dr. Larry Maxwell of Patterson Baptist Church in Patterson, New York has begun a 240 mile walk to Washington, D.C. to bring attention to the tragic situation of these families. Dr. Maxwell will culminate his walk at the Capitol this coming Monday, June 26th, where he will be joined by the families of the kidnapped men. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment because these American citizens can easily be forgotten and we must not do that. Dave, Mark and Rick needs our prayers and their families need to know that their loved ones have not been abandoned. Finally, we need to encourage all those who have worked during the last 7 years to bring an end to this horrific ordeal to continue their effort.

   Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator for yielding. I want to commend the chairman of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee for developing this legislation. I understand the constraints of the allocation given the subcommittee and I believe he and the gentleman from New Jersey have done a great job in developing a bill the entire Senate can support. 
   As a general aviation pilot I also want to specifically thank the Senator for his recognition throughout the legislation of the role of general aviation in the national air transportation system. As the report correctly noted, ``the FAA should not let the perfect be the enemy of the good'' and although for example the WAAS program is struggling, the legislation notes the number of satellite based applications that can be deployed here and now to enhance aviation safety. 
   As you move to conference, would the Chairman be willing to work with me on language for inclusion in the Statement of Managers to enhance direction to the FAA in this particular regard? Increasing the number of GPS approaches, developing databases and GPS corridors through Class B airspace will immediately improve safety for thousands of general aviation pilots.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have not a speech but a story to tell. The name of that story could very well be ``What Would Have Happened To Frankie Vee?'' Now, they say confession is good for the soul. I confess that during the Memorial Day recess a couple weeks ago I did not work during the whole recess. I spent some time with my family, with my wife, with my daughter Katie, her husband Brad, their baby, and some of the other kids, and we went to south Texas where we own some property. There is a little  town down there called Port Isabel. There is a restaurant there that none of the tourists go to. It is just the local people who go there. It is right there on the channel that goes out ultimately to the gulf. 
   There is a guy down there who sings. You sit down and you have dinner. He has these machines he turns on; they make music. He has a microphone, and he sings. He has a beautiful voice. The reason I like it is he sings the kind of songs I know such as ``Your Cheatin Heart'' and ``Lord, Help Me, Jesus,'' and songs like that. While he is singing, his wife sways to the music with her eyes closed. It is just a beautiful setting there. 
   This was going on when all of a sudden a light went on, and I do not know how this happened, but I was looking at this guy, who is just an ordinary person--he is about my age. He has gone through tough times in his life like I have. He has made 
   money; he has lost money; but he is just a very typical American. He is someone who has to obey the laws, has to work hard, and has to pay taxes. What occurred to me was that if Frankie Vee had blatantly and knowingly and wrongfully committed a crime like Kenneth Bacon, blatantly and knowingly and willingly committed a crime, he would not be singing there and spreading joy in the hearts of many while his wife is swaying. He would be serving time in a Federal penitentiary. 
   I am not outraged; I am not mad; and I am not feeling any anxiety about this. I guess the best way to characterize my feelings after the last 7 1/2 years of this administration using the Justice Department to protect its friends and to punish its enemies is just something that I feel numb about. I am proud of two of the mainstream media--only two--that have been willing to write about these things. And that is Fox News and the Washington Times. 
   So in this case, we have talked about comparing the crime that was committed by Kenneth Bacon with other crimes that were committed--and I am going to talk about that in just a minute--by other people in other administrations. But what occurred to me was that every citizen out here, whether in Wyoming or Oklahoma, has to obey the law and has to be punished under the law if that person disobeys the law, and that he would be prosecuted if there was justification for prosecution and then would be punished accordingly--except in this administration. 
   On Thursday, May 25, which was the eve of the Memorial Day recess when we left for about a week, the Clinton administration perpetrated another outrage to add to its long trail of operations, I guess you would say. In the face of the Pentagon inspector general's firm conclusion that Kenneth Bacon and Clifford Bernath violated the Privacy Act and broke the law and committed a crime, the Secretary of Defense announced that he would do nothing to hold these men accountable for their actions. And this neatly follows the earlier decision of the Justice Department not to prosecute after engaging in a 2-year coverup. 
   Now, as I have said before, this case has broad implications for what has been done to the rule of law and to the concept of honesty and integrity in Government over the past 7 1/2 years. Above all else, the systemic undermining of these time-honored principles constitutes the true and lasting legacy of the Clinton and Gore administration. Time after time after time, again and again, the Justice Department and Janet Reno have used that Department to protect the President's political friends and to punish the President's political enemies. 
   Today, as a result of this case, there are millions of Federal employees who are on notice that the information contained in their confidential Government personnel records cannot be protected from politically motivated disclosures. They are on notice that the Privacy Act can be violated with impunity even when the perpetrators are caught redhanded. 
   In an additional outrage, we find that the administration now wants the taxpayers to pay the legal bills for those two individuals during this process. 
   This is a letter we have uncovered, after it had been covered up, that the Office of the General Counsel is writing to Mr. Kaser, U.S. Department of Justice, requesting that the taxpayers pay the legal fees of Kenneth Bacon and Clifford Bernath. I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of my

   Mr. INHOFE. Let's quickly recap what happened. In March of 1998, about 8 weeks into the Monica Lewinsky scandal, the Pentagon public affairs director, Kenneth Bacon, got a phone call from Jane Mayer, who Jane Mayer was a long-time Clinton supporter and friend of the Clinton administration. She was an old friend of Kenneth Bacon. They worked together on the Wall Street Journal for years before. And she got a letter. She was then working on a story for the New Yorker magazine. Mayer informed Bacon that she had evidence that a key witness in this Presidential scandal, Linda Tripp, had been arrested for larceny as a teenager. Tripp was and still is a civilian employee of the Federal Government at the Pentagon. Mayer wanted to know how Tripp had replied to question No. 21 on her security clearance form, asking if she had ever been arrested. If she had answered no, which Linda Tripp did, then public disclosure of this information in conjunction with the new evidence that Mayer said she had would have been clearly damaging to Tripp's credibility and her reputation and would discredit her as someone who was bringing charges against the President. 
   Soon thereafter, it was discovered that Tripp's teenage arrest was the result of a juvenile prank perpetrated against her. The judge in the case told her in a laughing way that it was a funny trick and her record would be clear. Nevertheless, Mayer's story was published and the damage to Tripp was done. She was discredited forever. 
   I would characterize that as saying Mr. Bacon had conspired with Ms. Mayer to implement ``a scheme to defame and destroy the public image of Linda Tripp with the intent to influence, obstruct, and impede the conduct and outcome of pending investigations and prosecutions.'' That is exactly what the two of them did to Linda Tripp. 
   The reason I am reading this is because that is the exact language of 20 years ago when Chuck Colson committed this same crime at the beginning of the Watergate era. The court said Colson implemented ``a scheme to defame and destroy the public image of Daniel Ellsberg with the intent to influence, obstruct, and impede the conduct and outcome of pending investigations and prosecutions.'' 
   That is exactly the same thing Kenneth Bacon did. The actions of Bacon and Bernath immediately became the subject of the Pentagon IG investigation to determine if they had violated the Privacy Act which is designed to prevent the disclosure of confidential information on Government employees. 
   The IG quickly concluded that, yes, indeed, they did violate the Privacy Act. In July of 1998, the IG made a criminal referral to the Justice Department so the case could be prosecuted, but nobody knew it. The fact the IG had concluded the report was covered up by the Justice Department for 2 years. The Justice Department sat on the case for 2 years doing 
   nothing--a classic foot-dragging, stonewalling Clinton coverup. 
   Finally, in March of this year, they quietly announced no one would be prosecuted in this case. And they call it a Department of Justice. The Department said it concluded Bacon and Bernath ``didn't intend to break the law'' when they made the disclosure of the Tripp information, as if that is ever a legitimate excuse for anything. 
   I suggest if the Senator who is occupying the chair were driving down a Wyoming highway at 100 miles an hour and were pulled over by a highway patrol and he said, ``I didn't intend to break the law,'' that everything would be fine. 
   This is how the process works. Once the Justice Department refuses to prosecute, even after a criminal referral for prosecution has taken place, the very least that can happen to a person is the boss of the individual who is offending may take some kind of personnel action. 
   It was turned over to the Secretary of Defense, William Cohen. He was  charged with evaluating the conclusions of the IG report and taking any action he deemed appropriate, such as firing both of them. Keep in mind, this should not even have happened. This should not have taken place because by this time, there should have been a criminal prosecution. 
   This brings us to 2 weeks ago, Thursday, when Cohen announced what he deemed appropriate. He sent Bacon and Bernath personal letters expressing disappointment in their actions, making a clear point they were not letters of reprimand and will not be placed in their personnel records. It is not even a slap on the wrist. In other words, he did nothing. He did not fire anyone. He did not fine anyone. He did not suspend anyone. He took the IG's conclusion that the Privacy Act was broken and walked away without exacting any measure of accountability or justice. It is unbelievable. 
   He did, however, publicly release the IG report and related documents, and these clearly show the inspector general unhesitatingly concluded that Tripp's privacy was compromised, that the Privacy Act was violated, and that the law was broken. This was in the IG report. The IG totally rejected Bacon's and Bernath's contorted arguments to the contrary. 
   In addition, the IG report clearly shows that no serious investigation was ever conducted into the involvement of other Clinton administration officials or friends outside the Pentagon, such as those in the White House who may have been involved in orchestrating this smear of Linda Tripp. 
   I urge my colleagues to read an article that was in the Washington Times on Saturday, May 27, 2000. It lays out clear evidence that Bacon and Bernath did not act alone in this matter, as they claim. There is evidence the IG did not adequately follow up. Yet it is the kind of evidence that, as Clinton friend Dick Morris has said, would lead to a conclusion any 6 year old could understand; namely, that Bacon and Bernath most certainly did not act alone.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I will chronologically reconstruct what happened in this case. It is important I be redundant so that people will understand and that it will not be forgotten and covered up. 
   On March 12, 1998, New Yorker magazine writer Jane Mayer, a former Wall Street Journal reporter, called Kenneth Bacon who used to work with Mayer at the Wall Street Journal, asking him about a question on Linda Tripp's personnel file for a story she was writing. 
   On March 13, the very next day, Bacon tasks Clifford Bernath, then a Pentagon public affairs deputy, with answering Mayer's question. Bernath writes in his journal: ``Ken has made clear it's a priority.'' 
   Further, in March of that same year, the New Yorker story claims Tripp violated the law. 
   In March, Defense Secretary William Cohen calls the disclosure ``certainly inappropriate, if not illegal.'' Cohen continued: Tripp's file ``was supposed to be protected by the privacy rules.'' The DOD inspector general's investigation is initiated. 
   An investigation was initiated in March of 1998. 
   In April of 1998, Cliff Bernath was deposed by Judicial Watch. Bernath was accompanied by a battery of Government lawyers from the Justice Department, the Defense Department, and the White House, in addition to one from Williams & Connolly appearing on behalf of the First Lady who was then a defendant in the FBI file suit. 
   Over the next 6 hours, Bernath proceeded to change his story. He had previously insisted the request was handled in a routine way. In this deposition, he concedes that it was a high-priority issue by Ken Bacon. 
   On May 21, 1998, at a Pentagon press conference, Ken Bacon declined comment--as he has since repeatedly--to the press, including refusing to deny whether the White House directed him to release that information on the grounds that the IG was still investigating. 
   On July 10, 1998, Federal Judge Royce Lamberth ordered the Defense Department to seize the computer of a Pentagon staffer who admits releasing information on Tripp's security clearance form. Lamberth ruled that the Department's inspector general should check the computer because the Pentagon aide, Clifford Bernath, deleted documents, although Bernath claimed none of the deleted documents concerned Tripp. 
   Jumping forward to February 9, 2000, at a House Armed Services Committee hearing, Secretary Cohen had no answer to the question from Representative BUYER on where the DOD report was, in what stage it was. We found out the report was concluded almost 2 years before that question was asked. 
   I have to add a personal note in defense of Bill Cohen. I do not believe he knew. I think the White House covered that up and the Justice Department covered up the fact that the report was concluded almost 2 years before that hearing. I do not believe Cohen actually was aware of that. 
   On March 6, 2000--this brings the Federal court back in--Federal Judge Lamberth signed an order requiring DOD to produce records concerning the release of information in Tripp's DOD files and information on any attempts to withhold information from the public and/or investigators about the details of that release. 
   Then on March 13, 2000, Judge Royce Lamberth stated:  
   The Tripp release presents such a clear violation of the Privacy Act.  
   Lambert said:  
   The court finds it impossible to fathom how an internal investigation into such a simple matter could take so long to conclude.  
   In fact, even though that statement was made by the judge in the court records on March 13, 2000, that internal investigation had been concluded in July 1998, nearly 2 years before. 
   In previous talks on the floor, I have had occasion to compare this crime with a crime that was committed 20 years before. I have done so because when you talk about what President Clinton and Vice President GORE have allegedly done in terms of getting foreign contributions, which are a violation of law, there is nothing really precedented about that that we can go back and compare with someone else who was prosecuted. 
   In this case, the crime that was committed by Kenneth Bacon, and perhaps more people with him, is a crime exactly like the crime that was committed 20 years before by Chuck Colson. 
   Let's go back and see just what Chuck Colson did. This is what he said and did, in his own words. This is going back to 1971:  
   ......I got hold of derogatory FBI reports about Ellsberg and leaked them to the press.  
   He said further, in 1976:  
   I happily gave an inquiring reporter damaging information compiled from secret personnel files.  
   I know, again, this is exactly the same thing that we now have a confession by Kenneth Bacon that he did. He got ahold of derogatory reports about Linda Tripp. And then he happily gave them to an inquiring reporter--the same thing. 
   So what happened to Colson? Colson was sentenced by U.S. District Court Judge Gerhard Gesell to a prison term. On April 7, 2000, in a deposition, he provided the New Yorker writer Jane Mayer with Tripp information. In other words, he admitted it. He admitted that. There is no question about whether or not he committed this crime. There is no doubt about it, no dispute about it. 
   Bacon said: I am sorry that I did not check with our lawyers or check with Linda Tripp's attorneys about this. 
   Sorry? Sorry really didn't cut it for Chuck Colson. Chuck Colson ended up in a Federal penitentiary. Colson committed the crime in July 1971. He admitted his guilt and pleaded on June 3, 1974, and was sentenced to the Federal penitentiary on June 21, 1974. 
   Bacon committed his crime in March of 1998. He admitted what he had done in June of 1998. The Pentagon inspector general referred the matter for criminal prosecution in July of 1998. So now 2 years later, in April, May, and June of 2000, the Clinton Justice Department says it is going to take a pass, hoping nobody will see or hear about this at this late date. After all, 2 full years  had transpired since the report was concluded. 
   So Colson went to jail and served time in prison. If there were justice and equal application of the law, Bacon would go to jail and serve time in prison. 
   Is this the first time the Clinton administration has been 
   involved in lawbreaking and corruption? Not hardly. It has almost become a way of life--Travelgate, Filegate, Buddhist Temple fundraisers, illegal foreign campaign contributions, the compromise of high-technology nuclear secrets to the Chinese, not to mention perjury and obstruction of justice. The list goes on and on. 
   Why is this important? It is all about a concept. It is as basic to America as the concept of going to church on Sunday. That concept is: Equal application of the law. 
   Chuck Colson realized he did the wrong thing. Chuck Colson, in a book that he wrote in 1976, called ``Born Again,'' stated:  
   I happily gave an inquiring reporter damaging information about Ellsberg's attorney, compiled from secret FBI dossiers.  
   He said:  
   ......I pleaded guilty after being told by Watergate prosecutor Leon Jaworski that my conviction would deter such a thing from [ever] happening again.  
   That is a quote. 
   I suggest that it has happened again, and they are hoping no one will notice. 
   I refer to an article that was written on June 12--a current article--in the Weekly Standard by Jay Nordlinger. The question is: ``Why Didn't Bacon Get Fried?'' That is the name of the article. I will quote a few things from it. Jay Nordlinger wrote:  
   It's just a small matter, in all the Clinton grossness, but it counts. Linda Tripp was the victim of a dirty, and illegal, trick. It was played on her by her own bosses at the Pentagon. And now those men--Kenneth Bacon and Clifford Bernath--have escaped with the wispiest slaps on the wrist. This is ho-hum for the Clinton administration; but it is a reminder of how unlawful and indecent this administration has been.  
   Further in the article he talks about Joseph diGenova, who is a former U.S. attorney with long experience in this area. 
   Quoting from the same article, diGenova is quoted as saying:  
   The treatment of Bacon and Bernath suggests that the Privacy Act will be enforceable only in civil lawsuits filed by the victims. If there's no adverse action--not even a letter that goes into somebody's file--there's no deterrence here. None whatsoever.  
   The article by Jay Nordlinger further states:  
   The president and his men have a bit of history with the Privacy Act. You perhaps remember Passportgate. Toward the end of the 1992 presidential campaign, it was learned that political appointees in the Bush State Department had rifled through candidate Clinton's passport files and those of his mother. Democrats demanded an independent-counsel investigation. They got one--led by diGenova. One of the officials involved, Elizabeth Tamposi, was dismissed. The acting secretary of state, Lawrence Eagleburger, offered to resign over the matter. (President Bush refused). Said Clinton, in his first press conference [after he had been elected President of the United States], ``If I catch anybody doing [what the passport-file offenders did], I will fire them the next day. You won't have to have an inquiry or rigmarole or anything else.'' 
   About a year later, Passportgate had something of a reprise, this time featuring appointees in Clinton's own State Department. A few of them got hold of Bush-administration personnel files and leaked them to Al Kamen of the Washington Post.  
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent this article be printed at the conclusion of my remarks.

   Mr. INHOFE. Finally, I guess it begs the question, What can be done now? I mentioned that the media, the mainstream media, has pretty much ignored this. They like Kenneth Bacon. He was a member of the media. They are not going to do anything about it, I have decided. 
   Fortunately, the Washington Times has done something about it. Fortunately, Fox News has done something about it. But there is something that can be done. When the new administration takes office, and a new Attorney General comes in, the Bacon-Bernath lawbreaking should be referred again for criminal prosecution. A professional Justice Department, freed from corrupt partisan influences, should prosecute this case and uphold the law. 
   Such a referral can easily be added to a list of such referrals on other matters which are already being contemplated, as Representative DAN BURTON, who is the chairman of the appropriate House committee, mentioned yesterday. 
   For example, these, as mentioned, would include criminal referrals related to: 
   No. 1, evidence that the President broke campaign finance laws, was aware of illegal foreign contributions, and changed policies in return for campaign contributions; 
   No. 2, evidence that the Vice President broke the law when he made the illegal fundraising phone calls from the White House; 
   No. 3, evidence that the Vice President committed a felony by lying to the FBI investigators about his knowledge of illegal fundraising activities; 
   No. 4, that Janet Reno committed obstruction of justice when she refused to appoint an independent counsel; 
   And now we add this to the list: Evidence that Ken Bacon and Clifford Bernath broke the law when they violated the Privacy Act in the Linda Tripp matter. 
   It is obvious if the next President of the United States happens to be AL GORE that very likely we will have the same type of Justice Department. I don't think our forefathers ever anticipated, when they were constructing these documents, our Constitution and our statutes, that we would have someone in the President's office who would use the Justice Department to protect his friends and punish his enemies. I have come to the conclusion that if this had been Frankie Vee who had done this, he would currently be serving time in the Federal penitentiary. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I regret we are doing this today. I can only speak for myself and not others, but if you wanted to do away with 527s for everybody and not leave anybody out, I would do it and do it in a heartbeat. But not on this bill. Everybody knows the consequences of putting something such as this on this bill. I hope in this very brief period of time --I was hoping to have more time--to at least address how significant this thing really is and what we are talking about. 
   Mr. President, I have said this since 1995. Our country is facing the greatest threat it has faced in its entire history. But it is not just me saying this. Now we have George Tenet, who is the Director of Central Intelligence and an appointee of President Clinton, agreeing, in my committee, that we as a Nation are in the most threatened position we have been in in the history of America. So we need to turn this thing around. This is the first year in 14 years we are able to start turning the corner and rebuilding a deteriorated system. 
   At the National Training Center-Ft Irwin, units coming to the NTC today have not had enough time to train at their home stations to allow them to maximize the training opportunities. This means that the units are leaving the NTC less proficient than those who went thru the rotations in previous years. 
   At Ft. Bragg, according to the base commander, O&M funds have never been so tight. Commanders are being forced to make choices and trade-offs that their predecessors never faced. Insufficient Base-Ops funding has forced commanders to rob from training accounts. Insufficient RPM funding has resulted in the degradation of facilities in which the military personnel work and live. 
   Maintenance on barracks is so bad that every time it rains, one building leaks into the rooms where the troops sleep, and even into the armory where their weapons are stored which damages those weapons. 
   At the Norfolk Naval Base, the Navy is experiencing an increase in the cross decking of equipment and munitions as less modern systems are available to outfit all the hulls. In addition, supplies and spare parts are insufficient to support the surging of the Navy to meet its 2 MTW requirements. 
   Insufficient steaming days and flying hours are amongst the biggest readiness concerns within some Navy units. 
   At the San Diego Naval Base, on average, 20 percent of the deployed planes on the carriers are grounded awaiting parts or other maintenance requirements. Furthermore, the cannibalization of aircraft has gone up by 15% over the last three carrier deployments. 
   There have been notable reductions in the mission capability and the full mission capability rates of Naval aircraft over the past 4 years. This is true for the deployed and the non-deployed squadrons. 
   At the Nellis Air Force Base, reduction in Red Flag exercises from 6 to 4 means that fewer pilots can participate each year. The new goal is to move pilots thru Nellis once every 18 months vs. once every year. The high OPTEMPO of the forces--deployments are up fourfold while the force is down by a third--has been the principle reason for the reduction in exercises. 
   Regarding Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center-29 Palms, conditions at 29 Palms and the Marine Corps in general: money is low; ammo is short; and spare parts are scarce. ``The level of training and readiness has diminished, it is not what it was in Desert Storm.'' 
   At Camp Lejuene, modernization delays have a serious readiness impact.  Equipment is more costly to maintain, less capable, and spare parts cannot always be obtained. In particular, the CH-46 is wearing thin. Some replacement parts are no longer available. One Marine officer estimated that if a Gulf War size operation erupted today, only about 50 percent of Marine units would be qualified to deploy. 
   I can tell you, the problems are in all these areas. We have retention problems because we do not have adequate accounts being funded. The various military installations are taking money out of one account and putting it in another account. So at Fort Bragg, for example, they have not been able to maintain their barracks. When it rains, the troops have to lie down on the equipment to keep it from rusting. We have a crisis in terms of cross-decking at Norfolk as well as on the west coast. 
   So we have very serious problems, and these problems can only be met with this bill. I will just quote one thing out of the DOD Quarterly Readiness Report:  
   Readiness deficiencies are most readily visible in the later deploying and non-deploying forces, some forward deployed and first-fight-forces are also experiencing these difficulties.  
   What they are saying is, for several years we are able to take all our assets and concentrate them in areas that are behind the lines in favor of the forward deployed. Now even the forward deployed are having a problem. 
   I can remember in our committee, the committee I chair, the Readiness Subcommittee, we had the four chiefs in there. I asked them the question: If you were going to have to take a reduction someplace to increase your modernization or some other accounts, would it be in force strength, modernization, quality of life, and so forth? 
   Up until a couple years ago, the Marines would always say ``quality of life, because the Marines don't need quality of life.'' Now we are not even hearing that from them. We are facing a crisis at a time when this country is in the most vulnerable position in which it has ever been. 
   I think we should really be looking at the overall picture and the fact we have something very serious going on right now. We need to address it with this bill. This defense authorization bill turns the corner for the first time in 14 years. It is being held hostage right now on a matter that has nothing to do with defending America. 
   Mr. President, I think we need to get on with the bill and away from extraneous, nongermane amendments.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I wouldn't want anything I say to be misinterpreted by anyone as to how I am going to be voting on the defense authorization bill under consideration. I am going to strongly support it, although it is strongly inadequate for the needs we are faced with right now. I am realistic enough to know that when we get into a rebuilding program, that is going to have to happen under a different administration than the administration we have had over the last 7 1/2 years. 
   I was elected to the House of Representatives in 1986; my first term was 1987. It happened that a very smart young Congressman from Texas named Dick Armey made the decision that we were going to have to do something about excess infrastructure and devised a way, this smart guy who got his Ph.D. from the University of Oklahoma, to take politics out of the base realignment and closing process. I strongly supported him. 
   The first round voted on, I believe, in 1987, to be implemented in 1989, about which I spoke on the floor of the House and supported, was one that I felt this country did need. So for the first two of the four rounds we have already had, it was cherry-picking time. Yes, we closed bases and installations that resulted in a tremendous savings, and it was good. 
   The third and the fourth rounds didn't work out that way. We have to keep in mind that it had always been virtually impossible politically to close installations because of the politics involved. There are always Members of the House and Senate who don't want anything closed in their States. Consequently, this system that was devised, this BRAC process, was to take politics out. Everyone agreed, even though they didn't like the results, that there had to be a process free from politics to do that. It worked out for the first four rounds. 
   The last round that came through in 1995 was one where, among other things, the BRAC committee evaluated the air logistics centers. There are five of them in the United States, and each one was operating at that time at 50-percent capacity. Any logical business conclusion would demand that we close two of them and transfer the workload to the remaining three. I heard the distinguished Senator from Michigan talk about the process, about the fact that privatization in place is something that would be precluded in the next BRAC round, if he is successful in getting that authorized. I suggest that if somebody in the White House wants to violate the integrity of this process, it is not only privatization in place that will happen. He can find out some other way of doing it. 
   We are going to have, it now appears, one of two people as the next President of the United States. It will either be Vice President AL GORE or George W. Bush. In the case of Vice President GORE, let's remember what happened in the 1995 round. They made the recommendation to close two and transfer the workloads of the remaining three. They evaluated all five air logistics centers and determined that the two  least efficient ones were at McClellan Air Force Base in California and Kelly Air Force Base in Texas. 
   That being right before the election and both being in vote-rich swing States, the President and the Vice President went to McClellan and then to Kelly and said: Don't worry; even though they said that we are going to close your bases, we are not going to let that happen. We are going to--and just out of the air he grabbed a phrase--``privatize in place.'' Well, that made it very clear that if you really want to figure out a way to politicize the system, you can do it. 
   Who was it at that time who made the announcement out at McClellan in California and at Kelly in Texas? It wasn't President Clinton. It was Vice President AL GORE. I said when I began that one of those two individuals, GORE or Bush, is going to be the next President. I will fight to the bitter end, until at least the time we know who the next President is going to be, before I will vote to authorize future BRAC rounds in that one of the candidates, Vice President AL GORE, has already demonstrated that he will induce politics back into a system that is supposed to be free of politics. I think that has to be considered. 
   The second issue is, in this rebuilding process, I believe that if the next President of the United States is George W. Bush, having had personal conversations with him, he recognizes that we are in the same hollow force situation we were in in 1980 when Ronald Reagan became President and had to start a massive rebuilding program. 
   What is a massive rebuilding program today? The Joint Chiefs have all said, in testimony before our committee, with Senator LEVIN and myself present, that we need to have an additional $140 billion over the next 6 years to reach the minimum expectations of the American people. What are the minimum expectations of the American people? It is to defend America on two regional fronts. This has been a concept most Americans think we can do today, and we cannot do that simultaneously. 
   So if we start this rebuilding process and it is going to be as significant as we think it is going to be, then we need to be looking at what our infrastructure needs will be then, not what they are today. If we have artificially lowered our force strength in this country to an artificially low level, we don't want to bring our infrastructure down to the same level because when we start to rebuild, we don't know what our infrastructure needs will be. 
   That is the whole point. We will know with the new administration, and we will be able to project in the future what that is going to be. The argument is used that we can't have it both ways and we need to have more money. That is true. I think we need to have a lot more money than we have right now. In fact, we have testimony from the service chiefs that, even with the budget we have today, we are still inadequate to the degree of about $11 billion-plus a year in order to start the rebuilding process and get to the point we just described. 
   Why would we be in a hurry to do this? When they talk about the fact that we are going to have savings, we know those savings aren't even going to take place in the best scenarios until, at the earliest, 2008. In fact, I will read out of a March 2, 2000, news article that quotes Bill Cohen. He said it will be somewhere between 2008 to 2015. 
   Now that is beyond the point, hopefully, that we have a crisis in this country. Our crisis is here today. There are a lot of people who would like to believe there is not a threat out there because the cold war is over. I look wistfully back to the days of the Cold War. At least we knew who the opposition was. We had two superpowers, and we had good intelligence on both sides. We knew what they had, and they knew what we had. We were able to address it. Today, we have all these rogue nations that all have weapons of mass destruction. We have countries that possess missiles that will reach to the United States of America, China, Russia, North Korea, and maybe others--warheads that could blow us up. 
   I come from Oklahoma, and I think most of the people realize it was just 5 years ago in April that we had the most devastating domestic terrorist attack in the history of America. It happened in Oklahoma. When you saw the pictures of that Murrah Federal Office Building, you saw parts of bodies that were stuck to the wall in that flaming building and the absolute devastation, and you stopped to realize that the smallest nuclear warhead known to man today is 1,000 times that powerful. 
   So here we are vulnerable, with no defense system at all on an incoming missile. Secondly, we are at one-half the force strength in 1991 during the Persian Gulf war. We have one-half of the Army divisions, one-half of the tactical air wings, one-half of the ships floating out there. Our force strength is down. At the same time, under this administration, we have had more deployments in the last 7 years than we had in the previous 40 years collectively. They have been in areas where we don't have national security interests. So we are taking these rare assets we have, and we are putting them into places such as Kosovo and Bosnia, where we should not have gone in the first place. 
   So facing that 1980 dilemma our rebuilding is going to have to start immediately for national security reasons. I would like to think that by 2008 we would be back where we were in 1986 after the rebuilding. I have no way of knowing that for sure, but let's hope that is the case. 
   Anyway, while the Senator from Arizona said it is not at all sure, he said, to be perfectly candid, that we are going to be able to save $20 billion over that period of time. There is one thing I suggest we are sure of, which is that the cost over the next 5 years is going to be $2.6 billion. That means it is going to be negative during this time that we have to start the rebuilding process. Things, right now, are in a much more deplorable condition than America wants to believe. 
   As chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee of the Armed Services Committee, I have had occasion to go to all the military installations around the world, and I don't like what I see. We have RPMs, real property maintenance accounts, that are supposed to be done immediately, taken care of, and they are not doing it. We have barracks in Fort Bragg where when it rains--and I was there when it rained--the roof has been leaking now for years. They are unable to fix that because they don't have the money to do it. Our troops are actually lying down over their equipment to keep it from rusting. It is a crisis. 
   You can go to the 21st TACOM over in Germany and look at our M-915 trucks. Many of them have over a million miles on them. They are spending as much in maintenance on each one over the next 3 years as it would take to buy a brand new truck. It is a crisis that we don't have the money to buy new trucks when we need them. It is not feasible to do it that way, but that is our only choice. 
   We don't have spare parts for airplanes. The cannibalized rate is higher than ever before. That means they bring in a crated F-100 engine to be put into an F-l6, and in order to keep the F-l6 there running with a fairly recent engine, they have to rob parts from this. It is highly labor intensive. Consequently, we are having a problem in retention that is not only with pilots, which is an-all time low, but also the mechanics putting those parts in. 
   Our pilot retention in the Navy right now is below 20 percent. It costs between $6 million and $9 million to train each one of them. Yet over 80 percent of them are leaving and not taking the second full tour of duty. The mechanics fixing the planes are leaving, too. I have talked to these people, and they say this country has lost its sense of mission. It is not keeping its strength. We can't buy bullets for guns. Talk to the Air Force people who go out to the red flag exercises at Nellis in the desert. They have cut them down so they don't believe they are getting the necessary training to be combat ready and to compete. 
   Look at our modernization program. Now we have been cutting back on the Crusader Program, which the Army believes is the crown jewel--that thing we have to have for our launching capability on the ground. Look at our modernization program in airplanes. I was never more proud of a four-star general than I was the other day when he stood up and said America needs to know that the Russians now have the SU-34, an air-to-air, air combat vehicle  that is better than anything we have, including the F-15. 
   The average American would say we are fine and we have the very best of equipment. We used to, but we don't now. Look at the ranges we have now. We are faced with an issue of having to close--temporarily, I hope--the firing range on Vieques. That is going to have a dramatic effect on which installations to keep open. We won't have anyplace to have live fire training. We will lose such ranges as Cape Wrath in Scotland, Capo Teulada in southern Sardinia. Why? Because there is no justification to allow us to fire our artillery if we are not willing to do it on our own lands. 
   All of these things form a crisis. When I said I look back wistfully at the days of the cold war, it isn't just me. I was redeemed the other day at our subcommittee meeting when we had George Tenet, the Director of Central Intelligence, there. This happened to be telecast live on C-SPAN. I said:  
   Right now, we are in the most threatened position that we have been in as a Nation in the history of this country since the Revolutionary War. Would you respond to that?  
   He said:  
   Absolutely correct. We are in the most threatened position.  
   It is because of the combined reasons of deployments, force strength and, of course, not having the national missile defense systems. All those will be elements of rebuilding. Who knows what our needs are going to be when we start this rebuilding. I hope the next President will be a Republican, and that we will be in a position to rebuild our defense system. When that happens, we don't know what the elements of that system are going to be. 
   Lastly--and I don't want to overdo the time here--we are asked this question by the distinguished Senator from Arizona: I challenge my colleagues to name any military expert who says we should not have another BRAC round. 
   You can name a lot of them. 
   The Assistant Secretary of Defense under Ronald Reagan said in an article in the Washington Post on May 14, 1998, when we were having the same debate, that Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen is correct when he says that the Department of Defense needs the support of Congress to have a cost-effective national defense. But the Secretary is blaming Congress for problems that are not of its making. More importantly, Cohen is ignoring the administration's own complicity in creating funding difficulties for defense and vastly is exaggerating the potential problems that could occur if Congress fails to heed his advice. Cohen wants Congress to authorize two new rounds of base closures to free up an additional $3 billion a year for buying badly needed new weapons. But what Cohen has not stated is that these savings would not begin until a decade from now. 
   I think that is the significant thing. These savings would set in after a period of time that we would be going through this rebuilding process. 
   I hold him up as one expert who says we should not do a round at this time. 
   Another is the Commandant of the Marine Corps, Gen. Jim Jones, who said that he knew of no Marine installation he would recommend for closure. He said: We cannot give it away or we will never get it back. 
   I don't think anyone is going to say that Gen. Jim Jones is not a military expert. He has one of the most distinguished careers of any of them. 
   Adm. Jay L. Johnson, the CNO, said his view was ``not far'' from that of Jones. He said he is concerned about permanently losing training ranges, air space, and access to the sea. 
   The Chief of the Army, General Shinseki, said he would support some closures in the future but said that the Army needs to decide what its future force level is going to be before it can judge base consolidation with certainty. 
   We have three of the four chiefs of our services saying if we are going to do it we should wait and do it after we determine what our force strength should be in the future and not do it before that time. 
   For the combination of those reasons, there is certainly no rush to do it and do it in this bill. Certainly I would be willing to talk about this after the next administration comes in. It wouldn't make any difference anyway because the first round wouldn't be until 2003. 
   I think Dick Armey did a wonderful job back in 1987. I think it served a very useful purpose--particularly the first three BRAC rounds that we were able to accomplish. They saved a lot of money. We are now enjoying some of the savings. However, the amounts that we saved have far exceeded what we lost by the cleanup costs. I don't think those estimates would be anymore accurate if we were to go through two new rounds. 
   Keep in mind that every succeeding round is going to yield fewer benefits than the round before. I certainly think the Senator from Rhode Island, with his background and experience, knows that if you are going to start a closing process, you pick off the cherries to start with and accumulate those savings. 
   I conclude by saying that we need to look at them in the next administration after we find out what our force strength is going to be, and after we find out what degree of rebuilding we will have to undergo in order to protect America and meet the minimum expectations of the American people. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, if I can respond to a couple of the statements of the Senator from Ohio and the Senator from Rhode Island, first of all, I know the Senator from Rhode Island is sincere when he says this would not take place until 2003; it would be a new administration. But we have to keep in mind that administration could very well be a Gore administration. It was Vice President Gore who was very instrumental in politicizing the system before. I think that is significant. 
   I would say also to my friend from Ohio, while there are savings that would be effected, the savings, according to Secretary Cohen, would not even start until 2008. By that time, we are hoping we will have been able to use every available dollar to get us out of the situation we are in right now. I think that is very significant. Our crisis is now. Our crisis is a rebuilding program for the next 4 to 5 years. 
   I yield.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, on Wednesday, May 17, at page S. 4069 of the RECORD, the distinguished minority leader announced, ``I am going to demand that every single appropriations bill that comes to the Senate before it can be completed be passed in the House first because that is regular order.'' To be clear he repeated, ``We are going to require the regular order when it comes to appropriations bills.'' 
   The Senator refers to the origination clause of our Constitution Art. 1, Sec. 7, Cl. 1. The origination clause states that ``All bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives.'' The meaning of this clause is widely known, and I do not know why the distinguished minority leader would attempt to make an erroneous claim before those who know better. I do know why he did not challenge his 99 colleagues to correct this statement, as he did with another. The reason is that many could have come forward to tell him he was mistaken. 
   When I open Riddick's Senate Procedure, I read that ``[i]n 1935, the Chair ruled that there is no Constitutional limitation upon the Senate to initiate an appropriation bill.'' The House does claim ``the exclusive right to originate all general appropriations bills.'' Specific appropriations, however, ``have frequently originated in the Senate.'' 
   If the Senator intends to say that there is no precedent for the initiation of appropriation bills in the Senate, that is false. Perhaps there is some confusion between ``raising revenue'' and ``appropriating.'' The former the Senate cannot do. The latter it can. 
   Also, the room the Senate has to work within is broad rather than narrow. The Rules of the House of Representatives note that ``[a] bill raising revenue incidentally [has been] held not to infringe upon the Constitutional prerogative of the House to originate revenue legislation.'' 
   The courts agree with these constitutional interpretations. In fact, as recently as 1989, the Court of Appeals for the Tenth District in U.S. v. King, 891 F.2d 780, 781 ruled that where a bill does not qualify as a revenue bill, it is not subject to the provisions of the origination clause. 
   The United States Supreme Court, in Twin City Nat. Bank of New Brighton v. Nebecker, 167 U.S. 196, 202. ruled in an 1897 decision, which is cited as precedent to this day, that ``revenue bills are those that levy taxes, in the strict sense of the word, and are not bills for other purposes which may incidentally create revenue.'' 
   On another occasion, the Supreme Court, in U.S. v. Norton, 91 U.S. 566, 569 (1875) said that ``[t]he construction of the [origination clause] limitation is practically well settled by the uniform action of Congress'' and that ``it `has been confined to bills to levy taxes in the strict sense of the word, and has not been understood to extend to bills for other purposes which incidentally create revenue.' '' 
   Indeed, in 1997, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth District in Walthall v. U.S., 131 F.3d 1289 ruled that the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA) did not violate the originations clause. 
   It was not the intent of our Founding Fathers not to allow the Senate to decide how to spend government monies. Obviously, we must do that. Almost every action we take requires some money to be spent. What the Founding Fathers wanted to achieve with the origination clause was a check on government by which the most representative body had to authorize the extraction from the people of taxes. 
   The only obstacle I know of to the Senate passing certain appropriation bills is the objection of the distinguished minority leader. He claims, ``This is getting to be more and more a second House of Representatives.'' Who is making it so, I ask. 
   According to Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, Sec. 3.2, p. 134 it is the other body in which ``[i]nfringement of the Senate on the constitutional prerogative of the House to initiate revenue measures may be raised *.*.* as a matter of privilege.''

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, as our chairman, Chairman WARNER, I listened to the distinguished Senator from New Jersey talk about this issue. While I do have the utmost respect for him, I would have to say that one of the problems we had, getting into this mess to start with, was the grossly exaggerated figures that were used. I believe the Senator used the number 100,000--100,000 has been batted around quite often. I am going to read into the RECORD at this point from Robin Cook, the Foreign Secretary--this is October of 1999. He is under pressure to answer claims that ministers misled the public on the scale of deaths of civilians in Kosovo:  
   At the height of the war, western officials spoke of a death toll as high as 100,000. President Bill Clinton said the NATO campaign had prevented ``deliberate, systematic efforts at ethnic cleansing and genocide''.  
   Emilio Perez Pujol, a pathologist who led the Spanish team looking for bodies in the aftermath of the fighting, said:  
   I calculate that the final figure of dead in Kosovo will be 2,500 at the most.

   Mr. INHOFE. No, I will not yield unless I yield on your time. 
   I would like to have a better solution than the solution that is in front us. Frankly, I think we should have done this some time ago, but this seems to be the only vehicle in town. There are reasons we should not have been involved in Kosovo. It is not in our vital national security interests. There is no clear mission objective or schedule to accomplish it. There is no exit strategy. 
   The thing that really concerns me more than anything else, as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness, is what this has done to our state of readiness. I have been saying since before we sent the cruise missiles into Kosovo that the United States is in the most threatened position we have been in as a nation in this Nation's history. I have been saying that for a long time. It finally was redeemed the other day--our chairman will remember this--when we had George Tenet, Director of Central Intelligence, before our committee. I made that statement. I asked him to respond live on C-SPAN. He said, yes, we are in the most threatened position we have been in as a nation in the history of this country. 
   Why is that? It is because of three things. First of all, we are at one-half the force strength that we were in 1991 during the Persian Gulf war. Second, we do not have a national missile defense system. We were to have one deployed by fiscal year 1998, and through the President's veto and his veto messages saying he is not going to put more money into a national missile defense system, in spite of the fact that in July of last year we passed a bill that he signed into law with a veto-proof margin saying that is our No. 1 concern, we still do not have one. 
   But the third reason is all these deployments that have nothing to do with our national security interests. I can 
   remember the first one that came along. It was Bosnia. I went up to Bosnia. I knew the President was bound and determined to send our troops into Bosnia. I knew we did not have the spare troops to send in, that we could not respond to a crisis in the Middle East or North Korea if we were to continue to make these deployments, so I went up to the northeast sector. I remember this so well because I was the  first American, civilian or military, up there. I went up there with a British General named Rupert Smith, a colorful guy. He and I really enjoyed that trip, going up, talking about what the President promised the American people. 
   If you remember, we had a resolution of disapproval to stop the President from sending troops over there and getting involved. We lost it only by three votes. We lost it because the President said all the troops they would send there, in December of 1995, would be home for Christmas 1996. This is not an approximation. This is the commitment the President made to the American people. 
   We knew that was not going to happen. So we tried this same thing before. We tried at that time to say let's just draw a line in the sand at June of 1996; then June of 1997. We had the same debate at that time. ``No, they are going to come back, but all in good time.'' 
   There is no end in sight in Bosnia. They are still there. So here we have our people involved in an area with the Croats and Serbs and Muslims. Then you have the various other groups such as the Arkan Tigers and Black Swans. The only thing all these groups have in common is they all hate us, hate that we are over there. We lost our resolution of disapproval by three votes. 
   I have tried to determine how much we have spent in Bosnia alone. The most conservative figure will be $13 billion. When you consider everything that has to go with it in terms of ground logistics support, it is considerably more than that. 
   Then along came Kosovo. I knew the same thing was going to happen. This President has an obsession for sending our troops into places where we do not have any national security interests. So I went over to Kosovo. It is not a hard place to go across; it is only 75 miles across. I went by myself, one individual with me. As I went across Kosovo, I only saw one dead person, and that was a Serb, a Serb soldier who had been killed by an Albanian. 
   I rounded one corner and looked down the barrel of a rocket launcher, and it was held by an Albanian. Of some 92 mosques that are there, only 1 was burning. CNN had pictures of it from every angle. When you got back to the United States, you thought every mosque in Kosovo was burning. It was a propaganda effort deliberately to make the American people believe things were going on there that were not going on there. 
   What has happened since then, I might add, speaking of us, on this Senate floor I showed pictures and documented, since the Albanians are now on top, they have burned to the ground a minimum of 52--and we have pictures of all 52--Serb Christian Orthodox churches, most of them built prior to the 15th century. If you do not have any sensitivity to the religious aspect of this, look at the historic aspect. Nonetheless, this is the propaganda effort that got us over there. 
   I can remember one of my many trips. I have to say, I believe I have been in the Balkans, both places, more than any other Member has. Normally I am by myself, to really try to determine 
   what is going on there. I remember being in Tirana. Tirana is where all the refugees showed up. They were all pretty well dressed, but they were all upset with us. They said to me, ``When are you going to do something about this?'' I said, ``Why should we do it?'' They said, ``It's your fault we had this ethnic cleansing.'' 
   I will quote out of the Washington Post of March 31 of last year. They wrote:  
   For weeks before the NATO air campaign against Yugoslavia, CIA Director Gen. Tenet had been forecasting that Serb-led Yugoslavian forces might respond by accelerating ethnic cleansing.  
   Then Bill Cohen said:  
   With respect to Director Tenet testifying that the bombing could in fact accelerate Milosevic's plans, we also knew that.  
   This was live on Tirana television. They said: When are you--and I was the only American in the group--going to do something about our plight? Because it is your fault we had the ethnic cleansing. 
   Anyway, I think one of the bigger issues is the fact we are diluting our scarce resources. I will quote the comments by Henry Kissinger. He said at that time:  
   Each incremental deployment into the Balkans is bound to weaken our ability to deal with Saddam Hussein and North Korea.  
   He said:  
   The proposed deployment to Kosovo does not deal with any threat to American security....... 
   Kosovo is no more a threat to America than Haiti was to Europe.  
   So I know a lot of lies got us into this thing. I remember they rewrote history, saying if we do not go in there, we are going to have another world war because that is the way World War I started and that is the way World War II started. 
   Again quoting from Kissinger's book:  
   The Second World War did not start in the Balkans, much less as a result of its ethnic conflicts.  
   He wrote:  
   World War I started in the Balkans not as a result of ethnic conflicts but for precisely the opposite reason: because outside powers intervened in a local conflict. The assassination of the Crown Prince of Austria--an imperial power--by a Serbian nationalist led to a world war because Russia backed Serbia and France backed Russia while Germany supported Austria.  
   That is exactly what we are doing. We have rubbed Russia's nose in this thing because we have gotten involved in this thing, creating another serious problem facing our Nation. We are now down to where we have diluted the forces. General Richard Hawley, who at that time, in 1999, headed the Air Combat Command, said:  
   The Air Force.......would be hard-pressed to handle a second war in the Middle East or Korea.  
   Hawley said that 5 weeks of bombing Yugoslavia have left the United States munitions stocks critically short, not just of air-launched cruise missiles as previously reported but also of another precision weapon, the Joint Direct Attack munition, that is JDAM, dropped by the B-2 bombers. 
   If my colleagues go to the 21st TACOM in Germany, right down the road from Ramstein, they will find--that is where they handle the ground logistics--that even before we went into Kosovo, we were at 100-percent capacity. I asked the question: What would happen if we had to respond to a serious problem in the Persian Gulf where we do have national security interests? 
   The response was: We would be 100-percent dependent upon Guard and Reserve. 
   What has happened to our Guard and Reserve as a result of all these deployments? We have critical MOSs, military occupational specialities, because they cannot be deployed 180 and 270 days out of a year and keep the jobs they have at home. 
   Finally, I want to read one paragraph of an article written by Henry Kissinger which says:  
   President Clinton has justified American troop deployments in Kosovo on the grounds that ethnic conflict in Yugoslavia threatens ``Europe's stability and future.'' Other administration spokesmen have compared the challenge to that of Hitler's threat to European security. Neither statement does justice to Balkan realities.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, the International Civil Aviation Organization, ICAO, is a specialized agency of the U.N. that has been tasked for more than 50 years with the safe and orderly growth of international civil aviation. Based in Montreal, this 185 countries strong organization develops international standards on such critical issues as noise, emissions, and air worthiness. 
   I am saddened to report that, last week, the European Union dealt a severe blow to the integrity and future viability of this critical organization. I, of course, am speaking of the EU's implementation of the so-called hushkit regulation. This regulation bans hushkitted aircraft from being registered in Europe, prohibits such aircraft that are not European registered from flying in Europe within two years, and bars certain reengined aircraft with low by-pass ratios from European airspace. The regulation was implemented despite the fact that the aircraft in question meet the highest international noise standards. 
   Thankfully, in March, the U.S. filed an Article 84 case within ICAO against the fifteen EU Member States arguing that the regulation violated the Chicago Convention. ICAO will review the matter this fall, and hopefully resolve it in a way that reaffirms its position as the sole, international standard setting body. 
   Ironically, the EU wants to have its cake and eat it too. EU Members States are now anxious for ICAO to establish new, more stringent, Stage 4 noise standards. Indeed, the U.S. is working with ICAO on this endeavor as we speak. The key question becomes, why should we develop new standards if the EU has demonstrated that the old ones can be disregarded at whim? If the EU wants Stage 4, it must begin by demonstrating its respect for Stage 3 by withdrawing the hushkit regulation. 
   Mr. President, I will be following the resolution of this dispute very carefully. It is critical to future trading opportunities that the integrity of the ICAO process be upheld.

   Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I want to update my colleagues and the American people on the latest developments in the Linda Tripp file case. As my colleagues will recall, this is a matter concerning how information from the confidential personnel file of a Pentagon civil servant was leaked to the media in March of 1998, more than 2 years ago, by the Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon and a colleague in violation of the Privacy Act. 
   As my questions at an Armed Services Committee hearing revealed for the first time on April 6, the Pentagon's Office of Inspector General essentially completed its investigation of this matter within 4 months of the incident. In July of 1998, it referred its report to the Justice Department, having found sufficient evidence that a crime had been committed. 
   From July 1998 until March of 2000, the Justice Department sat on the report, taking no action, making us believe the IG report was not completed and not given to them--essentially engaging in a coverup, in its typical stonewalling, delaying tactics. Then finally, on March 28, 2000, they quietly returned the report to the Pentagon, informing them it would not criminally prosecute anyone in the case. 
   I reported all of this to the Senate in a floor statement I made on April 11. At that time, I pointed out that the offense in this case--disseminating to the media information from a Government employee's confidential personnel file--was the same offense Chuck Colson pleaded guilty to during Watergate. It was the same offense for which Colson served in the Federal penitentiary. 
   Since all of this was revealed last month, three principal defenses--I would call them excuses--have emerged as to why Mr. Bacon should not be prosecuted. These have been put forth to the media by Mr. Bacon's lawyer and by the Justice Department in its decision to take a pass on prosecution. Let me state these three defenses and what they are: 
   No. 1, defense by Kenneth Bacon is that Bacon only leaked a part of a confidential file, not the whole file; 
   No. 2, that the Freedom of Information Act ``trumps'' the Privacy Act; and 
   No. 3, that Bacon ``didn't intend to break the law.'' 
   Today, I want to report to the Senate that all of these arguments have been refuted and exposed as having no merit in this case. This leaves us facing the stark truth: The law was violated, and those who violated it should be prosecuted. 
   In testimony on April 26 before the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness, which is the Committee I chair, I asked Pentagon Deputy Inspector General Donald Mancuso about these issues. He confirmed these points:  
   No. 1, that criminal violations of the Privacy Act are not contingent on whether a whole file or just a part of a file is compromised. 
   Common sense would lead us to this conclusion anyway, but this was confirmed by the inspector general in our committee meeting. 
   Either one constitutes a violation. There is no distinction between leaking part of a file or leaking the entire file. 
   Secondly, that there was no formal written Freedom of Information Act request made prior to the Tripp file leak; that, in any event, the Freedom of Information Act does not trump the Privacy Act; and that, indeed, the Freedom of Information Act includes specific exemptions directly related to the Privacy Act. 
   So we are saying two things really. We are saying, first of all, when they said they used the Freedom of Information Act request as an excuse, they were lying, because there was no request under the Freedom of Information Act. Secondly, if that had happened, there is specific exemptions within our law to the Freedom of Information Act, one of which is the Privacy Act. 
   Finally, in its March 2000 decision not to prosecute, the Justice Department stated that Bacon and his colleague ``didn't intend to break the law when they released information from Linda Tripp's personnel file.'' 
   What this tells me is that the Justice Department knows the law was broken. It is all the more reason why their decision not to prosecute is so outrageous. The next time I am stopped by a policeman for speeding, I am going to tell him, ``I didn't intend to break the law.'' I suppose then everything will be all right. 
   Recently, I received a letter from Mr. Bacon's lawyer taking exception to a couple of points I made it my previous remarks on the floor. I would like to respond to each of those points here: 
   First, Bacon's lawyer claims that comparing Kenneth Bacon's offense to Chuck Colson's offense in Watergate is ``inaccurate'' and ``unfair'' because the two cases, he says, are not ``remotely comparable.'' 
   But he is wrong. They are directly comparable. 
   He goes into a lengthy description of the charges against Colson which were dropped by the court. All of this is interesting, but it is irrelevant to the current case. 
   Colson released information from Daniel Elsberg's confidential file, violating Elsberg's privacy. 
   Bacon released information from Linda Tripp's confidential file, violating Tripp's privacy. 
   What could be more ``comparable'' than this? 
   Second, Mr. Bacon's lawyer notes that the court said Colson implemented ``a scheme to defame and destroy the public image of Daniel Elsberg, with the intent to influence, obstruct, and impede the conduct and outcome'' of pending investigations and prosecutions. 
   Similarly, Bacon's action can easily be seen as part of ``a scheme to defame and destroy the public image of Linda Tripp, with the intent to influence, obstruct, and impede the conduct and outcome'' of pending investigations and possible prosecutions of the President and of Linda Tripp herself. 
   Let's not forget that Linda Tripp has testified that she was told by a top White House aide that she would be ``destroyed'' if she came forward and exposed illegal activities she witnessed in the Clinton White House, including matters related to the Filegate scandal. Tripp's FBI file was one of over 900 FBI files improperly obtained by the Clinton White House. Tripp remains a material witness in continuing legal proceedings on the Filegate matter. 
   In addition, let's not forget that Tripp has also been the target of a politically motivated prosecution in Maryland concerning the taping of Monica Lewinski's phone calls. 
   All of this provides ample evidence of possible motivations ``to defame or destroy'' her ``public image.'' 
   Third, Mr. Bacon's lawyer claims that Bacon did not violate any law in releasing the information on Tripp. 
   Again, he is simply wrong. Bacon clearly violated the Privacy Act, the law which was enacted in 1974 as a direct result of the Colson case. It isn't even a close call. 
   The contention that the media inquiry constituted a FOIA request that somehow superseded the Privacy Act will simply not stand up to scrutiny. 
   Finally, Mr. Bacon's lawyer makes a legitimate point with which I am 
   prepared to agree; and that is, that Mr. Bacon is a dedicated public official who has served the Department of Defense with distinction for 6 years. 
   Similarly, Linda Tripp is a dedicated public official who has served in the Pentagon and the White House with distinction for many years. 
   The problem is that there must be equal application of the law if the law is to have any meaning. 
   Mr. Bacon simply cannot be permitted to escape responsibility for an act that so clearly violated the law--a law which is designed to protect the rights of all government employees. 
   The news media, I think, has created a particular problem in this case. It is a travesty that the major news media have not covered this story and informed the American people about why this is important. 
   What a contract with how the news media acted during the Watergate era. At that time, the news media led the charge to uncover wrongdoing by high government officials, explaining why adherence to the rule of law was so vital to the protection of liberty. 
   In the aftermath of Chuck Colson's pleading guilty in June 1974, along with other Watergate figures, newspapers across the country expressed appropriate outrage. They covered the story. They commented on it forcefully. They didn't sweep it under the rug. They did not say they were bored. They did not argue that the country should ``move on'' to other things. 
   They knew that lawbreaking by high officials was one of the most important things they could report to the American people, because, as they kept telling us, an informed public is essential to the protection of liberty in a democracy. 
   Here are a few examples of editorials during the Watergate years. Where are the similar editorials today? 
   On June 12, 1974, the Philadelphia Evening Bulletin was upset that another Watergate figure got off too lightly with a 30-day suspended sentence for his Watergate crime. They said.  
   The circumstances (in this case) did not call for a tap on the wrist. [The judge's] praise for (the defendant's) integrity in this setting seems inappropriate. If [the defendant] is to be so excused for failing to do his duty ..... then how are others to be held accountable for placing personal loyalty above their duty and the requirements of the law?

   Mr. INHOFE. Then, speaking of Chuck Colson, on June 4, 1974, the Dayton (Ohio) Daily News wrote:  
   In this tawdry matter, Mr. Nixon's White House again has been exposed--this time by an aide who was high in its deliberations and was an intimate of the President's--as acting against the political and judicial process of this country as if they were enemies.  
   Finally, in commenting on Chuck Colson, in the home state of the Presiding Officer, the Portland (Maine) Evening Express wrote on June 30, 1974:  
   Yet another close aide or high appointee of President Nixon has been brought to justice ..... He had attempted to defame Elsberg and destroy his credibility ..... Daily, it becomes abundantly clearer that [the Nixon Administration is] the most morally reprehensible administration in the history of the nation.  
   So who is at fault? Of course, Ken Bacon is at fault for violating the law. But I suppose it is human nature to cover up to save oneself. Who is really at fault is the press--the media--who are covering up this crime. No one can look at the way the press assailed Chuck Colson for his crime and now covers up the crime of Ken Bacon without asking, ``Why? Why are they so defensive of Ken Bacon when they so aggressively went after Chuck Colson?'' Unequal application of the law is no worse then inequality in reporting. The consequences of both serve to diminish our liberty. 
   Unfortunately, Ken Bacon, who should have been prosecuted, is now in the hands of Secretary of Defense William Cohen. Cohen is charged with reviewing the IG report and issuing any administrative discipline, short of criminal punishment. I urge him to act swiftly and in accord with the seriousness of this matter.  
   Federal employees throughout government are watching this case. What will it say to them if someone who has so clearly violated the Privacy Act is not held accountable? 
   It will say that no one's privacy can ultimately be protected, that the law is largely meaningless, and that ideal of public service in support of the Constitution and the laws is forever diminished. 
   Madam President, I am not trying to single out Kenneth Bacon. I don't even know him. But I do know Chuck Colson, and he admits he was properly prosecuted, and Kenneth Bacon has committed the same crime and gets off free. This is wrong. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, let me address something that the Senator from Alabama was talking about. He gave so many good, concrete examples of the discipline problem we have in our public school system. It is a very real thing. I appreciate him bringing this up and the fact that we know why we are having this, with all the mandates and requirements. 
   I want to tell you a story. You talk about the discipline problems. I want to give a concrete example of how one ended up in doing a great disservice to the children of Oklahoma and other places. 
   I have kind of a unique situation at home. I have a wife and two daughters, all three of whom teach or have taught. My wife taught back in the fifties, when we were first married. As our four children were growing up, I remember so well the youngest one--I call her the runt of my litter--Katie, always wanted to be a schoolteacher just like her mom, and her mom's discipline was accelerated math. 
   So Katie was in school. She got her degree and got her master's in math education. She is really an accomplished teacher, because she loves the kids. She was active in Young Life because she liked to be around troubled  kids and help them with their problems. When someone is a dedicated person like that, that means they are a much better educator. 
   To make a very long story short, little Katie had wanted to teach the same thing her mother did. When she finally got all of her degrees, she came to the school where her mother taught and where Katie and her brothers and sisters all went to school. After she got the job, it wasn't only that she got a job in the same school as her mother, but she taught the same course in the same school in the same classroom that her mother had taught in 30 years before. She was rejoicing. It had just been a few years before that that she had gone through that school. 
   She taught there for 4 years, and she came to me one day literally in tears. She said, ``Daddy, I feel like a traitor because I have to leave to go to another school district.'' I said, ``Why? This is where your mother taught. This is where you went to school. Our whole family went to school there. It is a tradition.'' She said, ``I teach math, and the kids are so disruptive and not listening. There is no discipline. When you send them to the principal's office, the principal says, `Our hands are tied. We can't do anything about it.' '' So it continues. Consequently, these kids are not getting an education. 
   This is in the fourth week of the beginning of the school term. She said, ``I told the kids, `If you do not get the basics right now at the beginning of the school term, you are going to fail the class.' They all shrugged their shoulders in unison, and said, `We don't care.' '' And the parents didn't care. There is no way that the school was going to discipline those children. 
   Katie quit. She went to a private school. She is now involved in teaching and is an accomplished teacher. The public school system lost. I am a prejudiced daddy. I admit that. But they lost one who is considered by the parents and fellow teachers and certainly students as one of the best math teachers that taught, including my wife, in that school. It is all for one reason: There is no discipline. 
   That is what local emphasis is all about. I think we can untie the hands of the local school districts and let them do it. On the bill we are considering today, I would like to go further with vouchers in getting into more choice. But this is certainly a good personal first step. 
   I would like to mention one other thing before the Senator from Alabama leaves the room because I want to make one comment about a program that works and one that we are going to try to change and get fully implemented. That is called impact aid. 
   I know the Senator from Alabama is interested in this because Alabama would qualify for $12 million of impact aid. Last year they got $2.4 million. They are at 20 percent of where they should be. 
   Impact aid is a Federal program that really works. By and large, it is not something that is giving something to somebody. It says to go the Federal Government, you have come in here with your military installations, with your Indian reservations, or any other Federal type of program, and because of that those lands on which you are working are off the tax rolls. So there is no property tax coming in. Yet while you are doing that you have brought in with you a large number of children. Those 
   children have to be educated in our educational system. Yet there is no funding there to offset the cost of not being able to collect revenues from those lands that are on various installations. This as one of the rare programs we can talk about that is not just something good for students, but it is an obligation that we have to these students. Oklahoma, I might add, is in a very similar situation. 
   What we are proposing in a letter that we encourage people to sign, and which the Senator from Alabama has already signed, is that we need to phase in full funding for impact aid. Over a 4-year period of time, we start with 6 percent. Then we move on up until we have 100 percent. 
   This is a program that I think of as a moral responsibility to keep our word with local school districts because when we don't do that the amount of money they have to spend to educate that child is taken away from other programs such as computers and teacher-pupil ratios. This is something I think is an obligation and something that we should strive for. Hopefully, we can get the language in here. 
   I don't care if it ends up being an entitlement, as much as I hate to say that. This is a responsibility that we have.

   Mr. INHOFE. It is a big deal, because in my State of Oklahoma there our five major military installations. I hear from people all the time in Lawton, OK, and Fort Sill. Of course, we have a very large number of children who are being educated in the public school system, but there is no money coming from the tax base. This is a Government installation. 
   The local districts sometimes have ideas that are better than those ideas emanating from Washington. I will share one personal experience. I can remember many years ago when I was in the State legislature; I made it a practice to always come back to Tulsa from where we met when the kids had some kind of a function, a school play or something. I remember coming in one time and seeing my oldest son, Jimmy. At that time he was in the fourth grade. He was beaming. He said, ``Dad, guess what?'' He said, ``You know I am in the fourth grade.'' I said, ``Yes. I know that, son.'' He said, ``Guess what. In reading I am in the fifth grade.'' I said, ``How in the world did that work?'' He said, ``It is a brand new, something that has never been tried before. But they are taking me at the level where I am because I am better than the rest of the fourth graders. So I am in the fifth grade.'' 
   I thought back to when I was in grade school. I went to a little country schoolhouse where they had a wood-burning stove in the middle of the room. There were eight rows of seats and eight grades. I was in the first row because I was in the first grade. My brother was in the second row because he was in the second grade. My sister was in the eighth row because she was in the eighth grade. We had one school teacher. I think back now and wonder if he was really the giant that I remember. 
   When you needed discipline, as the Senator from Alabama was talking about--at that time they had a great big board. If you messed up, you were disciplined the right way. Anyway, when they would teach the classes, they would line you up. I would go with the first graders. In spelling, for example, when you missed a spelling word, you had to go up there and get a swat on the rear with this great big paddle. I have to tell you that I was a very good speller. I was in the third row. That taught me a lesson. 
   So I thought about that program that Jimmy talked about. This probably happened 30 years before then. It was a brandnew and innovative program. Programs that emanate from the Federal Government are not always the right ones. 
   We need to unshackle the hands of the teachers, the parents, and the local school districts to give them greater flexibility and greater opportunity to do a better job of teaching our children. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I understand a lot of people are preparing their remarks to address this very significant subject of the marriage tax penalty. I know the Senator from Texas has addressed this subject many times, as I have, and I intend to do that. 
   Regrettably, I want to report to the Senate and to the American people something different, which is more evidence of the hypocrisy, corruption, and coverup which pervades this administration. Something happened last week. At a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee, we finally got some answers about the ``investigation'' concerning the March 1998 incident in which information from Linda Tripp's confidential Government security file was deliberately leaked to the media. 
   Linda Tripp was and still is a Government employee who works out of the Pentagon. I understand nobody wants to hear about this. They would rather hear warm and fuzzy things. People say they have already heard it before, which they have not, but they think they have. They say there are only 9 months left in this President's term. Everybody says: Shut up; let it go; leave it alone; there is nothing you can do about it. They say: Just move on to something else. 
   For those concerned about the politics of it, that is probably wise counsel, but some of us are less concerned about the politics than we are about the truth. 
   I wish I did not have to say anything about this subject, 
   but somebody has to do it. We are talking about another crime committed in this administration. Politicians do not want to make people feel uncomfortable. As Henry Ward Beecher said:  
   I don't like those cold, precise, perfect people who, in order not to say wrong, say nothing; and in order not to do wrong, do nothing.  
   A lot of say nothing and do nothing takes place in this Senate. That is why I asked Donald Mancuso, the Pentagon's acting inspector general, a series of questions at the hearing last week. His answers revealed for the first time a number of things we previously did not know. 
   He told us: No. 1, the Pentagon Office of Inspector General completed its investigation of this matter in July of 1998. Spokespeople in the administration have been implying for the last 20 months that the Pentagon itself was still investigating. This is not true. It is just another Clinton lie. 
   What we have is evidence of a lie, a coverup, and a transparent effort to drag it out as long as possible, hoping to run out the clock as the administration's time in office winds down. 
   No. 2, we learned that the report--this is the report on the leak in 1998--was given to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution, and quoting Mancuso:  
   We felt we had found sufficient information to warrant consultation with the Department of Justice.  
   This means it was a criminal referral. The Pentagon IG obviously believed there was sufficient evidence that a crime had been committed. 
   No. 3, the inspector general concluded that Pentagon Director of Public Affairs Ken Bacon was involved in illegal activity. Quoting again Inspector General Mancuso:  
   The facts show that information was released by Mr. Bacon and it related to Linda Tripp.  
   No. 4, the Justice Department, after a 20-month coverup, quietly told the Pentagon in the last 2 weeks it would not prosecute anyone in the case. 
   We would not even have known about it if it had not been for the fact this came out during a hearing. This came out in a hearing that was live on C-SPAN. It was a public hearing, a public forum, so no one is going to be held legally accountable for what happened. 
   Remember, this is the President, who, in November 1992, said he would immediately fire anyone who was caught disclosing information from confidential Government personnel files. 
   All these things were not publicly known previously. I repeat, these four new findings we learned for the very first time only last week: First, we discovered that the Pentagon Office of Inspector General completed its investigation of the matter in July of 1998. 
   Second, we learned that the report was given to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution. 
   Third, we learned that the inspector general concluded that Pentagon Director of Public Affairs Ken Bacon was involved in the illegal activity. 
   Mancuso said:  
   The facts show that information was released by Mr. Bacon and it related to Linda Tripp.  
   Under the circumstances, releasing this information was clearly a criminal act, whether the Justice Department wants to believe this or not. 
   Fourth, we learned that the Justice Department has been covering up the crime for 20 months and only now tells us that no one will be prosecuted and no one will be held accountable. 
   This would never have come to light if it had not been for this hearing. 
   This is the same Justice Department that has botched up the investigation of the theft of information on the W-88 warhead, that has refused to appoint an independent counsel to investigate campaign fundraising illegalities, and that continues to cover up vital information in defiantly refusing to release the LaBella and Freeh memos suggesting that crimes may have been committed in the Chinagate scandal. 
   All this was ``breaking news'' last week. Did we read about it in the New York Times, in the Washington Post, or in the Los Angeles Times, or any of those publications? Did we hear about it on ABC, CBS, NBC, or CNN? No, we did not. With the noted exception of the Washington Times, the mainstream media largely ignored this important story. 
   Have we come to the point, 7 years and 3 months into this President's term, that the media, that is supposed to be the watchdogs of democracy, has given up caring about lawbreaking and abuses by the incumbent administration? Is that what this is all about? Are they so tired and bored by it all that they cannot report the obvious facts to the American people? 
   I appeal to the media right now to cover this story, and to cover it well. Just tell the truth. Expose the facts. Expose the hypocrisy. Do not, by your silence, allow yourselves to become pawns and participants in another Clinton coverup. 
   This is still America. The truth still matters. Let's look at some history. Let's recall a time when the media played a much different role than they are playing now. Watergate was 25 years ago, a time before the ``death of outrage,'' when the media boasted of its role explaining the immense significance of lawbreaking and coverups in high places. 
   Charles Colson, a guy I happen to know, I say to Senator BYRD--I attend a Bible study with him; an outstanding individual; at that time he was not so outstanding--was special counsel to President Nixon. He went to jail for doing essentially what Ken Bacon did. He released information to the media about a Pentagon employee that came from a confidential Government file in an attempt to discredit that person.  This was a crime then; and it is a crime now. 
   What exactly did Colson do? This is what he said he did, in his own words. This is going back to 1991:  
   I got hold of derogatory FBI reports about Ellsberg and leaked them to the press.  
   He said further, in 1976:  
   I happily gave an inquiring reporter damaging information ..... compiled from secret FBI dossiers.  
   So what happened to Colson? 
   In the midst of the media firestorm surrounding Watergate, Colson pleaded guilty to the charge that he obstructed justice by disseminating to the media derogatory information from a confidential FBI file about Daniel Ellsberg. 
   Colson was sentenced by U.S. District Court Judge Gerhard Gesell to a prison term of 1 to 3 years and fined $5,000. At the sentencing, Judge Gesell deplored Colson's ``deliberate misconduct'' and he lectured him to understand that ``Morality is a higher force than expediency.'' 
   In his book, ``Born Again,'' Colson talked about the significance of what he had done. He recalled that Judge Gesell said, in his pretrial hearing:  
   The whole purpose of this case, beyond its immediate objective, is to direct some attention to the desirability of having a government of law, not a government of men. That is what this is [all] about.  
   Colson continued, in his own words:  
   It is something I remembered from Civics I in school.  
   He said:  
   These were the cardinal principles of American government, the real bull-work against man-made tyranny. When a man's constitutional rights are in jeopardy, the violation, even cloaked in the time-honored protective shroud of national security, is simply intolerable.  
   Colson served 7 months in jail before the court reduced his sentence to time served. 
   Now, what did Ken Bacon do? 
   Let's go to the Washington Post of May 22, 1998:  
   The Pentagon's chief spokesman (Ken Bacon) apologized today for authorizing the release to a reporter of information contained in Linda R. Tripp's 1987 security clearance form, saying, ``In retrospect, I'm sorry the incident occurred.'' 
   Bacon's remarks came after he acknowledged in a deposition last Friday that he provided the New Yorker writer Jane Mayer with the Tripp information.  
   So, in other words, he admitted it. There is no question about whether or not he committed this crime. There is no doubt about it, no dispute about it. 
   Bacon said:  
   I'm sorry that I did not check with our lawyers or check with Linda Tripp's lawyers about this.  
   Sorry? Sorry didn't cut it for Chuck Colson. Colson committed his crime in July of 1971. He admitted his guilt and pleaded guilty on June 3, 1974, and was sentenced to jail June 21, 1974. 
   Bacon committed his crime in March 1998. He admitted what he had done in June of 1998. The Pentagon inspector general referred the matter for criminal prosecution in July of 1998. So now, 2 years later, in April of 2000, the Clinton Justice Department says it is going to take a pass, hoping nobody will see or care at this late date. 
   Colson went to jail and served time in prison. If there was justice, an equal application of the law, Bacon would also go to jail and serve time in prison. 
   Is this the first time the Clinton administration has been involved in lawbreaking and corruption? Hardly. It has almost become a way of life: Travelgate, Filegate, Buddhist Temple fundraisers, illegal foreign campaign contributions, the compromise of high-technology nuclear secrets to China, not to mention perjury and obstruction of justice--the list goes on and on. 
   Why is any of this important? It is all about a concept that is basic to America, a concept as basic as going to church on Sunday. That concept is: Equal application of the law. 
   Only the media can ultimately protect this fundamental principle by informing the people about what is happening. If the people do not know, of course, they will not care. The role of the media is critical in protecting our liberties. So again, I appeal to the media to cover this story, not to cover up this story. 
   Does anyone care? I believe the American people care. But they must be informed first. 
   Let me conclude by recalling the words of Chuck Colson. In writing about his own case, he said:  
   I pleaded guilty after being told by Watergate prosecutor Leon Jaworski that my conviction would deter such a thing from [ever] happening again.  
   So I am here today to tell the American people, it just happened again. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the National Institutes of Health EPSCoR Program Act of 2000 with my colleague, Senator LANDRIEU of Louisiana. This legislation we are introducing today, when passed, stands to make a major impact on the scope of biomedical research done in America today. 
   Small and medium sized states, like ours, have been unfairly discriminated  against in their competition for federal research dollars. In 1978, Congress created the EPSCoR program (Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research), to make sure that all states would have the opportunity to compete for scientific research funds. Despite this intention, the EPSCoR program only served to exacerbate the exiting funding disparity. You may ask, how can this be so? The answer is really quite simple. 
   The EPSCoR program does not extend to one of the biggest sources of scientific research--the National Institutes of Health (NIH). We are all aware, the NIH budget is growing rapidly; NIH's FY 2000 budget is $17.9 billion--up 8.43 percent in the past 5 years. Yet, despite this tremendous boom, 24 states receive 93 percent of NIH research grants, while the other 26 states split the remaining 7 percent. 
   Although the NIH budget has resulted in great scientific gains, the research divide continues. One-half of the states have seen little benefit in the recent NIH increase. The time has come to correct this allocation program, but in a way that insures we have the best biomedical research in the world, and that those benefits are extended to the entire country. Research institutes provide a great opportunity to improve the health care delivery and quality in their home state, but only limited opportunity exists in half the states, because of the existing funding divide. 
   The legislation we are introducing will provide $200 million to NIH-EPSCoR states will enable states that currently receive historically low amounts of NIH grants to participate in two special funds. 
   The first fund is to finance new infrastructure needs in these states. Because of their continued lack of equitable funding, many EPSCoR states have fallen behind in their infrastructure needs and are unable to compete against non-EPSCoR states. Our legislation will allocate $3.5 million each year to every NIH-EPSCoR state, to be used for projects the state EPSCoR committee targets as meeting the state biomedical research committees' goals. Because the state is responsible for choosing its infrastructure needs, we may finally be able to get away from the yearly requests for special projects in our states and allow federal funds to be spent in the most efficient manner possible. 
   The second fund is dedicated toward research in the new NIH-EPSCoR. This research is for meritorious projects, co-funded by the NIH-EPSCoR fund and the NIH Institute or Center. These projects must meet existing NIH standards or merit and quality, but will not have to compete against proposals from the non-EPSCoR states, which already dominate the grant process. 
   Finally, this process will be self sustaining. Because research is typically less expensive to perform in NIH-EPSCoR states, the savings in administrative costs are recaptured to fund additional research. In FY 1999 we estimate these savings would have added up to $49 million, which would have flowed back to NIH-EPSCoR states for additional research projects. 
   In recent years, we have made great strides in biomedical research, however, that research has been limited to only a select few. I ask you to join us in resolving this discrepancy and restore equity to the NIH process and would invite my colleagues to join us in this effort.

   Mr. INHOFE. First of all, I compliment the Senator on the time and effort he has devoted on probably the most difficult subject and working out some of these problems. 
   I have an amendment I wish to offer. I understand it is not going to be appropriate until later on. I want to tell you what it is. It is a sense of the Senate on fully funding impact aid. I notice that S. Con. Res. 101 does address this. It says:  
   It is the sense of the Senate that levels in this resolution assume that impact aid programs strive to reach the goal that all local education agencies eligible for impact aid receive a minimum of 40 percent.  
   Now my concern would be this. In the State of Oklahoma, overall, we are at about 36 percent now. However, we have some well below that and some above that. In this sense of the Senate, would it be assumed that those below 40 percent would be raised to 40 percent but not that those who are above it would be reduced to 40 percent, or some level lower than they are currently?

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, later today, I will introduce an amendment to the budget resolution concerning impact aid. It is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution and is very straight forward, it simply recognizes the importance of impact aid and states that it should be fully funded. Now, I realize that there are too few dollars chasing many worthy programs, but impact aid is a promise, that we, the federal government, have made to the states. I believe we should live up to our obligation and fully fund this program. 
   For those colleagues who are unfamiliar with impact aid, allow me to briefly describe the program. It is one of the oldest federal education programs, dating from the 1950's, and is meant to compensate local school districts for the ``substantial and continuing financial burden'' resulting from federal activities. These activities include federal ownership of certain lands as well as the enrollment in local school districts of children of parents who work and/or live on federal land. The rationale for compensation is that federal government activities deprive the local school district of the ability to collect property or sales taxes from these individuals (for example, members of the Armed Forces living on military bases, or Native American families living on reservations) even though the school district is obligated to provide free public education to their children. Thus, impact aid is designed to compensate the school district for the loss of tax revenue. 
   If the program is fully funded, the formula used to determine a local school district payment is fairly straight forward. Each child is assigned a weight based on the type of ``federal activity'' the family is involved in. For example: 
         Indian Children on reservations   1.25     Military children on post   1.0     Military children off post   0.1     Civilian children on reservation   1.0     Civilian children off reservation   0.05     Low rent housing   0.1  
   Next, the weighted student count is multiplied by a cost factor which reflects the greater of one-half of the state average per-pupil expenditure or one-half of the national average per-pupil expenditure. The local school district provides this information to the U.S. Department of Education who in turn writes a check to compensate the district for the loss of revenue. 
   In my state of Oklahoma, if the Impact Aid Program was fully funded, we would have received $63 million in fiscal year 2000 as opposed to $23 million we received. That is a difference of 63 percent. This chart shows what each state would have received in fiscal year 2000 if the program had been fully funded versus what they receive through the formula. As you can see all states do better with full funding and 35 states would have their payment increase by 50 percent or better. 
   I would be remiss, if I did not acknowledge that the appropriators have worked very hard to increase funding for impact aid. In fact, in each year since fiscal year 1995, there has been an increase in impact aid. 
   However, I believe we need to realize how not fully funding this program hurts local school districts. When this program is not fully funded, the federal shortfall has to be made up with local dollars which means that projects that would have been undertaken have to be postponed. My staff has done a little research into what type of spending is postponed. What they found is very telling of the type of pressure the federal government is putting on our schools because we fail to fulfill our obligation to them. For instance, the consequences of not fully funding impact aid means schools cannot afford to: 
   Buy handicapped accessible buses; buy classroom computers; buy computer upgrades; buy textbook replacements/updates; hire teachers to lower pupil teacher ratio; hire necessary staff for Special Education programs; hire necessary staff for Gifted and Talented programs; provide professional development for staff; provide adequate building security; provide for remedial instructional needs; or do basic building maintenance. 
   Full funding of impact aid means that local dollars that are now being used to offset lack of federal dollars can be used to take care of the above mentioned needs. For the school district it is like getting two dollars for every one dollar because it frees up their dollars to purchase buses, do building maintenance or hire additional staff to lower pupil/teacher ratios. 
   Mr. President, full funding of impact aid is not a luxury, it is a necessity. Our schools are in a funding crisis that  the federal government has created because we have failed to fulfill our commitment to them. We must compensate them for lost revenue because of federal activity in their area that prevents them from collecting sufficient property and sales taxes. This is not a handout; it is an obligation by the federal government to make school districts whole. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and join me in asking the appropriators to fully fund impact aid for fiscal year 2001.

   Mr. INHOFE. Yes. If the Senator will yield further, I do support what the chairman is doing. I would like to do more. Impact aid is a promise; it is an obligation. We have taken things away from the tax base that preclude States from financially supporting their schools, and it happens that between our military installations and our Indian population and some of the unique ways we handle it in the State of Oklahoma, we are impacted greatly by this program. 
   So I appreciate the fact that the Senator has made an effort to stop the President in his budget from reducing impact aid, but I would like to do a little more if I could. 
   I thank the Senator.

   Mr. INHOFE. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   I think one thing the Senator from Texas, Mrs. HUTCHISON, failed to say is that she has legislation to do the very thing she is talking about that is critical to more than just the economy of this country and just the price of oil but also to our national security. 
   I can remember in 1985 serving in the other body. At that time, we and Secretary of the Interior Hodel had a dog-and-pony show where we would go around the Nation and explain to people in consumption States that our dependency on foreign sources for our oil was a national security issue. That means we are dependent upon them for our ability to fight a war. This is an incontrovertible fact. In fact, if you go back to World War I, the wars have been won by those countries that have control of the energy. 
   I certainly applaud Senator HUTCHISON for her legislation. I am a cosponsor. 
   I think this is one of the ways we do it. We have two major sources in this country that we need to tap: One is in the State of Alaska, and offshore. I have been up there. I know how compatible that is to the ecology up there. I believe we are going to have to do it. Of course, in our areas, to some degree--Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Texas in the oil belt--we have tremendous reserves. But all of it is in shallow steppes. 
   She talks about 15 barrels a day. I used to do this for a living. I was a tool dresser on a table tool rig. Nobody knows what a table tool rig is anymore. But at that time, you had to work and work very hard. 
   It costs us in the United States of America 10 times as much to lift a barrel of oil out of the ground than it costs in Saudi Arabia. 
   You would think we were smart enough in this country to learn from experience, but we are not. In 1973, we were going through exactly the same thing we are going through today. The OPEC countries could produce oil cheaply. They had control of this. We were at that time only 36-percent dependent upon them, but that was enough for them to control to the extent they lowered the price and starved out the small, marginal well producers and stripper producers. They were no longer able to stay in business. 
   It is not easy to say: It is fine now because it is $38 a barrel, or $28 a barrel. It doesn't work that way. There has to be a predictability of price. 
   When you are making an investment decision to drill one of these wells, that has to be made about 6 months before you actually go into the ground. If you have fluctuating prices, you can't find many people who are willing to risk their capital to go in the ground. We have to have predictability. The only way we are going to have that is with a national energy policy. 
   I have probably been the chief critic of this administration in every area, from energy to national defense. But in this case I have to, in all fairness, say we do not have a national energy policy. We tried to get a national energy policy under President Reagan, under President Bush, and certainly under President Clinton. We have not been able to do it. This is where we are going to have to concentrate our efforts. 
   I think people who are concerned about prices need to understand there is another thing coming, and that is the EPA. Truck drivers have been requesting that Congress step in to reduce the cost of diesel fuel. If they think prices are high now, wait until the EPA finalizes their sulfur and diesel rule. I have talked to small refiners. They do not know how they can operate at that particular level. That is going to have a direct effect. It could double the cost of diesel. 
   Yesterday, Carol Browner said she wanted to eliminate the oxygenate mandate in fuels. However, she wants to mandate that all fuels contain a 1.5-percent renewable component. That means the cost is going to go up. It is done under the banner of the ecology. 
   The issue we are dealing with today is far more serious than just the price of gas at the pumps or the price of oil to heat our houses. This is a national security issue. We are now dependent upon foreign sources for our ability to defend America. 
   It has to come to a stop. The only way it can come to a stop is develop a national energy policy, the cornerstone of which is a percentage beyond which we cannot go beyond for dependence on foreign sources. I applaud the chairman for his efforts and join in the efforts to bring about such a policy.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I don't think there has been anyone in this body who has been more critical of the administration for the things that have taken place, for what has happened to our defense industry, for what has happened in many other problem areas that have come up, but I have to rise today to actually compliment the administration for an action that they took on March 14 of this year when they filed an article 84 action with the International Civil Aviation Organization, usually referred to as ICAO. 
   ICAO was put together as an organization where all of the nations that with aviation and commercial aviation would agree to certain standards so there is some degree of uniformity. They got together and determined we would have a noise standard that was classified as chapter 3. 
   The European Union, and I hate to say this, has demonstrated much arrogance. I guess they think that all of a sudden they have gone from a small fish in the pond to the big fish in the pond and they have totally disregarded agreements they have made. They signed an agreement, a trade agreement, an ICAO agreement with all of the other countries saying that by a certain date they would have to have chapter 3 noise level. 
   Then, not too long ago, they unilaterally decided they were going to abrogate that treaty and unilaterally say that they are going to not allow chapter 3 noise level unless it is done through new airplanes or re-engining, so a muffling system that takes it to the same noise level would not comply. 
   This means we in the United States are discriminated against. I think everyone is aware the big competition worldwide now is Boeing aircraft in the United States and Airbus in Europe. As a result of this, it gives a tremendous advantage to Airbus over Boeing. They would be financially discriminating against the U.S. in a way that would cost the United States and depreciate the value of the inventory of many of our Boeing aircraft. 
   The ``hush'' industry is a huge industry in the United States. They have been able to use this technology to bring down the noise level of existing aircraft to chapter 3 standards, and it shouldn't make any difference how we get to this level. 
   The administration has taken this into consideration when on March 14 they passed an article 84 against the European Union with ICAO. I think it is very significant. I know it will be a long and drawn out process, but I hope and I admonish the administration not to use the fact that it will be a long and drawn out process to go sideways or to cave in on this very critical issue to American workers and American manufacturers. 
   I can assure the administration that we will be working with them very closely to correct this action to be able to use any method that can be used that is on the market today in order to reach the chapter 3 noise standards. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am pleased that the State Department has filed an Article 84 petition with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). This will provide the basis for the United States to demonstrate that the European Union's (EU) hushkit regulation is not in accordance with international noise standards set by ICAO and is essentially targeting U.S. aerospace. Already this unfair regulation has hurt U.S. aerospace companies and workers because of the uncertainty it has introduced into the marketplace. Accordingly, it is imperative that the Administration pursue this Article 84 forcefully to show that we will not stand for discriminatory rules that hurt U.S. interests. If we do not make this point clearly, strongly, and now, we will have done nothing to prevent future efforts by the EU to act without regard to international standards and in ways designed to harm the United States' longstanding primacy in aerospace. 
   Filing an Article 84 is the beginning of what may be a long process. The mere fact that it may take a period of time should not serve as an inducement to the Administration to seek to shortcut the ICAO process by entering into a negotiated settlement that does not fully protect our aerospace industry and workforce. Further, we must make clear that the principle of adhering to international standards is essential in an industry as global as aviation. If we fail to demonstrate the seriousness with which we take this matter, we will inevitably have done nothing more than encourage the EU to try such incursions in the future. 
   I can assure you that I and many others will be working to see that the right message is delivered on this critical matter.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for yielding to me. 
   Last year, at the end of the session, I came to the floor and informed the White House, as well as my colleagues, that of a list of 13 proposed appointments, 8 were acceptable. I did this by checking with my colleagues to find out who would be placing holds on which of those 13 nominees. There were five that would have had holds on them. 
   I further stated that if anyone other than the eight were appointed, I would put a hold on all judicial nominations for the 2nd session of the 106th Congress. This policy was the result of an exchange of letters with the administration last summer in which the White House agreed to provide a list of potential recess appointments prior to adjournment so that the Senate could act on these appointments and avoid contentious action on recess appointments. The 8 to which I agreed were from a list of 13 that was provided by the White House, and I read those into the RECORD. 
   On December 9 the White House gave a recess appointment to Stuart Weisberg to the OSHA Review Commission, and on December 17 the White House gave a recess appointment to Sarah Fox to the National Labor Relations Board. They were not on the list of 13 that was received on November 18 and to which I referred on November 19. Based on these actions, I believe the White House violated their commitment by making these recess appointments. Therefore, I said I would put a hold on every judicial nomination this year. I believe this is the correct reaction to the action taken by the White House.

   Mr. INHOFE. I thank the majority leader. 
   I hate to interrupt this love-in, but I want an opportunity to explain my actions. First of all, I want to say to the majority leader that I appreciate his acknowledgement of the accuracy of what happened on November 19. That is important to me. There have been some erroneous statements made in various newspapers reflecting the existence of other lists, and all that. 
   The bottom line is this: We made a request, the list came forward, and 10 minutes before we adjourned on November 19 we read from the list. 
   I believe there were strong reasons why the two particular nominees, Weisberg and Fox, would have been unacceptable. There are several Senators I have spoken with who would have found them unacceptable--frankly, I am one of them--and who would have been placed holds on those two individuals had they known that recess appointments were imminent. Some would have placed holds or at the very least insisted that hearings be held to explore the important policy matters surrounding these two appointments. 
   I think that is irrelevant. The fact is, the names were not on the Nov. 19 list. If the names had been on that list, that would have been totally different. Maybe some would have objected to them so they would not have been brought forward. The point is, appointments were made, and they violated the statements and the intent of the letter that we received from the White House vowing to honor their commitment. 
   I say to the majority leader, it is my intention, if we go forward at some point to vote on the two particular nominations to which you referred, that I will want to be heard and go back and maybe talk a little bit about what happened to bring us to the point where we are today. 
   I add that the President is not keeping his commitments. I think when I read his letter there is no question in my mind. I made it abundantly clear on the floor what the consequences would be. 
   I say, also, that I am in a position, I say to the majority leader, that while the President does not keep his commitments, I do keep my commitments. My commitments are to do what I can to try to block judicial nominations.

   Mr. INHOFE. No, not now. 
   I just say this. In following through with my commitment to try to block the confirmations, while it is not my intention--if the handwriting is on the wall--to just arbitrarily lay down blanket filibusters, I do intend to consult with my colleagues and reserve my rights under the rules to assess what actions, if any, can succeed in this effort. 
   I want to make one other comment about this, too; that is, you hear a lot of yelling and screaming about: Oh, what are we going to do without these appointments that we have to have? I remind you, back in 1993, at the end of the Bush administration--he was ready to go out of office--there were 109 vacancies in the Federal judiciary. In other words, the Democratic controlled Congress failed to fill these vacancies. 
   Right now, there are 74 vacancies in the Federal judiciary. If you determine where we would be if normal history takes its course through deaths or resignations, at the most there would be another 25 vacancies. That means, at the most, we would have about 100 vacancies at the end of President Clinton's term. Compare that to the 109 vacancies left after the Bush administration. I make that comment to offset the argument before it is made as to what type of judicial crisis will come about if we ended up without judicial nominees being confirmed.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I would like to make a couple of statements about the vote that just took place, the reason for it, the history behind it, where we are today, and where we are going from here. 
   First of all, I suggest during the 5-day Memorial Day recess there was a pending nominee on whom there had been several holds. It is my understanding the appropriate committee had not received the financial information on that individual and there were  other problems that had been voiced that precipitated the holds. Consequently, during that 5-day Memorial Day recess, President Clinton went ahead and granted him a recess appointment. 
   I think the majority leader was correct when he said there have been Democrat Presidents as well as Republican Presidents who have made recess appointments. Frankly, I do not think the Republicans should have done it. I do not think the Democrats should have done it. If we go back and read the Constitution on what recess appointments are all about, we would see that back in the horse-and-buggy days when we would be in session for just a few weeks every other year, and if there were a death of a Secretary of State or something like that, it was necessary to put ourselves in a position where the President would be able to fill that vacancy. That was the whole intent of recess appointments. 
   In 1985, President Reagan was making recess appointments because at that time we had a conservative Republican President and we had a liberal Democrat-controlled Senate. Consequently, he wanted to get his conservatives passed, so he went ahead and made recess appointments. I do not believe he should have made those appointments. I think that contradicted the provisions in the Constitution. However, he did it anyway. 
   At that time, the minority leader, the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia, Mr. BYRD, did what was perfectly appropriate, and that was to send a letter to the President to say: Before you violate the constitutional prerogative of the Senate in its advise and consent power on any future recess appointments, I request a letter from you at a time with sufficient notice before the recess goes into effect. I request that you notify the Senate of what recess appointments you are intending to make during that recess and why. 
   Sufficient notice was interpreted and vocalized several times by Senator BYRD to be adequate notice so we would know they were coming up, so we could go to Members and see if there were anyone who would want to put a hold on a judicial or any kind of nominee during the recess and have adequate time to act on it before recess. In the extreme case, I suppose we could have just gone into a pro forma session and not gone into recess. Nevertheless, that is what he requested from President Reagan. I might add, President Reagan did agree to that request. He sent a letter that was satisfactory to Senator BYRD, so that set the precedent. 
   Because of the recess appointments of this President, I merely did the same thing Senator BYRD did back in 1985. I sent a letter, a communication to the White House, and I said: Because of your appointments, I am going to make the same request Senator BYRD made of President Reagan, with which President Reagan complied, and that is that you notify us in advance of any appointments you plan to have. If not, we will put holds on all appointments at that time--all nonmilitary nominees. 
   We did not get the letter for awhile. A few trial letters came over, but they were not consistent with what President Reagan had agreed to. Finally, on June 15, 1999, President Clinton sent a letter that said:  
   I share your opinion that the understanding reached in 1985 between President Reagan and Senator BYRD cited in your letter remains a fair and constructive framework, which my administration will follow.  
   He agreed to follow the same mandates President Reagan did. 
   At that time, I wrote a letter back praising the President for agreeing to abide by the same agreement as the Byrd-Reagan agreement. However, on November 10, as we approached our recess, I anticipated the President might be tempted to make recess appointments that were not consistent with that agreement. So I sent a letter to him that says:  
   If you do make recess appointments during the upcoming recess which violate the spirit of our agreement--  
   Then I went into the details as to what the spirit was; there had to be adequate notice on a list we could consider and pass around to our colleagues--  
   then we will respond by placing holds on all judicial nominees. The result would be a complete breakdown in cooperation between our two branches of government on this issue which could prevent the confirmation of any such nominees next year. We do not want this to happen. We urge you to cooperate in good faith with the Majority Leader concerning all contemplated recess appointments.  
   That was signed by me and by 16 other Senators. Almost all, I believe--most of them, anyway--voted against the motion to proceed a few minutes ago. 
   On November 17--I remember that well; it was my 65th birthday--I made a speech on the floor, and in that speech, anticipating there could be a misunderstanding of what our intent was, I said, on November 17, on this floor, at this podium:  
   I want to make sure there is no misunderstanding and that we don't go into a recess with the President not understanding that we are very serious....... It is not just me putting a hold on all judicial nominees for the remaining year of his term, but 16 other Senators have agreed to do that....... I want to make sure it is abundantly clear without any doubt in anyone's mind in the White House--I will refer back to this document I am talking about right now--that in the event the President makes recess appointments, we will put holds on all judicial nominations for the remainder of his term. It is very fair for me to stand here and eliminate any doubts in the President's mind of what we will do.  
   That is exactly what we said on the floor, and I am going back now and reminding this body of that statement. 
   On November 19--that was the day we were going out of session on recess, and it would be a lengthy recess going until January, the State of the Union time--the President notified the Senate of contemplated recess appointments. This was in compliance with the intent of the letter. 
   I hasten to say here it is not quite in compliance because this is on the day we are going into recess. But nonetheless, in the spirit of cooperation and fairness, we agreed to take this list and to read the list and to go to our colleagues and see what names were on this list of 13 nominees whom he desired to appoint during the recess, and we found there were 5 on the list who were unacceptable to some Members of the Senate. So we sent back to him that communication, that there are 8 of them, and if there were any appointments other than these 8, that would be in violation of the letter. 
   To reaffirm that, the majority leader was good enough to let me be the last speaker on this floor, where I stood here 10 minutes before we went into recess and I made a rather lengthy talk, of which I will just repeat a little bit right now. I said:  
   If anyone other than these eight individuals is recess appointed, we will put a hold on every single judicial nominee of this President for the remainder of his term in office....... I reemphasize, if there is some other interpretation as to the meaning of the (Nov. 10) letter, it does not make any difference, we are still going to put holds on them. I want to make sure that there is a very clear understanding: If these nominees come in, if he does violate the intent (of the agreement) as we interpret it [by appointing anyone other than these eight], then we will have holds on [all judicial] nominees.  
   There was one individual about whom the majority leader came to me, right after that, after we went into recess. He said: You know, we made a mistake, there was one other individual. Let's increase that to nine people instead of eight. 
   I said: That's fine. 
   We sent a letter to the President dated November 23 that, in the spirit of cooperation, we are adding one name to the list:  
   I hope this makes our position clear. Any recess appointments other than the nine listed above would constitute a violation of the spirit of our agreement and trigger multiple holds on all judicial nominees.  
   On December 7 we urged the White House not to violate the agreement. Yet, we found that by December 17 the White House did, and President Clinton did, in fact, violate the agreement directly and blatantly by appointing both Sarah Fox to the NLRB and Stuart Weisberg to the OSHA Review Commission. 
   It happens that both of these recess appointments that violated our agreement would have been objected to by a number of Senators, two of whom are in this Chamber right now. However, that is not significant. There are reasons we would have found that objectionable. But even if they had been acceptable, it still violated the very specific agreement we had. 
   On December 20, I stated:  
   I am announcing today that I will do exactly what I said I would do if the President deliberately violated our agreement.  
   And on January 25, 2000, I did just that. I placed a hold on all judicial nominees. On this Senate floor I said:  
   It was in anticipation of just such defiance--  
   I am talking about the President's defiance of the Senate's prerogative to advise and consent to nominees--  
   It was in anticipation of just such defiance that I and my colleagues warned the President on at least five separate occasions exactly what our response would be if he violated this agreement. We would put a hold on all judicial nominees. So today it will come as no surprise to the President that we are putting a hold on all judicial nominees. We are simply doing what we said we would do to uphold constitutional respect for the Senate's proper role in the confirmation process.  
   Today we have agreed--I did not agree, but we went ahead and agreed to bring up two nominees on which I did assert my prerogative and say we are going to have rollcall votes on every nominee that does come up, and those rollcall votes are going to be taking place in about 15 minutes. 
   I say for those individuals who hysterically talked about the chaos that would be created in the event we put holds on all nominees, and no nominees were, in fact, appointed by this President for the last year of his administration and confirmed by the Senate, if you go back and look at what happened in January of 1993--that was the last month President Bush was in office--there were 109 vacancies in the judiciary. In other words, 109 vacancies that the then-Democrat-controlled Senate failed to act upon. 
   Today, there are 74 vacancies in the judiciary. In the event normal history takes its course and the normal number of either deaths or resignations take place, it will be not more than 25 more. In other words, there will be approximately 100 vacancies at the end of President Clinton's term of office. That is still nine fewer than there were at the end of President Bush's administration. 
   This is sad. We are in the process of giving up an opportunity, by voting on some of these, for the first time in 7 years of this President's administration of holding him to his word. He has broken his word over and over. He has told lies to the American people over and over, and to this body he has broken his commitment. What we are giving up is our last and maybe only opportunity in 8 years to hold this President to his commitment. What is going on today is very sad. I deeply regret it. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all I applaud the White House--this is probably the first time I have done that in 7 years--for responding to an issue that is very critical, probably one of the most critical issues we will be facing. 
   Going back in the history of recess appointments, the Constitution provided for recess appointments to be allowed, thereby avoiding the constitutional prerogative of the Senate of advice and consent in certain conditions. The major condition was that a vacancy would occur during the course of the recess. This goes back to the horse-and-buggy days when we were in session for 2 or 3 months at a time and then we were gone. So if someone such as the Secretary of State would die in office, it would allow the President to replace that person without having to go through the advice and consent. 
   Throughout the years, both Democrat and Republican Presidents have  abused this. They have made recess appointments. In 1985, President Reagan made quite a few of them. The majority at that time, the Democrats, under the majority leadership of Senator BYRD from West Virginia, made the determination that he was making too many recess appointments. 
   He challenged the President to submit a letter that would outline future recess appointments during the Reagan administration. In 1985, a letter was sent from President Reagan to then-majority leader, Senator BYRD from West Virginia that stated no more recess appointments would take place unless the names of the individuals who were considered for recess appointment were submitted in writing in sufficient time in advance that the majority or minority leaders could take some type of action. 
   For example, if they were going to have someone recess appointed for the express purpose of avoiding the advice and consent of the Senate, then they would just not go into recess; they would go into pro forma, where they would have someone in the Chair all the time to make sure that did not happen. Also, it would be an opportunity to make sure they were not doing it for the express purpose of avoiding advice and consent. 
   Last May, there was an appointment during the recess of James Hormel to be Ambassador to Luxembourg. There were several people who were opposed to his appointment and had holds on his appointment. The major reason was not that he was a gay activist, but he had not submitted the appropriate financial information to the appropriate committee for consideration. The President went ahead and appointed him. 
   Consequently--that was already done, and there was no attempt to undo it even though it was contrary to the Constitution--I sent a letter to the President asking him if he would agree to the same thing Ronald Reagan agreed to back in 1985. Of course, I did not get a very favorable response. However, I said: In the event I do not do that, I will put a hold on every nondefense or nonmilitary appointment or nominee from the President. And I did so. 
   The weeks went by, and finally I got a letter from the President that said:  
   I share your opinion that the understanding reached in 1985 between President Reagan and Senator Byrd cited in your letter remains a fair and constructive framework which my administration will follow.  
   I have been concerned because this President has a long history of doing things he says he is not going to do and not doing things he says he will do. Consequently, I sent a letter to the President which I submitted for the RECORD last Wednesday. The letter was dated November 10, signed by myself and 16 other Senators, that said: Make sure you comply with the spirit of this agreement, this letter you have sent; we are going to serve notice right now that in the event you have recess appointments that do not comply with the spirit of the letter, we will put holds for the remaining of the term of your Presidency on all of the judicial nominees. A very serious thing. I repeated this several times last Wednesday to make sure there was no misunderstanding. 
   Since that time, the White House has cooperated and submitted a list of 13 names. I will read these names and the positions for which they have been nominated: Cliff Stuart, EEOC; Delmond Won, Commissioner of the Federal Maritime Commission; Leonard Page, general counsel for the Labor Relations Board; Luis Laurado, Development Bank; Mark Schneider, Peace Corps; Frank Holleman, Deputy Secretary of Education; Mike Walter, Veterans Administration; Mr. Jeffers, whose first name I do not have, J-E-F-F-E-R-S; Bill Lann Lee, Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights; Sally Katzen, Deputy Director of OMB; 
   John Holum, Under Secretary for Arms Control and International Security of the Department of State; Carl Spielvogel, Ambassador to the Slovak Republic; and Jay Johnson--not to be confused with the military Jay Johnson--a nominee for the U.S. Mint. 
   Of this list of 13, there are 5 who either have holds on them or there are intended holds on these individuals. Consequently, I make the statement at this time--and I think it is very important the RECORD reflect this accurately and everyone understands it thoroughly--that anyone other than the names I will read off--Cliff Stuart, Delmond Won, Leonard Page, Luis Laurado, Mark Schneider, Frank Holleman, Mike Walker, Mr. Jeffers--if there are any names that are submitted and are sought to be appointed during this recess, recess appointments, we, who undersigned the letter on the 10th of this month, will put a hold on every judicial nominee who comes before the Senate during the entire remainder of the term of President Clinton. 
   I am going to repeat that because it is very important. Any name, other than these eight names I just read, who is recess appointed, if anyone other than these eight individuals is recess appointed, we will put a hold on every single judicial nominee of this President for the remainder of his term of office. That means specifically we will not agree to Bill Lann Lee, Sally Katzen, John Holum, Carl Spielvogel, and Jay Johnson. 
   I will conclude with that. I reemphasize, if there is some other interpretation as to the meaning of the letter, it does not make any difference, we are still going to put the holds on them. I want to make sure there is a very clear understanding, if these nominees come in, if he does violate the intent as we interpret it, then we will have holds on these nominees. 
   I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I was presiding when the distinguished Senator from Ohio was talking about the problems the U.N. faces in Kosovo. I share all of the concerns the Senator from Ohio expressed. In addition to that, since I am the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Readiness Subcommittee, I have another concern, and that is the deployment of troops in 1995 into Bosnia, then again to Kosovo, and the way they are being deployed today has put us in an apparent condition in terms of our state of readiness. 
   It is very unfortunate that during this administration we have had a cut in our force strength by approximately 50 percent, only to find out just last week that two of our Army divisions are now rated at C-4. That means they are not capable of combat today. Those  two divisions are the 10th Army Division, of which most are located in Bosnia, and the 1st Infantry Division located in Kosovo. 
   This means that if something should happen, we are not in a ready condition to defend America, where we do have national security interests which, in my opinion, we do not have and never had in either Bosnia or Kosovo. I stood side by side with the Senator from Ohio in trying to keep us from making that deployment. We were not successful. I do believe we should be looking very soon at any way we can bring our troops back to a state of readiness, to do what we are supposed to be doing, the No. 1 function of Government, and that is to defend America.

<TEXT>
   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have been a little disturbed not knowing the certainty of the schedule and how long we will have to get some things done at the last minute. I want to bring up one issue that has to be discussed briefly, and that is the issue of the range that has been used for 58 years on the island of Vieques located 6 miles off the shores of Puerto Rico. 
   I am concerned about this because we started using this range 58 years ago. We have become dependent upon it because it is the only range we can use that offers an integrated three-level type of training--first, high-altitude bombing; second, the type of protection that comes from the ships to the shore using live fire; and third, the Marine expeditionary amphibious movements. All three of those can be done simultaneously and have been done successfully over the last 58 years. 
   The problem we have with this range is that there is no place else in the Western Hemisphere that we can actually give the training to our troops. Right, now we have deployed into the Persian Gulf the U.S.S. Kennedy. Because this President put a moratorium on training in Vieques, only half of those deployed on the U.S.S. Kennedy have ever had the necessary training should they have to become involved in combat. 
   We have scheduled for the 18th of February the deployment of the U.S.S. Eisenhower Battle Group. If this battle group goes through the Mediterranean and goes to the Persian Gulf, the chances are better than 50-50 they will see combat. If we do not allow them to have the training on the island of Vieques prior to their deployment, they will have to go into combat very likely without ever having any live ordnance training. This goes for the pilots flying the F-18s and the F-14s that will be deployed off the U.S.S. Eisenhower. 
   I was there 3 weeks ago and watched them during their training, but they were unable to use live ordnances and use that range. It goes for the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit and the others who would be deployed at the same time. 
   I would like to quote, if I could, Gen. Wes Clark. Of course, he is one for whom we all have a great deal of respect. We watched the way he worked commanding the European forces and the NATO forces. He said:  
   The live fire training that our forces were exposed to at training ranges such as Vieques helped ensure that the forces assigned to this theater--  
   We are talking about Kosovo, those 78, 79 days--  
   were ready-on-arrival and prepared to fight, win and survive.  
   What General Clark is saying is, we were successful. Even though we should not have been in Kosovo to start with, once we made that decision, we were successful in dropping our cruise missiles in there and our bombs because of the training those pilots had on the island of Vieques. 
   Capt. James Stark, Jr., the commanding officer of the Roosevelt Roads Naval Station, said:  
   When you steam off to battle you're either ready or you're not. If you're not, that means casualties. That means more POWs. That means less precision and longer campaigns. You pay a price for all this in war, and that price is blood.  
   We are talking about American blood. I am very proud of all the military, uniformed and others. This is the first time in the years I have served in the Senate that they have been willing to stand up for something they know is right, not knowing for sure where the President is going to be on this issue. 
   The President has imposed a moratorium on training on the island of Vieques. We are going to try our best to encourage him, for the lives of Americans, to allow us to use it to train those people who are on the U.S.S. Eisenhower, ready to be deployed. 
   Richard Danzig, the Secretary of the Navy, said:  
   Only by providing this preparation can we fairly ask our service members to put their lives at risk.  
   In a joint statement between the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Chief of Naval Operations, and the Commandant of the Marine Corps, they said: Vieques provides integrated live-fire training ``critical to our readiness,'' and 
   the failure to provide for adequate live-fire training for our naval forces before deployment will place those forces at unacceptably high risk during deployment. 
   This is military language to mean casualties, those who can be killed in action. 
   I am proud of Admiral Johnson, the Chief of Naval Operations, and General Jones, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, when they say: Without the ability to train on Vieques, the U.S.S. Eisenhower Battle Group and the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit scheduled for deployment in February 2000 would not be ready for such deployment ``without greatly increasing the risk to those men and women who we ask to go in harm's way.'' 
   Lastly, Admiral Murphy, the Commander of the Sixth Fleet of the Navy, said: The loss of training on Vieques would ``cost American lives.'' 
   It is a very serious thing. I sometimes listen to the complaints we hear from some of the Puerto Ricans, but mostly from the people of the island of Vieques, who say: Wait a minute. How would you like to have bombs dropped and live ordnances fired where you are? 
   You can't do anything about that. They actually have a 10-mile buffer range between the bombing range and where people live. 
   I happen to represent the State of Oklahoma. We have a very fine organization there called Fort Sill, where we do all our artillery training. I have said on the floor here several times before that, while on Vieques they have a 10-mile buffer zone, we have only a 1-mile buffer zone in the State of Oklahoma between a population of 100,000 people living in Lawton and the live-fire range. 
   So let me just wind up and conclude by saying that many of us, including Senator WARNER, the chairman of our Armed Services Committee, are asking the President and pleading with him to work out some type of arrangement to, at the very least during this interim while we are in recess, provide for training on the island of Vieques because if that does not happen, we will lose American lives. 
   I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, while presiding and listening to some of my distinguished colleagues talking about the lack of productivity of this session of the legislature, there are a few things that were very productive and that we can be very proud of when we go home and say we were able to get certain things done. 
   Before doing that, though, and to ensure I get one point out before using up the time that is allotted, the distinguished Senator from Illinois named a number of issues that he thought were somewhat disgraceful--for example, the fact that we do not have more gun control legislation. 
   Maybe because of my roots back in Oklahoma, I find it very difficult to understand this mentality, that somehow guns are the culprit as opposed to the people, and somehow that honest, law-abiding Americans should have to be disarmed, should have to give up their guns, while the criminal element would not be giving up their guns. 
   Time and time again, every survey that has been done, every study that has taken place, has come to the conclusion that the problems that we have are of a criminal element. There are people out there who are not getting adequately punished, and they will continue to have firearms. 
   I will just make one statement. It seems incredibly naive to me anyone could believe that if we pass a law that makes it illegal for all citizens to own guns, somehow the criminal element, who by their very definition and nature, are criminals, will comply with the law. 
   Also, it seems very frustrating to me that we have a 
   President of the United States who wants to have all kinds of legislation to take away guns from law-abiding citizens and at the same time turns 16 terrorists loose on the streets of America; that we have a President of the United States who will make speeches--as this President made some 133 times, including in two State of the Union Messages--that now, for the first time in contemporary history, the first time since the dawn of the nuclear age, there is not one--I repeat, not one--missile aimed at American children tonight. When he made that statement, he knew full well that in at least one country, China, there were a minimum of at least 13 American cities that were targeted at that very moment. So we are living in a very dangerous world. 
   I listened to the concerns that we have on the nuclear test ban treaty. As chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I would like to kind of lead into that to at least explain to thinking people that we did the right thing by not unilaterally disarming with the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which is not verifiable. 
   First of all, I can say--and I do not think anyone can challenge this statement--we are now in the most threatened position that we have been in, in the history of America. By that, I mean for things that have happened in the last 7 years in three broad categories. 
   First of all, we have a President of the United States who, through his veto messages, starting in 1993 in vetoing the defense authorization bills, and then succeeding bills since that  time, has done so, so that we would have to cut down the size of our military, so that we now have ended up having a force strength of one-half of what we had in 1991 and 1992 during the Persian Gulf war. 
   It is not a matter of the President vetoing defense authorization bills and taking money out of our defense system to put into his favorite domestic social programs, but at the same time he has deployed our troops to places all over the Earth where we have no national security interests. So now we have troops in Bosnia. 
   I remember in December of 1995, when we were on the floor trying to pass a resolution of disapproval, to stop the President from sending our rare military assets to places such as Bosnia. We lost it by three votes. The President said: Let me do this. If we defeat this resolution, and if we get to send troops into Bosnia, I promise they will be home for Christmas 1996. Here we are. We are getting close to Christmas 1999 and the troops are still not home. There is no end in sight. 
   We have the same thing in Kosovo. We have had serious problems. I have gone over to Kosovo, I am sure, more than any other Member has, only to find out this is a war that has been going on for 600 years, a war where the two sides alternate in who is the good guy and who is the bad guy. Ethnic cleansing has taken place historically for 600 years on both sides; both on the Serbian side and the Albanian side. 
   So it was a horrible awakening I had when I was over there, right after we went in there with cruise missiles, where we had refugees in different places such as Tirana, Albania. I can remember walking through the refugee camp. The people were well cared for. They were doing quite well. But then they looked at me and said: When are you and America going to do something about our problem? 
   I said: What is your problem? 
   They said: Well, we're refugees. 
   I said: Why should we in the United States be as concerned about that as other countries? 
   They said: Because it is because of you that we are refugees. It is because the ethnic cleansing was not accelerated until the time that the bombs started being dropped on that town. 
   So we now have a weakened defense system because we have starved it into a degree of weakness. Yet we are living in a time when virtually every country has weapons of mass destruction. 
   And now we find out that in conventional warfare we are not superior anymore. Wake up America. We are not superior anymore. We found out the other day that two of our Army divisions are ranked as C-4, which means they are not capable of combat. And what are these divisions? These divisions are the 10th Army Mountain Division in Bosnia and the 1st Infantry Division in Kosovo. 
   It is not the fault of our troops. They are put in places and they no longer have combat training, so they are not capable of combat without coming out of there and training for at least 6 months. 
   So if we are down to 10 Army divisions because of this President, and 2 of them are rendered incapable of combat, that is 8 Army divisions. We had 19 during the Persian Gulf war. So that is what has happened to our military. 
   Just the other day I was very proud of Gen. John Jumper, who had the courage to stand up and say publicly that we are no longer superior in air-to-air and air-to-ground combat. Our strategic fighters are not superior to those others on the market. He stated the SU-35, as made by the Russians, is on the market right now, the open market. It is for sale. Anyone can buy it--Iraq, Iran, Syria, Libya, anybody else--and it is better than anything we have, including the F-15 and the F-16. 
   We have to face up to this. It is a threat from the conventional side as well as from missiles. 
   I will make one comment about the missiles. Again, we hang this on President Clinton. In that same veto message in 1993, President Clinton said: I'm vetoing this bill. And I'm vetoing it because it has money in it for a national missile defense system, which we do not need because there is no threat out there. Yet we knew from our intelligence that the threat would be there and imminent by fiscal year 1998. And sure enough, it was. 
   So here we are with the combination of all these countries out there that have every kind of weapon of mass destruction: Biological, chemical, or nuclear. 
   Yet we have countries such as China and Russia and now North Korea that have the capability of delivering those warheads to anywhere in America right now, when we are in Washington, DC. They could fire one from North Korea that would take 35 minutes to get here. There is not one thing in our arsenal to knock it down because this President vetoed our national missile defense effort. 
   Now the American people have awakened to this, and we have enough Democrats who are supporting Republicans to rebuild our system and to try to get a national missile defense system deployed. Unfortunately, it couldn't happen for another 2 years, maybe 2 1/2 to 3 years. 
   That gets around to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty about which my distinguished colleague from Illinois was talking. I think probably the best thing that could have happened to us for our national security was to defeat that. If we don't have a national missile defense system, then what do we have to deter other countries from launching missiles at the United States? 
   What we have is a nuclear stockpile. We have nine weapons in the nuclear stockpile. Because of the President's moratorium, they haven't been tested for 7 years. We don't know whether or not they work. I suggest it might be better not even to have nuclear weapons than to have weapons but not know whether they work. That is exactly what we have right now. If we had passed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, there would be no verification, there would be no way in the world we would have known whether or not our stockpile was working because they hadn't been tested. 
   I can remember quote after quote after quote by the people who were so much involved in this from our energy labs. They all said--I had the quotes; I don't have them in front of me right now--that if we can't test these nuclear weapons, there is no way we can determine whether or not they work. It is a very unsafe thing for America. These were the directors of the labs responsible for this nuclear arsenal. 
   So of the nine weapons we have, which I have listed here, we only have one we have adequately tested enough to know whether or not it would work. That is the W-84 warhead that we know would work. 
   This would have been a real disaster for America. People kept saying President Eisenhower was for a comprehensive test ban treaty, that President Bush was, that President Reagan was. That isn't true at all. This flawed treaty was a zero-yield treaty. We would only have had the word of our adversaries that they would not test their nuclear arsenals. 
   We keep our word in America; we don't test our arsenal. But we don't have any idea whether or not they are going to test theirs. In fact, during the course of the debate, both China and Russia said they would not comply with the zero yield. There is no way in the world we can detect that, that we would know what our adversaries were doing. That would, for all practical purposes, be unilateral disarmament. 
   I am asked back in Oklahoma by people who have good street sense, why is it the liberals in Congress are so committed to disarming our country, to taking our money that we are supposed to have to defend America and putting it into these various discretionary social programs? I have to explain to them that the people in Washington, and some of the Senators in this Chamber, are not like the people of Oklahoma. I think President 
   Clinton honestly believes that if we all stand in a circle and hold hands and we unilaterally disarm, everyone will love each other and it won't be necessary to have a defense system. 
   That is what we are up against. In a very respectful way, I have to disagree with many of the things my distinguished colleague from Illinois stated. 
   I think we have had a very successful session. We have ensured a sound Social Security retirement system. We have improved educational opportunities for our children. Along this line, the major disagreement we had was that the Democrats thought the decisions should be made here in Washington; Republicans want to use the  same amount of money but not make the decisions in Washington but send that money to the school districts. The school board in Tulsa, OK, is much better equipped to know what their education needs are in Oklahoma than we are in this August body of the Senate. The Democrats say the answer is not school buses, not computers, not the physical facilities that are available; it is 100,000 teachers. I think the more we can send these decisions back to the local level, the better the people of America will be served. 
   I believe we have had a good session. I am not pleased with the way it is turning out right now. The old saying we have heard so many times in the past that there are two things you never want to watch while they are being made--one is sausage and the other is laws--becomes very true during the last few days of legislative sessions. 
   I think we have done a very good job. I think we did the right thing in defeating the unverifiable test ban treaty. I think we have passed legislation of which America will be very proud. I am anxious to end all this fun we are having and go home and tell the people in Oklahoma about it. 
   I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I wish to have a brief word about the issue of recess appointments. 
   For quite some number of years, Presidents--Democrats and Republicans--have, in my opinion, violated the Constitution by making recess appointments. The Constitution is very explicit when it says that recess appointments can only be made in the event the vacancy occurs during the recess. There is a reason for this, historically. 
   Back in the days when we were on horses and we had legislative sessions that might have lasted 1, 2, or 3 months, we found ourselves in recess more than we were in session. Therefore, on occasion it would be necessary for the Secretary of State, who may have died in office--or when vacancies had occurred while we were in recess--to have to reappoint somebody. So we did. It made sense. But since that time--over the last several years--that privilege has been abused. As I say, this is not just an abuse that takes place by Republican or Democrat Presidents; it is both of them equally. 
   Consequently, the Constitution, which says that the Senate has the prerogative of advice and consent, has been violated. It was put there for checks and balances. It was put there for a very good reason. That reason is just as legitimate today as it was when our Founding Fathers put it in there; that is, the Senate should advise and consent to these appointments. It means we should actually be in on the discussion as well as consenting to the decision the President has made by virtue of his nomination. 
   In 1985, President Reagan was making a number of recess appointments that, in my opinion, and in the opinion of most of the Democrats and Republicans, was not in keeping with the Constitution. And certainly the majority leader at that time--who was Senator BOB BYRD from West Virginia, the very distinguished Senator--made a request of the President not to make recess appointments. He extracted from him a commitment in writing that he would not make recess appointments and, if it should become necessary because of extraordinary circumstances to make recess appointments, that he would have to give the list to the majority leader--who was, of course, BOB BYRD--in sufficient time in advance that they could prepare for it either by agreeing in advance to the confirmation of that appointment or by not going into recess and staying in pro forma so the recess appointments could not take place. 
   In order to add some leverage to this, the majority leader, Senator BYRD, said he would hold up all Presidential appointments until such time as President Reagan would give him a letter agreeing to those conditions. The President did give him a letter. President Reagan gave him a letter. 
   I will quote for you from within this letter. This was on October 18, 1985. He said:  
   ..... prior to any recess breaks, the White House would inform the Majority Leader and [the Minority Leader] of any recess appointment which might be contemplated during such recess. They would do so in advance sufficiently to allow the leadership on both sides to perhaps take action to fill whatever vacancies that might be imperative during such a break. 
   This is exactly what we talked about. This is the reason President Reagan agreed to this. He gave a letter to Senator BYRD. Senator BYRD was satisfied. 
   Along came a recess last May or June, and the President did in fact appoint someone he had nominated long before the recess occurred--in fact, not just months but even more than a year before that--and who had not complied with the necessary information in order to come up for confirmation. In that case, President Clinton did in fact violate the intent of the appointment process in the advice and consent provision found in the Constitution. 
   I wrote a letter to President Bill Clinton. My letter said exactly the same thing the letter said from BOB BYRD to President Reagan in 1985. It was worded the same way President Reagan's letter was worded. It said: Unless you will give us a letter, I am going to personally put a hold on all recess appointments. 
   The President started appointing people. And I put a hold on all of them--it didn't make any difference; I put a hold on all nonmilitary appointments--until finally, I remember one time somebody said: Well, we have a really serious problem because we can't get confirmation on the President's nominee for Secretary of the Treasury. This could have a dramatic adverse effect on the economy. The value of the dollar could go down. All these things came into the picture. What are you going to do about that? I said: I am not going to do anything, but you had better tell the President about that because it is serious. Finally, he agreed to it.

   Mr. INHOFE. The letter finally came on June 15, 1999. I will read one sentence out of that letter.  
   I share your opinion that the understanding reached in 1985 between President Reagan and Senator BYRD cited in your letter remains a fair and constructive framework which my Administration will follow.  
   Once again, what is he following? He is saying, prior to any recess, the White House will inform the majority leader and the minority leader of any recess appointments which might be contemplated during such recess? Would they do so in advance sufficiently to allow leadership on both sides to perhaps take action to fill whatever vacancies might be imperative during such break? He agreed to it. 
   I have not seen such a document, but I think in anticipation of the recess we are going in, it is my understanding that the President merely sent a list of some 150 nominees he has. Again, I didn't see it. It was never officially received by the majority leader. It was sent back to the White House. 
   If he thinks this is a loophole in the commitment he made, it certainly is not a loophole. 
   Anticipating that this President--who quite often does things he doesn't say he is going to do and who quite often says things that aren't true--is going to in fact have recess appointments, we wrote a letter. It is not just on my letterhead signed by me, but also I believe there are 16 other 
   Senators saying that if you make recess appointments during the upcoming recess, which violates the spirit of your agreement, we will respond by placing holds on all judicial nominees.  
   The result would be a complete breakdown in cooperation between our two branches of government on this issue which could prevent the confirmation of any such nominees next year.   
   I want to make sure there is no misunderstanding and that we don't go into a recess with the President not understanding that we are very serious about that. It is not just me putting a hold on all judicial nominees for the remaining year of his term of service, but 16 other Senators have agreed to do that. 
   It would be very easy for the President to just go ahead and comply with that agreement he has in his letter of June 15, 1999, rather than feeling compelled to make judicial appointments during this recess. 
   I want to serve notice to make it very clear. 
   I received a letter from the President. He did not honor me with a personal letter. It came from John Podesta, Chief of Staff to the President. Without reading the whole letter, because it is rather lengthy, it says that they might not comply with this. 
   I want to make sure it is abundantly clear without any doubt in anyone's mind in the White House--I will refer back to this document I am talking about right now--that in the event the President makes recess appointments, we will put holds on all judicial nominations for the remainder of his term. It is very fair for me to stand here and eliminate any doubt in the President's mind of what we will do.

    Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, with all of the tributes to Senator John Chafee over the last few weeks I think it is important that we do not forget his talented and dedicated staff. In particular I would like to thank his staff on the Environment and Public Works Committee. He assembled a very professional team, well respected not only on both sides of the aisle but also within the larger environmental professional community. 
   I call special attention to Senator Chafee's staff director, Jimmie Powell. Jimmie has served Congress over the last 20 years in various positions, and has worked on every major environmental statute over the last 20 years. Earlier this year, the National Journal called him a ``low key aide whose political insights and institutional memory are sought out by industry lobbyists.'' This is an understatement. There is no Senate staffer, or House staffer, with more environmental experience and political know-how than Jimmie Powell. 
   I believe that Jimmie served his boss, Chairman Chafee well. I did not always agree with the positions that Senator Chafee took, but Jimmie always did an excellent job in representing his boss's interests. I am not sure what position Jimmie Powell will take next, but I am confident that he will approach any new challenge with the same integrity and honor he exhibited as a Senate staffer.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today with several of my fellow Senators to bring an important matter to the attention of our colleagues in the Senate. I refer to the disproportionate allocation of Federal impact aid funding to local school districts across the country. 
   As you know, this program is a successful example of the role Federal funding can play in education. This program succeeds in placing Federal education dollars directly in the hands of local educators, rather than federal bureaucrats. 
   State income taxes and local property taxes are often the primary funding sources for public school systems. However, military families pay income taxes to their ``State of residence,'' which may or may not be the same as the State in which their children are attending pubic schools. In addition, military families living on base or American Indians living on trust lands or reservations don't pay property taxes. Public schools are still required to provide these students a quality education. Who pays to educate these children? 
   Mr. President, Impact Aid fills this gap left when traditional revenue sources are inhibited by the presence of the Federal Government. This program is widely supported by my colleagues. In fact, it's a program which continually receives annual increases in appropriation levels. One would think if more money is flowing into the program then all States are fairly receiving increases in the annual funding levels. Unfortunately, this is not the case. 
   There is a formula used to determine the amount of funding distributed to each locally impacted school district. While clearly some states are more heavily impacted than others, this formula disproportionately favors certain states and their districts, at the expense of others equally impacted and deserving. Hundreds of school districts across the United States are scraping for the dollars necessary to educate our children. And they are doing it on less and less money every year. 
   States, local school districts, and parents are the primary resource to educate our children for the future. I would like to inquire of the chairman of Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions his intentions with respect to addressing the formula disparities.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the Senator from Wyoming taking the time to show some of the differences and some of the accomplishments of this session of the Senate. While I was watching him do that, it occurred to me that something else constantly needs to be brought up before the American people because a lot of times people look at Democrats and Republicans and do not realize that we do stand for different things. 
   In the case of the Republican Party, I have had the honor, since I have been in the Senate, of serving on the Senate Armed Services Committee. I originally discovered when I was in the House of Representatives--and it was a shocker--why there is such a difference in the approach to national security between the Democrats and Republicans. 
   To put it very bluntly, the Republicans have always believed that the primary responsibility of Government was to give America a more secure country and to promote our national security. Yet time and time again, it is quite obvious that there is a difference between Democrats and Republicans. 
   To document this or to quantify it, there is a group called the Center for Security Policy. I think this is kind of interesting because people need to know what we are doing here. All too often people will read the mail of their Senators and assume that is everything that is going on here, when, in fact, there are some things that may not be accurately expressed in that mail. 
   For example, if a constituent is concerned with how his particular Member is voting on tax issues, the National Tax Limitation Committee and National Taxpayers Union rank us so they can tell who is for more taxes and who is for less taxes. If a constituent is concerned about what is happening in terms of family values, they have a number of organizations that will tell how Members voted on issues such as abortion. If they are concerned about how much regulation is disturbing people who are trying to run small businesses, the NFIB, National Federation of Independent Business, actually does a rating. 
   As far as national security is concerned, the Center for Security Policy is an organization that takes all these votes we cast having to do with a strong national defense, having to do with test ban treaties, a national missile defense system, defense spending, and they rank us to see who the good guys and the bad guys are in their eyes; that is, who is promoting a stronger national defense and is more concerned about national security or who legitimately believes there is a threat. 
   The average Democrat is ranked, in accordance with the Center for Security Policy, at 12 percent; the average Republican is 94 percent. That tells us something. It tells us there is a basic difference in the policy of the Democrat versus the Republican Party. 
   This is significant because we just completed debate on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and we heard a lot of dialog on both sides. To the last one on the Republican side who voted in opposition to this treaty, it was a recognition that there is a real threat out there. By unilaterally disarming, which is essentially what we would have done under the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, we would have allowed those nations to go ahead and test their nuclear arsenal, even though there is no way of verifying whether or not they were testing, of course. 
   Good old America, we do what we say we are going to do. If we say we will not do it, then we don't do it. I remember several times Secretaries of Defense would actually testify: We know we are not going to do it, but there is no way of knowing whether the other side is doing it. I had no doubt in my mind that both China and Russia would continue to test their nuclear weapons, even if they had ultimately ratified. By the way, they kept using the argument that we are going to have to ratify this because if we don't do it, Russia won't do it. I remember that same argument in the START II treaty. Russia still hasn't done it. We need to look at these things. Unfortunately, it does become a partisan issue. 
   In talking about our national defense, I come from the background of chairing the Readiness Subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee. There is a huge issue taking place right now. I will make a couple of references to it because I have introduced a Senate concurrent resolution, with several Members who are cosponsoring it, which calls upon the President and the Secretary of Defense to reopen the Vieques training bombing range off the island of Puerto Rico. 
   This is what the range looks like. This is the island of Puerto Rico. It is about 22 miles from here to there. This part represents a live bombing range. It only constitutes 2.7 percent of the entire island. 
   This bombing range has been hot range active for 58 years. During the time period it has been active, there has only been one death on the ground as a result of the use of the range. 
   That was last April 19. As a result, everyone in Puerto Rico who is running for office, whether it is for delegate or for the Governor of Puerto Rico, is using as his or her platform: We are going to do the most we can to shut down this range. 
   This is the range over here. It has been used for 58 years. There is live ordnance all over the range. There are protesters there right now, illegally trespassing, who are picking up and throwing around these live pieces of ordnance. 
   I have written twice to Janet Reno and told her she should go down there  and enforce the trespassing laws, if for no other reason than just to keep someone from getting killed. She has refused to do that. Unfortunately, it has been politicized. 
   We had a committee meeting where we had the Governor of Puerto Rico and others testify. They take the position that if you want to keep this training range active so we can properly train our American soldiers, which include Puerto Rican soldiers, somehow you don't like Puerto Ricans. I think it is very important to realize that that little training range offers three components of training that cannot be duplicated anywhere else in the Western Hemisphere. 
   First of all, it is high-altitude bombing. Why is that necessary? It is necessary because, as in the case of Kosovo, when we sent our pilots in there with cruise missiles, it was necessary that they be above the range of the surface-to-air missiles. They were very successful in Kosovo in doing that. There is no place else we can get that training because of airspace restrictions. 
   I went, the weekend before this last weekend, to the U.S.S. Eisenhower, which is scheduled to go to the gulf, where they very likely could see some kind of combat. The Navy pilots were actually from that aircraft carrier conducting their training exercises in two different places in the United States. 
   Here is the problem. I say this as a professional pilot of 40 years. To do that, they have to go through normal commercial airspace. In other words, they take off in an F-14 or F-18 from the U.S.S. Eisenhower. They go to drop their load of either real or not real ordnance. To do this, they have to fly through civilian airspace as if they were a general aviation pilot or a commercial pilot flying a commercial airline. In doing this, it is a totally different set of rules. Then when they come up to the range, where they can drop their ordnance, they have to all of a sudden be tactical. It is totally disruptive, and they can't do it at an altitude high enough to give them the actual training. What it will mean is, if these guys are deployed in the Persian Gulf on February 18, many of them will go over there and will be called upon to do things they have never done before. 
   At the same time, you have your marine expeditionary units, that would not have had this training--actually landing and going on amphibious operations on the shores of Vieques, where they have been doing it for 58 years without incident. We wouldn't have the Navy being able to fire their guns. In fact, one of the officers said that they would be sending sailors out there to fire when they have never fired live on the ground before. 
   It is a very serious problem. I bring this up not just to gain support for the resolution but to respond to something that is going on right now. 
   We had a committee hearing with Governor Rossello. He came 
   in. I will read some of the local press there.  
   Gov. Rossello on Friday called Republican Senator James Inhofe a ``backward and reactionary'' member of the ultra right wing of the Republican Party, while several island legislators called him an ``Ugly American'' following comments the Oklahoma Senator made about Puerto Rico this week. 
   [Senator Inhofe] upholds the same tradition of other people who have made similar statements, which is an anti-Hispanic, anti-minority.......  
   It goes on. I think this is a further demonstration that they must not have a case, if they are going to have to resort to these kinds of insults. 
   I say, in my own defense, that it wasn't long ago--it was 1996--I, along with the Democrat over on the House side, was the recipient of the Award for Freedom and Democracy from the International Foundation for Election Systems. The statement that was made when I was being introduced was: Senator JAMES INHOFE has done more to promote freedom and democracy in Central America; he has done more to promote trade with Mexico and more to provide humanitarian assistance to the Caribbean than anybody else and is hereby awarded the Freedom and Democracy Award by the International Foundation of Election Systems. 
   That was due to a couple of things I have done. One time, not too many years ago, when a devastating hurricane wiped out the lower Caribbean, I led a group of 10 airplanes through two hurricanes to take down humanitarian goods, doctors, two nurses, and food for the victims on those islands. In the case of promoting trade with Mexico, in 1981 I promoted the first trade where we actually flew to San Luis Potosi, Mexico, and made, not a cultural exchange but an industrial exchange, where we computerized things they can do down there and things we were doing in my home city of Tulsa, OK. 
   And they now have established trade with that country, and relationships and contracts are still alive today. 
   I had occasion to be involved in Central America during the problems that were taking place down in Nicaragua and some of the other Central American countries. So I say that in my own defense. I appeal to people to start looking at the real problems that exist in Puerto Rico right now, in terms of that range. I wish there was someplace else we could train other than this island of Vieques. When they say it is an inconvenience and it is noisy and it is just 10 miles--this is the range. This is where the population is. It is 9.7 miles between here and here. 
   I want to show you, by contrast, if you hold up the other chart, the two red areas are the live ranges that are where? In Oklahoma, Fort Sill, which is an artillery training range, a hot range. When I fly over the area, the controller tells me whether their range is hot or not. So there it is, these two ranges. Here is the population of Lawton, OK. So you can see the hot range goes within 1 mile of a population of 100,000 people, as opposed to Vieques, where the range is 9.7 miles from 9,000 people. 
   Hold up the other chart, if you will. To give a comparison between the two, at Vieques, they use 9-inch guns. We use 6.1-inch in Fort Sill. The days of training average 164 live days a year in Vieques, and at Fort Sill we average 320 days per year. The range at Fort Sill is open and is hot and used twice as many days per year as it is in Vieques. 
   Thirdly, the distance from the population is 9.7 miles in Vieques, and it is only 1 mile at Fort Sill. The population, instead of 9,000, is 100,000 people. They talk about the danger that imposes. There have been three fatalities. One fatality in Vieques was an F-18 that went down and both pilots were killed. They have had 1 ground fatality there, and we have had 26 (34 including air fatalities) at Fort Sill over a period of time. 
   So when people accuse us of having two standards, one for those ranges in the United States and one for the range that happens to be in a territory, I think those people have to stop and realize: aren't they asking for something that is more than what we find to be perfectly acceptable in Kansas or in Oklahoma? So I hope people will keep in mind that several of our officers have made the statement that if we send and deploy, on February 18, as is currently scheduled, those sailors and airmen and marines, they will have to go by way of the Mediterranean to the Persian Gulf. The chances are better than 2-to-1 that they will see combat in the Persian Gulf because that is what history shows us right now. We would be sending them there without the benefit of any training at all. 
   There is another resolution that was introduced by Senator WARNER, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, last week. He was admonishing the President not to deploy the U.S.S. Eisenhower if they don't have that training range opened up so they can get the training. I am going to support that resolution as well as mine. The problem I see with it is that we have already deployed the U.S.S. Roosevelt. They are already returning. The U.S.S. Kennedy is out there right now, and only half of its personnel have had proper training. We would be asking them to make a second 6-month deployment. That would have a terribly negative effect on an already-eroding problem that we have with retention in the military. 
   So I have two points I wish to make. One is that we need to do all we can to protect our young people whom we are asking to go into combat by giving them the proper training, and also to point out that there is a difference between the Democratic and the Republican Party when it comes to our support of national defense. 
   I will repeat one more time the statistic I used from the center for security policy. The average Democrat rates 12 percent; the average Republican rates 94 percent. I don't think the American people would expect that the  defense of our country and national security should be a partisan issue, but it is. 
   I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have been sitting this morning and listening intently to all the comments that have been made about our very close friend, JOHN CHAFEE. I do not have a prepared statement, but I do have some thoughts I think I want to share. 
   It happens that this weekend, at the time that this happened, I was on the U.S.S. Eisenhower, where they were doing F-18 and F-14 maneuvers and trying to figure out how to get trained for something that is coming up in their deployment to both the Mediterranean and the Persian Gulf. So we were talking with some of the military types about JOHN CHAFEE. And about JOHN you hear all these things. I have been listening this morning about how he was such a great guy. But people forget what a hero he was during the Second World War, and then again in the Korean war. 
   In fact, I got on his committee when I was first elected, coming from the House to the Senate in 1994. There is a tradition that JOHN, every February, would have his new members, along with all the other members of his committee, for dinner. It was a very festive occasion. 
   I used to look forward to going to that dinner and not saying anything but sitting quietly and listening to the war stories told by JOHN WARNER and JOHN CHAFEE. You could sit there and relive the whole Second World War in a way you will never read about. 
   When you think of him and the image that he has today, and the image of him that we have been exposed to in the recent years, you do not think of him as being the type of person who would be a war hero. But he was. He was. And every time he told his war stories, it always came back to talking about the love he had for America, what America meant to him, the reason it has to stay strong. 
   I think it is interesting, because you hear a lot about his political philosophy, and some of the things he stands for are not consistent with standing for a strong national defense, yet he did. He was very unique in that respect. 
   I listened to the Senator from California, Mrs. FEINSTEIN. She did such a great job of describing this very gentle person. The Senator said in her comments, I believe three times, that he was a giant, and that she knew JOHN was a giant, and she could look at him and see the things he did that nobody else could do--that he was a giant. 
   One of the things that is interesting in listening to those who have been saying such eloquent things about JOHN is they are talking about what his stand was on different issues. As a conservative, who disagreed with most of the issues they talked about, I still had a love and reverence and respect for JOHN CHAFEE that is every bit as much or more than some of the others. 
   I think it is kind of an interesting thing; you look at a guy who does not vote the way you vote on things, and yet every time he would say something about the various issues Senator FEINSTEIN talked about, I would stop and think it over: This is JOHN, so maybe I need to be listening a little bit more. I think he had a greater impact on people who disagreed with him than he did on people who agreed with him. 
   I appreciate MAX BAUCUS and the things he said. He has served for some time as the ranking member of the Environment 
   and Public Works Committee, a very significant committee and one that is handling things that affect us in our everyday lives. And when he talked about JOHN's unquestionable integrity, I cannot build on that. That is true. That is JOHN. Senator REID also talked about what a giant he was. 
   I would only add, that of all the characteristics JOHN had, the word that comes to my mind is love. You had to love JOHN CHAFEE. A lot of people don't like me, certainly a lot of them don't love me, but I think of JOHN CHAFEE and say: Who couldn't love JOHN CHAFEE? I feel so rich that I have had the honor of serving with him and being close to him. 
   This morning when Kay, my wife, and I were talking about JOHN, she recalled her last conversation with Ginny was during our February dinner, the very eloquent dinner he has had every 2 years that he hosted at, I believe, the Metropolitan Club. Kay had been talking to Ginny for a long time. Their subject, Kay told me this morning, was he had already announced 3 days before that dinner that he was going to retire from the Senate after all these years. Ginny was talking about how they were looking forward to their traveling and all the things they were going to do. 
   Now Ginny is left with 5 beautiful children and 12 grandchildren. I remember how proud JOHN was when he talked about his son, Lincoln, who is running for his seat. So JOHN was a family man. He loved his kids and loved his grandkids. Maybe that is what we all had in common. But this place will not be the same without JOHN CHAFEE. JOHN CHAFEE was the lovable giant. 
   I yield back, Mr. President, and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania. And I will not use all that time because just since I have been down here, many of the things I was going to say have already been said. 
   I think the Senator from Ohio was very specific when he talked about the fact that 80 percent of those abortions using this barbaric, torturous, painful procedure are elective. I could also quote from the American Medical News transcript of 1993 and others, but I think that point has been well made. 
   I wish everyone could have watched last night, as I did, Senator BILL FRIST, Dr. BILL FRIST, when he talked about it from a medical perspective. I do not think anyone could have watched that and not been very supportive of Senator SANTORUM and everything he is trying to do. 
   One of the things I do not think has really been answered appropriately is the fact that we keep hearing from the other side that both the National Abortion Federation and the National Abortion Rights Action League, all of these pro-abortion organizations which claim that the anesthesia that is administered to the mother prior to a partial-birth abortion kills the child and, therefore, the child feels no pain. Norig Ellison, the president of the American Society of Anesthesiologists, unequivocally stated that those claims had ``absolutely no basis in scientific fact.'' 
   In fact, I think the whole idea of pain really needs to be discussed more. Dr. Robert White, a neurosurgeon at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine said:  
   The neuroanatomical pathways which carry the pain impulses are present in fetuses by the 20th week of gestation. 
   Also, the neurosystems which would modulate and suppress these pain impulses are either not present or immature during this stage of fetal development.  
   What this means is, if you stop and think how painful this procedure of going into the back of your head and opening the scissors and sucking the brains out would be to you--to anyone who is here on this floor--it could be more painful to the baby because those systems that modulate and suppress the pain are not developed at that stage. 
   So I look at this in terms of human life. Almost all these faces that are standing up here supporting this technique, if you were to inflict that type of pain on a dog or a cat, they would be protesting in front of your offices. 
   A minute ago, the Senator from Ohio made some reference to the fact that it is infanticide. I hope the pro-choice people, a lot of people out there who are pro-choice who believe abortion should be an alternative, will listen to the words of Senator PATRICK MOYNIHAN, who is pro-choice. He said: I am pro-choice, but this isn't abortion, this is infanticide. 
   Lastly, let me just mention to you, I have this picture. This is Jase Rapert. He lives in Arkansas. I have seven grandchildren. He is No. 4. I can remember, and some of you older people can remember, back when our wives had babies, they would not even let you in the hospital, let alone in the delivery room. 
   When my little Molly, who is now a professor at the University of Arkansas, called me up and said: Daddy, delivery time is here; do you want to come in the delivery room? I did. I was in there for all three of her children. This is a picture of the first one, Jase. 
   What registered to me at that time was, we have heard a lot of talk about maybe a baby isn't perfect or something. I do not think 
   perfection exists anyway. But in every sense of the word, that is a perfect baby. 
   If they had made that decision, if my Molly or her husband had made that decision at the time while I was in that room they were delivering this beautiful baby, they could have murdered Baby Jase. That is what is going on in America now. You have to put it in a personal context that we understand, that this can happen to someone we love very much.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I will take a few minutes to share with the Senate something that has not been mentioned yet in this whole CTBT debate. 
   First of all, let me respond to a couple of things that were said by the last speaker who spoke in favor of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. I hate to be redundant, but I cannot let these things continue to go by. People will actually believe them when, in fact, they are not true. 
   The statement was made by one of the Senators that the Directors of the labs--the three energy labs--were in favor of this treaty. I listened to this, and yet we had them before our committee which I chair. They were very emphatic about their feelings. I am going to read to make sure the record reflects this. 
   Dr. Paul Robinson, one of the Directors, said:  
   The Treaty bans any ``nuclear explosion,'' but unfortunately, compliance with a zero-yield requirement is unverifiable. The limitations of verifiability introduce the possibility of inconsistent observance of the ban under the threshold of detectability.  
   The threshold of detectability is something that is there. What that means is, no matter what equipment we use, we are unable to detect certain tests that are underground under certain yields. This is a zero-yield test. 
   We kept hearing from the same individual yesterday that they can get onsite inspections. Onsite inspections are not assured. Under this treaty, it is very specific. Going back to Paul Robinson, the Director of Sandia Lab:  
   The decision to approve a request for an onsite inspection must be made by an affirmative vote of at least 30 of the 51 members of the treaty organization's Executive Council.  
   I know there is supposedly some informal agreement that we in the United States would be a member of that executive council. I do not see anything in this treaty that says we are. We are putting our fate in the hands of some 30 nations, and we do not know at this point who those 30 nations will be. 
   I will quote further to get my point across, although the Senator was well meaning yesterday in making the comment this was endorsed by the Directors of the labs. I will quote Dr. Paul Robinson again. He was referring to himself and the Directors of the other two labs. I am talking about all three labs:  
   I and others who are or have been responsible for the safety and reliability of the U.S. stockpile of nuclear weapons have testified to this obvious conclusion many times in the past. To forego that validation through testing is, in short, to live with uncertainty.  
   He goes on to say:  
   If the United States scrupulously restricts itself to zero yield while other nations may conduct experiments up to the threshold of international detectability--  
   The one I just talked about--  
   we will be at an intolerable disadvantage.  
   We have to read that over and over because people are not getting that message. 
   The second thing he said was, what is the rush? This morning, I heard the President in his press conference of yesterday talk about the rush. Here is the President who has been saying over and over that he demands this come before this Senate and be acted upon by November of this year. Here it is. That is next month. We are doing exactly what he wanted. Yet now he wants to withdraw this treaty because he does not believe he has the votes for the ratification. I agree. He does not have the votes. It would shock me if he had the votes. 
   Yet we have had a chance for a very deliberative session. We have talked for hours and hours, some 22 hours of debate and committee activity on this subject. We are all very familiar with it. 
   I also suggest that any Member of the Senate who stands up now and says we should not be doing this and how unconscionable that we are considering something of this magnitude right now, any one of those Senators saying that had the opportunity, as the Senator from Illinois would have had the opportunity, to object to bringing it up because it was done so by unanimous consent. 
   The third thing they were talking about is how everyone is a strong supporter of this treaty. For the record, one more time, we have 6 former Secretaries of Defense and several former Directors of Central Intelligence, as well as some 13 former commanding generals, all of whom are in the RECORD right now, and I do not need to put it in again, I have already put that in the RECORD; also, the statement by Bill Cohen. There is no one for whom I have greater respect than my former colleague on the Senate Armed Services Committee, the former Senator Bill Cohen, now Secretary of Defense Bill Cohen. 
   But I had to remind him, during our committee meeting, that maybe now his attitude is different on some of these critical things because he is now working for the President. But what he said in September of 1992--and I remember when he said it when he was leading the fight to stop this type of a treaty; in fact, it is the same provisions--he said:  
   ..... [W]hat remains relevant is the fact that many of these nuclear weapons which we intend to keep in our stockpile for the indefinite future are dangerously unsafe. Equally relevant is the fact that we can make these weapons much safer if limited testing is allowed to be conducted. So, when crafting our policy regarding nuclear testing, this should be our principal objective: To make the weapons we retain safe. 
   ..... The amendment that was adopted last week .....  
   This is back in 1992, but this is the same language we are talking about today--  
   does not meet this test ..... [because] it would not permit the Department of Energy to conduct the necessary testing to make our weapons safe.  
   Here is the same Secretary of Defense, back when he was in the Senate, talking about the fact that our weapons are not safe. By the way, we had a chart that we showed of information that came from all three of the Energy labs which is in the Cloakroom right now, but we have used on the floor several times, showing specifically not one of the nine weapons in that arsenal meet the safety tests today. In other words, we have gone 7 years now without testing, and it has now taken its toll. We are having a problem. So anyway, that is very significant to remember those words of Secretary Cohen. 
   I have been asked the question by a number of people as to why I am so adamant about objecting to the unanimous consent request--and I do not care who makes it--to take this from the calendar and put it back into the Foreign Relations Committee. 
   I do so because there is something that has not even been discussed on  this floor yet; and that is, unless we kill it and actually reject this treaty by a formal action, the provisions of this treaty are going to remain somewhat in effect. In other words, we are going to have to comply with this treaty that has been signed--going back to a document of the Vienna Convention that was actually signed on May 23, 1969, but it did not become a part of the international law until January of 1980. 
   Article 18--and this is in effect today--says:  
   Obligation not to defeat the object and purpose of a treaty prior to its entry into force.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, in these brief moments, 5 minutes for each Senator--I think it is probably not a bad idea because we have had so many hours and hours and hours of debate on this it is becoming redundant now--I would like to use this brief period of time only to bring out a couple of things that need to be reemphasized. 
   First of all, mistakenly--certainly not intentionally--some of the Members have stood on this floor and have implied that the Directors of our labs are in support of this treaty. I think it is very important to hear a quote from one of the Directors, C. Paul Robinson, Dr. Robinson, from Sandia National Lab, speaking in behalf of all three of the Directors. 
   He said:  
   I and others [that's the other three] who are or have been responsible for the safety and reliability of the U.S. stockpile of nuclear weapons have testified to this obvious conclusion many times in the past. To forgo that validation through testing is, in short, to live with uncertainty.  
   He goes on to say:  
   If the United States scrupulously restricts itself to zero yield while other nations may conduct experiments up to the threshold of international detectability, we will be at an intolerable disadvantage.  
   I can't think of anything worse than to be at an intolerable disadvantage. 
   Second, it has been implied that all these Presidents have been for it in the past, Eisenhower and Bush, and everyone has been for this treaty. In fact, this is not true. I am sure those who stated it thought it was true, but it is not true. Only President Clinton has come forth with a treaty that is a zero-yield treaty--that is no testing at all--that is unlimited in duration--not 10 years as it was in the case of Eisenhower--and unverifiable. So this is the first time. It would be unprecedented if this were to happen. 
   Third, I hear so many objections as to the unfairness. It doesn't really matter how much time there has been devoted for the debate on this. Everyone out there, Democrats or Republicans, any one person could have stopped this. This was a unanimous consent. It is true we had three times the time that was allocated for debate on the CFE treaty, twice the time on the START I, three times the time that was allocated on START II. That is important, of course. It shows that we did give adequate time. But the point is, any Senator could have objected. That means every Senator endorsed this schedule by which this was going to be handled. 
   With the remaining minute that I have, let me just say, as chairman of the readiness committee, I have a very serious concern. We have stood on the floor of this Senate and have tried to stop the President of the United States, this President, Bill Clinton, from vetoing our defense authorization bills going back to and including 1993, stating in his veto message that he doesn't want any money for a National Missile Defense System. He has fought us all the way. We would have had one deployed by fiscal year 1998 except for his vetoes. But he has vetoed it. That means that there is no deterrent left except a nuclear deterrent. That means if a missile comes over, we can't knock the missile down so we have to rely on our ability to have a nuclear deterrent in our stockpile that works. And all the experts have said they don't work now. We can't tell for sure whether they work now. 
   We have stood on the floor of this Senate with a chart that shows, on all nine of the nuclear weapons, as to whether or not they are working today. We do not really know because we haven't tested in 7 years. Testing is necessary. We would be putting ourselves in a position where we have no missile defense so we have to rely on a nuclear deterrent. We don't know whether or not that nuclear deterrent works. 
   Last, I would say I wasn't real sure what the minority leader was talking about when he talked about article 18 of the Vienna Convention. I will just read it one more time so we know if we do not kill this and kill it now, we are going to have to live under it. It states:

   Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Chair and thank the Senator from Arizona for giving me this valuable time because we do not have a lot of time.  
   First of all, let me say I respect the Senator from Nebraska so much, and yet I have to disagree with him. I respect certainly the senior Senator from New York as well as the Senator from Delaware. But the reason I disagree with them is, it is not as if this came up all of a sudden and we did not have any time to look at it. This treaty has been here for 2 years. We could read it. We could study it. We could prepare amendments. We could spend time evaluating it, talk to the experts. I have been doing this. I assume many of my colleagues have been doing this. 
   So procedurally let me just explain, so there is no misunderstanding where we are, what my position is. 
   We had a unanimous-consent request propounded--it was agreed to a few days ago--that said we were going to have possibly up to two amendments, not necessarily, but if we did, it would be 4 hours of debate equally divided. Then we would have a vote on the treaty. There would be 14 hours of debate, which we are in the process of having right now. 
   This was done by unanimous consent. That means any one of these Senators we have been listening to this morning could have objected to that unanimous-consent request. Certainly, the senior Senator from New York could have done it, the Senator from Nebraska, the Senator from Delaware. Anyone could have done it. Only one Senator has said he would not have done it if he had been on the floor or if he had been aware of it. That was the Senator from West Virginia, Mr. BYRD. 
   That is the way the Senate is run. It is run by unanimous consent. So anyone could have stopped it. And they did not do it. But they could have. 
   It takes unanimous consent to vitiate that unanimous consent agreement. If this happens, I made an announcement yesterday and the day before, sitting on the Armed Services Committee--with such distinguished witnesses as our Secretary of Defense, Bill Cohen; as General Shelton, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; as the Directors of all the labs, all three of them--and I said in the event someone asks for a unanimous-consent agreement to delay this vote, I will object. I want everybody to know right now, I will object to that. 
   There may be some parliamentary maneuvering where they can figure out a way to get around my objection. If they do, I am sure it will have to be passed on by the Parliamentarian. And that might happen. I might lose this thing. 
   But we have been looking at this right now for over 2 years. Certainly we have had ample time to study it and digest it. It is not something that just jumped up. Any Senator, of 100 Senators, could have stopped the vote that is supposed to take place on Tuesday or Wednesday when the debate time expires. So let me just serve notice I will be here to object to that, so we get down to it. The reason is, we do not need to keep delaying and delaying this thing. 
   The President has been yelling for 2 years: Bring it up. Bring it up. We want to bring this up for a vote. Yet now that it is up and he knows--he suspects; he does not know--he suspects he does not have the votes for ratification, he wants to bring it back. So anyway, that is where we are today.

   Mr. INHOFE. Secondly, the Senator from Delaware is talking about our allies--I am very sensitive to our allies--and our allies have signed this treaty, so if our allies have signed this treaty, we have to do it. 
   Frankly, I am not concerned about our allies. I am concerned about our adversaries. I am not at all concerned that Great Britain is going to send a missile over to the United States. I am concerned about China and Russia and now North Korea. Right now, as we speak, the President is sending money and making promises to North Korea so they will not test a missile they have called a Taepo Dong 2 that will reach Washington, DC, from anyplace in the world, take 35 minutes to get over here, and we do not have any defense against this thing. 
   So those are the ones about whom I am concerned. Have they ratified this treaty? No, certainly not China, not Russia, not North Korea. North Korea hasn't even signed it. Those are the ones about whom I am concerned. 
   Thirdly, certification. Certification doesn't mean we have weapons we know will be operative at any point in the future. It merely says we don't know that they won't be; we don't know of any. We can certify we don't know of any problems. How can they know of problems, if they are not testing them? I think that is a very weak argument. 
   Lastly, I would like to address the reference made by the Senator from Delaware to Dr. Paul Robinson. He is the Director of the Sandia Laboratory. He is the one the Senator from Delaware talked about as being, apparently, a credible source, or he would not have mentioned his name in his opening statement. Dr. Robinson says:  
   We know today that a test ban cannot prevent states from acquiring nuclear weapons if they are determined to do so. Credible nuclear weapons can be constructed without nuclear testing, as several nations, including South Africa, have demonstrated. The underground nuclear tests by India and Pakistan in 1998 are another example. These events were not developmental tests. They were demonstrations of nuclear capability that had been developed much earlier with little or no testing. 
   Those who claim that by ending nuclear testing we will close off the threat of terrorist development and use of nuclear explosives mislead themselves. Congress should not accept such arguments as a basis for endorsing the test ban.  
   Further, Dr. Paul Robinson said:  
   It is indeed correct that the United States would be ill-advised to place a sophisticated nuclear explosive design into the stockpile that had not been previously tested and validated. There is no question that actual testing of designs to confirm their performance is the desired regimen of any high technology device, from cars and airplanes to medical equipment and computers. For a device as highly consequential as a nuclear weapon, testing of the complete system, both when it is first developed and periodically throughout its lifetime to ensure that aging effects do not invalidate its performance, is also the preferred methodology. I and others who are or have been responsible for the  safety and reliability of the United States stockpile for nuclear weapons have testified to this obvious conclusion many times in the past. To forgo that validation through testing is, in short, to live with uncertainty.  
   I don't want to live with uncertainty. There is no way of knowing that we have a nuclear deterrent if we have to live with uncertainty. 
   There is no one I respect more highly than Secretary Bill Cohen, our Secretary of Defense. I served with him on the Armed Services Committee of the Senate, and he is certainly a most knowledgeable individual. I do have to say this: He has certainly changed his story since he was in the Senate. I am going to quote what Secretary Cohen said in 1992, when at that time he was the most vigorous opponent of a ban on nuclear testing we had in the Senate. This is Secretary Bill Cohen when he was a Senator:  
   Many of these nuclear weapons which we intend to keep in our stockpile for the indefinite future are dangerously 
   unsafe. Equally relevant is the fact that we can make these weapons much safer if limited testing is allowed to be conducted. So when crafting our policy regarding nuclear testing, this should be our principal objective--to make the weapons we retain safe. The amendment that was adopted last week [speaking of 1992] does not meet this test, because it would not permit the Department of Energy to conduct the necessary testing to make our weapons safe. 
   When I asked that question, there was some suggestion that maybe we are talking about different weapons. We are not talking about different weapons. These are the nine weapons we are talking about today. These same nine weapons were there in 1992, the same ones to which Secretary Cohen alluded. 
   This chart tells us that there are five tests for safety features. These are the five tests. The most significant ones are the intensive high explosive and the fire resistance pit. That is to make sure they don't inadvertently explode during use or during storage; the same with the fire. If we look right here, we see that only one of these weapons--that is the W84--has any type of safety. I guess all five of the hazards are listed. The W62 has none. So this was true in 1992. It is true again today. 
   Some people have said, well, in the worst-case scenario, if something happens to the safety of this thing, we have a way of getting out of this thing. It is called safeguard F. Safeguard F is one sentence in the treaty. That sentence says that there is a way out in the event that it becomes a supreme national interest to get out. So that would be interpreted by our Commander in Chief or President, whoever is President at that time. I have often said--I don't think anyone is going to refute it--that we have a President who has a very difficult time telling the truth. Let us assume he is telling the truth. This is what he said his interpretation would be in his application of safeguard F: In the event that I were informed by the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Energy, advised by the Nuclear Weapons Council, the directors of the Energy Department's nuclear weapons labs and the commander of the U.S. Strategic Command that a high level of confidence in the safety or reliability of a nuclear weapons type, which the two Secretaries consider to be critical to our nuclear deterrent, could no longer be certified, I would be prepared, in consultation with Congress, to exercise the supreme national interest under the CTBT in order to conduct whatever testing might be required. 
   He is saying, even if these five people; that is, everyone who has anything to do with or any knowledge of these nuclear weapons, even if all of them insist on it, he didn't say he would do it. He said he would be prepared to do it. That is a very weak statement. It doesn't mean he would do it at all. I don't find any comfort at all in what he stated. 
   Coming close to the end of my time, let me share a couple other thoughts about which I do have strong feelings. We had all three Directors of our three labs before our committee yesterday. All three of them testified that we have to test these nuclear weapons in order to make sure they will continue to work if called upon. These are the ones who are responsible for doing that. Verification has to be talked about. 
   It is kind of interesting. I will read an article in the paper a couple of days ago. It was an article in the Washington Post by Robert Suro, entitled ``CIA Unable to Precisely Track Testing.'' This was last Sunday, I believe, talking about something that might have occurred on Saturday, less than a week ago right now. Again, it was entitled ``CIA Unable to Precisely Track Testing.'' Among the troubling facts uncovered:  
   According to senior officials, the CIA has concluded that it cannot monitor low-level nuclear tests by Russia precisely enough to ensure compliance with the CTBT........Twice last month, the Russians carried out what might have been nuclear explosions at its Novaya Zemlya testing site in the Arctic. The CIA found that the data from the seismic sensors and other monitoring equipment were insufficient to allow analysts to reach a firm conclusion about the nature of the events.  
   Having read that and then having had Gen. Henry Shelton and Secretary Cohen on the same panel, I asked them the question: Can you sit here and tell us that the Russians did not conduct those tests just a few months ago referred to in the article in last Sunday's Washington Post? They said: No, we can't. 
   We asked the same question of the Directors of the lab. They said: No, there is no way of knowing it. 
   Verification has always been a real serious problem with me. 
   Mr. President, I ask for 5 more minutes. I think that will be acceptable. The time I am asking for is from our side.

   Mr. INHOFE. I will conclude in less time than that. I want to accommodate the wishes of others who want to be heard. 
   As I look at this, if we allow ourselves to be put in a situation where we do not know whether we have a nuclear deterrent, that is nothing short of unilateral disarmament. I know there are differing philosophies around here. I believe in the White House they honestly believe that if we all stand in a circle and hold hands and disarm, everybody is going to be happy. But I am not at all satisfied with that. I believe we need to have a nuclear deterrent. 
   Right now, we are faced with a situation where, because of the vetoes of this President, we don't have a national missile defense system. That is to say, if they should deploy one of these missiles from North Korea, China, or Russia, which takes 35 minutes to get here, we have no way of knocking it down. We would be dependent upon a nuclear stockpile to have something to send back that is more significant. And not knowing whether or not those weapons would work would be worse than knowing they would not work.  
   So the time is here to do it. I have applied this to my ``wife test,'' which I often apply to things. I asked, ``Can we take a chance on not being able to fire missiles?'' She agrees with me, and she is never wrong. 
   Seeing the junior Senator from Texas, I recall something the senior Senator from Texas has said many times, which I think is very appropriate to quote at this time:  
   We have to remain strong. We all wish for the day and hope for the day when the lion and the lamb can lie down together. But when that day comes, I want to make sure we are the lion.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have a few brief comments to make in response to the very eloquent remarks from the Senator from West Virginia, in which I thought he covered it quite well. He had a concern for whether the intelligence estimate was going to be forthcoming. 
   I would suggest, and get into the RECORD at this time, that back in December of 1995 we were waiting for the NEI report to come out. And it came out. 
   That report said we would not have to defend ourselves in the United States of America for a limited attack in terms of--the discussion, of course, was the national missile defense--until approximately 15 years, not any less than 15 years. 
   We found out later that was actually imminent at that time. 
   I can recall so well writing the Chairman and Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Shelton, on the 24th of August of this last year--1998--and asking him to be specific in terms of taking the national intelligence estimate and all the information that he could garner and tell me at approximately what date North Korea would be able to fire a missile, a multiple-stage rocket. He came back and said it would be more than 5 years. 
   Seven days later--on the 31st of August, 1998--they fired one. 
   I think we all know right now that they have another type of missile that can reach Washington, DC, from anyplace in the world in about 35 minutes, and we don't have any defense against that. 
   I don't think, if we are going to rely on the NEI information, we are relying on something that is going to be in the best interests of defending our country. 
   The Senator from West Virginia also talked about the ratification process and about needing more time. 
   We hear over and over again from every single person who stood up to defend the CTBT we need more time, we have to have more time. Yet if one reads what those same individuals are saying, the President of the United States said on the 16th of May, 1998:  
   Now it's all the more important that the Senate act quickly, this year, so we can increase the pressure on, and isolation of, other nations that may be considering their own nuclear test explosions.  
   Also the President said:  
   ..... I ask the Senate to approve it [CTBT] this year.  
   That was 1998--last year; here it is 1999. 
   Vice President AL GORE said the same thing:

    Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Disaster Mitigation Act of 1999. As the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee with jurisdiction over FEMA, I have been working on this legislation for the last couple of years. I am joined in the introduction today with my ranking member Senator BOB GRAHAM. I appreciate his commitment to this legislation and I look forward to working with him to shepherd this Bill through the process. 
   We have been witness to several major natural disasters already this year. And, we have three more months to go. We have seen devastating tornadoes ravage Oklahoma City and Salt Lake City. We have also seen the destruction brought on the East Coast by hurricanes Dennis and Floyd. Our hearts go out to the victims of these natural disasters. I was in Oklahoma City the morning of May 4, the day after the tornadoes moved through the Oklahoma City metro area. I have never seen destruction like that any place in the world. I was moved by the stories I heard and saw as we traveled through the remains of entire neighborhoods. 
   Now a few months later, I see and hear stories of the destruction brought by the flooding in North Carolina and I know the problems that lie ahead as they begin to recover. As the recovery effort begin, our hearts and our prayers go out to the people of North Carolina. 
   The Federal government, through FEMA, has been there to help people and their communities deal with the aftermath of disasters for over a generation. As chairman of the oversight Subcommittee I want to ensure that FEMA will continue to respond and help people in need for generations to come. Unfortunately, the costs of disaster recovery have spiraled out of control. For every major disaster Congress is forced to appropriate additional funds through Supplemental Emergency Spending Bills. This not only plays havoc with the budget and forces us to spend funds which would have gone to other pressing needs, but sets up unrealistic expectations of what the federal government can and should do after a disaster. 
   For instance, following the Oklahoma City tornadoes, there was an estimated $900 million in damage, with a large portion of that in federal disaster assistance. Now, in the aftermath of hurricane Floyd in North Carolina, estimates of $1 billion or more in damages are being discussed. This problem is not just isolated to Oklahoma City or North Carolina. In the period between fiscal years 1994 and 1998, FEMA disaster assistance and relief costs grew from $8.7 billion to $19 billion. That marks a $10.3 billion increase in disaster assistance in just five years. To finance these expenditures, we have been forced to find over $12 billion in rescissions. 
   The Bill I am introducing today will address this problem from two different directions. First, it authorizes a Predisaster Hazard Mitigation Program, which assists people in preparing for disasters before they happen. Second, it provides a number of cost-saving measures to help 
   control the costs of disaster assistance. 
   In our bill, we are authorizing PROJECT IMPACT, FEMA's natural disaster mitigation program. PROJECT IMPACT authorizes the use of small grants to local communities to give them funds and technical assistance to mitigate against disasters before they occur. Too often, we think of disaster assistance only after a disaster has occurred. For the very first time, we are authorizing a program to think about preventing disaster-related damage prior to the disaster. We believe that by spending these small amounts in advance of a disaster, we will save the federal government money in the long-term. However, it is important to note that we are not authorizing this program in perpetuity. The program, as drafted, is set to expire in 2003. If PROJECT IMPACT is successful, we will have the appropriate opportunity to review its work and make a determination on whether to continue program. 
   We are also proposing to allow states to keep a larger percentage of their federal disaster funds to be used on state mitigation projects. In Oklahoma, the state is using its share of disaster funds to provide a tax rebate to the victims of the May 3 tornadoes who, when rebuilding their homes, build a ``safe room'' into their home. Because of limited funding, this assistance is only available to those who were unfortunate enough to lose everything they owned. We seek to give states more flexibility in determining their own mitigation priorities and giving them the financial assistance to follow through with their plans. 
   While we are attempting to re-define the way in which we respond to natural disasters, we must also look to curb the rising cost of post-disaster related assistance. The intent of the original Stafford Act was to provide federal assistance after States and local communities had exhausted all their existing resources. As I said earlier, we have lost sight of this intent. 
   To meet our cost saving goal, we are making significant changes to FEMA's Public Assistance program. One of the most significant changes in the PA program focuses on the use of insurance. FEMA is currently developing an insurance role to require States and local government to maintain private or self-insurance in order to qualify for the PA program. We applaud their efforts and are providing them with some parameters we expect them to follow in developing any insurance rule.  
   Second, we are providing FEMA with the ability to estimate the cost of repairing or rebuilding projects. Under current law, FEMA is required to stay in the field and monitor the rebuilding of public structures. By requiring FEMA to stay afield for years after the disaster, we run up the administrative cost of projects. Allowing them to estimate the cost of repairs and close out the project will bring immediate assistance to the State or local community and save the Federal government money. 
   We have spent months working closely with FEMA, the States, local communities, and other stakeholders to produce a bill that gives FEMA the increased ability to respond to disasters, while assuring States and local communities that the federal government will continue to meet its commitments. 
   In closing, I want to thank Senator GRAHAM for his help and the leadership he has taken on this important issue. Without his help, input, and insight, this legislation would be little more than an idea. As we continue to move this bill forward in the process, I look forward to continuing to work with him to make this legislation a reality.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, when the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 was passed, there was a misinterpretation by the Health Care Financing Administration of this bill--while it should have been revenue neutral--to have regular reductions in the amount of reimbursement that goes to hospitals, specifically a 5.7-percent reduction to reimbursement that would take place in July of the year 2000. This was not the intent of the Members of the Senate. 
   I have a letter that has 77 signatures on it, including those of each Senator who is in the Chamber right now, stating that was not the intent. This is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution saying that was not the intent so we would not be having that 5.7-percent reduction in July of the year 2000.

   Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senior Senator from Missouri for his recognition, and he is correct that there might be some problems with the implementation of the law. A provision of the law directs companies to conduct a public meeting for local residents regarding the risks of chemical accidents. The facilities are then supposed to send a certification of the FBI stating that they conducted the meeting. It is my understanding that the EPA and FBI have  decided that the EPA should collect the certifications and manage them through an EPA contractor. Not only did Congress not appropriate funds for this activity by the EPA but we specifically directed the FBI to collect this information.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we have all spent considerable time during the past few years analyzing the problems in agriculture and making predictions about the future. Some of these problems can be traced back to various sources such as an intrusive Federal Government, drought and instability in foreign markets. As markets closed due to the financial instability, the Asian economic crisis spread, supply increased and farmers had no place to sell overseas. As a result, commodity prices across the board have been well under costs of production. We have all heard from producers in our states, and the message we hear is that our farmers are needing help. 
   Before the August recess, the Senate passed a $7.2 billion emergency spending package designed to help offset some of the losses in recent years. Those in the Senate who represent Ag states realize we cannot pass emergency spending bills every time the Ag economy takes a nose dive. This is not fiscally responsible and is not sound public policy. Our farmers deserve better and the representatives in the Congress must look for ways to ensure the people in rural America reap the benefits of the economic prosperity we are experiencing. 
   Over the August recess, I held many town hall meetings across the state of Oklahoma. In one meeting in the small farming community of Boise City, I had an audience of six farmers. For over an hour, I was able to talk to the folks who had seen the face of agriculture go through substantial changes over the past 10 years. I was able to hear these farmers voice their concerns about what was working, what wasn't and what could be improved. 
   What really impressed me Mr. President, was the fact that these producers believed Freedom to Farm was the right thing to do for agriculture. They liked having the freedom to plant what they wanted, the freedom to experiment and try something new without government interference. One of the farmers, Mr. Ron Overstreet, decided to try a couple of new things. In an area we would not normally think of as dairy country or an area for growing grapes, Ron and some of his partners have opened a dairy operation, as well as starting a vineyard. As I heard during the meeting, ``If I am not willing to experiment and try something new, I am in the wrong business.'' I was pleased these farmers did not want to turn their backs on Freedom to Farm but rather work to improve and refine some of the provisions of the program. 
   At the end of August, Congressman FRANK LUCAS, who represents all of Western Oklahoma, and I held an Agriculture Summit in which we invited individuals representing different commodity groups, Ag lending companies, farm & ranch organizations, as well as Ag economists to discuss solutions to the sustained downturn in the agriculture economy. Many saw several positive changes which could be made to Freedom to Farm, with very few advocating getting rid of the existing farm program. As several of the representatives at the Ag summit suggested, the Federal Government must be more aggressive in opening and competing in foreign markets. We must make opening and penetrating foreign markets a top priority of our Nation's Ag policy. Nearly 1/3 of all U.S. crops are grown for the export market. In 1996, farm exports reached nearly $61 billion, with nearly 46% of that total going to Asian markets. Due to the economic turmoil, exports to Asia are now less than 39%. While economies in Asia are recovering, relief for our farmers cannot come soon enough. This Administration has been lax in it's fundamental duty to aggressively pursue foreign markets for American farmers. To do this, we must change attitudes. When the U.S. uses food as a diplomatic weapon with presidential embargoes, it deprives farmers of the freedom to sell their products. These unilateral sanctions hurt only a small percentage of America's populations. Unfortunately, that group is our farmers. But a simple reform introduced by Senator ASHCROFT, myself and others would work to change this. 
   As part of the Agricultural appropriations for FY 2000, the Senate adopted the Food and Medicine for the World Act. Under this amendment, all current food and medicine embargoes would be re-evaluated by the Administration and Congress and future embargoes could be imposed only if Congress agrees in advance. It would also lift restrictions on farmers using U.S. Department of Agriculture credit guarantees to get their goods to foreign buyers, as well as requiring the President to obtain Congressional approval before the U.S. implements any trade sanctions on food and medicine. I think this is a positive step towards reforming our policies on sanctions. 
   With all that said Mr. President, I would like to address the reason I came down 
   here today, which is to announce my support for and original cosponsorship of Senator ROBERTS' bill, The Risk Management for the 21st Century Act. 
   At the Ag Summit I held, one item many people thought could be improved was crop insurance. Witness after witness testified the current crop insurance program is inadequate and suffers from lack of affordability, inadequacy in multiple years of disaster, inequality in rating structure, and lack of sufficient specialty crop policies. I believe Joe Mayer, Vice-President of the Oklahoma Farm Bureau, stated it best when he noted, ``..... the cost of insurance balanced against the guaranteed revenues do not make the purchase of crop insurance a sound business practice in many parts of the country.'' In the Ag summit, producers also had several suggestions of how to improve the current system. These reforms are very simple. First and foremost, there must be greater levels of coverage at affordable prices to all producers. Second, there must be expanded availability of revenue-based insurance products. Third, the program must address the needs of producers suffering  multiple crop failures. Given the present state of agriculture, many within the Ag community believe reforming the crop insurance program is the best ways to provide immediate relief for farmers across the country. 
   Since the introduction of this bill, I have heard from producers and insurance agents across the state of Oklahoma who have been extremely pleased with the provisions of Senator ROBERTS' bill. I believe first and foremost one of the best provisions of this bill is the premium write-downs. Under this legislation, the current subsidy structure is inverted. By doing this we encourage participation at higher levels of coverage. By encouraging participation in the crop insurance program, we strengthen the safety net for America's farmers. While this is a very simple provision, I think this is one of the best provisions in the bill and one of the easiest ways to improve the current state of agriculture. 
   The Risk management for the 21st Century Act contains provisions which establishes an Average Production history credit program. This addresses the needs of those farmers who lack production histories because they are just beginning or have recently added land. A related provision which helps many of the farmers in Oklahoma is the multi-year disaster Average Production History adjustment for producers who have suffered a disaster during at least three of the preceding five years. This is especially important to our producers in the Southwest who have suffered through several years of drought conditions. 
   I am also pleased by the Noninsured Assistance program. Under this program, producers are allowed to plant different varieties of a crop and still be considered a single crop. As I heard from the farmers in Boise City, as well as the Ag summit, this is what they wanted--greater freedom and the opportunity to try new things. I am also pleased by the provisions dealing with restructuring the Board of Directors for the Federal Crop Insurance Commission. It is my hope we can fill this Board with producers who are farming on a daily basis and know the crop insurance system. 
   Mr. President, Danny Geis, President of the Oklahoma Wheat Growers Association, noted at the Ag summit, ``Policy set forth from now to the end of the current farm bill must culminate in the development of a program that will provide a realistically solid financial floor that will insure stability, and will encourage the opportunistic free enterprise system that makes U.S. agriculture strong.'' I am proud to be a cosponsor of the Risk Management for the 21st Century Act as I believe it helps achieve this important goal. It helps producers obtain better coverage at a lower cost, creates a flexible policy that better meets their needs, and it encourages development of policies that ensure against market losses. This plan strengthens the farm safety net by improving farm and risk management by providing a good step for long-term policy improvements for producers. By making the permanent improvements to crop insurance, we will ensure that farmers and ranchers will have powerful management tools for years to come. Once again, Senator ROBERTS is providing a tremendous voice for farmers across the country and I look forward to working with him to ensure passage of this important legislation.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I do want to talk about some of the tax ramifications, today's subject. I think it is very significant. 
   Prior to doing that, though, we have an issue that is current, rather sensitive, and is rather serious in terms of our Nation's security. 
   Tomorrow, the committee I chair, the Readiness Subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee, will be holding a hearing to review the national security requirement for continued training operations of the naval facility off the island of Puerto Rico called Vieques. It is a very important issue, military readiness, with the lives of military personnel on one side of the debate and the interests of the local community on the other. 
   At this point, I remind the President that for 57 years we have used this island of Vieques, an island that is approximately 20 or 25 miles wide, one small area way over on the east end of this island as a range, a bombing range--57 years. During that time, we have lost the lives of one person, who was a civilian employee working for the Navy. This happened last April and created quite a bit of hysteria. There are many people trying to use this as an excuse to close down the range that is so vital to our interests. 
   We have seen all the press reports outlining the concerns of those who oppose the military's use of the island. We have also witnessed the introduction of legislation to close this range. Unfortunately, far less attention has been given to the national security requirement for continued access to the training provided by this range. In fact, I have not heard anyone address the increased risk to our Nation's youth who serve in uniform and what they will face if we send them into combat without the benefit of the training that is offered only at Vieques Island. The subcommittee will be meeting tomorrow to explore the requirements of this language. 
   It is my hope that once the panel, appointed by the Secretary of Defense to review this matter and make recommendations for appropriate resolution, issues its report, the committee will be able to then meet to review those recommendations and hear from the people of Puerto Rico as well as the military. 
   The Secretary of the Navy recently released a report, prepared by two of its senior officers, which examines our training activities on Vieques and explores potential alternative training sites. Although no alternative site has yet been identified that would replace the training Vieques provides, I understand the panel appointed by the Secretary of Defense and by the President continues to seek a resolution to this issue. 
   I will read a couple paragraphs out of the Navy report prepared by those individuals. I think it is very significant:  
   The Inner Range at Vieques is the only range along the Atlantic seaboard that can accommodate naval gunfire, the only range at which strike aircraft are afforded the use of air-to-ground live ordnance with tactically realistic and challenging targets and airspace which allows the use of high altitude flight profiles.  
   This is very similar to what we witnessed in Kosovo, and they were very successful. Even though to begin with we should not have been involved, it was necessary to use high-altitude bombing to be out of the range of surface-to-air missiles. We did that successfully, and they received their training at Vieques. I do not know what the degree of success would have 
   been otherwise. 
   Continuing from the report:  
   It is the only range at which live naval surface, aviation and artillery ordnance can be delivered in coordination. Additionally, Vieques is the only training venue that can accommodate amphibious landings supported by naval surface fires.......  
   It continues and talks about how this is the only facility we have, and if we do not have this facility, we are going to be deploying troops into areas without proper training. One of the conclusions of the report is:  
   This study has reaffirmed that the Vieques Inner Range provides unique training opportunities vital to military readiness, and contributes significantly to the ability of naval expeditionary forces to obtain strategic objectives. This study examined alternative plausible sites and concluded that none, either in existence or yet undeveloped, would provide the range of training opportunities at Vieques Inner Range.

   I would only say that it is not very often you get total agreement from all of the commanders in the field, all of the CINCs in the field, as well as all the chiefs. All four chiefs are on record right now saying this is absolutely necessary to have as part of our training. 
   One of the things I have been trying to do is to quantify in terms of American casualties when you go from low to high to very high risk--what that means. There is no question there is not one who will not say if we send our troops in there without this very valuable training that they can only get at the Vieques, it is going to be at a higher risk, which means American lives. 
   I certainly hope the people of Puerto Rico understand we are talking about their lives, too. So we should all be focused on the same thing.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, a number of significant developments have occurred since the passage of last year's authorization conference report--some good, some less so. The best news is that this year's defense budget reverses a precipitous decline in defense spending. 
   For the first time in 15 years, we have finally passed an increase in defense spending, in real terms. 
   We have also included a 4.8 percent pay raise for our overburdened troops. These steps are long overdue, and we have been blocked at many turns by the Administration. 
   As many of our colleagues know, our forces are deployed in farflung places, many with little national interest or military requirement at stake. Yet, unfortunately, we have also had a hemorrhaging in the ranks, due to deep cuts from the Administration. 
   The numbers are staggering. In just the last six years, the following are among the forces which have been eliminated from the U.S. inventory: 709,000 regular service soldiers, 293,000 reserve troops, 8 standing Army divisions, 20 Air Force wings with 2,000 combat aircraft, 232 strategic bombers, 13 strategic ballistic missile submarines with 3,114 nuclear warheads on 232 missiles, 500 land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles with 1,950 warheads, 4 aircraft carriers, and 121 combat ships and submarines along with their support bases and shipyards. 
   When Bill Clinton took office in 1993, the United States devoted 4.5 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) to national defense. 
   Today, defense outlays account for just 3 percent of GDP--their lowest level since the end of World War II. 
   By Inauguration Day 2001, defense spending is projected to have plummeted to 2.8 percent of GDP. 
   Mr. President, this is a good bill. It has a number of important components to it, most of all the overall spending hike and pay raise. As the Chairman of the Readiness and Management Support Subcommittee Infrastructure, we were able to address a number of important issues this year. 
   Milcon: We authorized $8.49 billion for milcon, $3.06 billion above the Administration's request, with a strong emphasis on family housing and decaying infrastructure. 
   Range Withdrawal: we have allowed critical readiness training to occur for  the next 25 years on some of our critical ranges in the West. 
   Spectrum: the spectrum was protected from a corporate takeover, allowing crucial bandwidth to be maintained by the military. 
   At the same time, this bill simply does not go far enough. Under no proposed budget currently on the table is there a substantial increase in defense spending, like we need. In a budget approaching $2 trillion, we ought to be able to find the less than $100 billion it would take to truly restore our readiness. 
   It is time to reverse these trends. It is time to take prudent steps to rebuild our defenses to protect our people, our values and our country. I look forward to working toward that goal as a major priority in the year ahead.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I would like to enter into a brief colloquy with the Chairman regarding some weather observation equipment for the FAA. 
   As the Chairman will remember, last year he was very helpful in getting money in the Department of Transportation Appropriation bill for FY 99 to begin testing of the Automated Observation for Visibility Cloud Height, and Cloud Coverage (AOVCC) system. Using high resolution digital imaging, laser ranging and high performance computing technology, the AOVCC system augments the current ASOS by adding the capability to detect fast-moving weather systems in a timely and representative manner. Is it my understanding that FAA is currently testing this equipment and it appears that AOVCC is performing up to expectations. 
   Would the Chairman agree that if testing of AOVCC is successful, FAA would make every effort to purchase the AOVCC system to enhance existing weather observation?

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I had been presiding and listened intently to the debate that has been taking place. I have a couple of thoughts which I think have not been addressed. 
   For one thing, we recognize that this has to have been politically inspired, that you do not offer clemency to known terrorists without some type of motivation to do so. If one has been watching the media and if one has been listening to this debate, one has to come to the conclusion that it was politically motivated. There can be no doubt about that. Of course, there are a lot of Puerto Ricans in the United States and in some of the States such as New York, New Jersey, and Florida, perhaps, who could determine the outcome of a vote. So we have politicians catering to them. 
   I suggest to you, Mr. President, that while this is onerous enough, this is not happening in a vacuum because at the same time people are going after this voting block by offering clemency, something else is going on right now, something that not many people are aware of, and that is, for the last 57 years we have been able to use an island called Vieques off the shores of Puerto Rico as a bombing range, as an amphibious training base. This is classified and characterized by the Navy, as well as the ground troops, as an imperative area for our training and our readiness. 
   I guess what I am saying is, there is no place else in the Western Hemisphere we can use for this kind of training. It is high-altitude bombing training and also amphibious training. What this also means is when we are about to deploy a ship such as the U.S.S. Eisenhower they will not be able to train because of a moratorium on training on Vieques. 
   How does that relate to this subject at hand? It relates directly in that the reason we are having problems with the range which we have used successfully for 57 years and which is an imperative part of our state of readiness is that it is unique, but they have stopped us from doing it through a moratorium because of the people of the island of Vieques. There are only 9,000 residents on this island who are saying, all of a sudden: Well, we decided we don't want to have bombing on the far end of this island. 
   This island is over 20 miles long. The bombing range is way over on one side. There is a buffer zone in between that is a national park on which we have spent literally millions of dollars to satisfy that handful of people who want us to abandon the range. 
   What do we have going on right now? We have people who are running for high office--and I do not think there is any reason to mention who they are at this time--going in and holding press conferences in Puerto Rico, saying: We want to stop the bombing that is taking place on this range; we want to deactivate the range. 
   Those individuals who are running for office in Puerto Rico are going one step further. Right now, there are four groups of protesters. These protesters are down on the firing range, walking around where there are live ordnances on the ground, picking them up, throwing them around, and someone is going to get killed. Consequently, having witnessed this, when I came back I wrote a letter and made a phone call to Janet Reno, our Attorney General, to insist she apply the law to these trespassers to stop them from doing that. 
   I do not know what her motivation is, but she refuses to do it, and she is selectively interpreting and enforcing the law. I suggest that the Senator from Utah was correct when he said the Attorney General is asleep at the switch while the White House is running the Justice Department. We are allowing the White House to run the Justice Department insofar as clemency is being offered to these terrorists, but also running the Justice Department by not enforcing the law in getting these people out of harm's way. 
   I can stand on the Senate floor today and say that I believe someone is going to be killed, and when that someone is killed, it is going to be the fault of our Attorney General and her boss, the President, because they are selectively not enforcing the law at this time. 
   While it is bad enough we allow terrorists to go unpunished--we turn them loose on society; we somehow fall into this mindset that punishment is not a deterrent to crime for political purposes--it is even worse, in my opinion, to take away the one thing that is necessary, the most significant, an important training area, from our military in order to prepare to defend America. 
   So I think this thing has gone far enough, and I do believe it is politically inspired. I do believe that was the reason for the offer of clemency. I do believe that is the reason so many politicians right now are saying: Fine, we'll go ahead and close the range. 
   One last thing on the range. I know this message will get out to the right places when I say it. It is true that the people and the citizens of the island of Puerto Rico would like to have this range deactivated. But they also at the same time want to keep our facilities that are so significant in making contributions to their economies, such as Roosevelt Roads. 
   As chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Armed Services, I went out and told them I am going to do everything within my power--if they deactivate this range; and are successful in doing this, through the White House and the President's efforts--to do what we can to move those functions that take place in Roosevelt Roads, to deactivate that and bring those back to various installations in the United States that are only partially utilized. 
   So that is going out as a warning. I think it is time we take this whole thing very seriously and try, just for a while, to get politics out of this process which we have been discussing. 
   Lastly, yes, it is significant. We are talking about a President who has offered clemency to a bunch of people, some terrorists, who have inflicted crime on American citizens. When you stop and think about how the young people of America are looking at this and saying, ``Well, I guess there's not anything wrong with participating in this kind of activity,'' this is morally wrong, and it should be stopped. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, when I heard that the Senator from California was going to bring up her amendment, I came down to the floor. Quite frankly, I came down carrying the credentials of the blue-ribbon committee. I think there is one thing on which we can all agree: If you actually read the recommendations of the committee, they are not consistent with the amendment that is offered by the Senator from California. 
   We have 13 people on the panel. They are from industry, they are from some of the environmentalist groups, chaired by Dan Greenbaum of the Health Effects Institute. I think it is important that we read what this blue-ribbon committee recommends. 
   What they recommend is that they are not through yet. I will just read a couple of the recommendations here. They recommend that MTBE should be reduced but not banned. They said that oxygenate mandates should be eliminated. This amendment would increase mandates, not eliminate them. They said that benefits of ethanol need to be studied more. They did not say they have already been proven scientifically. 
   If there is one thing that has bothered me about the Environment and Public Works Committee, it is that some of the things that come out are not based on sound science. In this case, we do have the beginning of sound science. We have a recommendation by a blue-ribbon committee, made up of 13 people who are very professional and should represent all aspects of this issue. 
   Anyway, that is not what their recommendation is. They said that we should not ban MTBE, considering all alternatives and benefits. In addition to use as an oxygenate, MTBE is also used as an oxygenate enhancer. I think this has not been brought out. There is a reason for MTBE to be included. 
   As far as the use of ethanol, as far as the report is concerned, the environmental benefits are in question. The blue-ribbon panel recommended that it further be studied before its use is increased. That is what the recommendations were of this committee. I think we have plenty of time to have the hearings, as we have discussed. 
   There is another thing that has not been talked about. That is, if we were to adopt the Boxer amendment, some amount of money would have to come from the highway trust fund. Ethanol users receive a tax credit at the current time, and at the end of each year it comes out of the highway trust fund. Therefore, each of our States will have their highway funds reduced if this amendment should pass. 
   It is not possible to switch to ethanol right away, as the Senator from California suggests. We do not have the national infrastructure to transport the ethanol. A lot of people are not aware that this cannot be added at the refinery; it has to be added at the rack where the fuels are mixed. 
   On health effects, only 1 percent of the detections of MTBE in water has met the threshold for smell, which is below the threshold for human health effects. I really think if we want to use, as our basis, our decision on this amendment being the blue-ribbon panel recommendations, we ought to go ahead and not pass the amendment, allow Senator CHAFEE and me, as chairman of the subcommittee of jurisdiction, to have hearings. We are going to have hearings on this, on the blue-ribbon committee, in September. We are prepared to do that. 
   This is a drastic step. It is something we do not want to get into unless we are sure. If you read the report, it says: Do not do it now. Study it. The results are not in. We will have to make further recommendations. 
   We are willing to have the committee hearing on this. I can just give you my word at this time we will have it probably sometime in September. 
   I yield the floor or yield for questions.

   Mr. INHOFE. Of course. 
   The Senator was reading from the report. I would like to read the next paragraph that he overlooked. It says they are recommending:  
   Action by Congress to remove the current 2% oxygen requirement--  
   That is right before ethanol--  
   to ensure that adequate fuel supplies can be blended in a cost-effective manner while quickly reducing usage of MTBE.......  
   Exactly the opposite of what the Senator from California is trying to do with her amendment.

   Mr. INHOFE. I know people are getting restless and I know there will be a substitute offered, but if there is anyone in here who is predicating their decision on how to vote on this blue-ribbon committee, let me read from the report. It totally contradicts what the Senator from California is saying. They recommend:  
   Action by Congress to remove the current 2 percent oxygen requirement to ensure that the adequate fuel supplies can be blended in a cost-effective manner, while quickly reducing usage of MTBE.  
   What she is trying to do is actually fill that 2 percent with ethanol. 
   Another recommendation says:  
   Accelerate air and water affects research on other fuel components likely to take MTBE's place such as......  
   It names ethanol, aromatics, and alkylates. It says don't do it until we do the research. 
   That is the recommendation of this blue-ribbon committee. 
   Last, it bothers me when people use scare tactics. This blue-ribbon committee said:  
   The great majority of these detections to date have been well below levels of public health concern with approximately 1 percent rising to levels above 20 parts per billion.   
   I certainly concur with the recommendation of the Senator from Texas. Let Members have a chance to hold hearings on the results of the blue-ribbon committee. Nothing would be lost.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss my legislation, S. 880, the Fuels Regulatory Relief Act, which passed Congress today, and according to the Administration should be signed into law shortly. This bill was passed in the Senate by unanimous consent on June 23, 1999, and passed by the House with amendments, on July 21, 1999. 
   I appreciate the speediness with which the House acted on this legislation and the support of my good friend Chairman TOM BLILEY. Unfortunately the Senate is forced to act just as quickly on this legislation because of delays created by the administration. In early 1998, I raised concerns to the administration regarding the security risks posed by disseminating the worst-case scenario data on the Internet. The FBI agreed with my concerns. Despite the acknowledgment of the risks involved the administration did not cooperate with Congress to fix this problem until the eleventh hour. 
   Because of the urgency in passing this legislation I have decided that a conference would not be beneficial. While I agree with most of the changes incorporated in the House-passed version, due to the haste of their consideration, I feel the necessity to explain in more detail my view, as the lead sponsor, of one particular provision. 
   Section 3 of the act requires the ``Attorney General, and in consultation with appropriate State, local, and Federal governmental agencies, affected industry, and the public, shall review the vulnerability of covered stationary sources to criminal and terrorist activity, current industry practices regarding site security, and security of transportation of regulated substances.'' 
   In carrying out this provision, I ask the Attorney General, in consulting with the Federal governmental agencies, to work with the Intelligence Community as well as the FBI. If any technical assistance regarding chemicals is needed I direct the Attorney General to work with the Department of Energy facilities, particularly the Hazardous Material Spill Center at the Nevada Test site and the Sandia laboratory in New Mexico. Regarding the transportation issues, the Attorney General should consult with the Department of Transportation. In addition, I would like to emphasize that  any confidential information or national security information should be closely safeguarded.

   Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator. 
   Mr. President, I, like many of my colleagues, have been listening intently to all of the debate. I certainly understand that the Senator from New Mexico is very sincere when he talks about many of these programs that need funding. 
   I do think that something has been completely lost in the debate that has been taking place on the floor. It is this assumption that if we are going to pass a tax reduction, it is going to automatically reduce revenues. I think this is one of the fallacies that defies all history, and it is one that needs to be talked about at this time. 
   I can remember when President Clinton was first elected in 1992. One of the first appointments he made was his chief financial adviser, Laura Tyson, who was quoted to have said--I believe this is an exact quote; certainly the intent is the same--that there is no relationship between the level of taxation the Nation pays and the amount of economic performance. I think this is ludicrous. I think it defies all logic. If you carried that to its logical conclusion, you would say let's raise all marginal rates to 100 percent, and everyone is going to work as hard as they would have otherwise. Certainly this is not what history has shown us. 
   One of the interesting things that is so overlooked by many liberals and others nowadays is that you can increase revenues by decreasing taxes. You have to realize that for every 1-percent increase in economic activity, that generates new revenues of $24 billion. 
   This was really discovered by accident back in the 1920s. Back in the 1920s, under two administrations, Warren Harding and Calvin Coolidge, there was a guy named Andrew 
   Mellon, who was the Secretary of the Treasury under both administrations. It wasn't his understanding at that time that he would be able to increase revenues by reducing taxes, but this was right after World War I. In World War I, we had tax rates that were just unconscionably high--73 percent. So they said, all right, the war is over now. Let's reduce our tax rates, and they reduced them in three steps during a 9-year period from 73 percent to 25 percent. 
   This chart shows the income tax rate at the time right after the war and how they reduced it from 73 percent down to 25 percent. Look what happens as the income started rising. It came up from about $700,000 to over a billion dollars. It was almost doubled during that period of time. I think this speaks for itself. It shocked a lot of people. This wasn't some smart economist saying this is the way to increase revenue. They weren't even trying to increase revenue. But that is what happened. 
   Then again in the 1960s, of course, this was not a Republican administration. This was the administration of President Kennedy, and he made the statement, drawing upon the experience of the 1920s, that we have to have more revenues to take care of the obligations that we have incurred in Government. He said we need more revenues, and the best way to increase revenues is to reduce taxes. 
   I say to the Senator from New York, this was not a Republican saying this. This is someone whom he knew very well, President Kennedy, back in the 1960s. 
   So he came along with his tax rate. At that time the highest rate had been up at 91 percent, as you see on the chart represented by the green line. He reduced them over that period of time down to 70 percent. 
   Now, if you make that kind of a reduction in the tax rate and you see what has happened during that period of time, during the 1960s, it did exactly what the President said it was going to do in anticipating what was going to happen to the revenues. President Kennedy knew that, and I think many of the people at that time felt this was something that twice in history had been proven to be the case. 
   Then, of course, along came the 1980s. I can remember in the 1980s because I was around at that time. I remember when Ronald Reagan--keep in mind this was at a time when we had deficits, not surpluses as we have today. He was advocating a sweeping tax relief reduction of about $1.6 trillion. I happen to have known personally, as many of my colleagues did at that time, Speaker Tip O'Neill. Speaker O'Neill at that time was not considered to be one of the stalwarts of the conservative movement, but Tip O'Neill said: No, I think that is too much. I think to be fiscally responsible, we should reduce taxes only by $1.3 trillion. 
   Now, keep in mind, this is Tip O'Neill, a Democrat, advocating the reduction of taxes by $1.3 trillion. Now we are talking about merely reducing them by some $790 billion. 
   Mr. President, to repeat, we learned lessons quite by accident during the Harding and Coolidge administrations back in the twenties. The lessons were that you can actually increase revenues by decreasing taxes. We learned in the 1960s when President Kennedy did the same thing; we dramatically increased revenues by decreasing taxes. This is the most revealing one because there has never been a 10-year period in the history of this country where we have had more tax reductions in marginal rates than we did in the 1980s. 
   On this chart, the green line is the income tax revenues, starting in 1980, going up here and showing that they increase by two-thirds at a time when the reductions in the rates were actually cut by two-thirds. 
   I think it needs to be pointed out that there is not a direct relationship between the level of taxation and the amount of revenue. In fact, the relationship is just the opposite. I think those who are saying we don't want to reduce taxes are really saying we don't want to reduce revenues. I can understand that. Some people believe Government should have more spending power and more control of our everyday lives. That is what defines a liberal versus a conservative. I think we are trying to do something to really have dramatic cuts to enhance the economy. Perhaps one of the benefits of that would be, as history has shown, to increase revenues. 
   There is one thing you can do if you want to cut down the size of Government, and that is to cut some of these programs. It has been my experience--having worked at the local level, State level, and now in both Houses of Congress--that once a problem exists out there, you form a Government agency to deal with the problem. The problem goes away, but the agency goes on. In a great speech made in 1965 which was called ``A Rendezvous With Destiny,'' Ronald Reagan said:  
   There is nothing closer to immortality on the face of this earth than a Government agency once formed.  
   I believe we need to look at this and realize what has been happening, where we are going from here, and what effect the tax cuts we are advocating are going to actually have on the economy. 
   Another way of looking at it is, in 1993, Bill Clinton actually passed, with the support of Congress, the largest single tax increase in contemporary history--in the whole history of this country. He raised taxes in that one increase by $241 billion over a 5-year period. In 1995, 2 years later, President Clinton said:  
   People in this room are still mad at me about the budget because you think I raised taxes too much. It might surprise you to know that I think they raised them too much, too.  
   I think anybody at that time who was opposed to that largest tax increase in the history of this Nation should realize that a way to rectify that is to reverse and repeal some of the taxes that were increased at that time. We have looked at different taxes that should be reduced. I agree with the Senator from Texas that we should reduce the marriage penalty. It doesn't make any sense in our society to reward people who live together out of wedlock. It doesn't make any sense at all, and it creates some of the other problems that we are so concerned about. 
   I am very concerned about the marginal rate tax, and I think we can probably have the effect of increasing revenues by reducing marginal rates. 
   Thirdly--and this will be in one of the amendments that we vote on, I guess, tomorrow; I hoped it would be tonight, but it will be tomorrow--is the death tax. I suggest to you that I had occasion to be out in western Oklahoma talking about the farm crisis and about all the things that are happening, I know, in other States and in Oklahoma. I am sure they have the  same problems out in New Mexico. When you talk about repealing the estate tax or the death tax, all of a sudden they quit worrying about crop insurance and these programs because that is the thing they believe is most critical to the small businessman and woman and farmer in America. If there is one thing we can do, in all fairness, it would be to vote favorably on that when the appropriate time comes. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to lend my support for the inclusion of $15,000,000 million for the Oklahoma City National Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism. This important funding brings to completion the creation of the Oklahoma City National Memorial Trust as specified by PL. 104-58. 
   During the 104th Congress, we created the Oklahoma City National Memorial Trust to commemorate the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. The Oklahoma City National Memorial will consist of three components: the actual Memorial, an interactive learning museum, and the Memorial Institute now funded in this legislation. 
   Fundraising for the symbolic Memorial and the Memorial Center is nearly complete and construction for the symbolic Memorial is complete. With the funding provided in this legislation, the Memorial Institute is one step closer to a reality. Already, an implementation plan for the Memorial Institute is complete and work has begun to prepare for the construction. 
   In preparation, the Oklahoma City National Memorial Foundation and the Oklahoma City Memorial Trust have entered into a partnership with the Oklahoma Alliance for Public Policy Research to establish an operational relationship for the Memorial Institute. The Alliance consists of all of Oklahoma's research universities (Oklahoma State, University of Oklahoma, and Tulsa University), while the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center will perform the administrative and functional duties as directed by the Institute's management team. 
   The Alliance meets the joint public-private partnership arrangement provided for in the Oklahoma City National Memorial Trust Act. This joint partnership is both prudent and necessary as Oklahoma and the nation begins to consider the broader implications of domestic terrorism. 
   The Memorial Institute will be the only institute of its kind in the nation dedicated to understanding, deterring, and mitigating against terrorism. Naturally, it is only fitting that such a center is located in Oklahoma given our close, personal relationship with domestic terrorism. Yet this Memorial Institute will go beyond being just another reminder of the tragic event that struck Oklahoma and the nation early in the morning of April 19, 1995. 
   The Memorial Institute will also provide a collaboration and exchange of knowledge between public and private, Federal and state, and military and civilian efforts to counter terrorism. Another important issue that will be researched at the Memorial Institute is how to better coordinate and integrate health care and medical efforts associated with our response to terrorism. This collaborative research on emerging counter-terrorism projects will lend key insights to ensuring that the events of April 19 never occur again. 
   Mr. President, I thank the Chairman, Senator GREGG, and the Ranking Member, Senator HOLLINGS, for efforts to secure this important funding for the Memorial Institute. Their efforts will long be remembered by the researchers who spend time at the Memorial Institute and the American public who stand to gain countless benefits from their research. Oklahoma and the Nation thank them.

    Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I recognize and honor Rear Admiral Leonard Vincent, U.S. Navy as he retires upon completion of 32 years of service to the Navy, The Department of Defense and the Nation. 
   Born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, a graduate of McAlester High School, Oklahoma he enlisted in the Navy Reserve in 1961. He graduated from Southeastern State College, Durant, Oklahoma, in 1965 and received his commission as a Ensign in the Navy Supply Corps that same year. In 1976 he receive his Masters in Business Administration from George Washington University. 
   A distinguished professional, Admiral Vincent currently commands the Defense Systems Management College (DSMC). As the Commandant of DSMC, he has been a leader of change agents for acquisition reform. And he has brought a wealth of acquisition, logistics, and contract management experience to the vital task of training our nation's Department of Defense Acquisition Workforce. 
   Afloat he has served as the Supply Officer of an amphibious ship, the USS Pensacola (LSD 38) and the Supply Officer of a submarine tender, the USS Dixon (AS 37). 
   Ashore his assignments have included duty as Supply Officer with Naval Special Warfare Group and with Naval Inshore Warfare Command, Atlantic, both in Little Creek, Virginia. 
   His varied acquisition assignments include Director of Contracts, Naval Supply Center, Puget Sound; Contracting Officer for the Supervisor, Shipbuilding and Repair, Bath, Maine; Director of the Combat Systems department and Director of the Contracts department at the Navy's inventory control point, Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania; Assistant Commander for Contracts, Naval Air Systems Command; Deputy Director for Acquisition for the Defense Logistics Agency; and prior to his current assignment, RADM Vincent was the Deputy Chief of Staff for Logistics, Fleet Supply and Ordnance, Pacific Fleet. 
   In addition to his current assignment, his command tours have included Commander, Defense Contract Administration Services Region, Los Angeles, California; Commander, Defense Contract Management Command International, Dayton, Ohio; and Commander, Contract Management Command, Washington, D.C. 
   Throughout his career Admiral Vincent has displayed exemplary performance of duty, extraordinary initiative and leadership, keen judgment, and dedication to the highest principles of devotion to his country. He leaves the military and the acquisition community better by having served them. His contributions will have lasting consequence. 
   Mr. President, Leonard Vincent, his wife Shirley and their three children, Lori, Tiffany and Stephen have made many sacrifices during his 32 year Navy career. A man of his leadership, enthusiasm and integrity is rare and while his honorable service will be genuinely missed, it gives me great pleasure today to recognize him before my colleagues and wish to him ``Fair Winds and Following Seas'' as he brings to a close a long and distinguished career in the United States Naval Service.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask that you listen again. I am going to pick up on the incredible but true story of the Clinton administration's betrayal of national security and the scandalous coverup that continues as we speak. In doing so, I fully realize that the majority of Americans will not believe me. They have continued to believe our President even after he has demonstrated over and over that he has no regard for the truth. 
   Though you would never realize it by listening to the national media or the Clinton spin doctors, the recently released Cox Report has revealed a wealth of information on how the Clinton administration has undermined national security to simultaneously pursue its misguided foreign policies and self-serving domestic political agendas. 
   On the one hand, there is the mind-boggling story of how the Clinton administration deliberately changed almost 50 years of bipartisan security policies--relaxing export restrictions, signing waivers to allow technology transfers, ignoring China's violation of arms control agreements, and its theft of our nuclear secrets, opening up even more nuclear and high technology floodgates to China and others--thus harming U.S. national security. 
   On the other hand, there is the continuing coverup--the effort to hide from Congress and the American people the true damage that has been done to national security and the Clinton administration's central role in allowing so much of it to happen on their watch.  
   Over three months ago--on March 15--I spoke on this floor about China's theft of the W-88 nuclear warhead. To remind you, this is the crown jewel of our nuclear arsenal. It is the warhead that has 10 times the explosive power of the bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima and yet just a fraction its size. I spoke about how serious this was to our national security--how it was a story with life and death implications for millions of Americans. 
   I told how President Clinton was directly responsible for downplaying the significance of and covering up this story. While the information on the W-88 design--the crown jewel of our nuclear arsenal--was stolen in the late 1980's, the theft was first discovered in 1995 by this administration. So people remember, it was the Chinese walk-in informant to the CIA that gave us all this information. I told how it was this administration and this President who deliberately covered up this vital information from Congress and the American people and, at the same time, lulled our people into a false sense of security by repeating the lie that there were no nuclear missiles targeted at America's children. 
   At that time, I spoke of six proven incontrovertible facts, and let me repeat them now: 
   1. President Clinton hosted over 100 campaign fundraisers in the White House, many with Chinese connections. 
   2. President Clinton used John Huang, Charlie Trie, Johnny Chung, James Riady, and others with strong Chinese ties to raise campaign money. 
   3. President Clinton signed waivers to allow his top campaign fundraiser's aerospace company to transfer U.S. missile guidance technology to China. 
   4. President Clinton covered up the theft of our most valuable nuclear weapons technology. 
   5. President Clinton lied to the American people over 130 times about our nation's security while he knew Chinese missiles were aimed at American children. 
   6. President Clinton single-handedly stopped the deployment of a national missile defense system, exposing every American life to a missile attack, leaving America with no defense whatsoever against an intercontinental ballistic missile. 
   On March 15, I began my speech by asking the American people to listen as I told them ``a story of espionage, conspiracy, deception, and cover-up--a story with life and death implications for millions of Americans--a story about national security and a President and an administration that deliberately chose to put national security at risk, while telling the people everything was fine.'' 
   In the three months since I made these statements, none has been refuted. 
   Now, I come before you to tell some of the rest of the story that we have learned since March 15. And it is a truly astounding story. We thought the W-88 story was bad--and it is. But with the release of the Cox Report last month, the American people have been presented with documented evidence that the harm President Clinton has done to U.S. national security is enormously worse than we thought. 
   On March 15, I said that, as damaging as the W-88 breach was, I believed we had not yet scratched the surface of the national security scandal exposed by this one revelation. I must say that I was right--even beyond my own worst fears. 
   Let's not be distracted by the self-serving Clinton spin: that everybody does it; that it all happened during previous administrations; that this is only about security at the nuclear weapons lab; that there is equal blame to go around on all sides; that President Clinton acted quickly and properly when he found out; and that the only problem is now being fixed. 
   I am here today to tell you that all of this is wrong. The Clinton spin is nothing more than a dishonest smokescreen designed to divert attention from the real issues. It is also, I believe, an attempt to dissuade people from actually reading the Cox Report and discovering for themselves that the Clinton spin is a snare, a delusion, and a lie. 
   This is why I want to take some time to walk through some of the more important revelations in the Cox Report and to remind my colleagues that we have an obligation to tell the American people the truth--the truth that the media is inexplicably ignoring and that the President seems to hope the people will never find out on their own. 
   First, let us begin with a simple fact: Sixteen of the 17 most significant major technology breaches revealed in the Cox Report were first discovered after 1994. With the lone exception of the W-70 technology that was discovered back in the 1970's during the Clinton administration, all the rest of them were discovered since 1994. Again, that is when they had the individual who came into the CIA and exposed all of those. 
   Let me repeat--sixteen of the 17 most significant major technology breaches revealed in the Cox Report were first discovered during the Clinton administration. Those who tell you otherwise are willfully lying to you. 
   Second, of the remaining 16 technology breaches, one definitely occurred during the Reagan administration--the W-88 Trident D-5. Seven occurred sometime before 1995, though it is unclear exactly when. And eight occurred--without question--during the Clinton administration. 
   Let's take a closer look at these. The seven that occurred before 1995 included breaches of information on all of the currently deployed nuclear warheads in the U.S. intercontinental ballistic missile arsenal: the W-56 Minuteman II; the W-62 Minuteman III; the W-76 Trident C-4; the W-78 Minuteman Mark 12A; and the W-87 Peacekeeper. In addition, there was the breach of classified information on reentry vehicles, the heat shield that protects warheads as they reenter the Earth's atmosphere when delivered by long-range ballistic missiles. 
   Let me repeat that all of these technology breaches were first discovered in 1995. They were discovered when a Chinese ``walk-in'' agent actually approached the CIA at a location outside of China and handed them a secret Chinese government document containing state-of-the-art classified information about the W-88 and the other U.S. nuclear warheads. We still don't know why he did this, but he did. 
   The Cox Report also tells us that the Energy Department and FBI investigations of this matter have focused exclusively on the loss of the W-88, which we know happened around 1988. There have been no investigations undertaken about the loss of the other warheads, the timing of whose loss cannot be as clearly pinned down. 
   Next, we move to the other eight major technology breaches revealed in the Cox Report. All of these were not only first discovered during the Clinton administration, they also happened during the Clinton administration: 
   No. 1, the transfer of the so-called Legacy Codes containing data on 50 years of U.S. nuclear weapons development including over 1,000 nuclear tests; 
   No. 2, the sale and diversion to military purposes of hundreds of high performance computers enabling China to enhance its development of nuclear weapons, ballistic missiles, and advanced military aviation equipment; 
   No. 3, the theft of nuclear warhead simulation technology enhancing China's ability to perfect miniature nuclear warheads without actual testing; 
   No. 4, the theft of advanced electromagnetic weapons technology useful in the development of anti-satellite and anti-missile systems; 
   No. 5, the transfer of missile nose cone technology enabling China to substantially improve the reliability of its intercontinental ballistic missiles; 
   No. 6, the transfer of missile guidance technology (by President Clinton to China) enabling China to substantially improve the accuracy of its ballistic missiles--these same missiles that are targeting U.S. cities; 
   No. 7, the theft of space-based radar technology giving China the ability to detect our previously undetectable submerged submarines; and 
   No. 8, the theft of some other ``classified thermonuclear weapons information'' which ``the Clinton administration'' (not the Cox committee) ``has determined ..... cannot be made public.'' 
   We used to think China was decades behind us in terms of building a modern advanced nuclear arsenal. Now we learn that, later this year, China is planning to test its new JL-2 long range ICBM, a submarine launched ballistic missile with MIRV capability--meaning multiple independently targeted warheads on each missile--almost a replica of our Trident ICBM.  This missile will have a range of over 13,000 kilometers and could reach anywhere in the United States from protected Chinese waters. 
   In addition, we know that China has been helping North Korea, among others, with weapons and technology. North Korea is also expected to test its long range Taepo Dong II missile later this year. 
   I am reminded of something that happened last August when I made a request to sort of see where we were and where North Korea was in terms of a threat to the United States. 
   In a letter that I received from General Shelton, who was depending on our intelligence system for his response, he said it would be at least three years before the North Koreans would have a multiple-stage rocket. That was August 24. Seven days later, on August 31, they fired a multiple-stage rocket. 
   I remind my colleagues we have no defense against either of these potential threats, because of the policy decisions of the Clinton administration. Someone very smart back in 1983 determined that we would need a national missile defense system in place by Fiscal Year 98. We were on track to meet the deadline until 1993 when President Clinton, through his veto power, stopped this missile defense system. 
   But as the Cox Report points out, nuclear espionage by China is only one part of the problem. China's efforts to acquire U.S. military related technology is pervasive. Operating through a maze of government and quasi-government entities and front companies, China has established a technology gathering network of immense proportions. 
   The Congressman from Pennsylvania, Congressman CURT WELDON, has done extensive research in putting this together, and other charts to show exactly what capacity China has to collect our nuclear secrets. 
   When there is time to look at it, it shows you operational entities of the Chinese military in red, the Chinese military entities and those in contact involving financial entities in green, and you have the Chinese military front companies in blue. 
   You can see that this is well thought out. It took many years to put it together to make it effective. 
   They are willing and able to trade, bribe, buy, or steal to get U.S. advanced technology--all for the purpose of enhancing their long-term military potential. Their success is often determined largely by our willingness to make it easier for them to get what they want. 
   The Cox Report has shed light on the fact that the Clinton administration has actually helped China in its technology acquisition efforts or made it easier for them to commit thefts and espionage. You know the truth is always difficult and controversy is difficult. It is easier to take polls and tell people what they want to hear. But I have to make a decision--who do I love more--this President or America. 
   I find that to be very easy in this case. 
   The following are just some of the things that the Clinton administration has done. And I want to applaud Congressman WELDON for helping to bring many of these things to light. 
   No. 1, in 1993, the Clinton administration removed the color-coded security badges that had been used for years at Energy weapons labs claiming they were ``discriminatory''--as if that makes any sense whatsoever. Now just a few weeks ago, in the wake of all these revelations, the Energy Department has reinstated the color-coded badges. 
   But during the time that these thefts took place, they were not able to wear these badges. 
   No. 2, in 1993, the Clinton administration put a hold on doing FBI background checks for lab workers and visitors, an action which helped to dramatically increase the number of people going to the labs who would previously have not been allowed to have access. 
   No. 3, in 1995, the Clinton administration took the extraordinary action of overturning its own agency's decision to revoke the security clearance of an employee found guilty of breaching classified information. When this happened, it sent a message to employees throughout the Department, that this administration was not serious about countering breaches of classified information. 
   No. 4, the Clinton administration deliberately, and many would say recklessly, declassified massive amounts of nuclear-related information in what the Clinton administration touted as a new spirit of openness. 
   No. 5., in the W-88 investigation, the Clinton administration turned down four requests for wiretaps on a suspect who was identified in 1996 and allowed to stay in his sensitive job until news reports surfaced in 1999. 
   No. 6, in 1995, someone at the Department of Energy gave a classified design diagram of the W-87 nuclear warhead to U.S. News & World Report magazine which printed it in its July 31 issue that year. Representative CURT WELDON is still trying to get answers about how this leak was investigated and what was determined. He has good reason to believe the investigation was quashed because it was going to lead straight to President Clinton's Energy Secretary. 
   No. 7, career whistle-blowers at the Department of Energy who tried to warn of serious security breaches--including Notra Trulock, the former Director of Intelligence for the Energy Department, and Ed McCallum, the former Security and Safeguards Chief--were thwarted for years by Clinton political appointees who refused to let them brief Congress and others about what they knew. Trulock was demoted but will now get to keep his job. McCallum appears to be on his way to being scapegoated and perhaps fired for trying to tell the truth. 
   Members will remember we had extensive hearings. Notra Trulock testified under oath that he thought that the theft of the W-88 was so significant, he wanted to give it to Congress. He was refused being allowed to do that by the then-Acting Secretary of the Energy Department. 
   No. 8, rejecting advice from his Secretaries of State and Defense, President Clinton approved switching the licensing authority for satellites and other technology from the State Department to the Commerce Department, making it easier for China to acquire U.S. missile technology. 
   No. 9, President Clinton granted waivers making it easier for U.S. companies to transfer missile and satellite technology to China during the launching of U.S. satellites on China's rockets. 
   No. 10, in 1994, President Clinton ended COCOM, the Coordinating Committee on Multinational Export Control, the multinational agreement among U.S. friends and allies that they would not sell certain high-technology items to countries like China. When this happened, it opened the commercial floodgates. Ever since, there has been a wild scramble for competition to sell more and more advanced technology to China. As a result, the proliferation has never been worse than it has been in the last 6 years. 
   No. 11, in a series of decisions throughout his Presidency--and many surrounding the 1996 election--Clinton has consistently relaxed export and trade restrictions on various forms of high technology of interest to China. 
   Again, I applaud Congressman WELDON who put this chart together. This timeline was not put together because President Clinton took office in 1993, but that is when all the compromises took place. This timeline shows categories including machine tools, telecommunications, propulsion. All were compromised, or as we normally say stolen. 
   No. 12, President Clinton has ignored or downplayed numerous Chinese arms control violations by not imposing sanctions required by law. While we are selling more and more high tech to China, China is sending prohibited military technology to countries such as Pakistan, Iran, North Korea, Syria, Libya and Egypt. 
   What does the Clinton administration do? They do nothing. What are the motives for all this? Why did the Clinton administration act the way it did, with almost total disregard for any traditional concern for U.S. national security? 
   The Cox Report did not answer these questions because it was only concerned with the facts of the security breaches themselves, not what was behind it. 
   But FBI Director Louis Freeh did assign one man to look into this. His name was Charles LaBella, who became head of the Justice Department's China Task Force. He and his investigators  spend months looking into the connections, trying to connect the dots with campaign contributions, foreign influences and administration actions. What he found is laid out in a 100-page memo he prepared for Janet Reno. We know this memo argues in favor of the appointment of an independent counsel to carry on the investigation. 
   But the memo itself has reminded secret, even through it has been subpoenaed by Congress. Janet Reno, who rejected its recommendation for an independent counsel, has refused to release the memo to the Congress or to the public. It is time for that memo to be released.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, after many weeks of intensive negotiations, I am pleased the members of the Environment and Public Works Committee and the administration were able to come to an agreement on S. 880, the Fuels Regulatory Relief Act. I take this opportunity to clarify certain points of this important legislation. 
   One item that is of particular concern is the possibility for circumvention by covered persons. New subparagraph (H)(xii)(II) states that it ``does not restrict the dissemination of off-site consequence analysis information by any covered person in any manner or form except in the form of a risk management plan.'' My concern is that this provision would seem to allow a government official in possession of this information to alter it in some minor, trivial way--like white out the words ``Risk Management Plan'' at the top of the page--and then distribute it with complete impunity. That possibility would obviously undermine the entire purpose of the legislation. 
   The purpose of this part of the bill is simply to clarify that covered persons can talk generally to the public about off-site consequence information--so that they can prepare documents that discuss the overall effect of OCAs in a particular state or locality, or so that they can prepare summaries like the executive summaries of risk management plans. But this provision would not allow them to release OCA information about a particular facility, or  in a way that would tend to identify a particular facility, except to the extent allowed by the regulations envisioned in the bill, or in the event that the one-year moratorium expired without any regulations having been promulgated. The only exception would be where the covered person came into possession of information that could be described as ``off-site consequence information,'' but which was generated by some totally different process than the Risk Management Program. 
   I am also troubled about the provision entitled ``Effect on State or Local Law.'' On the one hand, subparagraph (H)(x)(I) states that the bill, and the regulations under it, shall supersede any inconsistent provision of state or local law. But on the other hand, that preemption is ``subject to'' subparagraph

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks about S. 880, the Fuels Regulatory Relief Act. This bill is designed to address the listing of certain flammable fuels under section 112(r)(3) of the Clean Air Act. The Committee determined that propane and flammables used as fuels should not be listed as a regulated or extremely hazardous substances because they do not comport with the Act's criteria for such listing. However, the National Association of Fire Fighters are concerned that removing these substances from Federal regulation under section 112(r) of the act will limit information regarding these fuels that would have been available to the public through the Risk Management Plans, RMP required by EPA's final rule implementing that section.

   Mr. INHOFE. I also thank my colleague from Montana for his work on this bill. We are very aware of the dangers fire fighters and other emergency response personnel face every day protecting the lives of our people and we want to provide them with the information they need to handle threats posed by extremely hazardous substances. Nonetheless, the substances generally addressed by S. 880, section 3, do not warrant coverage by a Clean Air Act requirement to submit RMPs. A voluntary, non-regulatory approach, such as the voluntary standards of the National Fire Protection Association for Liquified Petroleum Gas (NFPA 58), can better supply the information needed by fire fighters to protect their and the public's health and welfare.

   Mr. INHOFE. That is true. There are two reports included in this legislation designed to address those specific problems. The first report will examine the status of amendments to NFPA 58 that  will provide to local emergency response personnel information concerning the off-site effects of accidental releases of those substances exempted from listing by section 3 of this legislation. We strongly encourage all the parties involved in this NFPA amendment process to work together in good faith and in a timely manner. The second report is designed to examine the sufficiency of the information local emergency response personnel receive to help them respond to chemical accidents. Specifically, the report will address the level of compliance with all federal and state requirements for submission of this information to emergency response personnel. Also, the report will examine the adequacy of the methods for delivering this information to emergency response personnel.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I bring to the attention of this body the efforts of the Republic of China on Taiwan on behalf of the Kosovar refugees. As a member of the world community committed to protecting and promoting human rights, the Republic of China on Taiwan is deeply concerned about the plight of the Kosovars and hopes to contribute to the reconstruction of their war-torn land. To that end, President Lee Tung-hui announced on June 7, 1999 that Taiwan will grant $300 million in an aid package to the Kosovars. The aid package will consist of the following: 
   1. Emergency support for food, shelters, medical care and education, etc. for Kosovar refugees living in exile in neighboring countries. 
   2. Short-term accommodations for some of the Kosovar refugees in Taiwan with opportunities for job training to enable them to be better equipped for the restoration of their homeland upon their return. 
   3. Support for the restoration of Kosovo in coordination with international long-term recovery programs once a peace plan is implemented. 
   I commend the Republic of China on Taiwan for their commitment to humanitarian assistance for these victims of the war in Yugoslavia. Their aid will contribute to the promotion of the peace plan for Kosovo and will help the refugees return safety to their homes as soon as possible.

   Mr. INHOFE. I would be pleased to. An example of a use of the defense that this amendment would provide would be a federally enforceable reporting requirement on an energy facility. Suppose a plant operator is vigilant at the controls of a conventional power plant. At the stroke of midnight New Year's the plant is operating smoothly, and power is being transmitted to homes, hospitals, and nursing homes right on schedule. Further, the operator can see clearly that the environmental machinery that cleans emissions such as  sulfur dioxide (an acid rain precursor) or nitrogen oxides (a contributor to smog) is operating normally in every respect save one. The computer read-out from the continuous emissions monitor at the top of the smoke stack does not seem to be transmitting or storing the emission data verifying that equipment is otherwise in normal function. Repairing the bug in the monitor transmitter may take a few days over the holiday weekend. 
   Without my amendment the plant operator faces a terrible choice. Does he shut down the whole plant and let the people in the nursing homes freeze in the dark, or does he run the risk of severe sanctions for disregarding a requirement that he provide government agencies an unbroken chain of emission monitor print-outs? Mind you, he knows the pollution is being controlled as usual because he or she has hands on the equipment. With my amendment, the plant could keep operating, nobody's lights would have to go out unless--and this is key--doing so does not threaten public health, safety, or the environment. This is not a holiday from environmental quality laws.

   Mr. INHOFE. Certainly, suppose the power plant were nuclear and--this time--a temperature gauge is broken and the operator does not really know whether the plant is operating in safe mode or not. In such a case, the operator could not, under my amendment, ``drive in the dark with no lights on.'' Clearly operating in such a fashion that could pose a risk to health, safety, or the environment would receive no protection under my amendment, and no sympathy from me.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I was very surprised and disappointed to find that during our recess when we were not here, the President made a very controversial appointment of James Hormel to be U.S. Ambassador to Luxembourg. I believe it is something that should not be done. In fact, when I think of procedures, I look to a man I admire so much, Senator BOB BYRD from West Virginia. 
   During a recess in 1985, President Reagan made several appointments.  Senator BYRD said: The recess appointment power should not be used simply to avoid controversy or to circumvent the constitutional power and responsibility of the Senate. In several cases, Reagan's recess appointments avoided serious and probing debate by the Senate on controversial issues. There is no evidence that the needs of government required any of these appointments to be made as recess appointments. 
   Then Senator BYRD went on to give the history, as he always does in his very eloquent style, as to how the Constitution does provide for emergencies, for such things as appointments back in the 1800s when people were traveling and unable to get here or when something strategic is pending. In the case of James Hormel, certainly there is not anything strategic pending. 
   For that reason, I am serving official notice today that I am going to do the same thing Senator BYRD did back in 1985: I am putting holds on every single Presidential nomination. 
   In the case of James Hormel, it is a little confusing to a lot of people as to why he became controversial. Yes, he is gay. That is not the reason for people opposing him. It is the fact that he is a gay activist who puts his agenda ahead of the agenda of America. 
   I can recall when he made the statement when first nominated by the President: I wish the President had nominated me to be Ambassador to Norway, because if they have something on the ballot--same-sex marriages or something like that--I might be able to influence it. 
   That, to me, demonstrated very clearly that he wanted to use this position to advance his own agenda and not the agenda of America. 
   I hasten to say, I would have the same feelings about any other appointment on any other issue. If David Duke were appointed and came to the conclusion he was going to use his militia interests as his motivation and his agenda more than America's agenda, I certainly would oppose that nomination in the same way. Notice is hereby served. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. INHOFE. I will yield myself a couple of minutes and I will reserve the remainder of my time. 
   First of all, I don't disagree with many of the things the Senator from Iowa is saying. The only thing I disagree with is, we have much better  proof than he is implying in terms of mismanagement. 
   I find something very interesting, and that is a letter that went out last night over the web site from one of the prominent members, named Cameron Warner, to all his fellow members. In this letter he makes it very specific that we at CAP have problems--problems at the top--and they are going to have to be addressed. He goes on to say that if we don't do something about it, those things that we said yesterday on the floor of the Senate as to ``60 Minutes'' coming in and looking at all these abuses could actually be a reality. So here is a request from members of the CAP saying they want to clean up this act.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, the other thing I want to mention is that we all love the CAP. There isn't a person in the 100 Members here who has worked closer with them than I have. I was a flight instructor, and I have been involved with these people. We love them. We don't want something to happen where all of a sudden we find out bad things are going on and the Air Force says we can't be responsible for it, dump the program. We all want to save the CAP. 
   Third, I don't buy the argument when they say we are using our own money. It is 95 percent paid for by public funds. But it is always easy to say these funds were the ones that were the 5 percent. I am not criticizing anybody for saying that, because I hear that all the time on the floor of the Senate. 
   I have no problem with accepting this amendment. I think we can probably do it by voice vote. I would like to address these things together. The Senator from Iowa and I have talked, and certainly the Senator from Colorado also shares the concern that there could be mismanagement that has to be stopped, and this is actually the request of the members of the CAP. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I agree with a lot of the things the Senator from Iowa is saying. I felt that we were in a position where we couldn't do nothing. We had the accusations out there. I think, quite frankly, ``60 Minutes'' has had more publicity out of this than the CAP has. However, that is the reality. Any time there are accusations like this and 95 percent of the taxpayers' money is being spent, we have a responsibility for oversight. I think we will be able to do that. I certainly have no objection to working on this and making it happen. 
   I also say, since I have a minute remaining, that I am particularly concerned, because 2 weeks ago I was thinking about this ACP while flying an airplane which had an engine blow, and I wasn't sure I was going to be able to land safely gliding into the airport. I could very well have been their product a couple of weeks ago. 
   I yield the remaining time.

   Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator for yielding time. 
   I think just about everything has been said here, but there are some concerns I have that I would state in a little different way than the Senator from New Hampshire has stated them. 
   One is that we have gone through an artificial downsizing that is not commensurate with the threat that is out there. The myth that has floated around that the cold war is over, there is no longer a threat, is something that finally the American people are waking up and realizing is not true. We are in the most threatened position today that we have been in probably in the history of this country, with the diverse types of opposition out there, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and abilities to transport those weapons. 
   So I say, one of the strongest arguments against a BRAC round at this time is, we have gone through four BRAC rounds. If we take the level of our infrastructure down to meet the level of the force strength, then when we start back up with the force strength, we will not have the infrastructure that is necessary. 
   So we need to be looking at our rebuilding process. It would be like going through extensive BRAC processes back in the late 1970s--right before rebuilding, which is imminent. We are going to have to do it with the new administration. 
   Secondly, as I think the Senator from New Hampshire articulated quite well, we are in a really severe situation right now in terms of readiness. Later on today I want a chance to elaborate on this and talk about the fact that we are now at approximately one-half the force strength that we were in 1991. In other words, we could not repeat our effort in the Persian Gulf war today. 
   This is being complicated by all these deployments to places where we should not be. We should never have sent a troop or any effort or any assets into Bosnia; we should not have done that in Kosovo or Albania, or to Haiti, for all practical purposes, because that dilutes the already scarce military assets we have. 
   I say this relates to this subject because we have a military system that is hemorrhaging today. This is not something that we can wait until later to take care of. As the Senator from New Hampshire pointed out, anything that comes from a BRAC round, a new BRAC round, is going to cost money, not save money. 
   Now is when we are going to have to try to do something with our readiness so that if General Hawley has to stand up and say something has happened either in the Pacific theater, North Korea, or the Persian Gulf, Iraq or Iran, we would be able to meet that. We cannot do that today. So this certainly would be ill-timed, even if you believe that it was a good idea to have future BRAC rounds. 
   I think also we need to look at the budget we are passing. I want to talk about the inadequacy of what we are talking about in our authorization bill. We are increasing by about $9 billion what the President's budget was. We have had testimony from the CINCs and from others in the field and from the four-stars that this is totally inadequate. We are going to have to have at least a minimum increase of $24 billion each year for approximately 6 years. 
   Lastly, I would like to remind everybody of what happened in the last round, I believe, in the BRAC process. I was elected to the House in 1986, and that is when we put this idea together. It was a Congressman from Texas, DICK ARMEY, who did it. The idea was to get politics out of the BRAC process. Through round 1 and round 2 and round 3, there were no politics involved. They were not political decisions; they were rational decisions. 
   However, in the last round--and we all know what happened; no one is going to question this--the President went out there prior to the 1996 election, to McClellan in California and to Kelly in Texas, in order to get votes and politicize the system. 
   You might say: Well, this is going to come along after he is gone. I am a little bit concerned about the fact that there is a possibility, a very outside possibility, that AL GORE will succeed him. That being the case, he was involved in politicizing this, too. 
   For those who believe we still have excess infrastructure, I would like to have you consider that maybe we should wait until we see what the new administration is going to look like, what kind of commitments are going to be made. As chairman of the committee that has oversight over the BRAC process, I suggest we wait and not pass this BRAC recommendation today. 
   Thank you, Mr. President.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in opposition to this amendment. I want to say that there is no one of the 100 Members of the Senate who has been historically closer to the CAP, who has participated in CAP activities than I have. There is not a year that goes by that I do not talk to the troops and those who are being promoted, those who have achieved really great things and have made great contributions to society. I also, just 2 weeks ago, could very well have been the product of a search by the CAP, had I not been able to glide my plane into an airport. So I understand that. I have been on various patrols where we go out. I know the valuable contributions that the Civil Air Patrol makes to this Nation every year, search and rescue, youth cadet program. 
   However, we are concerned with the continuing streams of allegations coming from the Air Force and from members of the Civil Air Patrol that senior members of the CAP have engaged in inappropriate, and in some cases, illegal activities. I will outline a few of the allegations that have been brought to the committee by either the Air Force or former members of the CAP. 
   I have some documents to include as part of the RECORD that I will want immediately following my remarks, but these are just some of the accusations that are out there. I know that the Senator from Colorado is just as concerned about these as I am. 
   One individual was charging the cost of his flying hours to the Civil Air Patrol counterdrug account when he was actually flying to visit his daughter. A second accusation: One CAP wing charged both its home State and the CAP counterdrug budget for the same mission, essentially receiving double reimbursement for the same activity. 
   Here is a good one: The southeast regional commanders conference was held on a cruise to Nassau paid for by CAP headquarters. After the conference, some individuals requested and received a per diem, even though the cost of the cruise had been paid for by the CAP and, thus, by the taxpayers. I have often thought--I suggested this to the Senator from Colorado--what kind of a position would we be in, would I be in, as chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee if I sat back and let these charges go unanswered? I could just imagine ``60 Minutes'' or some news account of this talking about the cruise to Nassau that was paid with taxpayers' money and then double dipping on top of that. 
   We have numerous other types of reports concerning missing equipment. Seventy percent of one wing's gear, communications gear, computers, et cetera, cannot be accounted for; 77 percent of another wing's gear is missing. The most extraordinary of all, however, is a letter we received from one former member alleging that Federal laws and Federal aviation regulations relating to aircraft maintenance were being violated, and quoting from that letter, ``the lives of our cadet''-- these are juveniles--``members were being jeopardized.'' 
   We are talking about human lives here. Because of these accusations and because the Civil Air Patrol is an auxiliary of the Air Force, receiving virtually all of its funding--some 94 percent of the funding for the CAP comes from the Air Force and the headquarters at the Air Force installation--the leadership of the Air Force requested that the committee pass legislation to grant the Air Force the necessary authority to ensure responsible management of the Civil Air Patrol. 
   That is exactly what this legislation does. This is in our mark that is before us today. 
   I do urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. However, should it pass, I hope that the Secretary of the Air Force will refer the allegations to the FBI and seek to sever the Air Force's ties with the CAP. We can't hold the Air Force responsible for an organization that it doesn't have any authority to supervise. I do not know whether there is any other example anywhere, Mr. President, where you have the responsibility statutorily borne by some agency and they have no authority to police or discipline the behavior of that entity.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, I know the Senator has the best interests of the CAP at heart in making his comments. But I do believe that he needs to read this very carefully, and if any other Members want to read it, it is on pages 292, 293, and 294. 
   All we are doing is saying that if the Air Force is going to continue to be responsible for the behavior and the actions of the CAP, they be given some oversight, some ability to get into the books and check these things out. It is my understanding that the account that the Senator from Colorado has is not an accurate account of the cruise. I will repeat the accusation. 
   The Southeast Region Commanders Conference was held on a cruise to Nassau. Now, this is a cruise paid for by public 
   funds, CAP funds, which came from the Air Force. After the conference, some individuals requested and received per diem, even though the cost of the cruise had been paid for by taxpayer money. I just think this is so outrageous. In fact, the Air Force personnel who was wanting to stop this from happening was so opposed to it that he refused to go on the trip himself. He canceled out. 
   All we are saying is that if they are going to be responsible for this, we are going to have to, in some way, give them the authority to oversee it. After a while, I am going to be giving a talk on what I find to be offensive about this whole bill that we are discussing today. It is primarily that we are not funding adequately our whole military, certainly in the area of readiness. Our service Chiefs, our four-stars, and our CINCs all got together and said, in order to meet the minimum expectations of the American people, and to meet our national requirements, our mission requirements, we would have to have $17.4 billion a year more for the next 6 years, plus the amount for pay increases and retirement. That comes to about $24 billion. The amount of increase here is only $9 billion--totally inadequate. 
   I am supporting this legislation because it is the very best we can do. I say to the Senator from Colorado, we are looking everywhere to pick up a million dollars here and a little bit there; we want to do it. In spite of that, General Ryan recommended, because of his affection for the CAP, an additional $7.5 million. That should demonstrate his feelings about the CAP. We were not able to give that additional amount. We kept the same levels as the previous year because we have problems in modernization, quality of life, force strength, and there is no place that isn't bleeding and hemorrhaging right now. So that is my concern. 
   I would hate to be in a position to deny the Air Force the right to at least look at the books and have an opportunity to stop this type of abuse if they are going to be responsible for their actions. Right now, they are responsible. That is why I said if this should pass, I think the Secretary of the Air Force really needs to refer these accusations to the FBI and sever the ties of the Air Force. CAP doesn't want that. They have had a very good relationship all these years. I think there may be a small number of people who perhaps have not exercised the proper behavior and don't want the oversight. But I can't think right now of any example in Government where someone is responsible for someone else and yet has no authority over their behavior. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. INHOFE. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I was going to ask a question of the Senator. First of all, I realize that the Senator from Colorado and I both are among the strongest supporters of our national defense. The Center for Security Policy has us both rated as 100 percent. That is not an issue on the table. We both feel that way. 
   My problem is, No. 1, they have made the specific statement that it is not going to cost any more to have some supervision over the CAP because the time they spend trying to look into these things without the authority to do it is more time consuming than if they had the legal authority that we are trying to give them with our defense authorization bill. If you just take the money in the examples I used on the trip to Nassau and all of that, I think you would have to agree that the money would be better spent on spare parts than it would be on some of the double-dipping in which they have engaged. 
   I would be glad to yield to the Senator from Alabama.

   Mr. INHOFE. Let me yield myself whatever time I may need. 
   I say to the Senator that in my remarks I commented that there isn't a Member of the 100 Members of the Senate who has worked closer on an active basis, actually flying with and teaching and working with the CAP, than I have. I have attended every ceremony that they have had--unless there is something I don't know about--in the State of Oklahoma, because of my strong support for their group. 
   My problem is this wonderful group has a few bad apples in it, and there is no way to get at those bad apples. Here we have General Ryan suggesting that we increase the appropriations to them for the operation of their program by $7.5 million that we had to deny when the Senator and I were sitting in the Armed Services Committee. 
   This is a time that we can't afford to be throwing away any money when we have all the readiness needs, when we have modernization needs, when we have force strength needs, and quality-of-life needs, and all of these things that need to be funded in this particular area. I just do not want to be in a position where I am passing an amendment to take away the authority of the Air Force in this case which is using public funds to fund this entity and taking away their ability to in some way dictate what is going on there if they are going to be responsible for it. 
   Here they are responsible for some of this activity, such as the one individual that was charging the cost of his flying hours to the CAP counterdrug account when he was actually flying to visit his daughter, or one CAP person charged his time both to the home State and the CAP counterdrug budget. So he is double-dipping. Those are public funds they are getting--funds that could be used to buy spare parts, funds that would keep us from having to cannibalize engines, funds that would keep us from having to keep these guys working 16 hours a day repairing aircraft that are broken down. 
   I think we are looking at so many issues. That is why we discussed it at some length in our committee, because we can't allow these abuses to take place and tell the Air Force, Your hands are tied; you have responsibility for their actions but you don't have anything to do with their performance.

   Mr. INHOFE. Reclaiming my time, let me throw out a suggestion. We can go ahead and pass this as a mark that dictates at this time. If there is any kind of abuse, we can change it. Anything we do can be changed. That is what we are trying to do right now. These abuses are not things that just happened in the last 6 months. They have been happening over a long period of time. 
   We talked about doing something about this in the last three authorization bills. We haven't done it. We put it off. Nothing has happened. Now we have an opportunity to do it. All we are doing here is allowing us to at least have some ability to monitor what is going on and stop some of these things. 
   I just keep thinking about the ``60 Minutes'' program coming up with all of these abuses. What do we do? We have debated this issue. We turned around and said we will leave the status quo. That is what we are going to do if we pass the amendment.

   Mr. INHOFE. The amendment merely gives oversight. 
   Here is the problem: I appreciate the voluntary aspect of it; unfortunately, the voluntary aspect of this only funds about 5 percent, and about 95 percent is public funds, for which we are responsible. 
   Before the esteemed chairman of the committee arrived, I talked about how strapped we are. I believe the bill we are debating today is inadequate in terms of proper funding, but it is the best we can do, so we support it. 
   I can think of military construction projects right now that would love to have a little extra funding, and it does relate to our security interests. 
   I am happy to work with the Senator from Colorado on any kind of a compromise that will give oversight of the CAP to the Air Force so that they will have some degree of control. 
   If 95 percent of the funding of the CAP is taxpayers' dollars, the taxpayers have to have some degree of control. We have a lot of other anecdotal accusations. I don't want to get into that. Things like this are going on and things like this will continue to go on in any entity in society that doesn't have any oversight. I can cite some examples in another committee. We served on the Environment and Public Works Committee where one of the agencies has had no oversight over the past 5 or 6 years and was getting out of hand. They have to have oversight. Those people are dealing with public funds and the public has to have oversight. 
   My concern is what will happen if we don't do this. If we don't do this, as I suggested, the Secretarys of the Air Force may decide to sever relations, and then we really have a serious problem with CAP. I think there is not a person in here who is not a strong supporter of the CAP --certainly these three Senators are among the strongest. We 
   are attempting to save it.

   Mr. INHOFE. First of all, I don't want the Senator to get the impression that he is alone in his feelings. I agree with everything the Senator said. 
   I would like to ask the Senator if he didn't leave out one very significant reason why we should not be involved in that war --or that civil war within a sovereign nation--is that in our state of readiness right now we cannot carry out the national military strategy in defending America's regional fronts. In fact, it is even questionable, according to our air combat commander, that we could defend America on one front, with all the allocations of our scarce assets that are going into Bosnia, Haiti, and Kosovo. 
   Right now my major concern, with 5,000 of our troops already over there in Albania, is that they are virtually naked; they have no force protection, no infrastructure. 
   I hope the Senator will add to his list of reasoning why we shouldn't be there is because it is draining our ability to defend America on such fronts as North Korea or the Middle East.

   Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator for yielding. 
   I am not going to take that long, only because I don't want the Senator to be left with no time to respond to what I think we will be hearing in the next 22 minutes. I want to make sure the Senator has adequate time. 
   Let me take a minute and say that I don't like the amendment but I don't  know any other choice. I wish there were other choices out there. 
   We got involved in this. I am sure I can visualize what was happening when they made the decision to invade a sovereign nation, sitting around a table saying, we will send bombs out there for a couple of days and that will take care of him and everything will be fine. 
   That was not the plan. We heard the plan criticized by the very best people out there. I will be in the region again this weekend. 
   My concern, as I voiced several times, without a well laid out plan in a war we shouldn't be involved in--we have troops out there, as I said before, who are virtually naked and have no protection right now. 
   I am concerned about Albania and the threat to our lives there as much as I am crossing that line into Kosovo. Because right now there is no force protection over there. 
   As far as the pilots are concerned, I don't think there is a person in this U.S. Senate who has visited with the pilots more than I have, because as chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee I go around to all these places. I take journalists with me, frankly, so these people will realize why we are only retaining 19 percent of our Navy pilots, 27 percent of our Air Force pilots. It is not just the attractive economy on the outside. It is not just the fact our mechanics are overworked and they are not sure the spare parts are going to be there. As they said in one of the places, with witnesses there, our problem is we have lost our sense of mission. They are sending us in places without adequate training. With all the money we are spending in these contingency operations where we do not have strategic interests, it is draining us from our ability to properly train should we have to meet a contingency where our national strategic interests are at stake. 
   Our time that we are training these guys in red flag exercises in Nellis is cut way down; the National Training Center out in the desert, cutting down Twenty-nine Palms for the marines; they are not getting adequate training because we are busy deploying our troops in places where we do not have a national strategic interest. So I just look upon this as a way out. We have been looking for a way out of Bosnia since 1995. Now there is no end in sight there. I do not want to get ourselves in that position, so I see the only way out right now is what the Senator from New Hampshire is suggesting. I do support his amendment.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Delaware, the Senator from Alabama, and others have been talking about the legal ramifications of what this amendment is all about. You can study the sections and subsections and sub-subsections and quote all of these things, but I think we all know this was an alliance that was set up to be a defensive alliance. Now we are getting into something that is far more than that. 
   But I would put out two things that have not been said. First of all, I just came back from the Canada-United States interparliamentarian meeting up there. It is very clear to me they are involved in this, with a very modest contribution, only because we are in there. I wonder how many other of these countries are getting involved because we are providing that leadership. 
   No. 2, my concern about this is not a legalistic concern. It is what effect is this having on our state of readiness. I happen to be chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee. This is what is very frightening. We can remember in this Chamber in 1994, in 1995, talking about Bosnia; we were going to be sending people over to Bosnia. What was the main argument used? We have to protect the integrity of NATO. Then we have the same thing coming up on Kosovo. It has come up in other places, too. 
   These are areas where we do not have national strategic interests. What it has done is to put us in a position where we cannot carry out the minimum expectations of the American people or our national military strategy, which is to defend America on two fronts. 
   I want to tell you how proud I was of General Hawley the other day, Air Combat Command, who came out and said we, right now, are not in a position to respond if we should be called upon to respond in areas where we do have a national strategic interest such as North Korea or the Persian Gulf. 
   It is very, very important that we get to the bottom of this and we make a determination as to what our future commitments are going to be as far as NATO is concerned.

   Mr. President, I was absent from the Senate today in order to be a pallbearer at a funeral in Tahlequah, Okla. Had I been present, I would have voted ``no'' on the Hatch-Craig amendment. This position is consistent with my vote to table the same amendment on May 13. The tabling motion failed 3-97, thus leading to the today. I believe my presence would not have changed the outcome since determined efforts were  being made to switch just enough votes to assure the amendment's passage.

   Mr. INHOFE. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank my colleague, the senior Senator from Oklahoma. 
   Mr. President, in Oklahoma we have gone through tragedies that are indescribable. The Murrah Federal Office Building was the most significant terrorist attack on domestic soil in the history of America. It is one that you can't describe standing 
   here on the Senate floor. I have been there. And I remember so well the thundering march, the cadence of the fire trucks as they were going to try to extract so many people out of the building, and all types of volunteers. 
   We saw the same thing yesterday. It was indescribable. I note the story of a horse that was picked up and taken a quarter of a mile in the air, and dropped on top of a car, then a car on top of a house, and the twisted ``I'' beams. The power, the indescribable power that was there. 
   James Lee Witt--I am very complimentary of James Lee Witt, a man I have known long before he was Director of FEMA. As chairman of the committee that has jurisdiction over FEMA, I work very closely with him. And I tell you right now, he had his hands on there. He was personally involved in it. He explained to us that this is the most significant tornado that he had seen in terms of the devastating damage and power that was there. 
   You always remember one or two things. I recall in the helicopter ride going across a little town called Moore, OK. Everything was devastated in that town, except right across the street from the most devastating part of this tornado stood the First Baptist Church of Moore, OK. It had been untouched. 
   As my senior Senator from Oklahoma said, we are so appreciative of everyone coming together, for all of the comments of our colleagues since we have been back, the prayers that we had this morning from the Senate Chaplain and others, and people like the Governor of Oklahoma, the mayor of Oklahoma City throughout yesterday, the police departments and the fire departments, all of the volunteers, and certainly FEMA bringing this all together. 
   We are very thankful, and we in Oklahoma will be bound to that. We ask for your continued prayers for the families, for those who lost their lives, and for the families of those who lost their lives. 
   I thank very much all of the government coming together to help us rebuild the damage that has been done. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator from Arizona particularly for the way he has conducted himself in this debate in spite of the fact that there are many who do not agree with him and the resolution. 
   Let me first share some ideas that perhaps have not been discussed. I have done a lot of crossing off as I have listened today, taking off items I was going to discuss, and I have shortened my remarks and probably won't use all of my time. 
   First of all, months ago I went to Kosovo when I saw the handwriting on the wall, when I felt that ultimately this President was going to send ground troops into Kosovo. In spite of the fact he continuously said he was not going to, I felt very strongly that he was. I went over to find out as much as I could before all of the bombing started, what it was really like in Kosovo. Truly, Milosevic is just as bad a person as everybody says he is. I do not question that. But one of the things I came back with is a knowledge of a little bit of the history of the area and that some of the people over there are bad, too. 
   For example, you are talking about Kosovo, which is very small. It is about 75 miles in diameter, surrounded by mountains and for 600 years has been an area that has strived unsuccessfully for autonomy. There have been times when the Albanians have been the bad guys and the Serbs have been the good guys, and vice versa. It was about 12 years ago we were all so concerned because the KLA was doing all the raping and looting and burning, and not the Serbs. 
   Also, I noticed only two dead people in the road going across Kosovo. I turned them over. They ended up being Serbs. They were killed by the KLA. They were executed at point-blank range. 
   Rounding a corner about 10 minutes later, I saw someone--I found myself in the sights of a rifle-propelled grenade, an RPG-7, a very lethal weapon. After they put it down, we walked over, and it was the KLA, it wasn't the Serbs. 
   I went on and we saw on the map a place called the ``no-go zone.'' I asked what it was. They said that is where you do not go. They do not care whether you are a United States Senator or whether you are a Serb or an Albanian; if you go in there, you are going to be shot. It was controlled by the KLA. 
   I guess what I am saying, Madam President, is there are bad guys on both sides. 
   I would like to just mention one thing about the China scandal, because I see a connection here. I hate to say this, but a couple of months ago on this floor I told the history of 
   what had happened in the China scandal and the fact that back in the 1980s the technology known as the WA-8 technology was stolen and nobody knew about it until about 1995. The administration--the President and the administration found out about it and they withheld that from Congress for quite a number of years--not months but years. So in Senator WARNER's committee we started having some hearings to find out what the truth was. 
   Sometimes I remember that Winston Churchill said:  
   Truth is incontrovertible. Panic may rescind it, ignorance may deride it, malice may destroy it, but there it is.  
   Ultimately you get to that truth. That is what we are trying to get. And Notra Trulock, who was in charge of the intelligence for the Department of Energy--he said it became very serious a year ago--said we are going to have to tell Congress about this. So he wanted to come. He had to go to his superior, who was the Acting Director of the Department of Energy, Betsy Moler. And she said: No, you can't do that. You can't do that because it might be detrimental to the President's China policy. 
   Here we are talking about the theft of the most significant nuclear device in our arsenal, the WA-8 warhead. To give you an idea what it is, Madam President, this is something that has 10 times the explosive power of the bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima. It is a fraction of the size. The Chinese actually had missiles that were aimed at us at that time, at the time the President was running around the country, 133 times, saying: For the first time in the nuclear age there is not one missile aimed at American children--when in fact we had some 28 cities that were being targeted at that time. He signed the waiver to allow the Chinese to have a guidance technology to make those missiles more accurate, and he had knowledge of the fact they had, now, the warhead, the WA-8 warhead, that could be fitted on one of these. As a matter of fact, more than one could be fitted on one of their multiple-stage rockets. 
   I say that there is a connection. There is always talk about the President, every time he gets in trouble, something big happens, like sending cruise missiles into Sudan or Afghanistan or Iraq. In this case, we started a war. But I will say this--I do not want to dwell on this because that is not the subject at hand today--I see a connection. I believe there is a connection. I think we may very well have a ``Wag The Dog'' situation here. I think everyone knows what I am talking about. They do not say it, but they know what I am talking about. 
   But I did ask, in the committee meeting, since we had two diametrically opposed testimonies coming from Mr. Trulock and Ms. Moler, if they would submit to a lie detector test. Mr. Trulock immediately said he would; Ms. Moler vacillated. And then, in response to a letter, I found he is willing and she said she is not. So I think I know who is telling the truth. Nonetheless, we are going to have to address that in a little bit different way. 
   We have learned since then, by the way, in the last 6 years, virtually everything in our nuclear arsenal is now in the hands of the Chinese. 
   What I would like to do is cover this in four areas that have not been discussed by previous speakers. I think  they are significant. First of all, some of the things this President has said that led us to where we are today. The 
   President does have an insatiable propensity to say things that are not true, and he does it with such conviction that people start nodding and agreeing with him. I am not going into the details on that; everybody knows about that. 
   But one of the things that I think had the greatest impact on the American people in supporting the President to send our assets in there and get involved in a war of a sovereign nation, in a civil war--the first time we have done that, certainly the first time in 50 years that NATO has done that--was when he started talking about the history of World War I and World War II. He gave a very persuasive story of how World War I and World War II started. The only trouble is, he was not telling the truth. I am not a historian and neither is the President, but I will tell you who is: Henry Kissinger. He said he got quite upset with the thing. I am quoting now. He said:  
   The Second World War did not start in the Balkans, much less as a result of its ethnic conflicts.  
   Then he said:  
   World War I started in the Balkans not as a result of ethnic conflicts but for precisely the opposite reason: because outside powers intervened in a local conflict.  
   He said:  
   Russia backed Serbia and France backed Russia ......  
   And then Germany jumped in on Austria's side. So we had the same situation as is happening today. We had the great powers dividing up and getting on both sides of this, a civil war. It was a civil war, just like it is today. If that started World War I, certainly that could start World War III. 
   So what he said to the American people just simply was not true, Madam President. I think we need to talk about that. 
   The Senator from Washington just a few minutes ago talked about the article by Charles Krauthammer. I think that was very significant, when he talked about the Russians. It is already submitted for the RECORD so I will not resubmit it, but I will read a few things out of it. He said:  
   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov turned his U.S.-bound plane around in mid-transit to protest the bombing. * * * * * 
   Russia kicked NATO's representatives out of Moscow. It sent a spy ship into the Adriatic to shadow the U.S. fleet. It threatened to send military supplies to Belgrade. It boycotted NATO's 50th-year summit in Washington.  
   I don't know what we could have done that could have precipitated more of a problem between us and Russia than has already been done by this President in getting involved in war. 
   The last paragraph reads:  
   Most important, Primakov will have proved to the world--and to pro-Western Russians--that an anti-American foreign policy puts Russia back on the stage and gives it diplomatic clout, while the pro-American policy followed since the Gulf War yielded Russia nothing but a ticket to oblivion. 
   We will have vindicated Primakov's vision of Russia as leader of the opposition, friend and broker of rogue regimes [like] Serbia and Iraq [and] balancer of American power. This might even get him elected president next year when Yeltsin's term expires. 
   Clinton will finally have his legacy.  
   I would like to make one comment also to clarify the RECORD. I know Senator MCCAIN said this does not authorize ground troops. But it does authorize whatever force necessary, 
   and some of us could interpret it that way. But in my opinion, the President has always known that there were going to have to be ground troops. I know he said he is opposed to ground troops, but he wasn't telling the truth. I offer as evidence of that what, long before we sent bombers in there, General Wesley Clark said.  
   We never thought air power alone could stop the paramilitary tragedy......everyone understood it.  
   When he said that, he was with the President of the United States. 
   We had Secretary Bill Cohen, a man I have a great deal of respect for and served with here in this body, in the Senate, but I asked him the same question about this, and he elaborated a little bit on it, but he said we understood that Milosevic:  
   ......could take action very quickly and that an air campaign could do little, if anything, to stop him.  
   So when people talk about this resolution doing that, I think this is what the President had in mind all the time anyway. 
   The second thing I wanted to talk about is the cost of this thing. A lot of people have not realized, they do not stop and think about, the cost in terms of both money and our capability of defending America. I do not think there is anyone who is not going to stand up here and agree with me in this Senate that the President, through his veto power, has decimated the military budget so we right now, today, are at one-half the force strength that we were in 1991, back during the Persian Gulf days. That is very significant. I think people need to hear this and understand it: One-half the force strength. I am talking about one-half the Army divisions, one-half the tactical air wings, one-half the ships, from 600 down to 300. 
   We are one-half the force strength that we were because of this President. Add to that the deployments. We have had more deployments in the last 6 years than the previous 20 years to areas where we do not have any national security interests. We need to look at that. For Joe Lockhart, the Press Secretary of the President, to stand up last week and say that INHOFE is wrong, we are as strong today as we were in 1991, that is just an outrageous lie, and it is quantified in force strength. Anyone who is working on the committees understands this. 
   We have the deployments, we have the problems, and we are paying the price. Yet, we do not have the national security interests. I was so proud of Colin Powell this weekend to come out and admit that America does not have national strategic interests in Kosovo, the same as Henry Kissinger said. I have quoted both of them extensively. Yet, here we are making the commitment. 
   I came back from my last trip to Kosovo just to hear Tony Blair stand up and make his very eloquent statement: We want to escalate the war, escalate the airstrikes. Here is a guy standing up who does have national security interests. He is over there; we are halfway around the world. We do not have strategic interests there, but he does. He stood up and said we need to escalate the airstrikes when, at the time he said this, we had 365 airplanes over there and they had 20. That is easy for him to say. I say he is a better negotiator than we are. 
   I was very much concerned with what I saw over there. I see several members of the committee here. I have to say that sometimes the NATO interests do not necessarily coincide with our interests. I wonder sometimes what has happened to sovereignty in the United States of America, why we have to take 
   on all these other obligations at the expense of our ability to defend ourselves. 
   Can we defend ourselves? Again, General Hawley was very brave when he, this weekend, said--keep in mind he is the air combat commander, the top guy, a four-star general. It takes a lot of courage for one of these generals to stand up against the Commander in Chief, President Clinton. 
   He said that 5 weeks of bombing in Yugoslavia has left U.S. munitions stocks critically short, not just of air-launched cruise missiles, as previously reported, but also of another precision weapon, the joint direct attack munition--that is JDAM--dropped, used by these beautiful B-2s that are performing very well. Now we are short of them. 
   He went on to say we would be hard pressed to handle a second war in the Middle East or Korea. Let's stop and think about that a little bit. Our national military strategy has always been to be able to defend America on two regional fronts. I do not think there is anyone in here who believes we can simultaneously defend America on two regional fronts. 
   What General Hawley is saying on the commitments we have made to Bosnia and Kosovo and with the deployments we have made there is we would have a very difficult time. And he questions whether we could defend America if something happened in either North Korea or in Iraq. That is very serious. 
   I went back to the 21st TACOM, and I know people are tired of hearing me talk about that, but any time we do a ground operation anywhere in that theater, it has to be logistically supported  and run and operated by the 21st TACOM in Germany, down the road from Ramstein Air Force Base. 
   A year or so ago, I was over there. They said just with what we are doing in Bosnia, we are at 100 percent capacity; we cannot do anymore. And now they are doing more. 
   As I watched the deployments take place and they were cranking these troops through--5,000 were there a few days ago --as they were taken through, I said: What are you going to do if there is any contingency like in Iraq? 
   They said: We would be 100 percent dependent on Guard and Reserve. 
   We know the President's intentions are to activate the Guard and Reserve. He has already called up units. He has notified units. 
   Anyway, we do not have the capacity. I went over, Madam President, to Tirana, where our troops are, in a C-17. I found some things out there that were really kind of scary. The C-17 I went in was carrying two MLRSs, that is the mobile launch capability, and one humvee, and all the rest filled up with troops. We were at gross weight. We could not hold another pound in that C-17. 
   We have now done 300 sorties with C-17s. That is the beautiful high-lift vehicle that is going to replace a lot of the others of which we don't have enough and need more. Nonetheless, we are tying those things up. Four hundred of them are going in and out, taking things into Albania. 
   Then we have our scenarios as to what the cost is going to be. I will only say this. I came back convinced that the paper that was written by the Heritage Foundation was true, because from the officers over there, I learned three scenarios, which are: The most conservative scenario, go in and take over Kosovo, as if you can do that and nothing else is going to happen; second, take over Belgrade; third, take over 
   Yugoslavia. 
   The first scenario would take 30,000 American troops; the second scenario, 100,000 American troops; the third scenario, 250,000 American troops. While they do not like to think in terms of casualties, casualties under the most conservative scenario would be somewhere between 500 and 2,000 American casualties; the Belgrade option would be somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 casualties; and the Yugoslavia total effort would be somewhere between 15,000 and 20,000 American casualties. That is very, very serious. 
   Before I quit, I have two other things I want to share. I have heard many Senators stand on this floor and talk about the horrible atrocities that are going on, and they are. Anytime anyone is killed, anytime there are refugees, anytime there is any degree of ethnic cleansing, it is a tragedy. 
   For the junior Senator from California to stand up and say, ``the most God-awful ethnic cleansing since Hitler,'' just is not true. I am sure she believes it is true or she would not say it. 
   We keep hearing these horrible stories. We heard the President walk out into the Rose Garden last week and talk about what Brian Atwood, the AID Administrator, told him about the groups of men that were lined up and doused with gasoline and lighted on fire. I was with Brian Atwood over there a few days before that. Apparently, this allegedly happened before that time. He did not tell me about it. 
   I don't know what is true and is not true. I will say this. I know despite what you hear to the contrary--and this is most significant--the atrocities that have been committed on the Kosovar Albanians are minor when compared to other places. 
   I am involved in mission work. I go to west Africa with some regularity. I was in west Africa less than a month ago. This does not have anything to do with being a Senator. It is doing the Lord's work in some of these places. I am talking about Benin, Cote d'Ivoire, Angola, Nigeria, Sierra Leone. For every one person who has been killed, ethnically cleansed, killed in the Kosovar Albanians, for every one, there have been 80 killed in just the two countries of Angola and Sierra Leone. 
   Are they as brutal? Yes. They went into Sierra Leone and took whole tribes of people, lined up the children and cut their hands off. Entire tribes, the most brutal killing. For every one killed in Kosovo, 80 were killed there. Why aren't we concerned about that? We have now come to the conclusion that it is humanitarian reasons that are motivating us. What is wrong with the 80-to-1 ratio in west Africa? 
   What about Rwanda? For every one that has been killed in Kosovo, there have been 300 killed in the one country of Rwanda. You can go throughout Africa and see much greater atrocities.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, for too long, economic development in Indian country has been hindered by antiquated rules and regulations, many dating back to before the turn of the century. Many American Indians continue to struggle, denied by bureaucracy the opportunity to take steps to improve their position. I am proposing legislation today that would reverse one of these situations. 
   Under current law, Indian lands owned by more than one person require the consent of 100 percent of the owners before mineral development can go  forward. Oftentimes, this fractionated property is owned by over one hundred people; it is difficult, if not impossible, to locate all the owners. Once found, developers must obtain their unanimous consent. As you can imagine, this creates a significant and often insurmountable obstacle for leasing or other development. Last year, Congress lowered this requirement for the Three Affiliated Tribes of the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation to a majority, which more closely resembles regulations for non-Indian land. By loosening the consent requirements, these tribes have found the right balance between economic progress and protection of landowners' rights. 
   I am proposing to extend last year's legislation to seven Oklahoma tribes: the Comanche, Kiowa, Apache, Fort Sill Apache, Delaware, and the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes. Oil and gas are the cornerstone of Oklahoma's economy, but these tribes have by and large been left out of this industry because of the stringent consent statutes. Increased access to their own land would greatly facilitate mineral development, bringing increased economic opportunity. These tribes and their members will now be able to undertake oil and gas exploration which was previously not possible. This will represent a significant advance toward greater economic empowerment, breaking out of the constraints now imposed on these tribes. 
   Common sense dictates that the first step of self-sufficiency is being allowed to use the resources you already own. This proposal will be equitable and beneficial to all parties involved. I look forward to working with my colleagues on this and other such legislation that would help American Indians achieve greater economic independence.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I returned from Albania just a few hours ago. This is the third time I have made such a trip. I went over to see whether or not the beliefs I have developed over the last 7 months were true, and I came back, really, very convinced that they in fact are true. 
   For one thing--I have been saying for quite some time--even though the President denies it, the President has planned all along to send American ground troops into Kosovo. I am prepared to document this. 
   I want to put my remarks into four categories: One is the administration's approach to this war that we are about to get in; secondly, the cost in terms of both national security and dollars; third, refugees; and fourth, what our troops are in right now. 
   Before I do that, I want to go back and review a couple of remarks I made on March 23, just a month ago, to put it in proper perspective. 
   A month ago, I stated that I felt if we did not try to put a stop to this, we would, in fact, be in a protracted, bloody long war. This is a war in which we do not have national security interests. 
   A lot of people say, ``Well, we do have national security interests.'' I know this is a relative term. You can argue it, I suppose, but the people who are really knowledgeable on this are convinced that we do not have national security interests at stake. 
   Henry Kissinger said:  
   The proposed deployment in Kosovo does not deal with any threat to American security....... Kosovo is no more a threat to America than Haiti was to Europe.  
   I further went into the conclusion that if, in fact, we do not have national security interests, it is the humanitarian motivation which is getting us involved in this war. We are concerned about it, and I want to get into some detail about that. 
   There are some things I have discovered in the last 3 days. However, a month ago I mentioned that if this is the case and if we are concerned about humanitarian problems that exist all around the world, why are we not concerned about the 800,000 who have been killed in ethnic strife in Rwanda, the thousands who have been killed in Ethiopia, the 140 civilians killed by paramilitary squads in Colombia, including 27 worshipers slain during a village church service? Why is there no outcry for United States involvement in these obvious humanitarian situations where far, far more people have been brutally murdered than in the current Kosovo crisis? 
   Let me share with you, as I did back on March 23, a couple of paragraphs from an article in the Minneapolis-St. Paul Star Tribune. This was written on January 31, 1999. This was just a few days after 45 people were killed in Kosovo. Let's keep that in mind when putting this in the proper context, Mr. President. 
   I am quoting from the Minneapolis-St. Paul Star Tribune:  
   But no one mobilized on behalf of perhaps 500 people who were shot, hacked and burned to death in a village in eastern Congo, in central Africa around the same time. No outrage was expressed on behalf of many other innocents who had the misfortune to be slain just off the world's stage over the last few weeks. 
   Why do 45 white Europeans rate an all-out response [from the administration] while several hundred black Africans are barely worth the notice? 
   While U.S. officials struggled to provide an answer, analysts said the uneven U.S. responses to a spurt of violence in the past month illuminates not just an immoral or perhaps racist foreign policy, but one that fails on pragmatic and strategic grounds as well.  
   So now the President wants to send the U.S. military into Kosovo. Keep in mind, when we talked about this 1 month ago, he was still denying that he was going to send troops, and yet now we find out in the recent meeting which was held by NATO in Washington that they are doing an update strategy--an update strategy, Mr. President. That means perhaps an update of what we have previously said was our position on sending in ground troops. 
   I have to say, the whole purpose for me to be on the floor right now is to say I know there is no way to stop this. Once American troops are on the ground in Kosovo, we will all support them and do everything we can for the American troops. It will be the same situation we faced in Bosnia. We will not be able to turn this around. That is when it becomes protracted and without an end. 
   I will recount a trip I made to Kosovo recently--it was in January of this year--to find out what Kosovo was really like at that time. Keep in mind, Kosovo is only 75 miles across and 75 miles long. It is a place that has been in strife and civil war since 1389. 
   As I was going across Kosovo, I had a couple of experiences. One experience I had was seeing two dead bodies. These were obviously soldiers. When we turned them over, we saw that they were not Albanians; they were Serbs. They had been executed at close range by the KLA. 
   We went on a little bit further. I saw on the map something called a ``no-go zone.'' I said: I would like to go in to see what it is like. They said: You can't do that; it is occupied by the KLA, the Albanian military, and they will kill anybody who comes in. They don't care if you are a United States Senator or someone from the press. Nonetheless, you will be dead if you go in there. 
   We did not go in. 
   Then we rounded another corner. There was a rocket-propelled grenade, an RPG-7, that was aimed right at our heads. They put it down, and we went over and found out they were Albanians, not Serbs. 
   I am saying this, and I said this back on the 23rd of March, for a specific reason, and that reason is that while Milosevic is a bad guy, he is not the only bad guy in that conflict which is taking place.  
   There is one more thing I will mention with Henry Kissinger that I mentioned back on the 23rd of March. He said:  
   Each incremental deployment into the Balkans is bound to weaken our ability to deal with Saddam Hussein ..... .  
   Of course, this is the most critical thing we are dealing with. I happen to chair the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness. This committee is in charge of all readiness issues and military construction, all training. Since this President took office, we have watched what has happened with our military and our ability to defend ourselves. I am going to elaborate on that a little bit later. 
   The bottom line is, we are one-half the strength we were when he took office. I quantify that by saying one-half of the Army divisions, one-half of the tactical air wings, one-half of the ships. We have gone down from a 600-ship Navy to a 300-ship Navy. And all these things are happening at a time when we do not have the capacity to fund and to logistically support another ground movement. 
   A month ago, I went by the 21st TACOM. It is located in Germany. Its function is to logistically support ground operations. At that time, the 21st TACOM said they were at 100 percent capacity and could not take on any more responsibilities because they were devoting all their attention to Bosnia. The trucks were going into Bosnia from Hungary, taking everything necessary to keep that exercise going. 
   I looked at the problem we have within the administration in the 21st TACOM. This President has cut the number of troops managing from 28,500 to 7,300. They are operating with just a fraction of the number they had before, about one-fourth. 
   I asked the question: If we get into something--at that time, we thought it was going to be Iraq; we didn't know about Kosovo at that time--if something happens and we need ground troops in Iraq, what are you going to do? That is in your theater, too. 
   They said: We couldn't do anything. We would be 100 percent dependent upon Guard and Reserve. As we know, our critical operational specialities, MOSs, are failing in our Reserve and Guard components, and the reason is that we have had so many deployments under this administration that they cannot be expected to leave their jobs. A doctor can no longer expect to leave his practice for a period of 270 days and go back and have any practice left. And the same thing is true with the employers around the country. So we have those serious problems. Again, this is from a month ago. 
   And lastly, I mention, in a hearing before us, what the various generals had said. General Ryan, who is the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, said, ``There stands a very good chance that we will lose aircraft against the Yugoslavian air defense.'' The Navy Chief of Staff said, ``We must be prepared to take losses.'' The Marine Corps Commandant, General Krulak, said it will be ``tremendously dangerous.'' And George Tenet, the Director of Central Intelligence of the United States, reminded us that Kosovo is not Bosnia, and if we get on the ground there, their participants are not tired and worn out, they are ready and willing and culturally prepared to fight and to kill Americans. 
   I mention that, Mr. President--that was a month ago--to get it in a context that helps me to understand where we are today. I want to mention, I am not saying this as a Republican; I am saying this as a Member of the U.S. Senate and as the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Readiness Subcommittee, with a responsibility to tell the truth about what is going on. 
   The American people have not been hearing the truth. They have heard that the President does not want to send in ground troops, and yet we know he does want to send in ground troops. I have to say that the President of the United States, Bill Clinton, has a propensity to say things that are untrue with great conviction. And for that reason, I am afraid there are a lot of people who are afraid of this man, because he is so adept at getting the American people behind him. 
   One of the things he has said that is not true is what he told 
   the American people as to the reason why we were going to get involved. He talked about the history, and he said that this is exactly what precipitated World War I, and the same thing with World War II. I am not a historian, Mr. President, certainly not the historian that you are, but I would say there are some historians around who have voiced themselves on this. 
   Again, going back to Henry Kissinger, no one will question his credentials concerning the history of that region and that period of time. He said--and I am quoting now--``The Second World War did not start in the Balkans, much less as a result of its ethnic conflicts,'' totally refuting what the President told the American people. He goes on--and this is further quoting --``World War I started in the Balkans not as a result of ethnic conflicts but for precisely the opposite reason: because outside powers intervened in a local conflict. The assassination of the Crown Prince of Austria--an imperial power--by a Serbian nationalist led to a world war because Russia backed''--listen to this, Mr. President--``Russia backed Serbia and France backed Russia while Germany supported Austria.'' 
   That is exactly the same thing right now. If a person wanted to start World War III, based on the model that took place for World War I, they would do exactly what we are doing; that is, go in there and say to Russia and to China, who is with Russia, ``All right. We don't care what you say, we're going to get involved in a war here,'' and rub their nose in it. 
   Let's keep in mind that China and Russia have missiles that will reach the United States of America, and they have every different kind of weapon of mass destruction put on those missiles. So it is just exactly the opposite of what the President said. That war started because the superpowers of the time took each side in a civil war that was taking place in what was then Yugoslavia. 
   I have said several times that the President has not been telling the American people the truth in terms of ground troops and the number of ground troops that are going to be going in. I would like to quote now to try to validate what I have said. General Wesley Clark, who is the Supreme Allied Commander for NATO and our troops in Europe, said--this is way back in the beginning, 7 months ago--``We never thought air power alone could stop the paramilitary tragedy ..... everyone understood it.......'' 
   And just a week ago, Thursday, the Presiding Officer will remember, because he was sitting there, Secretary Bill Cohen, in whom I have the most respect, said, ``We would try diplomacy, and that's what Rambouillet was all about ..... we would try deterrence ..... but failing that, we understood that [Milosevic] could take action very quickly and that an air campaign could do little if anything to stop him.'' 
   So we have not just the experts in the field, the commanding general, but also the Secretary of Defense who said they have known all along we are going to have to send troops in. Obviously, they both work for President Clinton. And President Clinton knew it. 
   I was a little disturbed last week when Joe Lockhart, in one of his press conferences, brushed off some questions, and then he volunteered without a question being asked--he said, ``Senator INHOFE is wrong in that we are in great shape. Our state of readiness is just as good as it was back in 1991,'' or 
   words to that effect. And I have to say either he is intentionally lying or just incredibly misinformed, because, as I said before, we, right now, are one-half the troop strength that we were in 1991. I think it is a terrible disservice for Joe Lockhart and the President to try to convince the American people that we are more prepared than we really are. 
   I would like to also mention that the President is breaking the law today. I was over there in just the last 3 days, and I went in there on a C-17. That C-17 had multiple launch rockets right there, all of them hot and ready to be fired--two of those, along with some two pallets of additional ammunition, a humvee, and additional troops. 
   Troops are there right now within the sight of the border of Kosovo. And one of our most brilliant Senators, Senator PAT ROBERTS, had passed an amendment to the 1999 defense appropriations bill where he said that the President cannot deploy troops to--and  he named different places, which would include this area--unless eight different conditions were met. One was that we have national security interests; No. 2, why they are national security interests; No. 3, what is the mission; No. 4, what is the exit strategy; No. 5, what is the cost; No. 6, identify the cost; No. 7, how it will affect readiness; and there is an eighth one. He has not complied with any of these eight. I say just by sending them into Albania, he has already broken that law. 
   The second area I want to get into is cost. In ``cost,'' I am not talking about just dollars but also national security. 
   Because the President has decimated our defense budget, we no longer can defend America on two simultaneous, what they call MTWs--major theater wars. Ninety percent of the American people think we can because they have been told we can, but we cannot. We are not able to do that. We are one-half the force strength we were. 
   In addition to that, we are handling all of these deployments. We have had more deployments in the last 6 years than we had in the 20 years prior to that. In almost every case, they are being deployed in areas where we have no national security interests. So we are paying without any national security interest. 
   I think it is very interesting to note that, of the great effort we have put forth in the air, which has been very successful in terms of our deployment and our ability and our equipment, a total of 480 aircraft were used. Well, guess what, Mr. President. Three hundred sixty-five of those 480 were us, the United States of America. 
   So we have Tony Blair standing up and making these great profound statements: ``We have to escalate the war.'' That is easy for him to say. We have 365 airplanes over there. He has 20. I will tell you, that is a pretty good deal. ``Let's go ahead and escalate,'' if you are Tony Blair. 
   I have a problem with all these multinationalist things, obligations or obsessions, that this President has. In the case of NATO, we have 80 percent of the effort right now we are paying for and yet we only have 5 percent of the vote. 
   General Hendrix is the commander in chief of the 5th Corps over there. The 5th Corps, Mr. President, has 50,000 troops. To give you an idea of the significance of what is going on right now with the deployment to Tirana, just south of the Kosovo border, where I just came back from--where you have already been--he is there now full time. And what do we have? As of today, we have 5,000 troops--wait a minute--we have 5,000 out of his 50,000, and he is spending all of his time there. Why is he doing that? I can tell you--and I am sure the others who have been over there are fully aware--the big problem is that the decisions on targets for our military aircraft are being made by committees. 
   You have NATO. You have all these other countries that have to pass on targets. It is my understanding that even the President personally wants to pass on those targets. 
   This is a big difference from the war in Kuwait in 1991. George Bush and the administration got together and said, we have a serious problem over there. We are going to have to take care of it. This is our mission. Colin Powell and General Schwarzkopf, you go out and do it. These people are experts. They are professionals. So is General Hendrix, but he is not able to do it on his own because these are committee decisions as to where they are supposed to be able to fire at their targets. 
   I will just update for a minute. This is as of 2 or 3 days ago. We are just now approaching 400 sorties coming out of Ramstein Air Force Base. These are C-17s carrying our equipment. You go over there and you get on the ground where all of our troops are in tent cities. You see everything over there is American. 
   I will also mention the cost of this and the three scenarios. One scenario is you just send the troops in as far as Kosovo, and that would be about 60,000 troops, according to what I found out over there, 30,000 of which would be Americans. Or the next step, if we went all the way and took Belgrade, that would take 200,000 troops, of which half would be U.S. troops. Or if we wanted to destroy Yugoslavia altogether, it would take a half million troops, a quarter million of those would be Americans. 
   I thought this was interesting because I found this out when I was over there. And I thought I had heard these figures before. The Heritage Foundation came out on April 21 and put down the cost of the three options, and I found that to be exactly what I found out over there. The only thing is, they went one step further. They included U.S. casualties and the cost. The cheap way, going into Kosovo, would cost from $5 billion to $10 billion--this is the United States cost--and would take from 500 to 2,000 American casualties. The second, going into Belgrade, would be $10 billion to $20 billion. It would take a toll of 5,000 to 10,000 American casualties. The third, $50 billion to $60 billion, and that would result in 15,000 to 20,000 casualties.

   Mr. INHOFE. So we have that very serious problem. 
   I will briefly, in the remaining time, talk about the refugee situation. The toll we have heard about in terms of deaths over there has been somewhere between 2,000 and 3,500. NATO is now saying 3,500; some are saying 2,000. Let's say 3,000. That means that 1 out of 600 of the Kosovar Albanians has lost his life, 1 out of 600. If you compare that--I have a ministry in West Africa. Three weeks ago, I came back from there. In the two countries of Angola and Sierra Leone, for every 1 person who has lost his life in Kosovo, 80 have lost their lives in just those two countries alone. 
   We knew this was coming. I am reading now from the Washington Post of March 31:  
   For weeks before the NATO air campaign against Yugoslavia, CIA Director George Tenet had been forecasting that Serb-led Yugoslavian forces might respond by accelerating ethnic cleansing.  
   Then when we asked Secretary Cohen about this, he said:  
   With respect to George Tenet's testifying that the bombing could, in fact, accelerate Milosevic's plans, we also knew that.  
   So they knew it. The President knew it, and the administration knew it. I have to say this--and this has not been observed by anyone so far--I interviewed these refugees just 2 days ago. When I interviewed the refugees, I found some very interesting things. They all said the same thing. They said that, in fact, they didn't have any problems until the bombing started. I was interviewed by a Tirana TV station, I think it was Tirana. It was Albanian, anyway. And they said, What is the United States going to do about all these refugees? I said, What do you mean, what are we going to do? He said, You are the reason we are here. You are the ones that bombed, and that is what has caused the ethnic cleansing and the forced exodus. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 5 additional minutes.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have to say one other thing about the refugees. The refugees, in spite of the fact it is a  horrible thing that some 3,000 of them have lost their lives, still when you look at the refugees, I was shocked to find out, as perhaps you were, that they are very well off, considering they are refugees. Kids are all wearing Nikes and were very well dressed. They have the food that they need to eat. They seem to be in much better shape, certainly much better shape than the refugees in some other areas. 
   Lastly, I want to mention the troops. Our troops are doing a great job. I just couldn't feel better about that. But I really want to get into this, because the New York Times said, on April 13, we are going into Kosovo, the middle of nowhere, with no infrastructure. They will be naked, an official told the New York Times. 
   I went in there and I found that is exactly right. Our troops have just arrived there, and they are up to their knees, literally, in mud in a tent city. You have to keep in mind that Albania has some things that are very unique. First of all, it is the poorest country in Europe. Secondly, it is always listed as one of the three most dangerous countries in the world. And third, a guy named Hoxha came along right after the Second World 
   War, and he actually declared, and it is still official policy, it is the only nation that has a declared policy of atheism. So we are dealing with that kind of people there, too. 
   Then something happened in 1997. It is called a pyramid scheme. In 1997, these poor Albanians, from this country in poverty, as poor as Haiti, revolted and they took over the military. When they did that, they took over all the weapons they had. What kind of weapons did they have? They had rocket-propelled grenades, RPG-7s. They had AKA-47s. They had SA-7s, a shoulder-launched, surface-to-air missile that can knock down one of our Apaches very easily, and they had mortars. So here we have our troops who are there in the mud without any infrastructure protecting them and with all of this hostility around them. I might also add, I was sorry--I hate to even say this--that one of the units that came in there when I was there was the mortician unit, so the body bags have arrived. 
   Mr. President, if there is ever a scene that is set for gradual escalation and for mission creep, this is it. I can see our Troops going in right now. When the President, who has already decided he is going to send in American troops, takes these troops and puts them across the border--and we were standing there watching these high mountains where the border is--if they go in that way, or they go around through Macedonia or some other way, and they have to take over Kosovo and get the Serbs out of Kosovo, that mission is going to creep into the Belgrade scenario, and then that will creep into the Yugoslavia scenario, and let's remember what the Heritage Foundation said in terms of American casualties. 
   I will say this, and I am not enjoying doing this. There is only going to be one possible way to keep us out of a war, in my opinion, because the President is going to send in troops. Once our American troops get into Kosovo, it is irreversible. One way to keep that from happening is if the American people wake up and realize that we are getting involved in a war where we do not have any national security interests. We are getting involved in a war that is keeping us from adequately defending America in areas where we do have a national security interest such as Iraq or North Korea. Let us keep in mind that in Korea we still have about 367,000 troops and their families. This would greatly impair them. I hope we can have a concerted effort and a wake-up call to the American people to stop this President from starting this war that we will all live to regret. 
   Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time. 
   Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.

    Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have been involved in the aviation industry for over forty years. In that time, I have logged roughly 8,000 flight hours and have had my share of flight challenges in all sorts of weather and conditions. For instance, in 1980 during a humanitarian mission to Dominica, I led ten airplanes through hurricane David to deliver medical supplies to the island. As recently as 1991 I piloted a Cessna 414 around the world reenacting the same flight of Wiley Post sixty years earlier. I mention this to establish my credentials as someone who is an experienced pilot. As such, I have a great respect for the important job that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) does to make our air system the safest and best in the world. Notwithstanding my admiration for the job that the FAA does, I believe there are some areas of FAA enforcement that need to be examined. One such area is the FAA's use of ``emergency revocation''.  
   After talking with certificate holders and based on my own observations, I believe the FAA unfairly uses this necessary power to prematurely revoke certificates when the circumstances do not support such drastic action. In a revocation action, brought on an emergency basis, the certificate holder loses use of his certificate immediately, without an intermediary review by an impartial third party. The result is that the certificate holder is grounded and in most cases out of work until the issue is adjudicated. 
   Simply put, I believe the FAA unfairly uses this necessary power to prematurely revoke certificates when the circumstances do not support such drastic action. A more reasonable approach when safety is not an issue, would be to adjudicate the revocation on a non-emergency basis allowing the certificate holder continued use of the certificate. 
   In no way do I want to suggest that the FAA should not have emergency revocation powers. I believe it is critical to safety that FAA have the ability to ground unsafe airmen or other certificate holders; however, I also believe that the FAA must be judicious in its use of this extraordinary power. A review of recent emergency cases clearly demonstrates a pattern by which the FAA uses their emergency powers as standard procedure rather than an extraordinary measure. Perhaps the most visible case has been Bob Hoover. 
   Bob is a highly regarded and accomplished aerobatic pilot. In 1992, his medical certificate was revoked based on alleged questions regarding his cognitive abilities. After getting a clean bill of health from four separate sets of doctors (just one of the many tests cost Bob $1,700) and over the continuing objections of the federal air surgeon (who never examined Bob personally) his medical certificate was reinstated only after then Administrator David Henson intervened. Unfortunately, Bob is not out of the woods yet. His medical certificate expires each year. Unlike most airmen who can renew their medical certificate with a routine application and exam, Bob has to furnish 
   the FAA with a report of a neurological evaluation every twelve months. 
   Bob Hoover's experience is just one of many. I have visited with other pilots who have had their licenses revoked on an emergency basis. Pilots such as Ted Stewart who has been an American Airlines pilot for more than 12 years and is presently a Boeing 767 Captain. Until January 1995, Ted had no complaints registered against him or his flying. In January 1995 the FAA suspended his examining authority as part of a larger FAA effort to respond to a problem of falsified ratings. The full National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) exonerated Ted in July 1995. In June 1996, he received a second revocation. One of the charges in this second revocation involved falsification of records for a Flight Instructor Certificate with Multiengined rating and his Air Transport Pilot (ATP) certificate dating back to 1979. Remember, an emergency revocation means you lose your certificate immediately, so in most cases this means the certificate holder loses his source of income. Fortunately in Ted's case, his employer put him on a desk job while the issue was adjudicated. 
   Like most, I have questioned how an alleged 17 1/2 year old violation in the Stewart case could constitute an emergency; especially, since Ted had not been cited for any cause in the intervening years. Nonetheless, the FAA vigorously pursued this action. On August 30, 1996, the NTSB issued its decision in this second revocation and found for Ted. A couple of comments in the Stewart decision bear closer examination. First, the board notes that ``The administrator's loss in the earlier case appears to have prompted further investigation of respondent .....'' I find this rather troubling that an impartial third party appears to be suggesting that the FAA has a vendetta against Ted Stewart. This is further emphasized with a footnote in which the Board notes:  
   [We,] of course, [are] not authorized to review the Administrator's exercise of his power to take emergency certificate action ......We are constrained to register in this matter, however, our opinion that where, as here, no legitimate reason is cited or appears for not consolidating all alleged violations into one proceeding, subjecting an airman in the space of a year to two emergency revocations, and thus to the financial and other burdens associated with an additional 60-day grounding without prior notice and hearing, constitutes an abusive and unprincipled discharge of an extraordinary power.  
   Another example is Raymond A. Williamson who was a pilot for Coca-Cola Bottling Company. Like Ted Stewart, he was accused of being part of a ``ring'' of pilots who falsified type records for ``vintage'' aircraft. 
   As in all of the cases I have reviewed, Mr. Williamson biggest concern is that the FAA investigation and subsequent revocation came out of the blue. In November 1994, he was notified by his employer (Coca-Cola) that FAA inspectors had accused him of giving ``illegal'' check rides in company owned aircraft. He was fired. In June 1995, he received an Emergency Order of Revocation. In over 30 years as an active pilot, he had never had an accident, incident, or violation. Nor had he ever been ``counseled'' by the FAA for any action or irregularities as a pilot, flight instructor, FAA designated pilot examiner. 
   In May 1996, FAA proposed to return all his certificates and ratings, except his flight instructor certificate. As in the Ted Stewart case, it would appear that FAA found no real reason to pursue an ``emergency'' revocation. 
   I obviously cannot read the collective minds of the NTSB, but I believe a reasonable person would conclude that in the Ted Stewart case the Board, believes as I do, that there is an abuse of emergency revocation powers by the FAA. 
   This is borne out further by the fact that since 1989, emergency cases as a total of all enforcement actions heard by the NTSB has more than doubled. In 1989 the NTSB heard 1,107 enforcement cases. Of those, 66 were emergency revocation cases or 5.96 percent. In 1995, the NTSB heard 509 total enforcement cases, of those 160 were emergency revocation cases or 31.43 percent. I believe it is clear that the FAA has begun to use an exceptional power as a standard practice. 
   At my request, the General Accounting Office (GAO) did a study of emergency revocation actions taken by the FAA between 1990 and 1997. The most troubling result of the GAO study is that during time frame studied, 50 percent of the emergency renovations were issued four months to two years after the violation occurred. In only 4% of the cases was the emergency revocation issued within ten days or less of the actual violation. In fact, the median time lapse between the violation and the emergency order was a little over four months (132 days). 
   Clearly, at issue is ``what constitutes an emergency?'' After working with industry representatives, I believe we have come up with a balanced and prudent approach to answer that question. Today I, along with Senators MURKOWSKI, BURNS, GRASSLEY, BREAUX, STEVENS, CRAPO and FRIST am introducing a bill which will provide a certificate holder the option of requesting a hearing before the NTSB within 48 hours of receiving an emergency revocation to determine whether or not a true emergency exists. The board will have to decide within five days of the request if an emergency exists. During the board's deliberation, the certificate will be suspended. Should the board decide an emergency does not exist, the certificate holder will be able to use his certificate while the issue is adjudicated. Should the board decide an emergency does exist, the certificate will continue to be suspended while the issue is adjudicated. 
   Not surprisingly, Mr. President the FAA opposes this language. They also opposed changes to the civil penalties program where they served as the judge and jury in civil penalty actions against airmen. Fortunately, we were able to change that so that airmen can now appeal a civil penalty case to the NTSB. This has worked very well because the NTSB has a clear understanding of the issues. 
   This bill is supported by the Air Line Pilots Association, International; the Air Transport Association; the Allied Pilots Association, Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association; the Experimental Aircraft Association; National Air Carrier Association; National Air Transportation Association; National Business Aircraft Association; the NTSB Bar Association; and the Regional Airline Association. 
   In closing, this bill will provide due process to certificate holders where  now none exists, without compromising aviation safety. This is a reasonable and prudent response to an increasing problem for certificate holders. I hope our colleagues will support our efforts in this regard.

    Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to introduce Y2K Regulatory Amnesty Act of 1999. I believe this is a timely piece of legislation considering the current debate over the Year 2000 issue. Senators BENNETT, DODD, HATCH, FEINSTEIN, and MCCAIN have been working diligently on Year 2000 issues for quite some time. I applaud them for their efforts in dealing with such a unique and complex issue. 
   However, as I have watched their progress and listened to their reports, I have noticed one significant omission in their discussions. Virtually nothing has been said about the potential regulatory nightmare that regulated entities could face as a result of a Y2K disruption. While the debate has been centered on getting government and businesses ready for the date change, very little has been said about how the government will actually deal with the private sector's problems associated with the year 2000. The last thing we need is for Regulatory Agencies to view a Y2K problem as an opportunity for a fine. 
   As a result, I began to ask several regulated communities about their concerns over regulatory penalties as a result of a Y2K disruption. Surprisingly, many had not yet begun to think about the potential for regulatory problems. Instead, they have been focusing on becoming Y2K complaint, which is what they should be doing. However, one question remains; how will the federal government react to regulatory noncompliance due to a Y2K systems disruption? 
   In response to that unanswered question, I am introducing the Y2K Regulatory Amnesty Act. My legislation will create a ``Y2K upset'', which is defined as an exception in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance beyond the reasonable control of the party. It will provide regulated communities with an affirmative defense from punitive actions from the federal government should they encounter a Y2K systems disruption. 
   My legislation does not create a ``free pass'' for entities to violate federal regulations. A ``Y2K upset'' is strictly defined and can only be invoked if the entity has made all possible efforts to become Y2K complaint and meets other stringent requirements. Additionally, if the noncompliance would result in an immediate or imminent threat to public health, the defense is not applicable. For those individuals who do attempt to use this defense frivolously or fraudulently, there will be severe criminal penalties. 
   Let me give you an example of how this provision will work. Assume that a small, local flower shop is run by a simple 3-computer network. The flower shop uses its computer network to manage payroll, accounts payable/receivable, and to track orders 
   from customers. In an effort to become Y2K complaint, the flower shop hires an outside consultant to examine his network for signs of the Y2K bug and solve any problems that exist. This process costs the flower shop just over $1,000 but is well worth the investment considering the shop wants to be in business in January 2000. 
   On January 1, 2000, flower shop finds that its payroll software is failing to operate. The shop owner contacts the software manufacturer, the computer manufacturer, and his consultant in order to find a solution. From the outset, the shop owner knows this delay means that he will be unable to calculate how much he owes the IRS in payroll taxes--not to mention, they will be late. For that small business owner that means a hefty penalty on top of the hassle and lost business the failure caused in the first place. 
   Under my legislation, this small business owner would not be facing IRS penalties. The flower shop will still have to pay the taxes, but they won't be hit with a fine for a computer problem outside of their control. 
   This is just one example of how this legislation would assist businesses as they attempt to become compliant. However, this legislation would also help many others. I have heard from several schools in my state that fear that if they lose federally required reporting information, they may face losses in federal funding. I have also heard from small, rural telephone cooperatives who fear that even a short-term Y2K-related systems disruption could result in significant FCC fines and penalties. The list is exhaustive. Virtually, anyone regulated by the federal government faces the unanswered question as to how the federal government will handle a Y2K systems disruption. 
   There is also an added benefit to this legislation. Because this defense would only apply to those who have made good faith efforts to become compliant, it will serve as an added incentive for everyone to fix their Y2K problems upfront. 
   Some people will say this legislation is unnecessary. However, I believe it is prudent to define how the federal government will approach Y2K systems disruptions in a regulatory context. But, more importantly, I believe we need to establish the rules of the game in advance so that everyone is operating from the same page. 
   In closing, I would urge each of my colleagues to become a cosponsor of the Y2K Regulatory Amnesty Act and join with me in working to remediate the potential regulatory problems associated with the coming date change.

    Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill with my colleagues from Alabama, Senator Sessions, that will help our domestic oil and gas industry by reducing one of the many regulatory burdens that they must comply with. 
   Last year, I was informed of a case in Alabama in which the EPA was sued over their policy regarding underground injection and specifically, ``hydraulic fracturing''. This procedure is used in cases where product, such as gas is located in a tight geological formation such as a coalbed. A hole is drilled into that area and a fluid consisting of water, gel and sand is pumped down the wellbore into the formation creating a fracture zone. The gel and water are extracted during the initial production stage of the well while the sand is left to prop open the cracks in the formation. 
   When Congress originally passed the safe drinking water act (SDWA) in 1974, they intentionally left the underground protection control (UIC) program to the states. That act stated: ``the Administrator ..... may not prescribe requirements which interfere with or impede (injection activities associated with oil and gas production) unless such requirements are essential to assure that underground sources of drinking water will not be endangered by such injection.'' That concept was re-affirmed in 1980 when a provision was enacted specifically to recognize the adequacy of state programs, none of which required permitting for hydraulic fracturing in the construction or maintenance of oil and gas production wells. 
   So, when the lawsuit was filed in Alabama, and the court ruled in favor of the environmental organization that filed the suit, I was shocked. It seemed clear to me that the intent of the law was to leave the regulation of this procedure to the states. I have neither heard nor seen anything that would lead me to the conclusion that there is any contamination of drinking water because of hydraulic fracturing. In fact, I believe the EPA agrees with me. Let me read a letter from Carol Browner, the Administrator of the EPA, to Mr. David A. Ludder, General Council for the Legal Environmental Assistance Foundation, Inc (LEAF), the group that sued EPA over this procedure.  
   There is no evidence that the hydraulic fracturing at issue has resulted in any contamination or endangerment of underground sources of drinking water. Repeated testing, conducted between May of 1989 and March of 1993, of the drinking water well which was the subject of this petition failed to show any chemicals that would indicate the presence of fracturing fluids.  
   That statement seems pretty straight forward and implies to me that EPA would be willing to work with us to solve this problem. Unfortunately, that is not the case. Senator Sessions and I, with assistance from Senator Chafee, have received nothing but stalling tactics. In late January, we drafted this language and sent it over to EPA hoping that we could resolve this issue quickly to provide relief to our producers. Unfortunately, they were not willing to work with us. 
   So here we are introducing a bill that is simple and solves the problem. This bill is short and to the point. In less than two pages we clarify that hydraulic fracturing is not underground injection and re-affirm that the administrator has the ability to determine what is regulated as underground injection, which is simply a clarification of an ability the administrator already possesses. 
   It is my hope that EPA will work with us as this bill moves through committee and come up with a solution that will allow our oil and gas guys to get back to work and get EPA to focus on issues which may pose a more immediate threat.

   Mr. INHOFE. I thank my colleague from Oklahoma. He and I have worked together on this issue over the past several years. We proposed that the Appropriations Committee address the issue of an operational test and evaluation in its bill and they did so after the Army failed to comply with report language that was included in the FY 1998 Defense Appropriations Conference Report. To me, it is clear that the Congress directed the Army, in bill language in Title IV of the FY 1999 Defense Appropriations Act, to begin the development of a test and evaluation plan during this fiscal year using the $15 million provided in Title IV as well as to commence work integrating the two candidate missiles on an AH-64D helicopter; and that the money could be used for no other purpose. Does the distinguished Chairman agree with me?

   Mr. INHOFE. I am very familiar with this issue and have discussed it at length with the Army. We expect that the Secretary of the Army will provide the requisite certifications at the appropriate time, which is just prior to the actual conduct of the live-fire tests. I know that in the case of Starstreak, the missile contractor must make certain modifications at its own expense in order to make the missile compatible for use at air speeds consistent with the normal operating limits of the Apache helicopter and consistent with the survivability of the aircraft. The missile contractor has briefed these fixes to the Army and informed the Army in writing that the fixes will be made at no expense to the United States. By the time the Army is ready to conduct actual live firings the Secretary will be able to make all the certifications required by law.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it seems we are about to go to war with Yugoslavia. Our stated purpose is to stop the humanitarian disaster there caused by a civil war. If we do not act, we are told, innocent people will be killed, will be wounded, will be displaced from their homes. Indeed, over 2,000 have already been killed in the Kosovo civil war in just the last year. Many more have been uprooted. There are serious problems there. No one disputes that. 
   My question is, Where is the vital U.S. national interest? 
   The National Defense Council Foundation recently reported that there are at least 60 conflicts going on in the world involving humanitarian suffering of one kind or another. There are 30 wars being waged--civil wars, guerrilla wars, major terrorist campaigns. Many are driven by ethnic quarrels and religious disputes which have raged for decades, if not for centuries. 
   Just consider a partial list from recent years: 800,000 to 1 million people have been brutally murdered in Rwanda alone; tens of thousands killed in civil wars in Sudan, Algeria and Angola; thousands killed in civil war in Ethiopia; in January, 140 civilians killed by paramilitary squads in Colombia; including 27 worshipers slain during a village church service. 
   Why is there no outcry for these millions of people who are being brutally murdered in other places in the world, but we are all concerned about the humanitarian problems in Kosovo? 
   I have to say this, and I know it is very unpopular to say it, but I am going to quote a guy whose name is Roger Wilkins. He is a professor of history and American culture at George Mason University:  
   I think it is pretty clear. U.S. foreign policy is geared to the European-American sensibility which takes the lives of white people much more seriously than the lives of people who aren't white.  
   Let me read a couple paragraphs from an article in the Minneapolis-St. Paul Star Tribune on January 31, 1999:  
   But no one mobilized on behalf of perhaps 500 people who were shot, hacked and burned to death in a village in eastern Congo, in central Africa, around the same time. No outrage was expressed on behalf of many other innocents who had the misfortune to be slain just off the world's stage over the past few weeks. 
   Why do 45 white Europeans rate an all-out response while several hundred black Africans are barely worth notice?  
   And this is all in that same timeframe. 
   Further quoting the Minneapolis-St. Paul Star Tribune:  
   While U.S. officials struggled to provide an answer, analysts said the uneven U.S. responses to a spurt of violence in the past month illuminates not just an immoral or perhaps racist foreign policy, but one that fails on pragmatic and strategic grounds as well.  
   So now the President wants us to send the U.S. military into Kosovo, not to enforce a peace agreement--we do not have a peace agreement, as we were told 2 weeks ago--but to inject ourselves into the middle of an ongoing civil war, with no clearly defined military objective, no assurance of success, no exit strategy and great, great risk to our pilots and men and women in uniform. 
   We know that the Yugoslav leader, Mr. Milosevic, is a bad guy. No one disputes that. But are we absolutely sure that there are some good guys, too? Are there any good guys in the fight that stretches back over 500 years? 
   When I was in Kosovo recently, I was horrified as I was going through the main road--Kosovo is only 75 miles wide and 75 miles long, and there is one road going all the way through it. I was only able to see two dead people at the time. They turned them over and both of them were Serbs. They had been executed at pointblank range. And they were Serbs, not Kosovars, not Albanians. So the national interest here is not at all clear. 
   Let me quote Dr. Henry Kissinger, the former Secretary of State and National Security Adviser. In an op-ed piece in the Washington Post on February 24, Kissinger said he was opposed to U.S. military involvement in Kosovo. He is not unaware of the humanitarian concerns that the President and others talk about. Here are just a few of the highlights of what he said:  
   The proposed deployment in Kosovo does not deal with any threat to American security as traditionally conceived. 
   Kosovo is no more a threat to America than Haiti was to Europe. 
   If Kosovo, why not East Africa or Central Asia? 
   We must take care not to stretch ourselves too thin in the face of far less ambiguous threats in the Middle East and Northeast Asia. 
   Each incremental deployment into the Balkans is bound to weaken our ability to deal with Saddam Hussein and North Korea.  
   I think this is very, very significant, the last two points. 
   First of all, I have asked the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs 
   of Staff, I have asked the Chiefs, I have asked the CINCs, the commanders in chief, this question: If we have to send troops into Kosovo--keep in mind that people may lie to you and say this is going to be an airstrike. Anybody who knows anything about military strategy and warfare knows you can't do it all from the air. You have to ultimately send in ground troops. So we are talking about sending in ground troops. That is in a theater where the logistics support for ground troops is handled out of the 21st TACOM in Germany. I was over in the 21st TACOM. Right now, they are at 110 percent capacity just supporting Bosnia. They don't have any more capacity. The commander in chief there said, if we send ground troops into Iraq or Kosovo, we are going to be 100 percent dependent upon Guard and Reserve to support those troops. And look what has happened to the Guard and Reserve now because of the decimation of our military through its budget, finding ourselves only half the size we were in 1991. 
   Right now, we don't have the capacity. We have to depend on Guard and Reserves, and in doing this we don't have the critical MOSs. You can't expect doctors in the Guard to be deployed for 270 days and maintain their practice, so we now have ourselves faced with a problem, a serious problem, and that is we cannot carry out the national military strategy, which is to be able to defend America on two regional fronts. We don't have the capacity to do it. If we could do it on nearly simultaneous fronts within 45 days between each conflict, then we go up from low-medium risk to a medium-high risk, which is translated in lives of Americans. 
   Going into Kosovo for an unlimited duration at who knows what cost, who knows the amount of risk, the risk will be higher. 
   I chair the readiness subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Mr. President, and I can tell you right now that we are in the same situation we were in in the late 1970s with the hollow force. We can't afford to dilute our military strength anymore. And that is not even mentioning the immediate risk to our forces that they will face in Yugoslavia where the Serbs have sophisticated Russian-made air defense and thousands of well-trained and equipped troops motivated to fight and die for their country. 
   In recent testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, some of our top military leaders were very frank about what they expected for any U.S. military operation in Kosovo. 
   Air Force Chief of Staff General Ryan said, ``There stands a very good chance that we will lose aircraft against Yugoslavian air defense.'' 
   Navy Chief of Staff, Admiral Johnson, said, ``We must be prepared to take losses.'' 
   Marine Commandant, General Krulak, said it will be ``tremendously dangerous.'' 
   And then George Tenet, the Director of Central Intelligence, said this is not Bosnia we are talking about, this is Kosovo where they are not tired, they are not worn out, and they are ready to fight and kill Americans. 
   So we are faced with that serious problem, Mr. President. We should not under any circumstances go into Kosovo. Our vital security interests are not at stake, where we don't have a clear military objective or an exit  strategy, or where our policy doesn't fit into any coherent broader foreign policy vision. 
   So let me go back to my opening statement. Since we have no national security risks at stake, there must be another reason for our involvement. It is not humanitarian because of the following: 
   800,000 to 1 million killed in ethnic strife in Rwanda; 
   tens of thousands killed in civil wars in Sudan, Algeria, and Angola; 
   thousands killed in civil war in Ethiopia; 
   in January, 140 civilians killed by paramilitary squads in Colombia, including 27 worshipers slain during a village church service. 
   Why is there no outcry for U.S. involvement in these obvious humanitarian situations? 
   ``I think it's pretty clear,'' said Roger Wilkins, professor of history and American culture at George Mason University. ``U.S. foreign policy is geared to the European-American sensibility which takes the lives of white people much more seriously than the lives of people who aren't white.'' 
   Anyone who supports our sending American troops into Kosovo must be aware this will come back and haunt them. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to introduce the Medical Savings Account Expansion Act of 1999. There has been much said recently regarding the need to reform health care. I agree with many of my colleagues that health care is indeed in need of serious reform. However, the nature and the scope of reforms are open to debate. 
   During the health care debate of 1996, the Congress focused its efforts on attempting to provide the uninsured with insurance. Included in the legislation, Congress created a demonstration project in order to test the effectiveness of Medical Savings Accounts. However, in establishing the demonstration project, the Congress created numerous legislative roadblocks to the success of Medical Savings Accounts. 
   As we are all aware, Medical Savings Accounts combine a high deductible insurance policy and tax exempt accounts for the purpose of providing health care. MSA holders use these accounts to purchase routine health care services. When account holders spend all of the funds in their account and reach their annual deductible, their health insurance policy kicks in. If they don't spend all the money in the account, they get to keep what's left, plus interest for the following year. 
   The creation of Medical Savings Accounts was the result of a bipartisan coalition that many in the Senate worked long and hard to achieve. Medical Savings Accounts are really based on a simple principle that should be at the heart of the health care reform, that being, empowering people to take control of their own health care improves the system for everyone. Expanding MSAs is one small, but important, step in that regard. Providing individuals with an incentive to save money on their health care costs encourages them to be better consumers. The result is much needed cost control and consumer responsibility. 
   Mr. President, I think as the Congress begins to discuss health care reform this year, we must move away from the debate on the regulation and rationing of health care and focus our energies on providing health care to the uninsured. Instead of concentrating our efforts on reforms that will likely result in less health care, we should be trying to expand the opportunity for health care. At the same time, we must do so in a cost effective and market oriented way. MSAs meet that goal. 
   According to the General Accounting Office, more than 37% of the people who have opted to buy an MSA under the 1996 law were previously uninsured. That bears repeating; people who have previously been uninsured, are now buying health insurance. We need to make it possible for more people to obtain health care insurance. Now, compare those 37% of previously uninsured who now have health insurance with the projected 400,000 people who would lose their current health insurance if the Congress does something that would raise current health insurance premiums by just one percentage point and the argument becomes even stronger to expand the use of MSAs. 
   Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing today does just that, it makes Medical Savings Accounts more readily available to more people by eliminating many of the legislative and regulatory roadblocks to their continued success. The GAO report referred to earlier, points out that one of the key reasons why MSAs have not been as 
   successful as originally thought is the complexity of the law. 
   Let me touch on a just few of the problems my legislation addresses. First is the scope of the demonstration project. Mr. President, I believe we should drop the 750,000 cap and extend the life of the project indefinitely. The 750,000 cap is merely an arbitrary number negotiated by the Congress. By lifting the cap and making MSAs permanent, we will be allowing the market to decide whether MSAs are a viable alternative in health insurance. The cap  and the limited time constraint create a disincentive for insurance companies to provide MSAs as an option. The GAO study I cited earlier supports this conclusion. The majority of companies who offered MSA plans did so in order to preserve a share of the market. The result, few, if any, are aggressively marketing MSAs. If Congress is serious about testing the effectiveness of MSAs in the marketplace, we must free them from unnecessary and arbitrarily imposed restraints. 
   Second, under current law, either an employer or an employee can contribute directly to an MSA, but not both. The legislation I am introducing would allow both employers and employees to contribute to a Medical Savings Account. This just makes sense. By limiting who can contribute to an individual MSA, the government has predetermined the limits of contributions. I think many employers would prefer to contribute to an individual's health care account, rather than continue the costly, third-party payer system. By allowing both employers and employees to contribute to MSAs, we will be giving more flexibility to Medical Savings Accounts. That flexibility will allow more people to obtain MSAs and undoubtedly contribute to their success. 
   One of the arguments frequently made against MSAs is that they are for the rich. Certainly that is an understandable conclusion, given the fact that we limit who can contribute to MSAs. By lifting the contribution restrictions, individuals of all income levels will find MSAs a viable health care alternative. 
   As I travel throughout Oklahoma, a common complaint is the access to quality health care and the rising cost of health care. In my state, managed care is not always an option for many people in rural areas. However, Medical Savings Accounts are an option for many families because MSAs give them the choice to pursue individualized health care that fits their needs. These are the sorts of solutions that our constituents have sent us to Washington to find. They are not interested in more government. In fact, many want less. Yet, all we offer them is differing degrees of government intrusion in their lives. 
   Mr. President, the debate in the 105th Congress clearly demonstrated we are all concerned about access to health care, doctor choice, cost, and security. As the debate moves forward in the 106th Congress, I want to urge my colleagues to consider alternatives to further big-government and to be bold enough to pursue them.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I want you to listen. I am going to tell you a story of espionage, conspiracy, deception, and coverup, a story with life and death implications for millions of Americans, a story about national security, and a President and an administration that deliberately chose to put national security at risk, while telling everyone that everything was fine. 
   If it was written in a book, Mr. President, it wouldn't sell, because no one would believe it. If it was fictionalized in a novel, few could conceive it. But it is true. 
   For the sake of my statement today, I am stating that the President withheld information and covered up the Chinese theft of our technology. But I am realistic enough to know that a person with the history of deception this President has will have provided himself with some cover in case he got caught. So I am sure there is a paper trail that he can allege. The way the President probably covered himself was to include tidbits about this theft buried in briefings of 40 or 50 other items so the significance of it would not be noticed. But a paper trail would be established. 
   Anticipating that, I, over the weekend, talked to the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Congressman PORTER GOSS, and the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee at the time of the discovery of this secret, this information, Senator ARLEN SPECTER. Neither chairman was notified of the W-88 nuclear warhead technology theft. And these would have been the first to be notified, Mr. President. 
   There can be no doubt that President Clinton engaged in a coverup scheme. 
   Let me read three paragraphs from last week's op-ed article by Michael Kelly in the Washington Post, entitled ``Lies About China.'' I am quoting now, Mr. President:  
   In April 1996, Energy Department officials informed Samuel Berger, then Clinton's deputy national security advisor, that Notra Trulock, the department's chief of intelligence, had uncovered evidence that showed China had learned how to miniaturize nuclear bombs, allowing for smaller, more lethal warheads.......  
   Further quoting:  
   The Times reports that the House Intelligence Committee asked Trulock for a briefing in July 1998. Trulock asked for permission from Elizabeth Moler, then acting energy secretary. According to Trulock, Moler  told him not to brief the committee because the information might be used against Clinton's China policy.....  
   Further quoting:  
   The White House's secret would have remained secret had it not been for a select investigative committee headed by Republican [Representative] Christopher Cox.....  
   But even using the President's fictitious paper trail, the earliest either chairman could have known about it would have been late in the spring of 1997, years after the Clinton administration learned of it and, of course, after the 1996 election. 
   I start, Mr. President, by listing a few things which we now know to be true, factual, incontrovertible, and nonclassified. 
   For years, the Clinton administration covered up China's interest of top secret U.S. nuclear weapons data. They never informed the Congress or the American people about what had happened or its significance to our national security. 
   Let me tell you what President Clinton did during this period of time. 
   During this period of time, the President misled the American people on numerous occasions about the threat posed by strategic nuclear missiles in the post-cold-war era. 
   During this period of time, President Clinton made statements on over 130 separate occasions, such as the following:--and I am quoting--  
   For the first time since the dawn of the nuclear age, there is not a single solitary nuclear missile pointed at an American child tonight. Not one. Not a single one.  
   During this period of time, he knew that China was targeting up to 18 intercontinental ballistic missiles at American children. 
   During this period of time, President Clinton signed export control waivers which allowed his top campaign fundraisers' aerospace company to transfer sensitive U.S. missile guidance technology to China. 
   During this period of time, he shifted the prime satellite export responsibility from the State Department, where it had always been to maintain security, to the Commerce Department so that it would be easier to share sensitive information with the Chinese and others. 
   During this period of time, President Clinton hosted over 100 White House fundraisers as a part of a larger aggressive scheme to raise campaign contributions, many from illegal foreign sources primarily, including sources in China. Among guests permitted to attend these White House fundraisers were a convicted felon and a Chinese arms dealer. 
   During this period of time, John Huang, Charlie Trie, Johnny Chung, James Riady, and others with strong ties to China, were deeply involved, with the President's knowledge, in raising Chinese-tainted campaign cash for the Clinton campaign. 
   During this period of time, John Huang, who had been given a security clearance without a background check, was permitted to receive numerous classified CIA briefings, both during and after his stay at the Commerce Department. 
   And during this period of time, President Clinton was successfully stopping the deployment of a national missile defense system--exposing every American life to a missile attack, leaving us with no defense whatsoever against an intercontinental ballistic missile. 
   Mr. President, China's theft of secret data on the so-called W-88 nuclear warhead may be one of the most serious breaches of national security in the history of our Nation, more serious than Aldrich Ames; perhaps more serious than the Rosenbergs. 
   The public needs to understand that this story is true. This is not about partisanship. It is not about some ancient history of some long gone cold war. 
   This is about the real world here and now. It is about national security in its most important aspects. It is about protecting our freedom and our existence as a Nation. 
   This is ultimately a matter which concerns the life and death of every American citizen. 
   The W-88 is the most advanced nuclear warhead in the U.S. arsenal and is carried on top of a Trident submarine-launched ballistic missile. This is the cornerstone weapon of our Nation's nuclear deterrent. As many as 8 can fit on top of a submarine-launched missile; as many as 10 can fit on top of a land-based missile--either ours or China's. We are talking about a miniaturized warhead much smaller in size than the Hiroshima atomic bomb but 10 times more powerful. 
   This chart appeared in the New York Times on March 6 of this year. The first atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima weighed almost 9,000 pounds, yielded 15 kilotons and was dropped from a plane. By contrast, the modern W-88 is more powerful than this. It is 2.6 feet in length and weighs about 300 pounds and yields up to 150 kilotons. Several fit into the head of one missile. The technology on which it is built is super top secret and represents billions of dollars and years, if not decades, of investment on the part of dedicated scientists and engineers working in the supreme American national interest. 
   Some ask, why does America have such a weapon? Because it is part of our responsibility as a world superpower to have the most advanced, efficient, and credible nuclear deterrent, not only to protect our own freedom but the freedom of our allies. It is part of our policy of peace through strength. 
   I think about my friend from Texas, the Senator who is always talking about how we want to see the day when the lion and the lamb lie down together. But when that happens, we want to make sure we are the lion and not the lamb. We don't intend to use any of these nuclear weapons. It is a fact of life, in the most dangerous world we live in, we have to be prepared to deter any potential adversary. 
   The W-88 allows for multiple warheads to be placed on one missile. With this technology, China will now be able to put up to 10 warheads on a single long-range missile. Each warhead is targeted at a different city, each city subject to an explosion 10 times as great as that which destroyed Hiroshima at the end of World War II. 
   Mr. President, I am from Oklahoma. I can remember in 1995 when the bomb went off. It was a truck bomb. A 4,800-pound truck bomb destroyed the Murrah Office Building, maiming and killing 168 Oklahomans. I remember standing out there and watching the police and the firemen enter the building where there was no security and pulling out parts of bodies and bodies. It was the most devastating thing I have ever experienced. It was the worst act of terrorism ever recorded on American soil. That bomb had a force of 1,000 pounds of TNT, half of 1 ton. By contrast, the Hiroshima bomb had an explosive force of 15 tons, or 30,000 times as large as the Oklahoma City bomb. The W-88, while smaller in physical size, had a force of 150 kilotons, or 300,000 times the explosion power of the Oklahoma City bomb. By carrying 10 of these, it would be 3 million times the force of the Oklahoma City bomb. 
   The more compact W-88 warhead makes possible what is called MIRV technology, or multiple independent reentry vehicle, which allows the missile to reenter and then go to various targets. This is technology that we thought China was many, many years away from developing on its own, and they stole this technology, and President Clinton covered it up. 
   We also used to think North Korea was many years away from building a long-range multiple stage rocket. I got a phone call and a letter from Henry Shelton, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on August 24. In this letter he said he was confident we would have 3 years warning of any new long-range missile threat--that is, any new country that we already didn't know about. Seven days later, on August 31, a multiple-stage rocket was launched in North Korea. Part of it reached the coast of Alaska. 
   Because of the disparity over what our nuclear threat is, in the wisdom of the House and the Senate, the Democrats and the Republicans commissioned the Rumsfeld Committee. We were charged with the responsibility of finding the nine most informed scientists and authorities on missile technology, who formed a committee for assessing the threat that we have in this country. This was a bipartisan committee, appointed jointly by Democrats and Republicans. Of the nine, five were Republican appointments and four were Democrat appointments. They concluded unanimously that when it comes to advanced missiles and weapons, with countries willing to buy, sell, and steal technology, ``We live in  an environment of little or no warning.'' That means we must immediately be prepared. 
   Last year, you may remember it was revealed that the Clinton administration had changed the approval process for high-technology satellite transfers, how waivers were granted for American companies so they could launch satellites in China. This ultimately resulted in China acquiring advanced United States missile guidance technology, making their missiles more accurate and more reliable. President Clinton personally signed the waiver allowing China to acquire this missile technology. 
   Let me repeat, President Clinton personally signed the waiver allowing China to achieve this missile technology. 
   Executives of these two corporations which benefited, Loral and Hughes, were among the largest financial creditors to President Clinton's campaign ever but this is not important. The motive for aiding and abetting our adversaries could be money, or it could be some kind of perverted allegiance to some of these countries, or it could be just a callous disregard for the lives of American citizens. The motive is not important. The fact is, President Clinton did it and he knew exactly what he was doing. 
   Accompanying the transferred missile guidance technology with the stolen nuclear weapon technology, China can threaten United States cities with accurate, reliable, and horribly destructive multiple-warhead nuclear missiles. This is not science fiction. Two years ago, a high-ranking Chinese official made a statement. Two years ago, when the Chinese were trying to intimidate the elections of the Taiwanese and they were launching missiles at the Taiwan Straits, it was suggested to this high-ranking military official in China that it could be that America would come to Taiwan's defense and would intervene. His response was, ``No, they are not going to do that because America would rather defend Los Angeles than defend Taipei.'' At the very least, that is an indirect threat to use missiles on the United States of America. 
   By helping China develop their long-range missiles, President Clinton also helped North Korea and other rogue nations with theirs--nations like Iran. Let me read three paragraphs from last week's Washington Times article entitled ``China Assists North Korea Space Launches.''  
   China is sharing space technology with North Korea, a move that could boost P'yongyang's long-range missile program, White House and Pentagon officials told the Washington Times. ..... 
   Another Pentagon report on the 1996 Chinese booster that failed to launch a U.S. satellite concluded that ``U.S. national security was harmed'' by the improper sharing of technology with China by Hughes and other satellite maker Loral Space & Communications Ltd. .....  
   Keep in mind, it was President Clinton who signed the waiver to give the Chinese this technology.  
   In 1994, the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency reported that it believed China had helped design the Taepo Dong 2 missile (this is the North Korea missile) because its first stage diameter is very close in size to the Chinese CSS-2 immediate range missile.  
   It is factual to say that President Clinton knew he was giving our missile technology to North Korea as well as China. 
   I take this moment to remind my colleagues once again that America today has no defense whatever against such a threat. The Clinton administration today, despite its rhetoric, opposes the deployment of any national missile defense system. Someone who is pretty smart, back in 1983 when they determined that we would have to have a defense against an incoming missile by fiscal year 1998--that is, last year--so during the Reagan administration, then the Bush Administration, they embarked on this thing called SDI, Strategic Defense Initiative, to make sure that by 1998 we would have something to defend ourselves in the event an ICBM came over from China, from Russia, from Iran, from North Korea, from anywhere. So we were on schedule to have this deployed by fiscal year 1998. 
   Well, in 1993, that came to a screeching halt when President Clinton vetoed the defense authorization bill and vetoed all further efforts, including the bills that were introduced to put us on line with the national missile defense system. As an excuse for this, he said he had to protect the integrity of the 1972 ABM Treaty. Let me remind you that treaty was not a Democrat-inspired treaty. That was Republican-inspired; it was President Nixon and Henry Kissinger. The idea was that we had two superpowers, the U.S.S.R. and the United States of America. So we made a deal with them. Under the ABM Treaty, we said we won't defend ourselves, and you don't defend yourselves, and that way, if they launch a missile that goes to us, we launch one that goes back to them and everybody dies. I didn't like that theory back then, but it made sense when there were two superpowers. That is not true today. 
   Today, virtually every country has a weapon of mass destruction. We have missiles that we are finding that now even North Korea has. China is exchanging technology and systems with Iran and other countries like that. So there is a proliferation of missiles as well as weapons of mass destruction. I have to say that the mutual assured destruction concept which was adopted at that time has no relevance today. Even Henry Kissinger, who was the architect of the ABM Treaty of 1972 said, ``It's nuts to make a virtue out of our vulnerability.'' He said we should not be looking at that. Besides, somebody should remind the President that was a treaty that was made in 1972, and it was made between the United States and the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union no longer exists. So I have to say that President Clinton is solely responsible for the fact that we are totally defenseless against an incoming ICBM from China or any other place in the world. 
   Now, Mr. President, from news reports, this is some of what we know about China's theft of our nuclear secrets. Apparently, a spy at the Los Alamos weapons lab succeeded in transferring data on this highly classified W-88 warhead technology to China in the mid-1980s. That was not during the current administration; nobody refutes that. But our Government did not find out about it until April of 1995. That is 3 years into the Clinton administration. 
   This is a critical date, Mr. President. We did not know about the theft until April of 1995. Detection came when experts analyzed data from then-recent Chinese underground nuclear tests and saw remarkable similarities to the W-88 U.S. warhead to what they were experimenting with. Later in 1995, secret Chinese Government documents confirmed that there had been a security breach at Los Alamos. That was in 1995. 
   Deputy National Security Advisor Sandy Berger was first briefed about it. President Clinton did not respond then because he was obviously a little preoccupied with what he considered to be more important matters at that time. After all, there were White House fundraisers to host, foreign campaign contributions, satellite transfers to approve, high technology trade with China to promote and, of course, an election to be won--at all costs. Mr. Berger was well aware of all this. We know that he sat in on strategy sessions for the campaign for 1996. 
   So this was also the time when President Clinton was running around the country telling audiences that ``for the first time since the dawn of the nuclear age, there is not a single, solitary nuclear missile pointed at an American child tonight. Not one. Not a single one.'' Of course everybody cheered, wanting to believe he was telling the truth. 
   Of all the lies this President has told, this is the most egregious of all. 
   He repeated this misleading, deceptive lie over 130 times between 1995 and 1997, right at the very time he and his national security advisors knew that this horrible breach of nuclear security had occurred and was under investigation. It was also at that very time that he knew that up to 18 American cities were being targeted by Chinese long-range missiles, missiles that had and have the potential of killing millions of Americans. During this time, he said 130 times: ``For the first time since the dawn of the nuclear age, there is not a single, solitary nuclear missile pointed at an American child tonight. Not one. Not a single one.'' 
   So while the American people consume his misleading and dishonest public statements--helping to secure his reelection --nothing was done for over  a year about the security breach at Los Alamos. 
   The likely suspect spy was identified in early 1997, and the FBI urged that he at least be transferred to a less sensitive position. But inexplicably, he was allowed to keep his sensitive job at Los Alamos for a another year and a half. This was the spy who was responsible for the theft, and President Clinton kept him in that sensitive job for another year and a half. Finally, he was fired by Energy Secretary Richardson last Monday--a week ago today, March 8, 1999--but only after he was publicly identified in news reports as having failed two previous lie detector tests. 
   In all of this, was Congress ever informed? As a Member of 
   the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Senate Intelligence Committee, I certainly was not. As I said earlier, I talked to the chairmen of both the House Intelligence Committee and the Senate Intelligence Committee and they weren't informed either. 
   Did the President ever take the appropriate aggressive and timely steps that should have been taken in order to protect the national security interest in the wake of this matter? No, he did not. 
   Why? Why the delays? Why the lack of consultation and communication? Why the seeming indifference to this very, very serious breach of national security? We will be asking some tough questions about this in the days to come. I note that the Armed Services Committee will have a hearing on this, and the Intelligence Committee will have a hearing the day after tomorrow, Wednesday. We will have a lot of questions. The American people need to know what is going on here. 
   The President's National Security Advisor, Mr. Berger, has a lot to answer for here. He had better be prepared to answer questions from Members of Congress honestly, forthrightly, and without intention to deceive, mislead, or change the meaning of words. Otherwise, he should resign now and take the rap for President Clinton. 
   I am convinced that we have not yet scratched the surface of the national security scandal exposed by these most recent revelations. 
   This administration obviously wanted nothing to interfere with developing good relations with China. While it was soliciting and accepting campaign contributions from China, it was dragging its feet on investigating the most egregious espionage operation China had ever succeeded in pulling off in the U.S., a breach of security which could potentially put the lives of millions of Americans at great risk. 
   This is, without doubt, the worst example yet of how this administration has put its own selfish motives above the national security interests of this country and above the protection of American lives. 
   The American people and the Congress must demand that the President be held accountable for this gross dereliction of duty. I guess the question is, What can we do? We are Members of Congress and what can we do? I am not sure there is anything we can do except inform the American people and let public outrage solve the problem. And why are we in Congress so limited in what we can do? 
   Our Founding Fathers never envisioned we would have a President who would do these kinds of things and act in these ways. This is why the Constitution gives the President great latitude of action in carrying out his duties and why he is protected from the other branches of Government under the separation of powers. 
   When John Adams wrote to his wife after the first night he spent in the White House in 1799, he spoke of the expectations of all the founders during that time: ``May only honest and wise men rule under this roof.'' The White House. 
   There was an assumption that the American people would always elect Presidents with a basic level of morality, honesty and integrity, who out of patriotism would always put the welfare of the country above any personal ambitions for power or glory. 
   This President knew he was covering up information vital to the safety and well-being of every American--that China had stolen from us the advanced technology which would give them the capability to kill millions of Americans in multiple cities with just one missile, and he knew it. 
   In 1945, World War II was ended when the atomic bombs were dropped in Nagasaki and Hiroshima. Each explosion destroyed an entire city, killing tens of thousands. The death toll in Hiroshima was about 75,000 lives from that 15-ton nuclear bomb. 
   Just think, that with the technology that this President has transferred to China and what China has stolen and the President has covered up, China is now capable of producing a 150-kiloton bomb small enough to fit ten of them on top of one missile, each bomb targeted at a different American city with accuracy and reliability. 
   Just extrapolating the numbers, that--in theory--is enough destructive power to kill as many as 7,500,000 Americans--with just one missile. 
   And, due to this President who stopped our national missile defense effort, we have no defense. We have a President who acts as if he doesn't care about us. 
   So finally, Mr. President, let me repeat the six proven incontrovertible facts: 
   1. President Clinton hosted over 100 campaign fundraisers in the White House, many with Chinese connections. 
   2. President Clinton used John Huang, Charlie Trie, Johnny Chung, James Riady, and others with strong Chinese ties to raise campaign money. 
   3. President Clinton signed waivers to allow his top campaign fundraiser's aerospace company to transfer United States missile guidance technology to China. 
   4. President Clinton covered up the theft of our most valuable nuclear weapons technology. 
   5. President Clinton lied to the American people over 130 times about our Nation's security while he knew Chinese missiles were aimed at American children. 
   6. President Clinton single-handedly stopped the deployment of a national missile defense system, exposing every American life to a missile attack, leaving America with no defense whatsoever against an intercontinental ballistic missile. 
   Again, it doesn't matter whether President Clinton did these things for Chinese campaign contributions because the motive for aiding and abetting our adversaries is not important. The fact is President Clinton did it and he knew exactly what he was doing. 
   I'm not a lawyer, Mr. President, but I have to ask, could President Clinton have been tried for impeachment for the wrong crime? 
   Why am I here telling the truth about the President? 
   I think it is because I haven't heard anyone else do it. They know this President will lie with such conviction that the American people will continue to believe him, and they don't want to take the risk. 
   I happened to go yesterday to the McLean Bible Church, and the sermon was about taking risks--being willing to take a risk. They talked about the Israelites who were in the desert, and they sent a team up to Canaan to look to see what the risk was up there. They came back, and they said: There are giants up there. We don't have a chance. We are like mosquitoes next to them, except for Caleb.'' Caleb came back, and he said, ``We should take the risks. We can win. We can fight and win.'' 
   What happened? The rest of the story you know. You know what that is. God left the Israelites out in the desert, and he sent Caleb to the Promised Land. With all these blessings, we just do not seem to learn. I think Henry Ward Beecher said it in a different way. He said, ``I don't like those cold, precise, perfect people who, in order not to say wrong, say nothing.......and in order not to do wrong, do nothing.'' 
   We have a lot of people around here who are more concerned about their jobs that they would go ahead and do nothing. So somebody has to tell the truth about this President. We can't all be appeasers. An appeaser is a guy who throws his friends to the alligators hoping they will eat him last. 
   Hiram Mann said, ``No man survives when freedom fails, the best men rot in filthy jails, and those who cry appease, appease are hanged by those they tried to please.'' 
   I believe that truth will ultimately prevail. It is just stubborn. Winston Churchill said, ``Truth is incontrovertible. Ignorance may deride it, panic may resent it, malice may destroy it, but there it is.''  
   Mr. President, everything I have said during the course of the last 30 minutes is absolutely proven and true. I hope America is listening. We have a nation to save from this President. 
   Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am pleased to have the opportunity to discuss my support for the Education Flexibility Partnership Act or Ed-Flex as it has become known. Ed-Flex provides much needed relief to the schools of 12 states currently included in a demonstration project begun in 1994. Like many of my colleagues, I believe it is time to give this relief to the other 38 states who suffer from government over-regulation. 
   In preparation for each new school year, teachers and school administrators throughout the country face the challenge of providing the highest level of education with a limited amount of resources. This has always been the case and will remain the true for generations to come. I know this from personal experience. My wife was an educator in the Tulsa Public School District for many years and both of my daughters are current teachers. In my conversations with them, I have seen first hand the problems associated with bureaucratic mandates handed down from Washington. 
   Let me give you an example of what I am talking about. Over the last three decades, the Federal Government has piled on mountains of bureaucratic redtape on local school districts. Between 1960 and 1990, the average percentage of school budgets devoted to classroom instruction declined from 61% in 1960 to 46% in 1990. The most significant reason for this decline is traced to the explosion of administrators and non-teaching support staff while the overall number of teachers has reduced. One primary reason for the growth in administrative personnel is the growth in regulations, both state and Federal. 
   Let me show you just one example of how this is evidenced in Oklahoma. In my hometown of Tulsa, the Tulsa Public Schools have approximately 42,600 students. In order to provide quality education to those 42,600 students, there are approximately 225 administrative staff employed by the Tulsa Public Schools system. Now, I realize that some of these are essential managerial and administrative staff, however, how many are doing nothing more than trying to keep Tulsa schools' in compliance with Federal regulations? How many of those staff could be better utilized in classrooms across the district instead of spending their time dedicated to paperwork? And, this is just one example of one public school system in my state. The problem is the same in every single school system. 
   Mr. President, it is clear, the more people and resources it requires to comply with government regulations, the fewer people and resources dedicated to teaching our children. 
   Each time we create a new Federal program, with it comes numerous forms and reports. The schools must understand, complete these forms and reports and submit to the appropriate departments within the appropriate agencies, by the appropriate deadlines. Whether schools use teachers and administrators, or support staff and volunteering parents, to fulfill this obligation, valuable time and resources are used for Washington's paperwork, not student education. 
   Let me illustrate this point further. Currently, the Federal Government provides 
   approximately 7% of overall school funding. However, Federal paperwork accounts for upwards of 50% of all school paperwork. It is estimated that completing this paperwork requires about 49 million hours each year. Mr. President, that is the equivalent of 25,000 employees working full time for an entire year. According to one expert, it is estimated that it takes six times as many employees to administer a Federal education dollar as it does to administer one state education dollar. Again, these people are not teaching or educating our children, but completing bureaucratic red tape. 
   Earlier, I discussed the number of administrative positions in the Tulsa Public Schools; but the problem is more pronounced in the state as a whole. There are approximately 5,950 administrative and other certified staff performing non-teaching duties in Oklahoma. Those 5,590 people represent  about 10% of the total public school personnel. That is 10% doing something other than teaching children. That concerns me greatly. I have to wonder whether we are using our resources in the best way possible to meet the educational needs of our children. 
   Now, some of my colleagues, and the President, believe that we need the Federal Government to hire an additional 100,000 teachers in order to reduce class size around the country. However, I have to wonder if that is really the answer to the problem. As I have just demonstrated, we have too many professional and certified staff in my state that are not educating children. Instead, they busy themselves attempting to comply with government regulations. If we can unburden school districts of cumbersome regulation, the local districts can shift some of their resources back to educating our children. If the Federal Government does require the states to hire additional teachers, it will simply be one more mandate handed down from Washington for the states to comply with once the dedicated Federal funds expire. You can be sure that if there are additional Federal mandates there will be additional non-teaching certified staff required to administer the program and that means another professional staff member not in the classroom teaching our children. 
   As the bureaucratic mandates from Washington have increased, states needed a way to gain some flexibility to address their individual concerns. Our answer to the states was the Education Flexibility Partnership Demonstration Act of 1994, an effort I was proud to support while I was in the House of Representatives. First authorized in 1994 for six states, and expanded in 1996 for six additional states, Ed-Flex has given 12 state legislatures the freedom to identify the most efficient and effective means possible to meet the needs of students and schools in their states. Under Ed-Flex, the Department of Education gives to states and local districts the authority to waive certain Federal requirements that interfere with state and local efforts to improve education. In exchange for this flexibility, the state and local districts must agree to comply with certain federal core principles and agree to waive its own state regulations. The states must also agree to use the affected federal funds for their original purpose. 
   Mr. President, I think it says something about the nature of our current bureaucracy that we have to give states the power to waive Federal regulations. If there were fewer onerous regulations in the first place, we would not have to pass legislation to give states the power to ignore federal regulations. Wouldn't it make more sense to let the states be responsible for the education of our children, not bureaucrats in Washington? 
   In my State of Oklahoma, we have great diversity in our education needs. We have schools of all kinds; urban schools, rural schools, inner city schools, and suburban schools. In my conversations with educators and administrators, I hear them tell unique stories about the challenges they face in trying to educate their students. All of these educators tell different stories. However, not surprisingly, almost to a person, they tell me of the problems they have in complying with government regulations. It does not come as a surprise to me that the education challenges presented at urban schools like Tulsa McClain High School differ widely from the needs of smaller rural schools like Weatherford High School. Yet, they all have to comply with the same Federal regulations. Given the failings of the public schools today, it is little surprise that the cookie-cutter approach of the Federal Government has been a disaster. 
   The time has come to move beyond a one-size-fits-all Federal approach in educating our children. As I look around our country, I see the great successes that our Governors are having in making progress in education reform. I am continually amazed at the policy innovations going on in State legislatures all over the country with regard to education. However, now, it is the Federal Government's responsibility to join with those Governors and give them more flexibility to continue to innovate and improve our public schools. I understand the need for accountability. However, I believe accountability is best when it closest to home and vested in Governors, State legislators, and local school board officials than with faceless Federal bureaucrats in Washington. State leaders understand this. That is why groups like the National Governor's Association and the National Conference of State Legislators have endorsed this legislation. 
   As I have watched and listened to the debate on Ed-Flex, I have been surprised by many amendments offered by some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. Many of the proposed amendments seem counterproductive to the central purpose of Ed-Flex. Ed-Flex is about easing government mandates and regulations. However, many of the amendments we have debated would add to the mountain of Federal mandates applied to State and local school districts. As much as I hate to say this, it appears that many of my colleagues would rather have a political issue than have meaningful education reform. 
   Mr. President, the results Ed-Flex prove the effectiveness of the demonstration program. Whether it is giving local districts the resources to provide one-on-one reading tutoring or lower the teacher to student ratios in classrooms, Ed-Flex has been a tremendous success. These are all things we can agree upon. Based on its proven track record, the time has come to expand Ed-Flex to the rest of the country. We need to continue to identify programs that work and expand them, while eliminating the programs that are ineffective. 
   In closing, Mr. President, I want to thank Senators FRIST and WYDEN for their leadership on this issue. Their efforts prove that we can work together to the benefit of our children when it comes to educating our children. As the Senate proceeds with the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act later this year, I look forward to working with them to continue to progress we have begun here today. 
   Mr. President, thank you for the opportunity to discuss my views on Ed-Flex and I yield back the remainder of my time. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. Chief Justice, in the absence of hearing something that I haven't heard or seeing something that is unforeseen up to now, it is my plan to vote for conviction on the two Articles of Impeachment. 
   I think this is probably the most important vote I will cast during the course of my lifetime. I say it very sincerely. I believe we are going to rise to the occasion. 
   I had an experience back in 1975, 24 years ago. I was a member of the State Senate in Oklahoma. I can remember being called for jury duty, and I was very happy to find myself assigned to a murder case about which I had already expressed a definite opinion. I said I believed this defendant was surely guilty, and besides, I was the author of the capital punishment bill in the state legislature. So I thought for sure I wasn't going to be qualified as a juror. 
   Well, I went through the qualification procedure and somehow they qualified me. Five days later, I was the foreman of the jury that acquitted that accused murderer. This can happen. It is an experience that taught me a lot about our judicial system. 
   I sometimes say one of the few qualifications I have for the U.S. Senate is I am not a lawyer. So that when I read the Constitution, I know what it says; when I read the oath of office, I know what it says; when I read the law, I know what it says. I don't have to clutter up my mind with what the definition of ``is'' is. So it makes it a little easier for me. 
   From a nonlawyer perspective let me share a couple of observations. 
   First, insofar as perjury is concerned--lying under oath--I might be wrong, but I don't think there is a Senator in this Chamber who doesn't believe the President lied under oath. 
   I quote from the White House counsel, Charles Ruff, himself who said: ``Reasonable people can believe the President lied under oath.'' 
   I quote from Senator CHUCK SCHUMER who said: ``He lied under oath both in the Paula Jones deposition and what he said in the grand jury.'' 
   I quote from Representative ROBERT WEXLER, a strong supporter of the President, who serves on the House Judiciary Committee, who said: ``The President did not tell the truth. He lied under oath.'' 
   I quote from former U.S. Senator Paul Simon, one of my favorite Democrat colleagues, who appeared with me on a television program before the trial, who said: ``You have to be an extreme Clinton zealot to believe perjury was not committed.'' 
   Second, as a non-attorney, I have a hard time reconciling the idea that there might be certain permissible exceptions to telling the truth under oath. Maybe you who are attorneys, and have a different background than mine, see it differently. But how can you reconcile this idea that under some conditions--if the subject matter is sex or something else--you can lie under oath? I really have a hard time with this. 
   I know that morality is not supposed to be the issue here. We are supposed to concentrate on the two specific Articles of Impeachment. However, I don't think anyone can completely compartmentalize himself and totally disregard other things going on. 
   All of us get many, many letters from young children, parents, teachers, and others who are deeply distressed about the President's behavior and its  impact on the moral health of the Nation. I think I am very fortunate because my kids are all in their upper thirties and my eight grandchildren (make that nine--I count them when they are conceived) are all under 6, so I don't get those embarrassing questions. But I know many parents are struggling with this. 
   The other thing that concerns me is the reprehensible, consistent attitude this president has displayed over the years against women. Take Paula Jones as just one example. She may not win a popularity poll, but her civil rights have just as much standing as anyone else's, do they not? Is not our country based on the principle that even the least among us is entitled to equal treatment under the law? 
   It amazes me how these feminist organizations continue to hold this President in such high regard--groups such as the National Organization of Women. I went back and read their bylaws. They claim to want to protect women with regard to ``equal rights and responsibilities in all aspects of citizenship, public service, employment ..... including freedom from discrimination.'' 
   And here we have a president who not only misused his power to seduce a college-age intern, but who has also engaged in extensive similar misconduct outside of his marriage. It is not just Monica Lewinsky. There is Gennifer Flowers, Elizabeth Ward Gracen, Paula Jones, Kathleen Willey, Dolly KYLe Browning, Beth Coulson, Susan McDougal, Cristy Zercher--the list goes on and on. 
   This President has a consistent pattern of using and abusing women. You know that. I imagine most of you watched the Monica Lewinsky tapes as I did. I don't know why the House managers didn't pick this up--somehow they let it slip through--about when she told this story concerning the two security badges. She came here to Washington, this wide-eyed kid, and there is a blue badge that lets you get into the White House proper and a pink badge that lets you only into the Old Executive Office Building. And she wanted to be in there--in the West Wing--where she could see what was going on. 
   She had the pink badge so she had to be escorted to the West Wing by someone else. So the very first day she meets and talks to the President in person, he begins the relationship we're talking about. He didn't even know her name. And then he reached across and grabbed her pink badge, yanked it down, and said, ``This is going to be a problem.'' I don't think there is anyone in the room who doesn't know what he was referring to. He was preparing to use this girl and abuse her and discard her like an old shirt. But I know that these are not things the lawyers expect us to consider. 
   I do want to give another observation, though. I thought the playing field would be very uneven when this trial started. The members of the Judiciary Committee who are the House managers are all lawyers. But mostly, they are Congressmen first. Many of these Congressmen-lawyers had not been in a courtroom for literally years. And here they were taking on the most prestigious, the most prominent, the most skilled, the most experienced, the highest priced lawyers anywhere in America. And yet when they finished with their opening statements, there was no doubt the House managers had risen superbly to the occasion, and I believe they have done a great job throughout. 
   The White House lawyers are very skilled, very persuasive people. I would make this observation--again, a non-lawyer observation: I felt that three or four of them should have quit their opening remarks about 5 minutes sooner than they did. They had a tendency to close their presentations with arguments that undermined their credibility. 
   Cheryl Mills, for example, was really doing well, and she was very persuasive until she started at the very last talking about the President's record on civil rights, as if the civil rights of a person his associates had dubbed as ``trailer park trash'' were not significant, or the dignity of the intern he had branded ``a stalker'' was not significant. I really think she destroyed her otherwise very persuasive presentation. 
   I think the same thing was true with Gregory Craig. He ended by talking about how conviction in this case would somehow ``destroy a fundamental underpinning of democracy'' by overturning the results of an election, as if Bob Dole would come in if that were to happen. 
   Even our good friend, Dale Bumpers--I knew Dale Bumpers long before I came here to the U.S. Senate--did a great job. But I think he should have quit early, too, because at the very last it sounded like he was predicating the innocence of this President on his foreign policy. And as I just look at Iraq and what is going on over there, I think if that had been the test for this, I could have made up my mind a lot earlier. 
   Another perspective I bring to this is as chairman of the Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness. Having been in the service myself, and knowing how important discipline is, I am very disturbed that we have so many cases where severe punishment is dealt to individuals who have engaged in conduct far less serious than that of the President. Consider: 
   Captain Derrick Robinson, an Army officer, was caught up in the Aberdeen sex misconduct case and is serving time in Leavenworth for admitting to consensual sex with an enlisted person who was not his wife. 
   Delmar Simpson is serving 25 years in a military prison because a court-martial found that, even though his relationship with a female recruit was consensual, the power granted him by his rank made such consensual sex with a subordinate unacceptable. Think of the power granted this President by his rank. 
   Remember Kelly Flinn. She is not flying B-52s anymore. She was forced out the Air Force for lying about an adulterous affair. 
   Sergeant Major Gene McKinney, the Army's top enlisted man, was tried for perjury, adultery, and obstruction of justice--all concerning sexual misconduct. He was convicted of obstruction, but not before his attorney asserted at the trial how people in uniform rightly ask: ``How can you hold an enlisted man to a higher standard than the President of the United States, the Commander in Chief?'' 
   So I have looked at this and studied it. I think anyone who votes to acquit has to say that we are going to hold this President to a lower standard of conduct and behavior than we hold other people. I do not understand how they can come to any other conclusion. 
   My wife and I have been married 40 years. I have a thing called the wife test. You go home and when you want to get an opinion that is totally apolitical, you ask your wife. So I went home and I presented the case--as explained so eloquently by the White House lawyers and others--on why we could have a lower standard of conduct for a President than we have for a judge. And I know the argument. And I expressed the argument to my wife in the kitchen. I said, there are a thousand judges, only one President. I went through the whole thing. Then she looked up and said, ``I thought the President appointed the judges.'' You know, my wife is so dumb, she is always asking me questions I can't answer. 
   But I really believe that in this case we are getting at the truth. I really believe that the President of the United States should be held to the very highest of standards. 
   You know, Winston Churchill said: ``Truth is incontrovertible. Ignorance may deride it, panic may resent it, malice may destroy it, but there it is.'' 
   I think we have seen the truth. And I think the final truth is that this President should be held to the very highest of standards. 
   Sometimes when I am not really sure I am right, I consult my best friend. His name is Jesus. And I asked that question. Now I will quote to you the response that is found in Luke: ``From one who has been entrusted with more, much more will be asked.'' 
   Mr. Chief Justice, I think Jesus is right. 
   Mr. CLELAND, Mr. Chief Justice, inasmuch as the impeachment trial of the President has focused on the importance of oaths, I have begun to reflect on the oaths I have taken in my life. In terms of affirming my allegiance to this nation and the United States Constitution, I have taken an oath four times. I have followed up each oath with my signature.  
   The first such oath I took was when I was 21 years old. I was sworn in to the United States Army as a young Second Lieutenant. Later I followed my flag and my Commander-in-Chief in being a part of the armed military forces in the Vietnam War. 
   After the war, I took another oath. This time I was sworn in as head of the Veterans' Administration under President Carter. I still remember that turbulent time after the Vietnam War when so many of my fellow veterans were returning from that conflict. The words from Abraham Lincoln's second inaugural address seemed to constantly echo in my mind: ``.....to care for him who has borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan.'' Having been wounded in Vietnam myself I felt a grave responsibility to carry out my oath on behalf of my fellow veterans. 
   The next time I took an oath it was January, 1997. It was on the occasion of being sworn into the United States Senate. As Vice President AL GORE swore the new Senators in, I placed my right elbow on my Bible and raised my left hand in an oath to defend the Constitution against ``all enemies, foreign and domestic.'' Once in the Senate, I was fortunate to have been selected to follow distinguished former Georgia Senators Richard B. Russell and Sam Nunn in service on the Senate Armed Services Committee. I fully expected that any threat to our Constitution, our electoral process, or our delicately-honed system of checks and balances would come from outside our country, not from within. 
   I was wrong. 
   This leads me to my most recent oath to do ``impartial justice'' in the Senate in the impeachment trial of the President of the United States. In my personal view, this final oath, sealed with my signature in a book which will become part of the archives of American history, is a culmination of the other three oaths I have taken. 
   I have sworn to defend this country. 
   I have sworn to take care of its defenders. 
   I have sworn to uphold the Constitution for which my fellow defenders have suffered and died. 
   How can I now turn my back and ignore the challenge to that Constitution posed by this precedent-setting, first-time ever impeachment of an elected President of the United States? 
   I cannot. 
   When my name is called in regular order for my vote on the articles of impeachment, I will vote ``not guilty.'' 
   I have reached my decision after much effort. I have tried to keep an open mind and an open heart. I have attempted to search the depths of American history and the lore of our English forebearers for insight and guidance. I have counseled privately with experts on American history and constitutional law. I have met with knowledgeable sources inside and outside the government. I have personally listened to constituents in my state and throughout the nation. I have talked to them on the phone, read their letters and scanned their e-mail. I have tried to weave an appropriate course through the barrage of media talk and the system of political reporters doing their duty. 
   I have given it my best shot. 
   I understand now what Alexander Hamilton meant when he predicted 212 years ago that individual Senators faced with an impeachment trial had the ``awful discretion'' of removing a President. Yet, I believe Hamilton was correct when long ago he advocated placing his faith in the Senators, where he hoped to find, ``dignity and independence.'' I believe that under the circumstances the Senate has conducted itself appropriately, and has complied with Hamilton's standards of conducting an impeachment trial with ``dignity and independence.'' I also believe the Senate should continue to follow the standards set by our Founding Fathers regarding the use of impeachment power. According to the Founders as articulated in the Constitution, the impeachment clearly should be reserved for ``bribery, treason or other high crimes and misdemeanors.'' This language did not just turn up in the Constitution overnight. The language grew and evolved over a period of months in Philadelphia in 1787. 
   One of the Founding Fathers who especially impressed me is George Mason. Mason had an interesting background. Like many of our country's early statesmen, he was from Virginia. For me, Mason is a bridge of insight into what the impeachment clause in the Constitution is all about. 
   Mason was a soldier. Indeed, he was an officer, a colonel. He, too, understood the grave responsibility of military leadership, of leading men in combat and in caring for them afterwards. He certainly knew about the gravity of his own personal oath. It was Mason, then, who articulated during the Constitutional Convention that the phrase in the Constitution regarding impeachment must be more fully fleshed out and should more appropriately read ``..... and other high crimes and misdemeanors against the state.'' 
   Here was a soldier of the American Revolution. Here was an officer in that Revolution working with his fellow statesmen charting out a course for the Nation's future. Here was a brother of the bond from Northern Virginia who wanted to make sure the actual Constitutional language was clear that any impeachment must rise to a high level. According to the thrust of Mason's argument, for an impeachment of the President to be legitimate, the impeachable 
   offenses must pose a threat to the nation itself. The Committee which reviewed the language believed that the phrase ``against the state'' was redundant, and, in effect, assumed. 
   President Clinton has committed serious offenses. His personal conduct in this matter was, as I have said before, wrongful, reprehensible and indefensible. He has admitted to personal offenses, and will be appropriately judged for his misconduct elsewhere. In my judgement, under all the others I have taken under the United States Constitution, his offenses do not rise to the required level for impeachable offenses under the United States Constitution. 
   I will be voting against conviction and removal from office of the President on both articles because I do not believe that these particular charges reach the high standard for impeachment which I believe that George Mason and the other Founders intended: that such an offense must be conduct which threatens grievous harm to our entire system. I provided more detail about the reasons for these conclusions in an earlier statement I submitted for the RECORD, and I ask unanimous consent that those remarks be inserted following this statement. 
   As the Senate concludes this trial, I am reminded of other words from Abraham Lincoln's second Inaugural Address: ``with malice toward none, with clarity for all, let us bind up the nation's wounds......'' If Lincoln can say that as the nation was concluding the most divisive time in our history, which ultimately resulted in the first impeachment trial of an American President, surely we can say that to each other and to our nation as we conclude this historical second impeachment trial. 
   It is time to end this trial. 
   It is time to let the President conclude the term he was elected to by the American people. 
   It is time to put an end to partisan bickering about the motives and conduct of all of those who have become involved in this sad episode. 
   It is time for us all to bind up the nation's wounds. 
   It is time to get on with the business of the American people we were elected to conduct.

   Mr. INHOFE. First, Mr. President, now that the vote to impeach William Jefferson Clinton has been taken, and before I discuss my vote, let me say that this whole thing could have been avoided had President Clinton resigned months ago. I say this because I called for his resignation last September. Rather than explain my reasoning for calling for President Clinton's resignation, I believe it is better explained by an 8th grade school teacher from Tulsa, Oklahoma, Mr. Terrence Hogan. I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Hogan's letter to the President dated September 26, 1998, be printed in the RECORD.

   Mr. INHOFE. Today I voted to convict William Jefferson Clinton on each of the two Articles of Impeachment presented by the House of Representatives. 
   I find the President guilty, as charged, of high crimes and misdemeanors: lying under oath and obstructing justice. The President engaged in a deliberate and selfish pattern of conduct designed to thwart the civil rights of a fellow citizen. This conduct represents a serious breach of faith and trust. This conduct is incompatible with the solemn duties and moral responsibilities of the high office of President of the United States. 
   Similar conduct by others results in consequences: perjurers, witness tamperers and obstructors of justice go to jail; supervisors lose their jobs; military officers are court-martialed, imprisoned or forced out of the armed forces; judges are impeached and removed from office. Shall we embrace a lower standard for this President under these circumstances? I think not. I believe that the President of the United States should be held to the very highest of standards. 
   I believe that conviction and removal from office is justified in order (1) to preserve the integrity, honor and trust of the presidency; (2) to protect the sanctity of the witness oath in judicial proceedings; and (3) to uphold the fundamental principle of ``equal justice under law.'' 
   INTRODUCTION
   In accord with my sworn oath to do ``impartial justice according to the Constitution and the laws,'' I have approached the trial of William Jefferson Clinton as a solemn constitutional duty. Voting on the Articles of Impeachment may be the most historically significant thing I will do in my entire career in public service. I have taken this obligation seriously, without concern for public opinion polls or for any partisan political advantage of consequence. This is a moment when one must put the longer-term interests of the country first.

   Mr. INHOFE. I thank the distinguished Senator from Georgia for the time. I know it is very scarce, but I felt compelled, Mr. President, to make a couple of comments about what was not in the State of the Union Message last night.

   Mr. INHOFE. Recognizing my time is about up, I would only like to say that is only part of the problem. The other problem is--and I say this with some knowledge as chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee in the Senate Armed Services Committee--that we have roughly 60 percent of the capability that we had, in terms of force strength, that we had during the Persian Gulf war in 1991. And when I say that, I can quantify. Talking about 60 percent of the Army division, 60 percent of the tactical air wing, 60 percent of the ships floating around there; and yet we are in a more threatened world today. 
   So I believe that little pittance that the President is talking about of $110 billion over 6 years, of which only $2 billion of new money would be in the coming fiscal year, does not meet the expectations of the American people. It has not fulfilled the requirements of his own Secretary of Defense, his own Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the four chiefs who said: We are going to have to put a minimum of $25 billion of new money in each year for the next 6 years in order to get to a point where we can defend America on two regional fronts. 
   With that, I thank the Senator from Georgia for this very scarce time that he has given me.
