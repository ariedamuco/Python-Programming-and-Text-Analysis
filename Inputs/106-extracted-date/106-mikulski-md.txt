   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I rise with great enthusiasm to support passage of the bipartisan Older Americans Act and its amendments for the year 2000. 
   This bill enjoys very strong bipartisan support in this institution and in the House and, I believe, among the American people. Yesterday the House passed this legislation overwhelmingly, 405-2. The Senate companion bill that we are bringing to the attention of our colleagues today already has 72 cosponsors. There is strong bipartisan, bicameral agreement to reauthorize the Older Americans Act. It is built on the strong foundation of S. 1536 and the bipartisan compromises reached by the HELP Committee in that bill. 
   This legislation also has the strong support of the executive branch. President Bill Clinton's team from HHS was enormously helpful in enabling us to shape not only the reauthorization of the bill as we knew it but help create a framework for the future. The gifted Administrator on Aging, Jeanette Takamura, was tremendously helpful. 
   This bill is long overdue in its reauthorization. The reauthorization expired in 1995. It became bogged down for almost 5 years in prickly politics, most of which had nothing to do with how we could make sure we were effectively serving the senior population. 
   This year, as we moved into the 106th Congress, Senator MIKE DEWINE of Ohio and I pledged that we would do everything we could to come up with an excellent framework to meet the needs of the seniors, to not only reauthorize and rubberstamp but to look at it, to be both fiscally prudent but also to be effective with taxpayers' money. He worked very hard in doing that and worked very hard with my staff. I thank him and his staff for their collegial, cordial work on this legislation. 
   Of course, Senator JEFFORDS has been tremendously helpful. He enabled us to hold our hearings, to move the process forward. I personally thank him. Of course, my champ, the ranking member, Senator KENNEDY, with his very able staff, enabled us to work with the constituency groups, and so on. 
   So we did all the right process things. Now it is time to move the process to closure. We have had debate. We have had hearings. We have had consultations. We have consensus. Now it is time we have reauthorization. I hope today we can move expeditiously, entertain any amendments that Members would like to offer, and dispose of them in a timely way. The seniors are looking for it. 
   When I visit the senior centers in my own community, they say: How are you doing on the Older Americans Act? I say: We are doing fine, but the Older Americans Act is being stalled in a variety of procedural matters. 
   Let's remove the procedural barriers. Let's also deal with the amendments. 
   What I like about this legislation is that it keeps our promises to older Americans to retain and strengthen the current Older Americans Act programs, but it also provides new innovations and accountability to improve it. It will ensure that the Older Americans Act continues to meet the day-to-day needs of our country's older Americans and yet the long-range needs of an ever increasing aging population. 
   One of the highlights of this bill is the creation of a program called the National Family Caregiver Support Program. This recognizes the tremendous aging population, many who are left at home, many of whom rely on the primary caregiver as the 
   American family. The American family is stepping forward to take care of older parents and at the same time being able to raise their own children. 
   This places tremendous stress on the family in terms of time, energy, and even finances, but, as always, the American family is up to it. The American family is ready to step forward. Often the caregiving is primarily done by women, some who have taken temp jobs, some who have taken flextime jobs, some who are juggling so many others, often to the tune of at least 20 or 40 hours a week either in their own home or going to the home of a parent. 
   The American family is up to it, but we have to be up to supporting the American family. Government should never be a substitute for the family, but the family should be able to rely on the Government for certain support services to enable them to be the best at caregiving and not wear out. 
   The National Family Caregiver Support Program will provide very important support services. It will also provide information assistance to millions of Americans who are searching for what are the best resources to help their older parent. Also, it provides for them training, counseling, and even some respite care. Even the best family can't keep at it 24-7, 52 weeks of the year. 
   It will also help grandparents who care for grandchildren, and, as I said, this program has strong bipartisan support. 
   Later I will go into the need for caregiving, why it is so important, why we need to support the families. 
   At the same time, though, while we look for innovation, we also maintain the core programs of the Older Americans Act. I remember when this legislation was passed in 1972, I was so excited about it, working in Baltimore's neighborhoods, that we were actually going to have programs that would come right to the community and right at the neighborhood level. 
   We knew the seniors needed support services. We knew they were facing loneliness. We knew they were facing poor nutrition. We knew they were often the subject of scams and fraud and a variety of kinds of abuse. As a result of what was done in 1972, we stayed the course. But now, what are the best practices, the highest use of new technologies, and so on, to accomplish this goal? 
   The program called Meals on Wheels changed the face of America. 
   Fifty volunteers, often working with nonprofits, were able to get meals into a home in order to keep people independent and at the same time keep a unique partnership between the Federal Government and nonprofits, helping people remain independent. There  were people who were lonely--often widows or men who lost wives who were kind of walking around, hanging out at diners or cafes in certain areas. They needed companionship and maybe a hot meal, and they also needed a sense of purpose where they themselves would volunteer. We use the term congregate meals. What an insipid term because what we really wanted them to do is congregate with other people, to have fun and good meals and even learn some new skills which we are going to bring in with crossing the digital divide. Those nutritional programs kept people alive. My own dear mother, when she came home from an acute care facility, temporarily used that as we pitched in with the rest of the family. 
   We also maintain a separate and distinct title IV program for research and demonstration because we think we have to try new ideas before we create them and institutionalize them into the legislation. Innovation has always been a unique characteristic. We also talk about a White House conference in 2005. We maintain another poor program--support for transportation services. It is absolutely crucial in our own community and into rural areas. This language also requires older American services to be directed to those who need them the most. However, we acknowledged the unmet need that can exist in rural areas, so we included provisions to improve the delivery of services to older individuals in rural areas. 
   I congratulate Senator DEWINE, who really ensured a sensitivity to that. I represent rural counties myself. At the same time, we recognize the need to strengthen certain programs and increase accountability. The bill gives greater flexibility to transfer of funds between those congregate and home-delivered meals to the areas of greatest need. It also includes performance measures for States and private sector grantees in the Senior Community Service Employment Program. If these standards are not met and performance is not improved, other entities will get the opportunity to competitively bid for a portion or all of the original entity's grant--whatever the word ``entity'' means. While I believe that overall the current grantees are performing very well, these provisions will ensure that seniors get the high-quality services they deserve. We ensure accountability for not only the taxpayers' funds but the services being delivered. 
   So this bill strikes a good balance between recognizing the need for additional resources to support OAA programs and protecting the most vulnerable citizens and their access to services. It also authorizes the seniors to make voluntary contributions for all OAA services. It also allows States to require cost sharing for a limited number of services, such as transportation, respite care, and personal care. A long list of services is exempt from cost sharing, such as Meals on Wheels, information and assistance, and that very important ombudsman program. It also provides guidance to States and protections to help ensure that seniors are not discouraged from seeking services because of cost sharing. 
   I note the strong need for increased funding for the Older Americans Act programs. Very few OAA programs have seen increased funding in recent years. Yet there is a growing need for services. I support full funding for OAA and also for 
   the new National Family Caregiver Support Program. Also, the core programs need increases in funding. 
   So I think this is good legislation. I think it is good authorization. I think it will provide immeasurable guidance to the appropriators for the next 3 years. This morning I say we have good legislation. We can be so proud of the bipartisan, bicameral support. This is what America wants us to do, really--focus on the day-to-day needs of our constituents, look ahead to an aging population, and come up with a fiscally prudent, service-effective framework, and get the job done. All too often in this institution, when all is said and done, more gets said than done. Today, let's stay late and get the job done. 
   I yield the floor.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, we concluded a short time ago with the argument by the Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. GREGG, on his concerns about some aspects of the Older Americans Act. I thought we were going to resume a robust debate. That does not quite seem like it is going to happen, but I am going to have things to say. Right now I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent that it be charged equally, and then I will take the floor and begin my rebuttal.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for all of their kind comments on this legislation and also how they were complimentary, both on the content and the bipartisan nature of it. We really only have one unresolved issue and that is the amendment raised by our colleague from New Hampshire. I say to my colleague from New Hampshire, we admire his stewardship over Federal funds and his insistence on accountability. However, we think his amendment, though very well intentioned, is really misguided. 
   We are concerned, both on the basis of content and then also the consequences for this legislation. Number one, if the Gregg amendment should prevail, this could have the consequence of really killing this bill. This is a bill that has been arrived at through a very delicate bipartisan agreement, not only within our own institution but in the House. We are in the closing hours of the 106th Congress. If an amendment is agreed to, we are going to have to have a conference or this bill will go back to the House. Then the lid goes off and we will be involved in a variety of other discussions. I think my colleagues know that once you start talking you tend not to stop talking. 
   So we really encourage that people be aware this could sink the Older Americans Act for the 106th Congress. I would so regret that because we have worked so hard among ourselves with constituency groups and others. Really, from the standpoint of process, I hope, one would really look at this. 
   The second point is, in terms of the Gregg amendment itself, we are concerned that it does not provide due process. What it would do is allow a preliminary finding from an agency other than the Department of Labor to stop an organization from running its jobs program. There would be no opportunity to appeal or to be heard. There would be an audit by the IG or GAO, which would then serve as a final determinant. Audits are meant to raise questions, not to be a final determination. So we would raise that as, really, a very serious question. 
   This amendment is not needed. Current law already prohibits using these funds for lobbying or litigation against the Government. These are in well-known, well-circulated OMB circulars. Also, our own legislation pending before the Senate already has pretty firm, strict, and clear accountability. It says if you don't meet the standards, you lose all or part of your grant. And then those funds not used, because you have lost them, will be able to be competed for by other national organizations. This is a process for recompeting funds of a State or nonprofit agency or organization that does not meet established performance standards. I believe the process will work, and we should not interfere with it. 
   We believe we do have very firm accountability in this legislation. These performance measures in this bill are simply this: If an organization or a State fails to meet these standards or improve its performance, other entities will get the opportunity to competitively bid for a portion or all of the organization's grant. We establish a minimum amount that must be spent on enrollee wages and fringe benefits. We clarify the way the organization must define and report their costs, so there is no room for ambiguity. We codify our own clear responsibility tests and have very firm criteria for granting eligibility. We require a broad planning process so the area of greatest need within a State is served as efficiently and as specifically as possible. These provisions will ensure seniors get the high-quality services they deserve, and taxpayers will get value for their dollar. 
   Also, know that in addition to what we have in this legislation, as I said, the Government already has Government-wide standards and procedures, applicable to the suspension and debarment of any Federal contractor and grant recipient. The NSCERC is currently engaged in an audit resolution process with DOL. All indications are that this process is working and we should not interfere with it. 
   Also, during the debate words were used such as ``slush fund,'' et cetera. I think that was a little harsh and inaccurate. Did the National Senior Citizens Education Research Center have problems? You bet. 
   The Department of Labor did an audit. They found that there was no malicious intent to defraud. There was no intent to be scum or scam. What they did was essentially have a certain program related to the HIP indemnity in the wrong category. 
   Do they owe the Federal Government some money? Yes. Is there discussion ongoing now about the most effective way to recapture that? Yes.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, the other point I want to make is we have  the accountability. This is a good program, and it is hard to administer. The Senior Community Service Employment Program is under title V. Do you know what it does? It helps old people of modest income find work. This is not easy. 
   This program itself serves the oldest and poorest in our society. Forty-one percent are minorities, the highest minority participation of any Older Americans Act program. This primarily helps women. Seventy percent of them are women. They are old. They are poor. They are trying to add extra money to hold body, soul, and prescription drugs together. 
   At the same time, 83 percent are over 60; 36 percent do not have a high school education; 11 percent have disabilities. This is a very intensive hands-on program to operate. It takes a lot of help to get people ready for a job and a lot of professionalism to find the jobs for them. By all accounts, all of the grantees have met those criteria. 
   I could go through example after example in my own State, but I will give two. An 85-year-old woman is now a senior aide working as a library assistant for $7.17 an hour. Another 71-year-old female was employed as a customer service rep of one of our Maryland agencies because she had good manners and a good work ethic, and therefore they taught her the skills to earn some extra money. These are the kinds of people this program helps. 
   Many of the nonprofits that operate these programs operate with a very low margin. This is a very cost-intensive and labor-intensive program to operate. I hope we defeat the Gregg amendment because: First, it is not necessary. We have good, tight accountability requirements in the bill and responsibility. Second, it will kill the bill. And third, we do not need to add more bureaucracy, more shackles, more audits, more paperwork just because we are cranky with one organization. Let's give them the chance to meet the responsibilities established by the Department of Labor and pay the money back, and let's renew the Older Americans Act and leave this Senate with our heads held high that we defied the laws of inertia in this institution and reauthorized the Older Americans Act. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of Senate passage of the bipartisan Older Americans Act--OAA Amendments of 2000--H.R.  782. This bill passed the House yesterday with the overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of 405-2. The Senate companion bill S. 1536 has 72 cosponsors. H.R. 782 is a bipartisan, bicameral agreement to reauthorize the OAA. It is built on the strong foundation of S. 1536 and the bipartisan compromises reached by the HELP Committee in that bill. It also has the overwhelming support of the aging community. H.R. 782 is well worthy of your support. 
   This bill long overdue. It keeps our promise to older Americans to retain and strengthen current OAA programs, but is also provides new innovations and accountability to further improve the Act. It will ensure that the Older Americans Act continues to meet the day-to-day needs of our country's older Americans and the long range needs of our aging population. 
   The highlight of this bill is the creation of the national Family Caregiver Support Program. This program will provide respite care, training, counseling, support services, information and assistance to some of the millions of Americans who care for older individuals and adult children with disabilities. it also will help grandparents who care for grandchildren. This program has strong bipartisan support, will get behind our nation's families, and give help to those who practice self-helped. 
   Today our families are the backbone of the long term care system in this country. Currently about 12.8 million adults need assistance from others to carry out activities of daily living, such as bathing and feeding. By 2030 there will be about 21 million people over the age of 70 needing care. More than half of the elderly that do not currently receive help do not expect to have help in the future. 
   One in four adults currently provides care for an adult with a chronic health condition. The economic impact of caregiving is staggering. A recent study found that on average, workers who take care of older relatives lose $659,139 in wages, pension benefits, and Social Security over a lifetime. Further, it is estimated that the national economic value of informal caregiving was $196 billion in 1997. 
   Many of us have personally cared for sick or aging parents or other relatives and understand firsthand the strains and stresses facing caregivers. We know that adult children are most often the providers of care for seniors. This is the sandwich generation with moms and dads caring for their own children and their own parents. They have full-time jobs at the office and then they come home to full time jobs of caring for other family members. 
   My sisters and I cared for my mother when she was ill. We were fortunate. We all lived relatively close to my mother and could share caregiving responsibilities. But may families may be scattered across the country and find it more difficult to ensure that older members of their family are cared for properly. In addition, as our population ages, many people are living longer. We now see 80-year-old spouses caring for each other. We can see 70-year-old daughter caring for her 90-year-old mother. 
   The National Family Caregiver Support Program will help caregivers across the country care for their older relatives, grandparents care for grandchildren, and older individuals care for adult children with disabilities. It is a vital new innovation in this bill. It will meet the day-to-day needs of countless families across the country. We must pass this bill to create this program to help families. 
   When many Americans think of how the Federal Government helps our country's older Americans, they think of Social Security and Medicare. But what many Americans do not realize is the vital role that the Older Americans Act plays in meeting the day-to-day needs of seniors in this country. In this bill we maintain core programs in this Act that help our seniors. 
   Some of the most well known OAA programs are congregate and 
   home-delivered meals. OAA provides about 240 million meals to over 3 million older persons. About half of these meals are provided in congregate settings and the other half are provided to frail older persons in their homes. These meal programs are vital to seniors. 
   A national evaluation of the nutrition program shows that, compared to the total elderly population, nutrition program participants are older and more likely to be poor, to live alone, and to be members of minority groups. The report found that the program plays an important role in the participants' overall nutrition and that these meals are the primary source of daily nutrients for these seniors. For every Federal dollar spent, the program leverages on average $1.70 for congregate meals, and $3.35 for home-delivered meals. A hot lunch at a senior center could be the only hot meal some seniors get each day. 
   Congregate meals also provide an opportunity for seniors to get out of their homes and socialize with other older persons in their community. After a meal, seniors may stay on for other activities. A meal can lead to a spirited game of bingo, ping-pong, pool, a dance class, or an exercise class. These kinds of activities keep older Americans more active and engaged which can help them live longer and live better. Home-delivered meals allow the frail elderly to enjoy a nutritious hot meal in the comfort of their own home. It can help keep seniors in their own home rather than having to live in an institution. 
   We also maintain important protective services for seniors such as legal assistance, the long-term care ombudsman, and elder abuse prevention activities. Legal assistance helps seniors with everything from writing a will to guardianship issues to assistance with housing to accessing Social Security benefits. 
   The long-term care ombudsman is the only OAA program that focuses solely on the needs of institutionalized persons. A senior in a nursing home or that senior's family can contact a local long-term care ombudsman if they are concerned about the quality of care their family member is receiving in a nursing home. The ombudsman is a neutral third party that investigates and helps resolve complaints about quality of care. This is an invaluable resource for seniors to help ensure that they get the best care possible. 
   The Act also provides for elder abuse prevention programs. OAA helps coordinate elder abuse prevention programs and combat crimes against seniors. It helps train professionals who serve seniors to help them better recognize signs of abuse and help seniors who are victims of abuse. OAA helps increase public awareness about elder abuse both among seniors and in the community at large. 
   We keep innovation and new ideas flowing by maintaining a separate and distinct Title IV for Research and Demonstration Projects, which is where innovative programs like the eldercare locator got started. We recognize the importance of the White House Conference on Aging to the aging community, and require the President to call such a conference before the end of 2005. Past White House conferences have brought forth innovative new ideas and created new programs to better serve seniors. 
   We maintain strong support for transportation services, which are critically important to seniors in our rural areas. I know this can be especially important in areas like Western Maryland and the Eastern Shore where seniors may have to travel further to the grocery store or a doctor's appointment or to their nearest senior center. And we retain core provisions of the law, like minority targeting language. That language ensures that OAA services are directed to those who need them the most. However, we acknowledge that unmet need can exist in rural areas, so we have included provisions to help improve the delivery of services to older individuals in rural areas. 
   At the same time, we recognize the need to strengthen certain programs in the Act and increase accountability. We have focused efforts on strengthening accountability and improving the Senior Community 
   Service Employment Program or title V. 
   This program provides part-time community service jobs to low-income seniors. It gives them a steady source of income that they need for rent, groceries, medical care, and utilities. Most of the seniors participating in the program are older women whose work histories include working in the home, domestic work, caring for their children and grandchildren, or part-time unskilled employment. Many have not finished high school. Few have pensions, and Social Security or supplemental security income may be the  only source of income for the majority of participants. They count on their check from this program to pay their bills. 
   Seniors also receive valuable training and skills that enable them to get unsubsidized jobs in the public and private sectors. This is especially important in today's right labor market. Increasingly, employers are looking to older workers to fill jobs traditionally not held by older Americans. 
   Title V also gives something back to communities. Seniors in this program serve meals in senior centers and drive the vans to help seniors get to their local senior center for a hot lunch. They work in schools and hospitals and day care centers. They make a difference in their communities and their work does not go unnoticed. 
   We have taken a number of steps to increase accountability. We establish performance measures. If an organization or a state fails to meet these standards and improve its performance, other entities will get the opportunity to competitively bid for a portion or all of the original organization or entity's grant. We establish a minimum amount that must be spent on enrollee wages and fringe benefits. We clarify the way organizations must define and report their costs so that there is no room for ambiguity. We codify responsibility tests and new criteria for grantee eligibility. We require a broad and open planning process so that areas of greatest need within a State are served as efficiently as possible. 
   While I believe that overall the current grantees are performing very well, these provisions will help ensure that seniors get the high quality services they deserve. They also strengthen the entire SCSEP program and do not target one particular grantee. 
   This bill strikes a good balance between recognizing the need for additional resources to support OAA programs and protecting the most vulnerable seniors and their access to services. It specifically authorizes seniors to make voluntary contributions--donations--for all OAA services. The bill also allows states to require cost-sharing for a limited number of services such as transportation, respite care, and personal care. A long list of services is exempt from cost sharing, such as the meals program, information and assistance, and ombudsman. It also provides guidance to states and protections to help ensure that seniors are not discouraged from seeking services because of cost-sharing. 
   I also want to note the strong need for increased funding for Older Americans Act programs. Very few OAA programs have seen increased funding in recent years, yet there is a growing need for services. I strongly support full funding of the new National Family Caregiver Support Program, but other OAA programs must also receive needed increases in funding. I strongly urge my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee and in the Senate leadership to do as much as possible to increase funding for these valuable programs in the final days of this Congress and in the future. I look forward to working with you to do that. 
   I want to thank Senator DEWINE, Chairman of the Aging Subcommittee, for his sincere dedication to reauthorizing the OAA and willingness to work in a bipartisan manner to accomplish this. Thank you to Senator JEFFORDS for his strong leadership in moving this bill through the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee and all the way through until enactment. Senator KENNEDY also deserves credit for this bill--he continues to be a tireless advocate for the OAA and the people it serves. I want to thank the Senate staff that have worked so hard on this legislation: Sean Donohue, Hollis Turnham, Karla Carpenter, Jeff Teitz, Abby Brandel, and Rhonda Richards. I can not think of any better way to celebrate the 35th anniversary of the OAA in 2000 than by enacting this long-awaited bipartisan reauthorization of the Older Americans Act.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the VA-HUD conference report and I urge my colleagues to do the same. 
   I want my colleagues to know that this conference report is the exact same bill that was passed in the Senate last week. 
   It has come back to the Senate in the form of a conference report, which includes report language in the statement of the managers. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote for this measure to give our veterans the health care and benefits they deserve, to provide housing for families of modest income, and to protect our environment. 
   First, I am especially pleased that we were able to provide a significant increase in funding for veterans health care. We met the President's request of $20.2 billion and are $1.4 billion above last year's level. 
   We were also able to provide $351 million for medical and prosthetic research. This is $30 million above the budget request and last year's level. 
   The VA plays a major role in medical research for the special needs of our veterans, such as geriatrics, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and orthopedic research. 
   We are also providing $100 million in funding for State veterans homes. This is $40 million above the budget request and $10 million above last year's level. 
   I am also very pleased that we were able to include a new title in our bill that will provide medical care and veterans benefits to Filipino veterans who fought alongside Americans in World War II and who live in the United States. 
   Finally, our Filipino-American veterans will receive equal benefits for equal valor. 
   Our bill provides almost $13 billion to renew all expiring section 8 housing vouchers. We have included $453 million in funding to issue 79,000 new vouchers to help working families find affordable housing. 
   Unfortunately, we were forced to drop Senator BOND's housing production bill due to objections from the authorizing committee, but I hope we will revisit the issue next year. 
   We were also able to maintain level funding for other critical core HUD programs. 
   We provided $779 million for housing for the elderly, which meets the President's request and is $69 million more than last year. This includes funds for assisted living and service coordinators. 
   We also provided $217 million in funding for housing for disabled Americans, which is $7 million above the President's request and $23 million over last year's level. 
   We were able to provide both the Community Development Block Grant Program and the HOME Program with $150 million increases over the President's request. CDBG is funded at more than $5 billion, and HOME is funded at $1.8 billion. The CDBG program is one of the most important programs for rebuilding our cities and neighborhoods. 
   We also provided increased funding to help our neighborhoods and communities through the Hope VI Program. This year, we provided $575 million for Hope VI, the same as last year's level. 
   I am pleased that we were able to provide funding for other programs that help America's communities. We increased funding for empowerment zones by providing $90 million in this bill for urban and rural empowerment. 
   We also help homeowners by extending the FHA downpayment simplification program for 25 months. 
   I am extremely pleased that our bill fully funds NASA at $14.3 billion, an increase of $250 million above the President's request. 
   All of NASA's core programs are fully funded and all NASA centers are fully funded, including the Goddard Space Flight Center in my home State of Maryland. 
   The VA-HUD bill includes $1.5 billion for Earth science and more than $2.5 billion for space science. 
   It includes $20 million to start an exciting new program called ``living with a star,'' which will study the relationship between the Sun and the Earth and its impact on our environment and our climate. I am especially proud that this program will be headquartered at the Goddard Space Flight Center. 
   And, of course, we fully fund the space shuttle upgrades, space station  construction, and the new ``space launch initiative'' to find new, low-cost launch vehicles that will reduce the cost of getting to space. 
   The VA-HUD manager's amendment also increases funding for the Corporation for National Service. The corporation is funded at $458 million, a $25 million increase over last year's level. The Corporation for National Service has enrolled over 100,000 members and participants across the country. 
   As many of my colleagues know, I have been very concerned about the digital divide in this country. I introduced legislation called the Digital Empowerment Act to provide a one-stop shop and increased funds to local communities trying to cross the digital divide. I am pleased that this bill contains $25 million within the national service budget to create an ``e-corps'' of volunteers by training and mentoring children, teachers, and non-profit and community center staff on how to use computers and information technology. 
   With regard to the EPA, our bill provides $7.8 billion in funding. All together, this is an increase of $400 million over last year's level and $686 million more than the President's request. 
   We increased funding by $246 million for EPA's core environmental programs. 
   We also provided an additional $550 million for the clean water state revolving fund. 
   Taking care of the infrastructure needs of local communities has always been a priority for the VA-HUD Subcommittee. 
   A number of my colleagues have raised concerns about some environmental provisions in the bill. 
   I will address these topics in more detail later. But let me say that the administration helped negotiate these provisions and the administration supports them. They do not threaten the environment and they maintain EPA's authority and flexibility. 
   A am a strong supporter of FEMA and am proud that we have provided $937 million in funding for FEMA, plus an additional $1.3 billion in emergency disaster relief funding. 
   The National Science Foundation is funded at $4.43 billion, a $529 million increase over last year's enacted level and one of the largest increases in NSF's history. This is a downpayment toward our goal of doubling the NSF budget over the next five years. 
   I am especially pleased that we were able to provide $150 million for the new nanotechnology initiative. 
   Mr. President, I once again appreciate the cooperation of my colleagues throughout this process. While I regret that this year's process was highly irregular, I am pleased that we worked together to bring a conference agreement to the Senate floor. I believe this year's VA-HUD bill is good for our country, our veterans, and our communities. 
   To reiterate, Mr. President, I rise in support of the VA-HUD conference report and urge my colleagues to do the same. As I said, this conference report is the exact same bill we passed last week. It has come back to the Senate in the form of a conference report and includes the report language contained in the Statement of Managers. 
   That is kind of inside baseball, but what I want people to know is, this is the same bill we voted on, so there does not need to be extensive debate. What is not inside baseball, and it is how we played the game, is that we played it very fairly. We tried to both exercise a great deal of fiscal prudence while looking out for the day-to-day needs of our constituents and the long-range needs of our country. 
   Our appropriation--the VA-HUD, EPA, National Federal Emergency Management, space program, National Science Foundation, and 22 other agencies--had the least increase, the least gross increase, of any other subcommittee to come before the Senate. I tell my colleagues who believe in fiscal discipline, have worked for fiscal discipline, and have voted for fiscal discipline, that they need not fear voting for the VA-HUD-other agencies appropriations. 
   Throughout our entire deliberation on moving this bill, we wanted to have legislation that could both meet the responsibilities of fiscal stewardship as well as meet the needs. I believe we did do it. Sure, there are increases, but it costs more to do what we do. One of the major areas where it costs us more to do what we do is in veterans health care. 
   Health care is on the rise everywhere. It costs money to have the best nurses in America working for our veterans. It costs money to be able to have primary care facilities. It costs money to provide a prescription drug benefit. The cost our veterans gave in their service to America is far greater than any monetary spending we can do to ensure they get the health care they need. 
   That is why we do have increases. We have increased veterans health care. We have ensured the benefits that they deserve. At the same time, we have worked very hard to provide housing for people of modest income. We have an increase in section 8 vouchers. 
   What does that mean? It means there are Federal funds to enable the working poor to be able to have a subsidy for housing. If you have gotten off welfare, we make work worth it by making sure that if you are working and you can't afford to live and pay for the housing that you need, there will be this modest subsidy. 
   We are also doing housing for the elderly. Like it or not, America is getting older. Like it or not, we need housing for the elderly, and we also bring some innovations to it. Those need to be project based. 
   My esteemed Republican colleague and I don't believe vouchers work for the elderly. We don't believe if you have a wheelchair or a walker, we should give you a little voucher while you forage for housing in your neighborhood. We met those needs. 
   We have also protected the environment. We have encouraged voluntarism, and we have also made major public investments in science and technology. Why did we do that? Because we want to be sure America is working in this century. 
   These major investments in science and technology are to generate the new ideas that are going to give us the new jobs 
   for the new economy. 
   We believe we bring to the Senate a bill that really does represent what America wants--yes, fiscal stewardship, but promises made, promises kept to those who served the country in the U.S. military through its benefits, to make work worth it, and make sure we have a helping hand for those who are out there working every day and have moved from welfare to work, to protect our environment, encourage voluntarism, and come up with the science and technology for the new ideas, for the new jobs. 
   I encourage my colleagues to vote for this bill. 
   I again thank my colleague. There has been much made about bipartisan cooperation. We saw it in the debates. We see it in the ads, and so on. I can tell my colleagues, I saw it in the Subcommittee on VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies. I thank my colleague, Senator BOND, for his cordial and collegial support. I thank the members of the subcommittee on both sides of the aisle. It really worked for us. Quite frankly, I believe if the rest of the Senate is working in the cooperative way we work, when all is said and done, more will get done. 
   I yield the floor.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, it has been more than a year since the Columbine tragedy, but still this Republican Congress refuses to act on sensible gun legislation. 
   Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. Until we act, Democrats in the Senate will read the names of some of those who have lost their lives to gun violence in the past year, and we will continue to do so every day that the Senate is in session. 
   In the name of those who died, we will continue this fight. Following are the names of some of the people who were killed by gunfire one year ago today. 
   October 19, 1999: 
   Jerry G. Bowens, 25, Memphis, TN; 
   Nathaniel Bryan, 20, Washington, DC; 
   Wayne Butts, 43, Atlanta, GA; 
   Arnold Handy, 19, Baltimore, MD; 
   Paul Johnson, 31, New Orleans, LA; 
   Russell Manning, 52, Dallas, TX; 
   Rebecca Rando, 25, Houston, TX; 
   Mark Smith, 31, Dallas, TX; 
   Kirk Tucker, 32, Chicago, IL; 
   Jermaine Wallace, 22, Baltimore, MD; and 
   George Williams, 19, Pittsburgh, PA. 
   We cannot sit back and allow such senseless gun violence to continue. The deaths of these people are a reminder to all of us that we need to enact sensible gun legislation now.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I begin by thanking my colleague, Senator BOND, as well as our colleagues Senator BYRD and Senator STEVENS, for enabling us to move our bill forward. I particularly express my appreciation to Senator BOND for his collegial and civil way of including me in all discussions related to both the funding and policy that we developed in this bill. His courtesy and collegiality are very much appreciated. 
   I believe today the bill we present takes care of national needs and national interests. I am also confident that it will be signed by President Bill Clinton because it takes care of the day-to-day needs of the American people and at the same time looks forward to helping with the long-range needs of our country to remain competitive and on the cutting edge of science. 
   This bill has always been to me about five things: meeting our obligations to our veterans--promises made, promises kept; investing in our neighborhoods and our communities promoting self-help; creating real opportunities for people to move from welfare to work, to make sure that public housing is not a way of life but a way to a better life; and, of course, advancing science and technology, the new ideas that lead to the new jobs and the new products. It is also about protecting consumers from fraud and scams and communities from floods and disasters. 
   I believe we meet the goals in this bill, and we have done it in a fiscally prudent way. While I support the bill, the process has left much to be desired; again no fault of Chairman BOND but really the Senate has placed us in a very awkward situation. 
   The bill before the Senate today is a managers' substitute for the Senate bill. This is effectively our conference report. We did not have a conference report, though we met. We had kind of a chatroom where we would meet and try to iron out our differences. We did. It also involved OMB and the White House for consultation. We wanted to be sure both sides of the aisle would support the bill. We also wanted to be sure that the President would sign the bill. I believe we achieved this. 
   I say to my colleagues, it will be absolutely crucial, in order to move this bill with this unique parliamentary situation, to have no amendments to this legislation. My colleague from California, Senator BOXER, will offer two amendments. I am going to oppose them. I am going to oppose them both on procedural and substantive grounds. On procedure, if the Boxer amendments prevail, we will have enormous difficulty reconvening and working with the House to pass this bill. I just put that out. 
   Though we had an unofficial conference, I do believe we were able to move forward. Senator BOND has outlined in detail what we were able to do financially. I am so glad we worked together on a bipartisan basis, particularly in the area of veterans health care, joining hands, scrutinizing the budget and then the appropriations to make sure that veterans health care will be funded $1.4 billion over last year's level. 
   We also want to look ahead to be sure, while we are taking care of the men and women who bear the permanent wounds of war, we do the medical research, to find the cures for those things affecting our veterans population. This legislation provides $350 million for medical and prosthetic research, $30 million over last year. I have seen the work at my own University of Maryland and know that people will live longer, live better, and recover more quickly because of the funding for veterans health care research which also goes into the civilian population. 
   Also, we have added more money, $100 million, for State veterans homes. This is to provide long-term care and rehabilitation, which is very crucial. It  means the Federal Government does not bear the sole burden, the State governments do not bear the sole burden, and, most of all, our veterans do not bear the sole burden. This unique Federal-State partnership will meet the long term and rehab needs of our veterans. 
   In addition, we have paid attention to the day-to-day needs of our constituents in Housing and Urban Development. 
   We want to make sure the people of the United States of America, who are out there working every day but who are also part of the working poor, have help with housing. We have been able to create 79,000 new vouchers to help working families find affordable housing. Unfortunately, we do not have enough housing to meet their needs. 
   Senator BOND led a very vigorous effort, which I supported, as did the authorizers on my side, to start a production program. We were derailed from that, but we did not want to be detoured from the bill, so we put that aside for another year. But we really call out to our authorizers, please, pass a production bill that will generate jobs in construction and meet the needs of our citizens. 
   Where I think we also worked very closely together is in helping the elderly and disabled. We have provided $780 million for housing for the elderly. It is more than last year. It also helps with assisted living and service coordinators to be able to help people keep as independent as long as they can, and to even develop new models of care. 
   At the same time, we looked out for those who are disabled and the special AIDS population. But we wanted to also remember not only the ``H,'' which is housing, we wanted the part called urban development. But we also know so many of our constituents live in rural areas. So we looked to see how we could increase the ability for local decisionmaking. That is why we funded community development block grant money and a program called HOME at much more than last year, because it goes right to cities, communities, and neighborhoods. Whether you are in a small rural town in Missouri or a big city such as Baltimore, community development block grant money and HOME will be of great help to you. 
   But we are about promoting self-help. That is why we continued to stay the course in providing funds for empowerment zones, again recognizing rural needs and also promoting home ownership. That is why we help the homeowners by extending the FHA downpayment simplification program for another 25 months. So we looked at how we could create opportunities at the local level. 
   Another area where we have strong bipartisan support within the committee and by its chairman and ranking member is to make sure that America continues to lead the way in science and technology. Therefore, I am so pleased that we are funding the National Space Agency at $14.3 billion, $250 million above the President's request. Quite frankly, I think NASA needs a lot more because they have been severely cut over the years, but fiscal prudence won. At the same time, we wanted to make sure that we were fiscally prudent, that our shuttle will be safe, our space station will be ready, and that we will move ahead on a vigorous space science program, such as the Living With A Star Program that will be done at Goddard Space Flight Center in my own community. 
   The National Science Foundation is also a very important, crucial program. The national science program, as Senator BOND has said, really does promote the basic research that goes into our country. It has been a star. It has been almost flat-lined for several years while we tried to balance the budget. This is why this year they will receive a $520 million increase over last year's enacted level. 
   One of the areas which we will be also advocating is a field called nanotechnology. You have heard of a nanosecond. 
   It is because it is small. But let me tell you, the nanotechnology is the next generation past this infotechnology. You have seen the biotech revolution and the infotech revolution, but wait until the nanotech research gets underway. We are going to have new products, new materials. We are going to be able to have a supercomputer the size of my ring. 
   We will be able to take little pills, that will literally have diagnostic equipment, that will be able to go through our bodies, giving immediate responses to our physicians. This is going to be extraordinary. I am so pleased to be part of what we are doing. 
   At the same time, we want to call forth young people to continue the call for service. That is why I am so pleased we continued to stay the course on national service, with a modest increase. 
   One of the things we have done in national service is add something called E-Corps. As many of my colleagues know, I have been a strong proponent to make sure we do not have a digital divide in this country, meaning that young people have access to technology and access to know how to use technology. What we are creating in this legislation is having E-Corps volunteers to train and mentor not only the children but community leaders and librarians and others who will be teaching our children. 
   Last, but not at all least, we joined hands to protect the environment. We have increased funds for the environment, whether it is the clean water revolving fund, small watershed programs to restore rivers and streams, or having full funding of the Chesapeake Bay program. I believe the environment will be stronger and better protected by the resources that we have put in this bill. 
   Now, yes, there are riders. I don't go for riders. None of us go for riders. But we were in a very difficult situation with the bill. We took the language that was being proposed by the House, working with the office of OMB--the President's own--and the Council on Environmental Quality that advises the President on the environment. They were in the room to help us really identify the appropriate language that could meet the policy objectives of those who advocated it without shackling EPA or hurting communities. 
   I will say more about that during the debate. But I will tell you, regardless of how you feel about the riders, they were acceptable to the President's Council on Environmental Quality. 
   To be more specific, Mr. President, I am especially pleased that we were able to provide a significant increase in funding for veterans health care. We met the President's request of $20.2 billion and are $1.4 billion above last year's level. This will help us ensure that promises made to our veterans are promises kept, and that our veterans get the health care to which they are entitled. 
   We were also able to provide $351 million for medical and prosthetic research. This is $30 million above the budget request and last year's level. 
   The VA plays a major role in medical research for the special needs of our veterans, such as: geriatrics, Alzheimers, Parkinson's, and orthopedic research. Our veterans are not the only ones who benefit from this research--our entire nation does, especially as America's population continues to age. 
   We are also providing $100 million in funding for state veterans homes. This is $40 million above the budget request and $10 million above last year's level. The state homes serve as long-term care and rehabilitation facilities for our veterans. 
   We were also able to provide over $1.6 billion for the Veterans Benefits Administration, which will help them administer benefits to our veterans more quickly. 
   I am also very pleased that we were able to include a new title in our bill that will provide benefits to Filipino veterans who fought alongside Americans in World War II and who live in the United States. 
   Finally, our Filipino-American veterans will receive equal benefits for equal valor. 
   We were able to take care of America's working families in this bill as well, by funding housing programs that millions of Americans depend upon. 
   Our bill provides almost $13 billion to review all expiring section 8 housing vouchers. And we have included $453 million in funding to issue 79,000 new vouchers, to help working families find affordable housing. This is 19,000 more than we were able to fund last year. 
   We included provisions to make it easier for public housing authorities to provide more project-based assistance to increase the stock of affordable housing, instead of just vouchers.  
   As many of my colleagues were aware, a production bill was under serious consideration during the conference. It was a modified version of Senator BOND's housing production bill that was included in the original Senate bill. Unfortunately, we were forced to drop this provision due to objections from the authorizing committee, but I hope we will re-visit the issue next year. We were also able to maintain level funding for other critical core HUD programs. 
   We provided $779 million for housing for the elderly, which meets the President's request and is $69 million more than last year. This includes funds for assisted living and service coordinators. We also provided $217 million in funding for housing for disabled Americans, 
   which is $7 million above the President's request and $23 million over last year's level. 
   Homeless assistance grants received a $5 million increase and are funded at $1.025 billion. 
   We were able to provide both the Community Development Block Grant Program and the HOME Program with $150 million increases. CDBG is funded at more than $5 billion, and HOME is funded at $1.8 billion. The CDBG Program is one of the most important programs for rebuilding our cities and neighborhoods. 
   We also provided increased funding to help our neighborhoods and communities through the HOPE VI Program, which helps demolish and then revitalize distressed public housing sites. This year, we provided $575 million for HOPE VI, the same as last year's level. 
   I am pleased that we were able to provide funding for other programs that help America's communities. We increased funding for empowerment zones by providing $90 million in this bill and increased funding for CDFI--Community Development Financial Institutions Fund. 
   Funding for empowerment zones will help designated areas with economic development and social services. Community involvement in the empowerment zone initiative will prove especially beneficial. 
   We also help homeowners by extending the FHA downpayment simplification program for 25 months. 
   As I said, I am extremely pleased that our bill fully funds NASA at $14.3 billion, an increase of $250 million. This funding exceeds the President's request for NASA. All of NASA's core programs are fully funded and all of our centers are fully funded, including the Goddard Space Flight Center in my home State of Maryland. 
   The VA-HUD bill includes $1.5 billion for Earth science, more than $2.5 billion for space science, including funding for the Mars polar lander, and $20 million to start an exciting new program called ``Living With A Star,'' which will study the relationship between the sun and the Earth and its impact on our environment and our climate. It will help us predict and protect against solar storms that can disrupt our energy and communications systems. 
   I am especially proud that this program will be headquartered at the Goddard Space Flight Center. 
   NASA science programs are critical not just for science, but for technology. With NASA technology, we can create new jobs and literally save lives, while developing a greater understanding of how our universe works. 
   I fought hard to make sure that this funding was included in this manager's amendment. 
   And, of course, in the area of human space flight, we fully fund the space shuttle upgrades, space station construction, and fully fund the new ``Space Launch Initiative'' to find new, low-cost launch vehicles that will reduce the cost of getting to space. 
   The VA-HUD manager's amendment also increases funding for the Corporation for National Service. 
   The House bill cut funding for the Corporation for National Service, but I made it a priority to restore it in the Senate bill and in conference. 
   The corporation is funded at $458 million, a $25 million increase over last year's level. 
   The Corporation for National Service has enrolled over 100,000 members and participants across the country, in a wide array of community service programs, including: AmeriCorps, a national service program that helps communities, learn and serve America, which supports service-learning programs across the country by providing funding and training, and the National Senior Service Corps, which helps seniors get involved in their communities. 
   As many of my colleagues know, I have been very concerned about the digital divide in this country. 
   I introduced legislation called the Digital Empowerment Act to provide a one-stop shop and increased funds to local communities trying to cross the digital divide. 
   I am pleased that this bill contains $25 million within the national service budget to create an ``E-Corps'' of volunteers who will bring technology skills to people who have been left out or left behind in the digital economy, by training and mentoring children, teachers, and non-profit and community center staff on how to use computers and information technology. 
   With regard to the EPA, our bill provides $7.8 billion in funding, plus an additional $138 million for the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, ATSDR, and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, NIEHS. 
   All together, this is an increase of $400 million over last year's level, and $686 million more than the President's request. 
   We increased funding by $246 million for EPA's core environmental programs, including a $38 million increase for nonpoint source pollution control grants, and a $20 million increase for the climate change technology initiative. 
   We also provided an additional $550 million for the clean water state revolving fund. Taking care of the infrastructure needs of local communities has always been a priority for the VA-HUD Subcommittee. 
   We have fully funded the Chesapeake Bay, Great Lakes, and Long Island Sound Programs, and provided $1.25 million for the Chesapeake by small watershed grants program, a $500,000 increase over last year's level, that will help our small communities around the Bay watershed prevent runoff and pollution. 
   Legislatively, the bill includes the FY 1999 bill and report language regarding the Kyoto Protocol, provides up to an additional 6 months for finalizing the arsenic-in-drinking-water rule, and includes a weaker version of the Collins-Linder provision on ozone. 
   There is no language on the diesel sulfur rule. However modified report language has been included regarding dredging and invasive remediation. 
   I am a strong supporter of FEMA, and am proud that we have provided $937 million in funding for FEMA, plus an additional $1.3 billion in emergency disaster relief funding. 
   The National Science Foundation is funded at $4.43 billion, a $529 million increase over last year's enacted level, and one of the largest increases in NSF's history. 
   This funding level will keep America at the forefront of science and technology into the next century in info-tech and bio-tech, and is an important step towards holding onto America's science and technology base. 
   This is a downpayment toward our goal of doubling the NSF budget over the next five years. 
   I am especially pleased that we were able to provide $150 million for the new nanotechnology initiative. We were also able to provide $215 million for information technology, and well-deserved increases for several of NSF's education and human resources accounts. These include a $10 million increase over the budget request for informal science education, nearly $20 million for graduate fellowships in K-12 education, and over $55 million for graduate research fellowships. 
   Mr. President, I once again appreciate the cooperation of my colleagues throughout this process. While I regret that this year's process was highly irregular, I am pleased that we worked together to bring a conference agreement to the Senate floor. I believe this year's VA/HUD bill is good for our country, our veterans, and our communities. 
   Mr. President, before I conclude my statement, I really want to thank Senator BOND and his staff, Jon Kamarck, Cheh Kim, and Carolyn Apostolou, for all the work they did, and also my own staff, Paul Carliner, Sean Smith, and Alexa Mitrakos, for helping us really move this bill, and, most of all, to move America forward.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I oppose the Boxer amendment on arsenic in drinking water, and I urge my colleagues to vote against it. 
   This amendment is not needed, and its adoption will effectively kill this bill. 
   Let me be clear about what we did. 
   In our negotiations with the House, bill language was added that allows EPA to take until June 22, 2001 to issue a final rule setting the allowable level of arsenic in drinking water. 
   EPA remains free to issue the final rule anytime up to June 22, 2001. 
   This provision was carefully negotiated with the administration. 
   It does not prevent, prohibit or restrict EPA's ability to issue a final rule for arsenic in drinking water. 
   Since EPA missed the deadline for proposal of this rule, this extension from the current January 1, 2001 statutory deadline would allow EPA the same length of time--12 months--to consider public comments as contemplated in the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1996. 
   This provision is fully consistent with the Safe Drinking Water Act. 
   Our provision maintains all of the protections for public health and safety. 
   If it didn't, I would not support it. 
   This is not a debate about arsenic in drinking water. 
   We all agree that arsenic in drinking water should be reduced or eliminated consistent with science based public health standards. 
   This is a disagreement over process, not substance. 
   Let me be very clear, the language contained in the VA/HUD bill is permissive and does not prevent EPA from issuing the regulation earlier than June 2001 if EPA is prepared to promulgate the final rule. 
   Also, public interest groups would still be allowed to file suit next June if EPA misses the revised deadline--just as they can now. 
   No one's rights or privileges have been taken away. 
   Our provision on arsenic simply moves a date. It poses no threat to public health or the environment. 
   It is fully consistent with the Safe Drinking Water Act, and it maintains EPA's full authority. 
   I point out to my colleagues that this bill contains $825 million for the safe drinking water revolving loan program. 
   This is EPA's main program to upgrade and improve our Nation's public drinking water systems. 
   Overall, our bill provides $3.6 billion for all clean water programs--a $200 million increase over last year and, over $700 million more than the President's request. 
   If the Boxer amendment is adopted, it will kill this bill and jeopardize the funding increases for our clean water programs. 
   If this bill dies, there is no guarantee that we will be able to maintain our current level of funding. 
   The administration supports our provision, and I urge my colleagues to vote against the Boxer amendment. 
   Mr. President, I oppose the Boxer amendment on ozone nonattainment and I urge my colleagues to oppose it. 
   This amendment is not needed and should it pass, it will effectively kill this bill. 
   The administration supports the provision in our bill, and I urge my colleagues to support it and vote against this amendment. 
   Let me be clear about what the ozone nonattainment provision in the VA/HUD bill does. 
   The provision prohibits EPA from issuing new ozone nonattainment designations until June 15, 2001, or until the Supreme Court issues its ruling in this matter, whichever comes first. 
   The administration was involved in the negotiations over this provision and they support it. 
   I believe this provision is a matter of common sense. It makes no sense to issue new nonattainment designations, just to have the Supreme Court invalidate them. 
   That will do nothing more than confuse State and local governments and undercut EPA's authority and credibility. 
   I want to point out to my colleagues, that during our negotiations with the House, the language was modified to allow final designations to occur as soon as the U.S. Supreme Court rules on the ozone standard case, rather than waiting until June 15, 2001. 
   Depending on the Supreme Court's decision, this would potentially allow EPA to proceed with final designations several months earlier than under the original language. 
   This provision does not weaken the Clean Air Act, it does not threaten the Clean Air Act and, it does not undercut EPA's authority. 
   Our bill language does not preclude EPA from taking preparatory steps leading up to the final designations. 
   After the final designations are made, States have 3 years before they have to begin implementing their plans for achieving the new standard. 
   The additional time provided by this bill language, being tied to the Supreme Court process, minimizes any delay in moving forward with any clean air plans and acknowledges the uncertainty created by the ongoing litigation. 
   Our bill provides $209 million for State air assistance grants to help states meet Clean Air Act requirements. 
   If the Boxer amendment passes, the VA/HUD bill will be killed and funding levels that it contains will be in jeopardy. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote against the Boxer amendment and support the administration. 
   Mr. President, in summary, I oppose the Boxer amendments both on the issue of substance and procedure. No. 1, everybody complains about the process. Nobody complained about it more than BOND and MIKULSKI. We wanted to bring our bill to the floor, have a vote by the Senate, and go into a conference that was open and public. We were denied that. 
   Because we were worried about the homeless, because we were worried about veterans, because we were worried about the environment, we pressed on in a quasi-conference. BOND and MIKULSKI were united to delete the riders, but we lost. The House would not yield. 
   We then went to a fallback position because, again, we are worried about the homeless; we are worried about the veterans; we are worried about the environment and the National Service Corps, and all that is in this bill. When we negotiated, I invited into the room OMB--with the concurrence of my Republican colleagues--who brought in  the Council on Environmental Quality. The President's chief adviser on the environment was on the phone with the legal counsel at EPA. We did not make this up. 
   I thought I was proceeding on safe grounds because of the advice I received from the Council on Environmental Quality. I say to my Democratic colleagues: Do you believe in a letter from 21 groups or do you believe in President Clinton's Council on Environmental Quality? The choice is there. Do you believe the advocacy analysis or President Clinton's analysis? I go with President Clinton because I believe there is a track record on protecting the environment. 
   What about arsenic? It does not shackle anybody. It delays it by 6 months. Under the current law, EPA must give the regs by January 2001. They can issue them at any time up to 2001. EPA retains its authority and its flexibility to issue the regs any time, but it removes the old deadline. Why do we do this? So small rural communities can have time to get EPA information, cost, and other things they are going to need to comply. 
   Let's go to the ozone. That court case is before the Supreme Court of the United States. It is not going through some small court. It is in the Supreme Court. They are going to decide it in June. The Court term ends in June. This language will no longer apply once the Court issues its ruling. Also, the language becomes moot in 2001. 
   Why was this language added? To prevent EPA from making new attainment designations and then have the Supreme Court invalidate them. We are saying, let the Court act and move on. At the same time, EPA is allowed to go on with its own planning process. Once the Supreme Court acts, EPA is good to go. 
   We are not shackling anybody. We are not stymying anybody. I believe in each of these instances there is flexibility to meet the compelling needs of public health. If they did not have that, I would not have supported it. If President Clinton's own team did not tell me it was OK to do this, I would not have done it. 
   I stand on the advice we were given, and I believe the advice is accurate, responsible, and reliable. I urge my colleagues to defeat the Boxer amendments.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Boxer amendment and I urge my colleagues to vote against it. 
   This amendment will have to be disposed of by the House. It will not be accepted by the House and therefore will kill this bill. 
   I would like to explain to my colleagues how our bill addresses the issue of contaminated sediments, why I am opposed to the Boxer amendment and, why the administration is opposed to the Boxer amendment. 
   The Boxer amendment is not necessary and its passage would effectively kill this bill. 
   Let me explain what we do in our bill. 
   The final version of the VA/HUD bill will contain report language in the statement of the managers that prevents EPA from dredging any contaminated site that does not have an approved plan in place by October 1, 2000 until the National Academy of Sciences, NAS, has completed its study on this issue and EPA has reviewed it. 
   This language sunsets on June 30, 2001. The NAS is expected to release its report in December. With an EPA review, the delay would last probably no more than 120 days. 
   We have included some exceptions to this language that are very important and I want to outline them for my colleagues. 
   First, if a site has an approved dredging plan in place by October 1, 2000, the language does not apply. 
   Second, if dredging or dredging activity is already occurring at a site, the language does not apply. 
   Third, if a site has a voluntary agreement in place with a potentially responsible party, the language does not apply. 
   Fourth, if EPA determines that a site poses a threat to public health, the language does not apply. 
   These exceptions are very important and were carefully negotiated with the administration. 
   This was no small victory for us.  
   The House passed VA/HUD bill included report language that would have directed EPA not to initiate or order dredging or other invasive remediation technologies, until the NAS report was complete and required that the results be incorporated into the EPA decision making processes. 
   This more extreme language would have effectively frozen work at affected sites for an indefinite period of time. 
   During our negotiations with the House, we successfully modified the provision to remove the extreme language. 
   The report language that will be incorporated into the final version of the VA/HUD bill still leaves EPA with some discretion and does not mandate any solutions. 
   Our language also allows EPA to take comment on proposed remedial actions such as that for cleanup of the Hudson River. 
    Our language would also allow all cleanup plans to be finalized by a date certain--June 30, 2001--even if the NAS report has not been completed in a timely manner. 
   The NAS is expected to use their final report, no later than January 1, 2001, allowing the report to be properly considered by EPA while sites without final plans work on their drafts. 
   Mr. President, the administration supports our language and I urge my colleagues to vote against the Boxer amendment. 
   I wish to also respond to my colleague and friend, the Senator from California, by saying this: No. 1, neither Senator BOND nor I wanted the riders. The House insisted on the riders. So we attempted to remove the draconian substance of the riders and put in more procedural issues, more procedural safeguards. The Senator thinks we wimped out. We think we had a victory because of the draconian aspect. We fought off the dragons. 
   Also, I want to be clear to my colleagues, we are in a very unusual parliamentary procedure. If we pass this bill without any amendments, it will go immediately to the House and can go through a process of ratification and will be done. If any of these amendments pass, we will have to go into a parliamentary situation where the House will not accept this and, therefore, the bill will be dead. So I just lay that out for everyone to take into consideration. 
   So the funds for EPA, which are quite robust--matching, in many instances, the President's request--housing, as well as veterans, science and technology, and other consumer protection agencies such as the Consumer Product Safety Commission--I believe will be jeopardized. 
   Having said that, I don't want to make my argument on jeopardizing the bill. I want to address the concerns that my conscientious colleague has raised about jeopardizing the environment. 
   This bill prevents EPA from dredging at any site that does not have an approved dredging plan by October 1 until the National Academy of Sciences has completed its study and EPA has reviewed it. In the arsenic ozone debate we heard, the National Academy of Sciences elevated it to an icon status that said don't do anything on this rider because of what the National Academy of Sciences says. By the way, I think the Senator from California and I would agree that we do need the National Academy of Sciences. On the dredging issue, what we are saying is that the dredging sites cannot move ahead until the National Academy has completed its study and EPA has looked at it. Guess when the study is going to be done. December 2000 or January 2001. Any delay will be micro--90 to 120 days. Guess what. I say to my colleagues in the Senate, this is not permanent. It only takes this language to June 30, 2001. 
   This language has a sunset provision of June 30, 2001. 
   What are these exceptions? The main one is that if EPA believes any site poses a threat to public health, the language does not apply. 
   Let me repeat to anyone who thinks wisdom lies in Washington, with 21 advocacy groups, that if EPA believes the site poses a threat to public health, this language does not apply. 
   Also, if the site has a voluntary agreement in place, it doesn't apply. If dredging is already occurring at a site, the language does not apply. If you have your plan approved by October 1, the language does not apply. 
   We have so many ``doesn't applys'' here that I don't think the arguments made by the proponents of this amendment apply really in any way that has validity or attraction. 
   If you are worried about public health--I salute you for it--remember, it would not apply. 
   I join with my colleagues to say let the National Academy of Sciences complete its work. Let the EPA review it. Then it can move forth on all of this. If there is a delay, it would be 90 to 120 days. 
   That is basically what the argument is. 
   I hope the amendment offered by my colleague from California will be defeated. 
   How much time did I consume?

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, we are now in the concluding minutes of the debate. 
   First of all, on the three issues raised by the Senator from California, I want to say a couple of things. 
   No. 1, I am very proud of the Senate. When we moved our bill out of the full committee, we had no riders. We were not authorizing on appropriations. We had no riders, and we attempted to stand firm. Yes, we did face the dragons of the riders. What we ended up doing was not eliminating the dragons but we defang them. We defang the riders. We took the teeth out of them so they couldn't snarl up what this legislation is trying to do. 
   I believe the language we have adopted through the committee, through the managers' amendment, does have the riders. They are procedural. We acknowledge the flashing yellow light of the Senator from California with her terrible situation in California. We will do everything we can to make sure the Senator has that letter. I know it is not a substitute for the amendment. However, we want our colleagues to know the flashing yellow lights raised by the proponents are not valid. 
   Remember on the dredging, if the site has been approved by October 1, 2000, the language doesn't apply. If the dredging is already occurring, the language does not apply. If you have a voluntary agreement, the language does not apply. And if the EPA certifies that the site posed a threat to public health, the language does not apply. 
   I recommend the Boxer amendment does not apply to this bill and I urge its defeat. 
   I yield back the remaining time.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, as we conclude our debate on the VA-HUD bill, there are differences of opinion on these riders. I do hope they are rejected. If they are adopted, it will have a serious parliamentary and maybe even fiscal consequence. However, it is a democracy; people need to work their will. I am very proud of this bill because we do meet the needs of our veterans, those who fought the war over there so we could have peace here. I am very proud of what we have done in housing and urban economic development because what we want to do is create an opportunity ladder so people can make sure they have the opportunity for a better life, that there is local control in decisionmaking, strengthening communities whether they are in rural or urban America. 
   I am very proud of what we have done on the environment. We have funded clean air, clean water, safe drinking water, the ongoing efforts to clean up the Chesapeake Bay and many other bays around the United States of America. Also, in terms of science and technology, again, we have increased the funding so we can come up with the new ideas that ultimately will save lives, generate jobs, and save communities. That is what this bill is all about. 
   There are little known provisions, such as funding Arlington Cemetery where brave people who died in war are buried, and where Navy diver Stethem, my own Maryland resident who died as a result of an act of terrorism, is buried. He was on an airplane, and he wore the Navy uniform. They beat him up. This bill is a tribute to what people fight and die for around the country: That people will have a better life. 
   I yield the floor.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I know we are concluding. I express my thanks to Senator STEVENS and to Senator BYRD, who enabled us to move forward with this very unusual process, and for the assistance they gave us in dealing with severe budgetary allocations. 
   I also thank Senator BOND, as well as Congressman Walsh, for including the Democrats as full participants, and also the courtesy extended to members of the executive branch at OMB and also to the Council on Environmental Quality. 
   I also thank Senator BOND's staff for, again, their really close work in relationship with us and for the professionalism that was afforded. And I thank my own staff. While we worked on this bill, a lot of people were off enjoying themselves. They went home to dinner; they went to fundraisers; they played with their grandchildren; and we were out here working. That is our job. We were happy to do it. But after we would go home, the staff would work, often until 10, 11, 12 o'clock at night and through weekends. I thank them for their hard work. But, most of all, I know the American people thank them for their hard work. 
   Mr. President, that concludes my remarks.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. First, do not be deluded by the phrase ``sense of the Congress.'' This is not a free ride on the riders. There are consequences if this passes. It is a dangerous amendment. This amendment will then go to a formal conference. The House will not accept our decision. This bill will then die as so many other things are dying. It will die quickly, as a matter of fact. 
   Second, in terms of the consequences to policy, first of all, there are so many exceptions in this bill, one of which is that this language does not apply if EPA says the site poses a threat to public health. It does not apply if a voluntary agreement is in place, if dredging is already occurring in a site. If a site has an approved plan by October 1, 2000, it doesn't apply. 
   Guess what. It sunsets on June 30, 2000. Let's just sunset the amendment and move on.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I want to take 5 minutes at this time to speak on the events occurring in the world today. 
   I stand here with the melancholy that any Senator would feel as a result of the loss of lives of our U.S. military men and women due to a despicable act of terrorism. 
   I say to the terrorists: You underestimate the United States. Right now we are in an orderly constitutional process to begin the transition of the executive branch to a new leader. Do not think because we are beginning a transition that we are weak. 
   I say to the terrorists anywhere in the world: When any American is under attack, all Americans are under attack. We will check our party hats at the door. We will be united as one nation. I believe the Congress and the American people will stand as one behind President Clinton to aggressively pursue and punish the terrorists who have engaged in this despicable act. You might have gotten away with this one, but do not think again about the next hour, the next day, or the next week. The United States of America is coming after you, and we are all together on this. 
   In addition, to our friends in the Middle East: We are deeply troubled by the violence that is ongoing. A peace agreement was within reach. Indeed, it was fragile. We say now, please, take a timeout, end the violence, let's step back to see if we cannot come forward under the leadership of the United States as an honest broker to move ahead. We are plunging into chaos. Chaos only means further retreat. It means that maybe for years violence will continue. 
   We say: Please, Mr. Arafat, do not work behind the scenes; work on the front lines; end your violence. 
   To the people of Israel: We know that the first act is the act of self-defense. We understand that. It is human. Please, we ask restraint, and we ask all to come back to the bargaining table. Let's put down the stones. Let's put down the guns. Let's see if we can move forward. 
   I come back to what has occurred on the Senate floor today. I say to people  around the world: This is democracy. Good people who have been good friends differ. We can conduct ourselves with civility. We can have intellectual arguments. We can quote our lawyers and our National Academy of Sciences, and so on. Ultimately, the Congress will work its will. This is democracy. We invite the whole world to participate in it. War only leads to more war. Violence only leads to more violence. But democracy leads to more democracy, and democracy means ultimately peace and prosperity. 
   We invite the world: Please, constitutional governments, treaties, rules of law are what this 21st century should be all about.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I hope today the Senate will pass legislation to improve the lives of women in America and around the world and protect them from predators. 
   Make no mistake, when people commit crimes, they never commit crimes against people who are bigger, stronger, or have more power than they. They always go after the weak, the vulnerable. One can be weak either in physical strength or weak because one does not have the same size weapon. 
   Today we have two pieces of legislation pending: One, the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, and the other will break new ground to protect women and children who are bought and sold around the world as if they were commodities. They are victims of predatory behavior. 
   By passing this legislation, we are going to protect them. Women in their own homes are often victims of violence. Mr. President, 900,000 women last year were battered in their own homes. 
   The Violence Against Women Act says we will not tolerate violence, whether it is in the home, in the neighborhood, or on a street corner. 
   I thank Senator LEAHY and Senator BROWNBACK who have been working on this legislation, along with Senator JOE BIDEN. We appreciate the support and leadership of the good men here. 
   We want to be sure that through this legislation, we are going to not only prevent violence but help women rebuild their lives. The Violence Against Women Act works through domestic violence programs at the State level, works with law enforcement, and works in treatment programs for those who were the abusers. I hope we pass this legislation. 
   The second part is legislation that will also be a hallmark. It is the Sexual Trafficking Victims Protection Act. Girls as young as 10 years old are kidnapped from their villages and taken to brothels or sweatshops where they are imprisoned, forced to work as prostitutes, beaten, threatened, and even drugged into submissiveness. They prey upon women in the poorest regions of the world. 
   In addition, in central and southern Europe, with the collapse of the old economy, women from very poor villages are lured by fraudulent scam  predators into thinking they are going to work in the West and are going to work in the hospitality industry. You bet it's hospitality. It is called turning them into whores. 
   I say to my colleagues, that is not what the free world and free economy should be about. We want to make the trafficking in women and children as criminal as the trafficking in illegal drugs. Guess what. Often the same scum who traffic in women are also the ones who traffic in drugs and traffic in illegal weapons of mass destruction. 
   I support and applaud the efforts of the Senator from Kansas who has taken the leadership in this area. He has visited Asia and has seen the recruitment and despicable circumstances under which young girls and children are forced to work. From briefings here, we know this is going on in the Balkans, out of Ukraine, and out of Poland. Many are brought into this country under false pretenses with phony visas. We have to stop the trafficking of women around the world. 
   This is very good legislation. 
   It will improve the lives of women in America and around the world. By passing the Violence Against Women Act, we are helping the victims of domestic violence to rebuild their lives. By passing the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, we are protecting women and children who are bought and sold, and forced into slavery. 
   Again every year, more than 900,000 women are victims of violence in their own homes. Every second, 20 women are battered. The Violence Against Women Act says we will not let violence threaten women, families, or communities. 
   Violence against women is not just a threat to the health and safety of women. It is a threat to the health and safety of families and our communities. 
   No woman in this country should live in fear. No woman should fear walking home at night. No woman should fear leaving a campus library. No woman should fear that her husband or boyfriend will hurt her or her children. 
   We will not tolerate it--not in Maryland, where 41 women were killed by domestic violence last year; not anywhere in America, where 4 women a day are killed by domestic violence. 
   The Violence Against Women Act supports programs that help women to rebuild their lives. It strengthens law enforcement's response to domestic violence. It gives legal assistance to victims of domestic violence, and it creates safe havens for women and children who are victims of domestic violence. 
   The Violence Against Women Act will protect thousands of woman throughout the country. Today we are also taking steps to protect women throughout the world--by passing the Sex Trafficking Victims Act. 
   The truly repugnant practice of trafficking in human beings affects between one and two million women and girls each year. As I have stated, girls as young as ten years old are kidnaped from their villages. Or unsuspecting families allow their daughters to leave--with promises of good jobs and better lives. These women are taken to brothels or sweatshops--where they are imprisoned. They are forced to work as prostitutes. They are beaten, they are threatened--and many are killed. Even if a woman escapes, she is often so afraid of retaliation that she will not testify against her abductors. 
   Organized, international criminals are responsible for the increase in trafficking. They prey on young women in the poorest regions of the world. They take advantage of the most vulnerable--who live in developing countries with poor economic and uneven law enforcement. 
   Most countries have no way of dealing with this sophisticated form of international crime. Many countries where trafficking is most prevalent lack the laws and law enforcement authority to handle the problem. To often, when local authorities catch traffickers, the women get the brunt of the punishment for prostitution--while traffickers face minor penalties. 
   That is why this legislation is so important. It focuses on prevention, protection, and support for victims, and prosecution of traffickers. It recognizes that trafficking is a global problem that requires an international solution. 
   To prevent trafficking this legislation raises the awareness of the problem in villages and countries. It educates potential victims by promoting anti-trafficking awareness campaigns and by authorizing educational and training assistance to international organizations and foreign governments. It also requires the Secretary of State to report on the severe forms of trafficking in persons in the annual country reports. 
   To strengthen prosecution, this legislation provides local authorities with the tools to crack down on traffickers. 
   To support the victims of trafficking, this legislation directs funds for international organizations that help these women to rebuild their lives. They are given a safe haven where they can recover. They are provided with education, training, and microloans. 
   This legislation also recognizes that trafficking is not just a foreign problem. Approximately 50,000 women are brought to the United States each year where they are forced into prostitution or other servitude. This bill toughens current Federal trafficking penalties by doubling the current maximum penalties for traffickers to 20 years imprisonment with the possibility of life imprisonment. It also changes immigration law to help victims of trafficking. This will stop the practice of deporting victims back to potentially dangerous situations. 
   We want this century to be one of democracy and human rights. We will not achieve this unless everyone, including the worlds' poorest women, is able to control their own lives. This means education, economic development, family planning and civic institutions that protect the rights of women. The legislation we are passing today will take us closer to achieving these goals. I urge my colleagues to join me in strongly supporting the Violence Against Women Act and the Sex Trafficking Victims Act. 
   In conclusion, 4 years ago, I was a victim of violence. I was coming home from dinner with a wonderful professor who was an economic adviser to me and was here for a conference. I got her to her hotel. As I stepped out of my car, zam, I was mugged. I lost my handbag. I had a severe injury to my hand. I tried to fight him off, but he was over 6 feet, and I am under 5 feet. Fortunately, I escaped with my life. All I had was a broken memory and shattered security in my own neighborhood. 
   Thanks to the success of the Baltimore Police Department and the pressing of charges and the willingness not to plea bargain, that man is doing time while I hope I am out here doing good. I want to be sure the streets of America are safe. I have an entire Baltimore community on my side, including the informants. Not every woman has that. Let's try to get them the resources they need to be safe in their homes and communities. I thank the Chair.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of Senate passage of the Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act S. 662. I am proud to be the lead Democratic sponsor of this  bill. This is legislation that will help save lives, and it has the strong bipartisan support of 76 cosponsors. It gives states the option of providing Medicaid coverage to low-income women diagnosed with breast and cervical cancer through the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program under the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC. 
   Senate passage of this legislation was a true bipartisan team effort, and I want to recognize the other members of this team. I want to commend the late Senator John Chafee, who sponsored this legislation, for his leadership and genuine commitment to the women this bill would help. I want to thank Senators LINCOLN CHAFEE, MOYNIHAN, SNOWE, GRASSLEY, and HATCH for their strong support and leadership as we have all worked together to move this legislation through the Senate. I thank the Majority Leader and the Democratic Leader for their commitment to getting this bill through the Senate. 
   I also want to commend Senator ROTH for his leadership in the Finance Committee to ensure committee consideration and passage of this bill. Thank you also to President Clinton and Vice President GORE who have been supportive of providing treatment to women diagnosed with breast and cervical cancer through the CDC screening program, especially by including a provision similar to S. 662 in the Administration's Fiscal Year 2001 budget. 
   Finally, none of us would be here today to celebrate Senate passage of this bill without the hard work, tenacity, persistence, and perseverance of Fran Visco and the National Breast Cancer Coalition. They have done an outstanding job of making sure that women's voices from across the country were heard, listened to, and well represented. 
   However, our work is not yet finished. The House of Representatives must now take up and pass the bill we passed today. The House should move swiftly to enact this legislation that has such overwhelming bipartisan support. 
   The CDC screening program celebrated its 10th anniversary on August 10, 2000. The CDC screening program has provided over one million mammograms and over one million Pap tests. Among the women screened, over 7,000 cases of breast cancer and over 600 cases of cervical cancer have been diagnosed. I am proud to be the Senate architect of the legislation that created the breast and cervical cancer screening program at the CDC, and now I'm fighting to complete the program by adding a treatment component. There are three reasons why we must swiftly enact the Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act. 
   First, times have changed since the creation of the CDC screening program ten years ago. In 1990, when I wanted to include a treatment component in the screening program, I was told we didn't have the money. Well, now we are running annual surpluses, instead of annual deficits. The screening program was just a down payment, not the only payment. We have the resources to provide treatment to these women. I think we ought to put our money into saving lives. 
   Second, prevention, screening, and early detection are very important, but alone they do not stop deaths. Screening must be combined with treatment to reduce cancer mortality. Finally, it is only right to provide federal resources to treat breast and cervical cancer for those screened and diagnosed with these cancers through a federal screening program. 
   I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to ensure swift enactment of the Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act in the final days of this session. Women diagnosed with breast and cervical cancer shouldn't have to wait another year for treatment. I can't think of any better way to mark the 10th anniversary of the CDC screening program than by finally adding a federal treatment component to ensure that we make a true difference in the lives of women across this country.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to oppose cloture on the H-1B visa bill. I understand the importance of filling jobs in our high-tech industry. Yet hiring more people from abroad is only a short-term stop-gap solution. 
   We don't have a worker shortage--We have a skill shortage. We must upgrade the skills of American workers. 
   If we don't start dealing with the issue of skills, we will never have enough high-tech workers, and we'll perpetuate the underclass. 
   I am pleased that the H-1B visa bill would use visa fees for worker training and National Science Foundation scholarships, but we must do a lot more for K-12 education. That is why I want to offer an amendment to enable all Americans to learn the skills they need to work in the new digital economy. 
   My amendment is endorsed by the NAACP, the National Council of La Raza, the American Library Association, and the YMCA. 
   During consideration of the budget resolution, I offered an amendment to create a national goal: to ensure that every child is computer literate by the 8th grade, regardless of race, ethnicity, income, gender, geography, or disability. 
   My amendment passed unanimously. Yet in this Congress, we have done nothing to make this goal a reality. 
   A digital divide exists in America. Low-income, urban and rural families are less likely to have access to the Internet and computers. Black and Hispanic families are only two-fifths as likely to have Internet access as white families. Some schools have ten computers in every classroom. In other schools, 200 students share one computer. 
   Technology is the tool; empowerment since the Civil Rights Act of 1964, or it could result in even further divisions between races, regions and income groups. 
   Last year I visited New Shiloh Church in Baltimore. The pastor, Reverend Carter is working to bring jobs and hope to his community. He wanted to start a technology center. He asked for my help--and I didn't know how to help him. So for over a year, I've been learning about the digital divide. 
   I reached out to the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, the Congressional Black Caucus, people throughout Maryland, including, Speaker Cass Taylor, who is trying to wire western Maryland, ministers in Baltimore, who want their congregations to cross the digital divide, business leaders, who need trained workers, and educators, who want to help their students become computer literate. 
   I learned that our Federal programs are scattered and skimpy. Teachers and community leaders have to forrage for assistance. 
   The private sector is doing important, exciting work in improving access to technology. But technology empowerment can't be limited to a few zip codes or a couple of recycled factories. We need national policies and national programs. 
   We must focus on the ABC's: A--Universal Access; B--best trained--and better paid teachers; C--computer literacy for all students by the time they finish 8th grade. 
   My amendment would do two things. First of all, I am focusing on access. Community leaders have told me that we need to bring technology to where kids learn not just where we want them to learn. 
   They don't just learn in school; they learn in their communities. 
   Not every family has a computer in their home, but every American should have access to computers in their community. 
   This is a truly American ideal. We are the nation that created free public schools to provide every child with access to education. 
   We created community libraries across the country to provide all Americans with access to books. 
   We now need to bring technology into our communities to give all Americans access to technology. 
   What does this amendment do to improve access to technology? It creates 1,000 community based technology centers around the country. These centers would be created and run by community organizations, like a YMCA, the Urban League, or a public library. 
   The Federal Government would provide competitive grants to community based organizations. 
   At least half the funds for these sectors must come from the private sector. So we will be helping to build public-private partnerships around the country. 
   The private sector is eager to form these partnerships because their biggest problem is hiring enough skilled workers. 
   What does this mean for local communities? It means a safe haven for children, where they could learn how to use computers and use them to do homework or surf the Web. 
   It means job training for adults, who could use the technology centers to sharpen their job skills or write their resumes. 
   These community centers can serve all regions, races, and ethnic groups. They will be where they are needed, where there is limited access to technology. 
   They will be in urban, rural, and suburban areas. 
   They will be in Appalachia, and urban centers, and Native American reservations. 
   Over 750 community organizations applied for Community Technology Center grants last year. 
   We were only able to give grants to 40 community organizations. 
   There were so many excellent proposals last year that they didn't ask for new applicants this year, so this year, they are funding 71 more of the original applicants. 
   We must do better. 
   The second part of my amendment is about education. 
   My amendment doubles teacher training in technology. 
   Why is this important? 
   Because everywhere I go, teachers tell me that they want to help their students cross the digital divide. They need the training to do this because technology without training is a hollow opportunity. 
   Yet, according to a 1998 study by the National Center for Educational Statistics, only 20 percent of teachers feel fully prepared to use technology in their classrooms. 
   The Maryland Superintendent of Schools, Dr. Nancy Grasmick, told me that last summer, over 600 teachers from across the State volunteered to participate in a technology training academy. They volunteered their time to go to Towson State University to learn how to use technology in their classrooms. Over 400 were turned away because of lack of funding. 
   That is why my amendment would double funding for teacher training in technology. 
   Finally, my amendment doubles funding to train new teachers. Over the next 10 years, we will have to hire an additional 2 million teachers. In Maryland, over half our teachers will be eligible to retire by 2002. We must make sure that all new teachers have the skills they need to fully integrate technology into their classes. 
   Under cloture, I would not be able to offer my amendment. 
   Some of my colleagues would be glad about that.  
   They would say this bill is about immigration, not education. 
   Well, I would have preferred to offer this amendment to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, but the majority leader pulled that bill off the floor after only nine days of debate. 
   So instead of educating Americans for high-tech jobs, we are putting a Band-Aid on the problem by relying on workers from abroad. 
   We are living in an exciting time. 
   The opportunities are tremendous: to use technology to improve our lives; to use technology to remove the barriers caused by income, race, ethnicity, or geography. 
   This could mean the death of distance as a barrier for economic development for poor children and children of color; it could mean the death of discrimination and enable them to leap frog into the future. 
   My goal is to ensure that everyone in Maryland and in American can take advantage of these opportunities, so that no one is left out or left behind. 
   It would be a shame and a disgrace for this Congress to end without helping all Americans to cross the digital divide.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Senator for his advocacy on this issue. 
   First of all, I acknowledge the validity of the high-tech community's concerns about the availability of a high-tech workforce. The proposal here is to solve the problem by importing the people with the skills. I am not going to dispute that as a short-term, short-range solution. But what I do dispute is that we are precluded from offering amendments to create a farm team of tech workers. This is what I want to do if I would have the right to offer an amendment. 
   We do not have a worker shortage in the United States of America. I say to the Senator, and to my colleagues, we have a skill shortage in the United States of America. We have to make sure the people who want to work, who have the ability to work, have access to learning the technology so they can work in this new economy. 
   The digital divide means the difference between those who have access to technology and know how to use technology. If you are on one side of the divide, your future as a person or a country is great. If you are on the wrong side, you could be obsolete. 
   I do not want to mandate obsolescence for the American people who do not want to be left out or left behind. That is why I want to do two things: No. 1, have community tech centers --1,000 of them--where adults could learn by the day and kids could learn in structured afterschool activities in the afternoon. Then, also, to increase the funding for teacher training for K-12, where we would have a national goal that every child in America be computer literal by the time they finish the eighth grade. And maybe they then will not drop out. 
   That is what we want to be able to do. I do not understand. Why is it that farm teams are OK for baseball but they are not OK for technology workers, which is our K-12? 
   I share with the Senator a very touching story. A retail clerk I encounter every week in the course of taking care of my own needs was a minimum wage earner. I encouraged her to get her GED and look at tech training at a local community college. She did that. In all probability she is going to be working for the great Johns Hopkins University sometime within the month. She will double her income, she will have health insurance benefits, and it will enable enough of an income for her husband to take a breather and also get new tech skills. 
   But they have to pay tuition. They could do those things. I think we need to have amendments to address the skill shortage in the United States of America.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today's vote will set the course for America's relationship with China into the future. 
   The debate is about whether the United States should grant China Permanent Normal Trading Relations, PNTR status or continue the annual review of China's trade status. 
   It is not a debate on whether we should trade with China. 
   Granting PNTR to China will establish China as a full partner--not just in trade, but in every aspect of international relations. 
   It will end our ability to review and challenge China's trade status on an annual basis. 
   Denying PNTR to China will maintain our national sovereignty in our dealings with China. 
   It will retain our right to annually review America's trade relationship with China. 
   It will retain our right to exert pressure on China to improve on various fronts--from human rights to nuclear proliferation. 
   This is an exceptionally difficult decision for me. 
   I have studied the issue for many months. 
   I have weighed the pros and cons of granting China PNTR, and I acknowledge that there are strong arguments on both sides. 
   I will oppose PNTR for China. 
   I believe we should engage China--but not embrace China. 
   We all want to increase trade with China. 
   I want to see the United States not only win Nobel Prizes but also win new markets. 
   I want the United States to reap the rewards of great new American ideas by developing new American products and exporting those products around the world. 
   I want U.S. industries which can benefit from lower trade barriers in China--such as high tech companies and agricultural producers--to reap the rewards from this agreement. 
   Ambassador Barshefsky and the administration did a great job in negotiating a trade agreement to bring down China's trade barriers to the United States. 
   Although China's trade barriers to the United States still remain much higher than U.S. trade barriers to China, this agreement is a big step forward. 
   Yet I cannot ignore so many other factors in making this crucial and far-reaching decision. 
   I believe that the downside of this agreement has been significantly dismissed and the benefits have been greatly exaggerated. 
   So even though I believe and support trade, I do not believe we should grant permanent trade privileges to countries--such as China--at any price. 
   Instead, we should trade with China but not grant it PNTR status. 
   We should continue to review our trade relationship with China on an annual basis. 
   Since 1980, Congress has had the legal right to review the President's annual decision to grant China Most Favored Nation, MFN Status. 
   Unfortunately, we have rarely taken advantage of this right. 
   For the most part, Congress has rubber stamped the President's decision to give China full trading rights and access to the U.S. market without asking for concessions. 
   I voted against granting China MFN after the Chinese Government massacred thousands of Chinese citizens at Tiananmen Square in 1989. 
   The majority of my colleagues also voted to deny China MFN and together we took a firm stand against China's brutal massacre. 
   I wish President Bush had not vetoed our decision. 
   If he had upheld our vote, China would have learned that its behavior could jeopardize its access to the U.S. market. 
   Instead, President Bush taught the Chinese Government that it could literally get away with murder. 
   We should use the annual review as it was intended--to actively debate and question whether China deserves continued access to the U.S. market. 
   If we had ever used the annual review to deny China access to our market, it could have exerted pressure on China to improve its behavior. 
   It could even have worked to exert pressure if China had ever believed that its access to our market was in jeopardy. 
   I believe we should retain and strengthen our annual review because it is a practical and prudent tool. 
   Otherwise, it will be much more difficult to raise the numerous concerns we have about China. 
   There are at least 6 key factors that lead me to oppose PNTR for China. 
   U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY WILL BE JEOPARDIZED 
   I am worried that by transferring our wealth and technology to China it will enable Beijing to build its war machine with more smart weapons and technological developments. 
   Media reports indicate that China uses U.S. computers to develop its nuclear arms--such as illegally using U.S. supercomputers to simulate warhead detonations without actual underground tests. 
   This and other practices lead me to believe that China's use of U.S. technology to build its war machine will only increase if we grant it PNTR status. 
   Taiwan already lives in fear that efforts to declare independence from China will result in military action from Beijing. 
   This fear will only increase if China's military might is strengthened and it continues to break every nuclear nonproliferation agreement it claims it will respect. 
   I cannot ignore China's continued blatant disregard for international nuclear non-proliferation agreements. 
   Despite its repeated commitments to such agreements, China remains one of the key suppliers of nuclear technology and expertise to several rogue countries. 
   Who are they? 
   Pakistan, Iran, North Korea and Libya. 
   As recently as July of this year, the United States learned that China continues to assist Pakistan in building long-range missiles that could carry nuclear weapons. 
   This dangerous irresponsible behavior cannot be ignored especially because Kashmir remains such a volatile area. 
   China continuously avoids its international obligations. 
   It flagrantly jeopardizes international security at a time when its trade relationship with the United States is still undecided. 
   So the American people can be sure it will take even more egregious steps if its trade relationship with the United States becomes permanent.  
   CHINA'S POOR RECORD OF COMPLIANCE WITH EXISTING INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS 
   How do we have fair trade with a country that has not fairly lived up to its previous international agreements? 
   China has made efforts at the national level to improve its compliance record. 
   Yet these efforts mean little in practice, because they are so often ignored at the local and provincial levels. 
   For example, Beijing repeatedly promises to comply with intellectual property agreements. 
   But factories throughout China continue to turn out pirate videos and CDs--with a wink and a nod from the local government. 
   The effect is a failure to protect against infringement of U.S. copyrights, trademarks and patents. 
   Will China improve its record of compliance once it joins the WTO? 
   Unfortunately, there's no reason to think it will. 
   The WTO simply doesn't have strong enforcement mechanisms. 
   The WTO is a multilateral, bureaucratic institution. 
   We cannot expect it to adequately resolve our battles with China. 
   If we grant China PNTR status and it joins the WTO, we will still have to fight our own trade battles with China.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, it has been more than a year since the Columbine tragedy, but still this Republican Congress refuses to act on sensible gun legislation. 
   Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. Until we act, Democrats in the Senate will read the names of some of those who have lost their lives to gun violence in the past year, and we will continue to do so every day that the Senate is in session. 
   In the name of those who died, we will continue this fight. Following are the names of some of the people who were killed by gunfire one year ago today. 
   SEPTEMBER 14, 1999
   Charles Caldwell, 18, Minneapolis, MN; Penny Calhoun, 32, Salt Lake City, UT; Henry J. Calhoun, 32, Salt Lake City, UT; Jovan Coleman, 19, Chicago, IL; Orlando Cortezq, 24, Dallas, TX; Israel Cuervas, 26, Dallas, TX; Charlie D. Duff, 18, Chicago, IL; Alfredo Fernandez, 50, Houston, TX; Toi Goodnight, 41, Pittsburgh, PA; Stevie Gray, 33, Washington, DC; Jessie Harper, 39, Houston, TX; Michael L. Harris, 41, Chicago, IL; Lee Sun Heung, 43, Baltimore, MD; John Homilton, 82, Oakland, CA; Stephen Hornbaker, 35, Pittsburgh, PA; Kerne Lerouge, 43, Boston, MA; Nigel D. Reese, 17, Chicago, IL; Herman Ridley, 24, Baltimore, MD; Frank Rizzo, Houston, TX; Charles Waldon, 62, Houston, TX. 
   One of the victims of gun violence I mentioned, 41-year-old Toi Goodnight of Pittsburgh, was shot and killed one year ago today in a carjacking incident. The man who killed Toi shot her in the mouth and left her on the highway as he drove away in her car. 
   We cannot sit back and allow such senseless gun violence to continue. The deaths of Toi Goodnight and the others I named are a reminder to all of us that we need to enact sensible gun legislation now.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President I rise as a proud original cosponsor of the Omnibus Long-Term Care Act of 2000. I am very pleased to join Senators GRAHAM, GRASSLEY, BAYH, COLLINS, BREAUX, and AKAKA to introduce this bipartisan legislation that provides a comprehensive approach to the long-term care of our nation's citizens. I am committed to finding long-term solutions to the long-term care problem in our country. 
   I like this bill because it meets the day-to-day needs of Marylanders and the long-range needs of our country. At least 5.8 million Americans aged 65 and older currently need long-term care. While this legislation has many important provisions, I would like to highlight three of its features: the National Family Caregiver Support Program, long-term car insurance for federal employees, and the ``return to home'' provision. 
   First, this bill would establish the National Family Caregiver Support Program. I am proud to have sponsored and cosponsored this legislation previously in this Congress. This program will provide respite care, training, counseling, support services, information and assistance to some of the millions of Americans who care for older individuals and adult children with disabilities. In fact, eighty percent of all long-term care services are provided by family and friends. This program has strong bipartisan support, will get behind our nation's families, and give help to those who practice self-help. 
   As Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Aging, I am pleased to report that last week the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee unanimously approved a bipartisan bill to reauthorize the Older Americans Act (OAA). This bill included the caregiver support program which is strongly supported by the entire aging community. As I work with Senators JEFFORDS, KENNEDY, and DEWINE and our colleagues in the House to pass the OAA reauthorization in September, I want to strongly urge fellow appropriators in the House and Senate to fund these vital caregiver support services as close as possible to the full funding level of $125 million. Millions of Americans are waiting for Congress to act. 
   Second, I think it is important that this bill includes the Long-Term Care Security Act. This bill would enable federal and military workers, retirees, and their families to purchase long-term care insurance at group rates (projected to be 15-20 percent below the private market). It would create a model that private employers can use to establish their own long-term care insurance programs. As our nation's largest employer, the federal government can be a model for employers around the country whose workforce will be facing the same long-term care needs. Starting with the nation's largest employer also raises awareness and education about long-term care options. 
   Yesterday, the Senate passed the Long-Term Care Security Act (H.R. 4040). I am proud to be the lead Democratic sponsor of the Senate companion to this bill, S. 2420, because it gives people choices, flexibility, and security. Families will have an additional option available to them as they look at their long-term care choices. This provision would also help reduce reliance on federal programs, like Medicaid, so the American taxpayer benefits. 
   This legislation also provides people with flexibility because it allows them to receive care in different types of settings. They may choose to be cared for in the home by a family caregiver--or they may need a higher level of care that nursing homes and home health care services provide. Different plan reimbursement options will ensure maximum flexibility that meet the unique health care needs of the beneficiary. 
   Long-term care insurance also provides families with some security. Family members will not be burdened by trying to figure out how to finance health care needs--and beneficiaries will be able to make informed decisions about their future. 
   Finally, I am pleased that the bill we have introduced includes bipartisan legislation that I have previously sponsored, the Seniors' Access to Continuing Care Act (S. 1142). This legislation protects seniors' access to treatment in the setting of their choice and ensures that seniors who reside in continuing care communities, and nursing and other facilities have the right to return to that facility after a hospitalization, even if the insurer does not have a contract with the resident's facility. 
   Across the country seniors in managed care plans have discovered too late that after a hospital stay, they may be forced to return to a facility in the plan's provider network and not to the continuing care retirement community or skilled nursing facility  where they live. No senior should have to face this problem. In Maryland alone, there are over 12,000 residents in 40 continuing care retirement communities and 24,000 residents in over 200 licensed nursing facilities. I have visited many of these facilities and heard from residents and operators about this serious and unexpected problem. 
   Residents choose and pay for facilities like continuing care retirement communities (CCRC's) for the continuum of care, safety, security, and peace of mind. Hospitalization is traumatic. Friends, family, and familiar staff and faces are crucial to a speedy recovery. Where you return after a hospital stay should be based on humanity and choice, not the managed care company's bottom line. 
   Specifically, the Seniors' Access to Continuing Care Act protects residents of CCRC's and nursing facilities by: enabling them to return to their facility after a hospitalization; and requiring the resident's insurer or managed care organization (MCO) to cover the cost of the care, even if the insurer does not have a contract with the resident's facility. Certain conditions must be met. 
   This legislation also requires an insurer or MCO to pay for a service to one of its beneficiaries, without a prior hospital stay, if the service is necessary to prevent a hospitalization of the beneficiary and the service is provided as an additional benefit. Lastly, the bill requires an insurer or MCO to provide coverage to a beneficiary for services provided at a facility in which the beneficiary's spouse already resides, even if the facility is not under contract with the MCO. Certain requirements must be met. These provisions are an important part of our safety net for seniors. 
   I want to salute the strong leadership of the other cosponsors of this legislation who have authored various provisions of this comprehensive bill that we have joined together to introduce today. I know that all the cosponsors are sincerely committed, as I am, to addressing the challenges facing our aging population. I look forward to working with all of them to enact this important legislation.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of final passage of H.R. 4040, The Long-Term Care Security Act. As the lead Democratic sponsor of the Senate companion to this bill, S. 2420, I believe this is an important part of our down-payment on finding solutions to the exploding problem of long-term care. 
   Without long-term care coverage, no family has real security against the costs of chronic illness or disability. The Long-Term Care Security Act H.R. 4040 (S. 2420), does 4 things:  
   1. Enables federal and military workers, retirees and their families to purchase long-term care insurance at group rates--projected to be 15 percent to 20 percent below the private market. 
   2. Creates a model that private employers can use to establish their own long-term care insurance program. 
   3. Provides help to those who practice self-help by offering employees the option to better prepare for their retirement. 
   4. Reduces the reliance on federal programs, like Medicaid, so the American taxpayer benefits. Federal workers also benefit because they are paying lower premiums than they would get in the private market. 
   I am a strong supporter of The Long-Term Care Security Act because it gives people choices, flexibility and security. Faced with a sick parent or spouse, most Americans currently do not have a lot of choices. They may choose, or be forced, to spend down their assets in order to qualify for Medicaid. They, or a spouse, may quit their job to do some of the caregiving themselves. Or, families may be forced to make the difficult choice of putting a child through college, or paying for long-term care for a parent. This legislation gives people better, more informed choices. 
   It also provides people with flexibility because beneficiaries will have different types of settings where they can receive care. They may choose to be cared for in the home by a family caregiver--or they may need a higher level of care that nursing homes and home health care services provide. Different plan reimbursement options will ensure maximum flexibility that meet the unique health care needs of the beneficiary. 
   Long-term care insurance also provides families with some security. Family members will not be burdened by trying to figure out how to finance health care needs--and beneficiaries will be able to make informed decisions about their future. 
   Some of us have faced the challenge of having a family member who needed long-term care. It is emotionally and financially difficult. But, imagine if you are a secretary working at the Social Security Administration, or a custodial worker here in the Senate. And a family member gets Alzheimers, or Parkinsons, or has some other illness that requires long-term health care. Your paycheck probably isn't big enough to cover the cost of home health visits, or a nursing home stay. So where do you go? Medicare doesn't cover long-term care so that is not an option. Should you quit your job so you can take care of your parent? But then what if you have a family of your own that you need to support? Or, what if you are trying to put a child through college? 
   Consider if you are a 61 year old employee at NASA and you are diagnosed with cancer. You might be able to retire, but the federal employees health benefits program does not cover long-term care--even for retirees. You may not have family to provide care and your pension probably isn't large enough to finance the high costs of long-term care. Where do you go? 
   Many Americans are currently facing these difficult decisions. Consider that: 
   At least 5.8 million Americans aged 65 or older currently need long-term care. 
   As many as six out of 10 Americans have experienced a long-term care need. 
   41 percent of women in caregiver roles quit their jobs or take family medical leave to care for a frail older parent or parent-in-law. 
   80 percent of all long-term care services are provided by family and friends. 
   These statistics represent the enormous financial and emotional costs associated with long-term care. This legislation is an essential step in providing opportunities for federal workers to plan ahead for retirement so they can take responsibility for their future long-term care needs. 
   Since my first days in Congress, I have been fighting to help people afford the burdens of long-term care. Eleven years ago, I introduced legislation now known as Spousal Anti-Impoverishment. My bill changed the cruel rules of government that forced elderly couples to go bankrupt before they could get any help in paying for nursing home care. 
   Through the Older Americans Act, seniors have easier access to information and referrals they need to make good choices about long-term care. I am also working hard to create a National Family Caregivers Program so that families can access comprehensive information when faced with the dizzying array of choices in addressing the long-term care needs of a family member. 
   It is clear that we have a long-term care problem. The Office of Personnel Management estimates that 96,000 federal employees will be retiring in the year 2001. Providing federal employees with a long-term care insurance benefit is a down payment on a solution. 
   I am starting with federal employees for two reasons. As our nation's largest employer, the federal government can be a model for employers around the country whose workforce will be facing the same long-term care needs. Starting with the nation's largest employer also raises awareness and education about long-term care options. 
   I am a strong supporter of our federal employees. I am proud that so many of them live, work, and retire in Maryland. They work hard in the service of our country. And I work hard for them. Whether it's fighting for fair COLAs, lower health care premiums, or to prevent unwise schemes to privatize important services our federal workforce provide, they can count on me. 
   One of my principles is ``promises made should be promises kept.'' Federal employees and retirees have made a commitment to devote their careers to public service. In return, our government made certain promises to them. One important promise made was the promise of health insurance. The lack of long-term care for federal workers has been a big gap in this important promise to our federal workers. This legislation will close that gap and provide our federal workers and retirees with comprehensive health insurance. 
   I reiterate my commitment to finding long-term solutions to the long-term care problem. I am proud that this bipartisan bill takes an important step forward in helping all Americans to prepare for the challenges facing our aging population. 
   I would like to thank Senator CLELAND, Senator GRASSLEY, Senator AKAKA, Senator COCHRAN, Senator LIEBERMAN and Senator THOMPSON for all of their hard work in coming to a bipartisan consensus on how best to provide federal and military employees, retirees, and their families with the opportunity to purchase long-term care insurance. Additionally, many Senate staff worked very hard in developing this compromise: Nanci Langley, Hope Hegstrom, Michael Loesch, Tamara Jones, Judy White, Larry Novey, and Dan Blair. And I would like to thank Cynthia Brock-Smith and Frank Titus at the Office of Personnel Management.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the life and legacy of Senator PAUL COVERDELL. His passing has shocked and saddened us all. It has left a void in the Senate and in our nation. 
   For Senator COVERDELL, public service was his profession and his passion. After serving in the Army, he began his public life as a member of the Georgia State Senate where he served as Minority Leader. After working in the private sector, he was appointed Director of the Peace Corps. In this important position he worked to spread American values around the world. This experience helped him when he later served on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, where he was a leader in our international effort to strengthen our anti-drug efforts. 
   In the Senate, Senator COVERDELL was known as a hard worker who often reached across the aisle to build coalitions. Senator COVERDELL fought hard for his principles. We didn't always agree on policy--but he always treated those on the other side with dignity and respect. He knew that despite our different views, we all shared a common goal. We all want to do what's best for our constituents and our nation. He understood that we can get more done with civility than with contention. 
   Senator COVERDELL will be greatly missed. My thoughts and prayers are with his family.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today with the Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education to discuss a fatal brain disorder called Huntington's disease. This genetic ailment, which has no cure, has afflicted approximately 30,000 Americans, and over 150,000 more people in our country are at risk. In my state alone, it is estimated that over 500 people have Huntington's, and another 4,742 are at risk. Also known as ``HD,'' the illness is like a cross between Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Everybody with the defective gene will become ill, slowly losing the ability to walk, talk, eat, and reason and eventually dying from choking, infection, or heart failure. HD strikes both sexes, all ethnicities, and sometimes even children. In addition, each child of a parent with HD has a 50/50 chance of inheriting the gene. 
   One family that has been struck by the terrible realities of Huntington's disease is the Mason family of Baltimore, Maryland. Troy Mason was once the agile quarterback on his high school football team. Today at age 36, Mr. Mason uses a wheelchair and can only walk a bit and speak some words. His wife, Rosemary, is his full time caregiver. Troy and Rosemary's two children have a 50/50 chance of inheriting the HD gene. Not only does Mrs. Mason care for her husband, but she also cares for her mother who suffers from HD. This means that Mrs. Mason also has a 50/50 chance of inheriting the HD gene. Mrs. Mason not only has to face the incredible daily stresses and strains of caregiving, but must also face the possibility that she and her children may someday have Huntington's disease themselves. This Baltimore family is courageously fighting Huntington's disease, but they need our help.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. The people of Maryland appreciate this support by the NIH and laud your and Senator HARKIN's leadership in doubling the NIH budget over five years. I am very pleased to join you in this worthy endeavor. We are proud to have an HDSA Center of Excellence in Maryland, at Johns Hopkins University and Johns Hopkins Hospital. Johns Hopkins also receives funding from NIH to conduct Huntington's disease research. However, I believe additional resources are needed to fund important HD research. I am concerned that the current health appropriations bill does not provide guidance to the NIH on HD funding and research priorities.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to express my disappointment that this bill does not provide $125 million for supportive services for caregivers under the Older Americans Act (OAA). As an appropriator, I understand the difficult funding constraints under which Senator SPECTER and Senator HARKIN operate. However, I also know that providing and funding supportive services for caregivers has strong bipartisan support and would meet a compelling human need. 
   Many of us have had personal experiences caring for parents or other loved ones and understand firsthand the stresses and strains caregivers face. Last year, the Subcommittee on Aging heard the compelling testimony of Carolyn Erwin-Johnson, a family caregiver in Baltimore, Maryland. Ms. Johnson has been caring for her mother who has Multiple Sclerosis for sixteen years. She left Chicago and her work on a second Masters degree to come to Baltimore and care for her mother at home, rather than put her mother in a nursing home. She found a community-based care system that was fragmented, underfunded, and overburdened. After months of frustration and trying to find help, Ms. Johnson took to hiring nursing aides off the street and training them to care for her mother while she worked a forty hour work week. Even then, she could only afford to pay for eight hours of help when her mother needed 24-hour care. She and her mother ended up paying on average between $17,000 and $20,000 annually in out-of-pocket costs to care for her mother at home. 
   Caregiving has taken its toll on Ms. Johnson. Today, she has been diagnosed with two incurable, stress-related illnesses, changed jobs, and seen her income drop to levels that mean she can no longer afford to hire private aides. Ms. Johnson is helped by the 164 hours of respite care she receives annually from the Alzheimer's Respite Care Program. In the words of Ms. Johnson, ``Respite care programs are the key to the survival and longevity of family caregivers.'' 
   Mr. President, currently about 12.8 million adults need assistance from others to carry out activities of daily living, such as bathing and feeding. One in four adults currently provides care for an adult with a chronic health condition. Many caregivers struggle with competing demands of paid employment, raising a family, and caring for a parent or other relative. Caregiving can take an emotional, physical, mental, and financial toll. A recent study found that on average, workers who take care of older relatives lose $659,139 in wages, pension benefits, and Social Security over a lifetime. Further, the estimated national economic value of informal caregiving was $196 billion in 1997. 
   The National Family Caregiver Support Program, originally proposed by the President, would provide respite care, information and assistance, caregiver counseling, training and peer support, and supplemental services to caregivers and their families. Full funding of $125 million would provide services to about 250,000 families. Senators DASCHLE, GRASSLEY and BREAUX, DEWINE, and I have all sponsored legislation in this Congress to establish this program. Twenty four Senators joined me earlier this year in urging the Labor/HHS Appropriations Subcommittee to fully fund these supportive services for caregivers. I know other colleagues of mine have also voiced support for funding these worthwhile services. This is truly a step we can take that will meet a compelling human need. It gets behind our Nation's families and helps those who practice self-help. 
   As this bill moves to conference, I strongly urge the conferees to re-evaluate the current decision not to fund caregiver support services. As the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Aging, I am working with my colleagues on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee to reauthorize the OAA this year. I hope that we are able to reach agreement on outstanding issues to reauthorize the OAA this year. While we are working on reauthorization, I believe that we must also move forward on funding caregiver support services. American families are counting on us to act.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to my dear colleague, Senator DANIEL INOUYE. Today, Senator INOUYE receives the Congressional Medal of Honor for his heroic service to our nation. This honor is richly deserved--and long overdue. 
   Senator INOUYE's life is one of service and patriotism. He began his service when he was just seventeen, leaving his home in Honolulu to aid wounded civilians on the day of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. As a Japanese American, he faced bigotry, resentment, and outright persecution. Even while facing this discrimination, he withdrew from his medical studies at the University of Hawaii and enlisted in the Army as soon as Japanese Americans were permitted to serve. 
   Stationed in Italy with the war's end nearing, 2nd lieutenant INOUYE led his men into his final battle. Though he was shot and his platoon was pinned by gunfire, he continued on alone. Bravely he tossed two hand grenades before his right arm was shattered by a German rifle grenade. He threw a final grenade with his left arm before another shot in the leg forced him to retreat. It is for this tremendous act of courage that Senator INOUYE receives this long overdue honor. 
   Senator INOUYE is being honored for his courage in battle. We also know that Senator INOUYE's service to our country extends far beyond his bravery in war. When Senator INOUYE was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1959, he was the first American of Japanese ancestry to serve in the House. Since 1962, Senator INOUYE has served with great distinction in the Senate. 
   Every day, we witness first-hand Senator INOUYE's commitment to the people of Hawaii and the people of the United States. He is a leader on national security and international human rights. As a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, he works tirelessly to ensure that we meet the day to day needs of our constituents--and the long term needs of our nation. Since my earliest days on the Appropriations Committee, I've learned from Senator INOUYE--particularly in the area of defense policy. 
   Even in a war filled with heroes, Senator INOUYE's heroism was extraordinary. It is with deep respect and affection that I offer my most sincere congratulations to Senator INOUYE for being awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor today.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, as a member for the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, I've worked to enact foreign aid bills that reflect our national interests and our values. While I support the FY2001 foreign operations appropriations bill, I do have some serious concerns that I hope will be addressed during conference. 
   I am pleased that the foreign operations bill provides assistance to Israel, Cyprus and Armenia. I believe that its important that we stand by these friends as they make the difficult steps toward peace. I am also pleased that we support bilateral population assistance and support for micro-enterprise programs. These programs are vital in helping the world's poorest people to help themselves. 
   I am disappointed that the bill does not provide sufficient assistance in other crucial areas, such as adequate flood relief assistance to Mozambique and the Administration's full funding request for debt relief. 
   In addition, although I am pleased with the human rights requirements included in the Colombia aid package attached to this legislation, I have grave reservations about the large military aid package to Colombia. 
   Colombia has been suffering through a civil war for over thirty years. Over 35,000 Colombians have been killed in the last decade. In recent years, this civil war has been exacerbated by the illegal production and trade of drugs coming out of Colombia--primarily cocaine and heroin. Most of these drugs wind up in the United States and contribute to America's growing drug problem. It is clear that the United States has to help Colombia deal with this volatile situation. 
   It is also clear that we have to do more to stop the growing demand and dependence on drugs in our own country. In my own hometown of Baltimore--out of a population of 600,000--60,000 people are addicted to heroin or cocaine. These individuals not only wreck their own lives but they also have left a horrible mark on the city--drug-related crimes are now at $2 to $3 billion a year. Drugs destroy individuals, families and communities. That's why I've always fought for anti-drug education, increased drug treatment programs and strong law enforcement. 
   I am not convinced that the military aid provided to Colombia included in this bill is the best way to fight drugs in the United States. 
   First of all, I'm concerned that we're getting dragged into the middle of a civil war. I am also concerned that there is no clear exit strategy. The aid package is open-ended. The Administration has admitted that this ``two-year'' package is really expected to run longer--more like five or six years. An open-ended commitment could turn into a quagmire. 
   I believe the best way to help Colombia is by supporting its peace process through a balanced aid package. The package before us is not at all balanced. Over 75% of this package is in military arms, equipment and training. Only a small fraction of the aid helps to fund economic alternatives to drug production, to assist the large number of civilians who will be displaced by this assistance or to address the deeper social problems that have led to Colombia's increasing reliance on drug production and cultivation in the first place. 
   These funds would be better spent combating the drug problem in the United States. More funding and support is badly needed for drug treatment and prevention programs in our own country. That is why I supported Senator WELLSTONE's amendment to reduce the military aid provided to Colombia and re-direct that funding to domestic substance abuse programs--in particular to vital state and local community based programs--that are in desperate need of funding. I regret that this amendment did not pass. 
   Although I regret that such a large percentage of our assistance to Colombia is in military aid, I am pleased that strong human rights requirements must be met by Colombia's Government and Armed Forces before this aid is dispensed. President Pastrana has taken important steps to improve the human rights situation in Colombia by disciplining army officials who have committed human rights violations. Nonetheless, it is a well-known and well-documented fact that members of Colombia's Armed Forces continue to be linked to paramilitary groups that commit these violent acts. 
   The human rights requirements in this legislation helps to address this continuing problem. For example, under this legislation, the head of Colombia's Armed Forces must suspend personnel alleged to have committed gross human rights violations or to have aided or abetted paramilitary groups. It also requires the Colombian Government to prosecute leaders and members of paramilitary groups as well as military personnel who aid or abet paramilitary groups. Before U.S. military aid can be dispensed to Colombia, the U.S. Secretary of State must certify that these human rights conditions have been met. By enforcing these conditions, I believe that the Colombian Government--with U.S. support--might achieve real progress on Colombia's path to peace. 
   I urge that Congress maintain the strong human rights requirements in this legislation. Without such checks in providing assistance to Colombia, we run the risk of further exacerbating Colombia's civil war. We must also monitor the impact this assistance will have on reducing drug production in Colombia and drug supply in the United States. By keeping this goal in mind, we can evaluate and devise the best method for combating the war against drugs in the United States which, after all, is the ultimate aim of this aid. 
   As the strongest nation on earth, and the world's strongest democracy, our foreign aid must be used to promote peace, stability and human rights. As a member of the Foreign Operations Conference Committee, I will work to ensure that the final legislation supports these goals and represents our national interests and our values.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the amendment offered by Senators MURRAY and SNOWE. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this amendment. 
   This amendment would repeal the current ban on privately funded abortions at U.S. military facilities overseas. 
   I strongly support this amendment for three reasons. First of all, safe and legal access to abortion is the law. Second, women serving overseas should have access to the same range of medical services they would have if they were stationed here at home. Third, this amendment would protect the health and well-being of military women. It would ensure that they are not forced to seek alternative medical care in foreign countries without regard to the quality and safety of those health care services. We should not treat U.S. servicewomen as second-class citizens when it comes to receiving safe and legal medical care. 
   It is a matter of simple fairness that our servicewomen, as well as the spouses and dependents of servicemen, be able to exercise their right to make health care decisions when they are stationed abroad. Women who are stationed overseas are often totally dependent on their base hospitals for medical care. Most of the time, the only access to safe, quality medical care is in a military facility. We should not discriminate against female military personnel by denying safe abortion services just because they are stationed overseas. They should be able exercise the same freedoms they would enjoy at home. It is reprehensible to suggest that a woman should not be able use her own funds to pay for access to safe and quality medical care. Without this amendment, military women will continue to be treated like second-class citizens. 
   The current ban on access to reproductive services is yet another attempt to cut away at the constitutionally protected right of women to choose. It strips military women of the very rights they were recruited to protect. Abortion is a fundamental right for women in this country. It has been upheld repeatedly by the Supreme Court. 
   Let's be very clear. What we're talking about here today is the right of women to obtain a safe and legal abortion paid for with their own funds. We are not talking about using any taxpayer or federal money--we are talking about privately funded medical care. We are not talking about reversing the conscience clause--no military medical personnel would be compelled to perform an abortion against their wishes. 
   This is an issue of fairness and equality for the women who sacrifice every day to serve our nation. They deserve access to the same quality care that servicewomen stationed here at home--and every woman in America--has each day. I urge my colleagues to support this important amendment to the Fiscal Year 2001 Department of Defense Authorization Bill.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, the pending bill is on Transportation appropriations. I wish to comment not only on the content of the bill but on the managers of the bill. 
   I am sorry they are not here, though I note the chairman of the full committee is. 
   I thank the chairman, Senator SHELBY of Alabama, for the courtesies and cordiality he extended to me as he worked on the physical infrastructure needs of Maryland. I am continually grateful for his cooperation. 
   I also want to say something about a very dear friend, and pay my respects to someone I have worked with up and down the Northeast corridor, on the highways and byways of Baltimore, of Maryland, and our country. That is, of course, the very distinguished Senator from New Jersey, Mr. LAUTENBERG. 
   When I came to the Senate in 1986 and was sworn in in 1987, I was the very first Democratic woman ever elected to the Senate in her own right. At the time of my arrival, there was only one other woman in the Senate, the very wonderful Senator from Kansas, Ms. Nancy Kassebaum. 
   When I gave speeches out in the community, they would say: Senator MIKULSKI, what is it like to be the only Democratic woman Senator? I would say that although I was all by myself, I was never alone because there were wonderful men in the Senate who helped me get started, who showed me how to be effective, and how to be a very good Senator. Of course, I had a great senior Senator, Mr. PAUL SARBANES. I had the help of the then-chairman of the full committee, Senator BOB BYRD, and others, such as Senator KENNEDY and Senator DODD. 
   But also right there in appropriations was someone who I counted on and looked up to, and who was really a help, my very 
   good friend, Senator LAUTENBERG. That is why I was never by myself because I could turn to Senator LAUTENBERG. 
   What a way he had on appropriations--bringing his businessman's savvy and yet his total compassion for people. He brought to the Appropriations Committee a need to see how we could be compassionate about people today and yet look at the long-range needs of our country. 
   That is what he brought to the Transportation Subcommittee. 
   While we were working on how to build America and its physical infrastructure, Senator LAUTENBERG looked beyond bricks and mortar. He was looking at people. 
   It was under his leadership that he brought to our attention the issue related to terrorism and how we could protect our people, whether it was on the high seas or at airports. 
   He was the one who talked about the impact of smoking and what it meant to both airline passengers as well as those who worked on the airlines. 
   Most recently, he has also talked about the issue of the impact of high blood alcohol levels on the whole issue of drunk driving. 
   Senator LAUTENBERG brought public health and a public safety agenda to the Transportation Subcommittee. It has served the Nation well because we not only built communities but we have been able to save lives because of what I call ``the Lautenberg approach,'' which is putting people along with bricks and mortar. We are building communities and saving lives. 
   I hope long after the distinguished Senator no longer officially serves the people of New Jersey that ``the Lautenberg approach'' can be an approach that the Senate continues always thinking about people--putting people first, looking at every opportunity to enhance the public safety and the public health of the people of this country and the people who visit this country. 
   Again, although I was all by myself, I was never alone. The American people owe Senator LAUTENBERG a great debt of gratitude. People are alive because of him today. I owe him a debt that I can never repay, except to follow the Lautenberg method. 
   Senator LAUTENBERG will always be with me in every day as long as I continue to be a Senator and a public servant. 
   Mr. President, I thank the Senators for their kind attention, and I yield the floor.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to support Senator KENNEDY and my colleagues in moving forward on this issue on a very strong Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   In the debate the question was, Do you remember the Clinton plan? I sure do. I remember it with fondness. I wish we had passed it because we would not be in this mess that we are in today. 
   When the Clinton plan was before the Senate, they said: We can't pass it. It is going to create a big bureaucracy. It is going to shackle the decisionmaking by physicians. And it is going to lead to rationing by proxy. 
   What do we have now with this mess that we are rendering in the delivery of health care? This plan, the way health care is being given in this country now, was created by a group called the Jackson Hole group. It might have been created by the Jackson Hole group, but for most patients they go through a black hole trying to get the medical treatment they need. 
   Where do we find ourselves? Doctors unionizing, hospitals closing, and the American people up in arms. There is a reason for this. This is because our delivery system has turned into a bureaucratic-rationing-by-proxy nightmare. 
   This is why we are trying to move this legislation. 
   This legislation we are talking about--Norwood-Dingell--passed the House in October 1999 by a vote of 275-151. That is bipartisan. The Senate moved quickly to have conferees in October. The House did it in November. But we did not have our first bipartisan meeting until February 23. The first Members' meeting wasn't until March. So I am very frustrated by the slow and stodgy pace of these deliberations. 
   Our progress has been minimal and meager. The snail's pace of the conference leads me to conclude that unless we act quickly, we are not going to have time in this session. 
   It is high time we deal with this issue. No more delays. No more parliamentary derailment. It affects the  health care of every American who is in a managed care plan. They want us to take action. They want us to take it now. 
   But while this is not about political posturing, this is about people in pain: the 57-year-old man with prostate cancer whose HMO denies him access to a Government-approved clinical trial; the 35-year-old mom who had a stroke and whose employer switched plans in the middle of her rehab so she cannot get back on her feet and back with her family and back on her job. Think about the woman who has to talk to three insurance gatekeepers before she gets to see her OB/GYN. 
   When we embarked upon this, I said I wanted to fight for patients, not profits. Health care decisions should be made in the consulting room by a doctor, not in the boardroom by insurance executives. Patients need continuity of care. They should have the right to receive treatment that is medically necessary and medically appropriate, using the best practices and, yes, holding their health insurance plans accountable with the right to sue, if necessary. 
   The Norwood-Dingell plan essentially gives us an external appeals process before you get into court. This would resolve this. 
   It has been 8 months since the Norwood-Dingell bill passed the House of Representatives. I think it is high time we move on this. I say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, 
   we have worked so closely together in expanding the opportunity for medical breakthroughs. I could name names as we go around in which I worked with each and every one of you to really be able to enhance and improve NIH, and even double the funding in certain areas--certainly Dr. FRIST in his work there; Senator SUE COLLINS and her wonderful work on diabetes; and we could go around; the leadership that Senator JEFFORDS has had even in conducting hearings. 
   Why can't we come together to push for the breakthroughs, where we have had more scientific and medical breakthroughs in our country, so people have the health care they need, to have access to the very breakthroughs that the American people paid for and was invented in their own country? 
   If we are going to make the 21st century a real century of opportunity, then I think we need to start now with ensuring that every single American has access to the health care that is medically necessary or medically appropriate as mandated by their physician. 
   This is really a life and death decision. The clock is ticking. This session of Congress is closing. I hope when it is over that we can have a bipartisan legacy where we have passed a Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   I yield the floor.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. 
   Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce the ``Imported Products Safety Improvement and Disease Prevention Act of 2000.'' I am proud to be the sponsor of this important legislation which guarantees the improved safety of imported foods, and I have high hopes that we will act on it this year. 
   The health of Americans is not something to take chances with. It is important that we make food safety a top priority. Every person should have the confidence that their food is fit to eat. We should be confident that imported food is as safe as food produced in this country. Cars can't be imported unless they meet U.S. safety requirements. Prescription drugs can't be imported unless they meet FDA standards. You shouldn't be able to import food that isn't up to U.S. standards, either. 
   We import increasing quantities of fresh fruits and vegetables, seafood, and many other foods. In the past seven years, the amount of food imported into the U.S. has more than doubled. Out of all the produce we eat, 40% of it is imported. Our food supply has gone global, so we need to have global food safety. 
   The impact of unsafe food is staggering. There have been several frightening examples of food poisoning incidents in the U.S. When Michigan schoolchildren were contaminated with Hepatitis A from imported strawberries in 1997, Americans were put on alert. Thousands of cases of cyclospora infection from imported raspberries--resulting in severe, prolonged diarrhea, weight loss, vomiting, chills and fatigue were also reported that year. Imported cantaloupe eaten in Maryland sickened 25 people. As much as $663 million was spent on food borne illness in Maryland alone. Overall, as many as 33 million people per year become ill and over 9000 die as a result of food borne illness. It is our children and our seniors who suffer the most. Most of the food-related deaths occur in these two populations. 
   These incidents have scared us and have jump-started the efforts to do more to protect our nation's food supply. Now, I believe in free trade, but I also believe in fair trade. FDA's current system of testing import samples at ports of entry does not protect Americans. It is ineffective and resource-intensive. Less than 2 percent of imported food is being inspected under the current system. At the same time, the quantity of the imported foods continues to increase. 
   What this law does is simple: It improves food safety and aims at preventing food borne illness of all imported foods regulated by the FDA. This bill takes a long overdue, big first step. 
   First, it requires that FDA make equivalence determinations on imported food. This was developed with the FDA by Senator KENNEDY and myself in consultation with the consumer groups. 
   Today, FDA has no authority to protect Americans against imported food that is unsafe until it is too late. According to the GAO, the FDA lacks the authority to require that food coming into the U.S. is produced, prepared, packed or held under conditions that provide the same level of food safety protection as those in the U.S. This means that currently, food offered for import to the U.S., can be imported under any conditions, even if those conditions are unsanitary. The Imported Products Safety Improvement and Disease Prevention Act of 2000 will allow FDA to look at the production at its source. This means that FDA will be able to take preventive measures. FDA will be able to be proactive, rather than just reactive. 
   That means that when you pack your childrens' lunches for school or sit down at the dinner table, you can rest assured that your food will be safe. Whether your strawberries were grown in a foreign country or on the Eastern Shore, in Maryland, those strawberries will be held to the same standard. You won't have to worry or wonder where your food is coming from. You won't have to worry that your children or families are going to get sick. You will know that the food coming into this country will be subject to equivalent standards. 
   Second, this bill contains strong enforcement measures. Last year, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, under the leadership of Senator SUE COLLINS, held numerous hearings on the safety of imported food. These enforcement measures are largely a product of those facts uncovered during those hearings. 
   Finally, this bill covers emergency situations by allowing FDA to ban imported food that has been connected to outbreaks of food borne illness. When our children, parents and communities are getting seriously sick, the Secretary of Health and Human Services can immediately issue an emergency ban. We don't have to wait till someone else gets seriously sick or dies. We no longer have to go through the current bureaucratic mechanism that is inefficient and resource intensive. We can stop the food today, to protect our citizens. 
   My goal is to strengthen the food supply, whatever the source of the food may be. This bill won't create trade barriers. It just calls for free trade of safe food. It calls for international concern and consensus on guaranteeing standards for public health. 
   This bill is important because it will save lives and makes for a safer world. Everyone should have security in knowing that the food they eat is fit to eat. I look forward to working on a bipartisan basis to enact this legislation. I pledge my commitment to fight for ways to make America's food supply safer. This bill is an important step in that direction. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a summary be added to the RECORD.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, we are so fortunate to live in an era when modern medical breakthroughs are an almost common occurrence. Every day brings new research and insight into the human body and diseases that, unfortunately, affect our friends, families, co-workers, and ourselves. For example, there are several wonderful new therapies that help people with chronic diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and Hepatitis C live more active and pain-free lives. I am proud to be an original co-sponsor of the Access to Innovation for Medicare Patients Act (S. 2644), which would extend Medicare coverage to new self-injected biological therapies for these chronic diseases. 
   One of the most important things I do as a United States Senator is listen to the people and the stories of their lives. The story of one of my constituents, Judith Levinson of Rockville, Maryland, is a compelling example of the power of these new therapies. Judith was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) when she was 40 years old. At first, her fingers and toes swelled up and sent sharp pains into her arms and shoulders. Over the next few years, she had multiple surgeries to place artificial knuckles in her fingers, to fuse her thumbs, and to replace both of her wrists with steel rods. Her feet have also been affected. Judith had six surgeries on her feet because bone deterioration made walking very difficult and painful. She now wears a size 2 shoe because so much bone has been removed from her feet. Unfortunately, Judith's suffering did not end with the surgeries. During recovery, her hands had to be placed in cages in order to heal properly--which made her completely dependent on others for daily activities. On a scale of 1 to 10, Judith rated her daily pain as an 8. 
   In January of 1999, Judith's doctor prescribed a new self-injectable drug called Enbrel, which had just been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of advanced RA. I am proud to add that the Johns Hopkins University's Division of Rheumatology was instrumental in the development of this breakthrough therapy as one of its clinical trial sites. Judith says that, within five weeks, she had less swelling in her fingers and she had more energy. As she puts it, she is in ``go mode.'' I am happy to report that Judith has resumed writing, takes daily walks with her family without stopping at every street corner, and truly believes that this treatment has changed her life. 
   Judith is fortunate in that her insurance plan covers the cost of Enbrel, with a small co-payment. Medicare, on the other hand, does not allow coverage of self-administered injectable drugs. It covers only drugs that are administered in a physician's office. That means that many Medicare beneficiaries are going without treatment because they can't afford it themselves, or that they are treated with a therapy that is covered but may not be the most appropriate or effective treatment. That doesn't make sense. I am very proud that most of the breakthroughs in medicine today were invented in the United States. But breakthroughs alone aren't enough--I believe that every American ought to have access to those breakthroughs. Medicare patients are certainly no exception. 
   It is gratifying that this legislation is supported by a broad range of women, senior, minority, religious, rural, and health professional organizations like the Alliance for Aging Research, the American Public Health Association, the National Farmers Union, the Older Women's League (OWL), the National Hispanic Council on Aging, and more than a dozen other organizations. OWL, the only national membership organization that works on the issues unique to midlife and older women, has stressed the importance of access to innovative medical treatments for older women and urged Congress to recognize that ``73% of women on Medicare have two or more concurrent chronic conditions, which often lead to limitations in the activities of daily living and the need for long-term care. In order to improve the health of women suffering with chronic diseases ..... Congress should extend Medicare coverage to self-administered injectables.'' 
   Mr. President, we must ensure that Medicare beneficiaries have access to promising and innovative new therapies. This legislation will help thousands of people living with chronic conditions like RA, MS, and Hepatitis C live better, happier, and more productive lives. I urge my colleagues to join Senators GORTON, MURRAY, myself and the other co-sponsors in supporting it.

    Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to join my good friend and colleague, Senator SNOWE, to introduce the Women's Health Office Act of 2000. I'm pleased to join Senator SNOWE in introducing this bill because it establishes an important framework to address women's health within the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). 
   Historically, women's health needs were ignored or inadequately addressed by the medical establishment and the government. It is really only in the last ten years that the health of women has begun to receive more attention. A 1990 General Accounting Office (GAO) report acknowledged the historical pattern of neglect of women in health research, and especially the exclusion of women as research subjects in many clinical trials. This was unacceptable. Women make up half or more of the population and must be adequately included in clinical research. That's why I fought to establish the Office of Research on Women's Health (ORWH) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) ten years ago. We needed to ensure that women were included in clinical research, so that we would know how treatments for a particular disease or condition would affect women. Would men and women react the same way to a particular treatment for heart disease? We had no way of knowing because women were not being included in clinical trials. 
   While the ORWH began its work in 1990, I wanted to ensure that it stayed at NIH and had the necessary authority to carry out its mission of ensuring that women were included in clinical research. That's why I authored legislation in 1990 and 1991 to formally establish the ORWH in the Office of the Director of NIH. These provisions were later enacted into law in the NIH Revitalization Act of 1993. 
   Last year, Senator HARKIN, Senator SNOWE, and I requested that GAO examine how well the NIH and ORWH was carrying out the mandates under the NIH Revitalization Act of 1993. The results were mixed. While NIH had made substantial progress in ensuring the inclusion of women in clinical research, it had made less progress in encouraging the analysis of study findings by sex. This means that women are being included in clinical trials, but we are not able to fully reap the benefits of inclusion because analysis of how interventions affect men and women is not being done. While the NIH is taking steps to address this, we are missing information from research done over the last few years about how the outcomes of the research varied or not for men and women. 
   NIH is but one agency in the DHHS. Other agencies in DHHS do not even have women's health offices. How are these other agencies addressing women's health? Only NIH and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) have statutory authorization for offices dedicated to women's health. Other  agencies in HHS have a hodgepodge of women's health offices or advisors/coordinators, some of whom have experienced cuts in their funding. For example, funding for the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Office of Women's Health has decreased from $2 million in Fiscal Year 1995 to $1.6 million in Fiscal Year 2000. In addition, funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Office of Women's Health was cut more than 10% between Fiscal Year 1999 and Fiscal Year 2000. 
   I believe we need a consistent and comprehensive approach to address the needs of women's health in the DHHS. This bill that I join Senator SNOWE in introducing today would do just that. The Women's Health Office Act of 2000 would provide authorization for women's health offices in DHHS, CDC, the FDA, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), and the Health Resources and Serivces Administration (HRSA). 
   This legislation establishes an important framework and build on existing efforts. The HHS Office on Women's Health would take over all functions which previously belonged to the current Office of Women's Health of the Public Health Service. The HHS Office would be headed by a Deputy Assistant Secretary for Women's Health who would also chair an HHS Coordinating Committee on Women's Heath. The responsibilities of the HHS Office would include establishing short and long-term goals, advising the Secretary of HHS on women's health issues, monitoring and facilitating coordination and stimulating HHS activities on women's health, establishing a national Women's Health Information Center to facilitate exchange of and access to women's health information, and coordinating private sector efforts to promote women's health. 
   Under this legislation, the Offices of Women's Health in CDC, FDA, HRSA, and AHRQ would be housed in the office of the head of each agency and be headed by a Director appointed by the head of the respective agency. The offices would assess the current level of activity on women's health in the agency; establish short-term and long-term goals for women's health and coordinate women's health activities in the agency; identify women's health projects to support or conduct; consult with appropriate outside groups on the agency's policy regarding women; serve on HHS' Coordinating Committee on Women's Health; and establish and head a coordinating committee on women's health within the agency to identify womens' health needs and make recommendations to the head of the agency. The FDA office would also have specific duties regarding women and clinical trials. All the offices, including the HHS Office beginning no later than Jan. 31. 2002, would submit a report every two years to the appropriate Congressional committees documenting activities accomplished. In addition, the bill authorizes appropriations for all the offices through 2005 
   I believe that this bill will establish a valuable and consistent framework for addressing women's health in the Department of Health and Human Services. It will help to ensure that women's health research will continue to have the resources it needs in the coming years. This bill is a priority of the Women's Health Research Coalition. The Coalition is comprised of nearly three dozen academic centers, voluntary health associations and membership organizations with a strong focus on women's health research and gender-based biology. I encourage my colleagues to join Senator SNOWE and myself in supporting and cosponsoring this important legislation for women.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, yesterday I offered an amendment to the legislative branch appropriations bill commending the Capitol Police, and all the employees of the legislative branch, and recommending that we keep the Senate funding levels in conference. 
   I also complimented the outstanding leadership provided by Senator BENNETT, the Chair of the legislative appropriations subcommittee, as well as Senator FEINSTEIN, the ranking member of the subcommittee, who really moved this legislation in a way that I think meets the responsibilities we have to the American people. 
   The best way we can show our responsibility to the American people is to really let them know that the men and women who work at the U.S. Capitol are needed and valued. 
   My amendment is not about money, it is about morale. We want to say to the men and women who work at the U.S. Capitol that we know who you are and we value what you do. You are the men and women who work in this building for the American people. You serve the Nation. 
   The Capitol Police protect this building, which is a symbol of freedom and democracy the world over. The Capitol Police ensure that everyone who comes to the U.S. Capitol is safe and secure, including Members of Congress and staff. 
   The Capitol Police are brave. They are resourceful. They are tough. They are gallant. They protect you whether you are a foreign dignitary, such as Nelson Mandela, or a member of a Girl Scout troop from Maryland. 
   We need to make sure they have their jobs, they have their pay, they have their pension, and they have our respect. That is what my amendment is all about: To support the Capitol Police and the other employees of the legislative branch. 
   I was deeply disturbed at the House bill which cut over 1,700 employees of the legislative branch. This isn't about bureaucracy. The people we are talking about are the 117 people from the Congressional Research Service. That is the body that is absolutely dedicated to giving us unbiased, unpolitical, accurate information so we can make the best decisions in our approach to forming public policy. We turn to them for models for the Older Americans Act and for ideas on new technology breakthroughs to be pursued. We have to make sure we have the Congressional Research Service and that they have the staff they need to do their job. 
   Also under the House bill, 700 jobs would be cut from GAO. Every Member of the Senate who is fiscally prudent knows we need the GAO. It is not about keeping the books, but it is about keeping the books straight. We continually turn to the GAO to do investigations of waste and abuse, to give us insights on how to better manage and be better stewards of the taxpayers' funds. People with those kinds of skills could leave us in a nanosecond and move to the private sector. They could be ``dot.comers'' with no hesitation. 
   If we are going to be on the broadband of the future, we need to make sure we have the skills to run a contemporary Congress. We need to make sure they have security in their jobs and security in health benefits and in their pensions. We need to be sure we let those workers know we are on their side. 
   In addition to that, we want to make sure we acknowledge the role our own staffs play in constituent service and in helping us craft legislation. 
   Two years ago, we all endured a very melancholy event here in the Congress. Two very brave and gallant police officers literally put themselves in the line of fire to protect us. Their names were Officer Chestnut, from Maryland--his wife still lives over there at Fort Washington--and Detective Gibson, of Virginia, father of three--teenagers, college students. We mourn them. We consoled their families and said a grateful Congress will never forget. 
   We should not forget the men and women who work here, but the way we remember is with the right pay, the right benefits, and the right respect. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, my amendment in no way is a criticism of Senators BENNETT and FEINSTEIN. They did a fantastic job, not only in moving the bill but the way they have conducted the hearings and worked with Members on very sensitive issues. I commend them. Had the House done what Senators BENNETT and FEINSTEIN did, my amendment would not have been necessary.

<TEXT>
   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, that amendment is offered in behalf of myself, Senator DASCHLE, Senator MURRAY, Senator REID, Senator SARBANES, and Senator WELLSTONE. 
   The reason I wanted the amendment read is that I wanted to convey the importance that many of us feel in commending the employees who work here at the Capitol, both the police as well as other very important departments and divisions. 
   I first compliment Senator BENNETT and Senator FEINSTEIN for the outstanding job they have done on moving the legislative branch appropriations bill. This sense of the Senate is in no way a commentary on their leadership, which I think has been exemplary. I think their leadership has been sensitive to the needs of employees and sensitive to the needs of the taxpayers. So we thank you for the leadership you provided, first in terms of the adequacy of the resources to do the job and, second, stewardship over Federal funds. 
   Also, I particularly want to thank Senators FEINSTEIN and BENNETT for adding the report language on the need for an employee ombudsman for the employees of the Architect of the Capitol. I had come to their hearings, in which I was received with such collegiality that I am very grateful. But we wanted to problem-solve over what was happening to the restaurant employees who often believe they have nowhere to go with many of their problems. Essentially, my own office was becoming the EEO office for these employees. 
   I am ready to do that. I am ready to be the Senator from Maryland and I am ready to be the Senator for the restaurant employees. But I want the Architect of the Capitol and those who work for him to do their job so that our employees have the same type of ombudsman and opportunity for personnel  grievance that the private sector has. 
   I thank them for that. 
   Let me come back to my amendment. My amendment is a sense of the Senate. It is not about money, but it is about morale. We want to say to the men and women who work at the U.S. Capitol that we know who they are and we value what they do. 
   These are the men and women who work in this building for the American people and serve the Nation. The Capitol Police protect this building which is a symbol of freedom and democracy the world over. They protect all the people who visit the Capitol, and they protect Members of Congress. It is the Capitol Police who ensure that everyone who comes to the U.S. Capitol is safe and secure. They are the most unique law enforcement officers in the country. They protect the building, and they protect the people, and they do it whether you are an American citizen or a foreign dignitary. They protect you whether you are a Member of Congress or a member of a Girl Scout troop. 
   That is who they are. They are brave, they are resourceful, they are gallant, whether it is protecting a dignitary such as Nelson Mandela or a Girl Scout troop from Maryland. They protect us from crooks, terrorists, people who are deranged, and anyone else who wants to harm us or the Capitol. Also, each is Officer Friendly welcoming people from all over America and all over the world. 
   The Capitol is a tourist attraction. Why? Do they come because we are so compelling, so charismatic, so gifted? No, they come to see democracy in action. We are the greatest deliberative body in the world. Sometimes we act great, and sometimes we deliberate, and sometimes we even do something together. But people come to see us in action. Those police officers ensure this facility is open to the people, preserving safety, often giving guidance and direction, many even learning foreign languages to do it. 
   Under their community police mentality, do not think, because they greet visitors like Officer Friendly, that they are soft. Talk to the Capitol Police. We know, No. 1, that they are tough, they are competent, they are a modern police force. They take bomb squad training, they take antiterrorist training, and they also work to make sure they have the right approach to deal with each and every situation they may encounter. 
   We need to make sure they have their jobs, they have their pay, they have their benefits, and they have our respect. That is what the sense of the Senate resolution is all about: to support the Capitol Police and the other employees of the legislative branch. 
   The House was going to cut over 1,700 people and as many as 400 police officers, which is 25 percent of the force. That is unacceptable. Then they were going to cut 117 staff from the Congressional Research Service. I will say what the Congressional Research Service is. It is a group of people who are absolutely dedicated to giving us unbiased, accurate information and unbiased, accurate analysis so we can do our jobs. If we want to make some very good decisions on the best models for the Older Americans Act or new technology breakthroughs, we should ensure adequate funding for the Congressional Research Service. 
   I will talk about the jobs being cut at GAO, the Government Accounting Office. The Government Accounting Office is not about keeping the books, it is about keeping the books straight. 
   My colleagues and I know we continually turn to the staff at the Government Accounting Office to do investigations of waste and abuse, to give us insights into how better to manage and be better stewards of the taxpayers' funds. People with those kinds of skills could leave us in a wink and be at a dot com in less than a nanosecond. If we are going to be on the broadband of the future, we need to make sure we have the people with the skills to run a contemporary Congress. And, we need to make sure that these people 
   have security in their jobs and reliability of pay that they need to do just that. 
   I will now talk about our own congressional staff. They help us serve the Nation. We all know what the people who work for us do. They are the caseworkers who track down Social Security checks for our constituents; they help us answer our mail; and they help us draft legislation. It is the congressional staff who are now working, hopefully, to see that we pass a Medicare prescription drug benefit. It is the congressional staff who are now working around the clock so we can have a conference on the Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   Whether it's the Democratic side or the Republican side--the fact is that our staff is on our side so we can be on the people's side. We should not be cutting the very staff who help us get the job done. 
   We should not forget the restaurant workers, the custodial staff, and the facility managers who ensure the U.S. Capitol is a building that is comfortable, clean, and safe to visit. 
   We know about the draconian cuts in the House. Rumor has it they are going to restore some of those cuts. Good, because I would say to them, shame on them for what they were doing. 
   Do my colleagues know what the House intended to do? They intended to cut 400 Capitol Police officers, 114 employees from the Congressional Research Service, and 700 employees from GAO--1,700 people could have lost their jobs. 
   This is not about job security, this is about maintaining the safety, security, and cleanliness of the Capitol and the competency of staff so we can do our job. 
   I hope we adopt this amendment 100-0. 
   I close my remarks by saying that the reason I am offering this sense of the Senate amendment is so we know and show the people who work here every day that we are on their side. I believe Senators BENNETT and FEINSTEIN showed that by putting the money in the Federal checkbook, to show there is money which hopefully ensures a high level of morale. 
   I am also offering this sense of the Senate amendment because we need to keep our promises. A short time ago, we had two gallant police officers die in the line of duty--Officer Chestnut from Maryland and Detective Gibson from Virginia. We all attended their memorial services. We mourned them. We tried to console their families. We thanked them for their sacrifice, and we said that a grateful Congress will never forget. We should not forget Officer Chestnut, and we should not forget Detective Gibson. We should not forget the men and women who work here every day, in every way, in their own way dedicating their lives to serving us. 
   I hope we adopt this sense of the Senate amendment. Again, I thank Senators BENNETT and FEINSTEIN for their leadership. 
   I yield the floor.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, last Sunday, I joined hundreds of thousands of Americans in marching in support of common-sense gun safety laws. Today we're trying to show that these marchers made a difference. We can either listen to the mothers and fathers who marched with their feet--or we can listen to the gun lobby--who march with their dollars. 
   The Daschle amendment says that we're listening to the Million Mom  marchers. It merely calls on the Congress to do it's job--to convene the Juvenile Justice Conference and pass common-sense gun safety laws. 
   Since I've been in Congress I have fought for gun control and gun safety. We passed the Brady bill--which requires a 5-day waiting period so there can be background checks of gun purchasers. This law has stopped 242,000 felons from buying guns. We fought to ban certain types of semi-automatic assault weapons and cop killer bullets. 
   For ten months, our gun safety proposals have been in legislative limbo. The Senate passed the Juvenile Justice Bill in July 1999. Since then, the Republican leadership has refused to let us move the bill forward. 
   During this time, we've seen 3,600 children die from gun violence. We've seen twelve children die every day from gunfire. In Maryland, we've mourned the death of over 100 children a year. In Maryland we saw a crazed man steal five guns--and murder four people--before holding a family and a community hostage. 
   The Juvenile Justice bill includes common-sense gun safety provisions. It would close the gun show loophole--by requiring background checks for all guns bought at gun shows. It would require gun safety locks to be sold with new guns. It would close the loophole in the law that permits the importation and possession of high-capacity ammunition clips. It would keep guns out of the hands of serious juvenile offenders by banning gun sales to juveniles with violent crime records. Finally, it would ban juvenile possession of semi-automatic assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition clips. 
   The State of Maryland is the national leader in gun safety. I commend Governor Glendenning and the Maryland General Assembly for passing path-breaking gun safety legislation. The new Maryland law will require built-in child safety locks on new hand guns; ballistics testing for new guns--to help law enforcement and safety training for new gun purchasers. This legislation is the first of its kind in the Nation. It will save lives. The United States Congress should follow Maryland's lead--and enact common-sense gun safety legislation. 
   Mr. President: I was so proud to join thousands of Marylanders in the Million Mom March. Let's show that the march mattered. Let's make democracy work--and pass the Daschle amendment.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for her leadership and her advocacy on this issue. 
   I was so proud to march with her on The Mall with the mothers and the fathers and the good men who supported the women. We were proud. Why were we proud? Because the people marching believed marching made a difference. They thought if they could go out and march with their feet instead of people marching with their money into these lobbying events that are held here, they could make a difference. I thank the Senator for responding to their marching feet. 
   I stand with her, along with the people who were there from Maryland. I congratulate her because we are making democracy work. If we don't march on this floor and pass this amendment, I really say to the voters of America, march into the voting booth and get a Congress that will respond to marching feet instead of marching to millions of dollars.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, this is an exceptionally difficult decision. 
   But after weighing the pros and cons of this legislation, I rise to support the Trade and Development Act. 
   It is high time that we address economic growth in Africa and the Caribbean. Africa, in particular, has been ignored for far too long. I would like to support this effort to encourage economic growth, investment and trade in the region while recognizing that this effort alone is not enough. It should only be a small piece of our policy in Africa. Much more must be done. 
   I have considered the impact this measure will have on American workers. I am a blue-collar Senator. My heart and soul lies with blue-collar America. I spent most of my life in a blue-collar neighborhood. My career in public service is one of deep commitment to working-class people. I have fought and continue to fight for economic growth, jobs and opportunities in America--in particular--in my own State of Maryland. And in the last decade, working people have faced the loss of jobs, lower wages and a reduced standard of living, and a shrinking manufacturing base--everything that the critics say. But voting against the Trade and Development Act will not save those jobs or bring those jobs back. 
   I also care about working-class people all over the world. I applaud my colleagues for uniting to pass Senator HARKIN's amendment to meet and enforce internationally recognized standards that eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Countries can only enjoy the benefits granted under this Act if they take action to eliminate work that harms the health, safety or morals of children. Benefits will not be given to sub-Saharan or Caribbean countries that carry out hazardous child labor practices, such as slavery, debt bondage, forced or compulsory labor, child prostitution or drug trafficking. This effort is especially relevant to this trade legislation because out of the 250 million children between the ages of 5 and 14 who are working in the developing world--one-third are in Africa. 
   This Act could have been further strengthened. I supported other amendments toward that aim, which were not incorporated into this legislation. I see several yellow flashing lights that we cannot ignore and we must address with our trading partners in sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean. 
   Even though the worst forms of child labor were addressed in this legislation, additional efforts still need to be undertaken to protect the rights, welfare, health and safety of all workers. I supported amendments offered by my colleagues to ensure the enforcement of internationally recognized core labor standards and to establish a labor side agreement before this legislation could go into effect. Neither amendment was adopted. 
   Furthermore, much more needs to be done to protect our environment. Dangerous or haphazard practices that damage the environment in sub-Saharan African or the Caribbean not only harm territory within these regions--it affects all of us. We cannot continue to ignore the environment in trade agreements. We must find a way to ensure that economic growth does not come at the expense of the environment. 
   In addition, much more must be done to provide debt relief to Africa and to prevent and address the HIV/AIDS crisis plaguing the region. 
   Taking into account these considerations, I still believe that we have a unique opportunity to support legislation that works toward free trade and fair trade. This Act strives to create economic growth, jobs and opportunities in sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean. It encourages African nations to compete and to institute market-oriented economic reforms. It also works to strengthen America's economy and to create American jobs by increasing US exports and investment to these regions. 
   I agree that the Trade and Development Act as it stands does not encompass numerous other measures that America needs to undertake with respect to Africa and the Caribbean. But it is a courageous first-step and it merits our support.

    Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the life of Myra Lenard. She was a daughter of Polonia who played an important role in the life of America. 
   Myra Lenard was born in Poland and immigrated to America as a young girl. Like so many new Americans--she embraced her new country while never forgetting her homeland. 
   Myra had a long career as a successful business woman and community volunteer. I got to know her because of our shared commitment to our proud Polish heritage. As the executive director of the Polish American Congress, she was one of our strongest voices for the people of Poland who were forced behind the Iron Curtain. We worked together to provide humanitarian relief and to support the growing democracy movement. She was one of Solidarity's best friends in America. 
   During the darkest days of martial law in Poland, Myra led the Polish American Congress' ``Solidarity Convoy,'' in which 32 container trucks provided $10 million worth of supplies for the suffering people of Poland. This showed the Polish people that they were not alone. 
   When Poland became free, Myra began her tireless efforts to rebuild Poland and to enable it to take its rightful place among Western democratic nations. This effort didn't begin in 1998--when the issue started to make headlines. It began in 1989, when Congress passed legislation to provide assistance to the new democracies of central Europe. It was a long process of educating Congress and the American people on how Poland's membership in NATO would contribute to America's security. Myra was there every step of the way. She was gentle but extremely persuasive. She was creative in tapping into the energy of the Polish American community who understand the history, and cared so deeply. 
   Myra Lenard's life was a triumph. Her legacy is her family, as well as the deep friendship and alliance between the United States and a free, democratic Poland. I will miss her friendship and her counsel. Her beloved husband Cas and their children are in my thoughts and prayers.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to support the conference report on satellite reform. As a co-sponsor of the original bill, I believe this bi-partisan legislation will encourage more competition in the satellite communications market. This will benefit American consumers and workers. It will also make America more competitive in the global satellite market. 
   The Open-market Reorganization for the Betterment of International Telecommunications Act (ORBIT bill) will benefit our nation in a number of ways. First, the bill allows Lockheed Martin to acquire 100% of COMSAT Corporation by removing a number of old and outdated regulatory barriers. This is great news for these two outstanding Maryland companies and their employees. The merger will encourage growth and economic competition in one of the most dynamic sectors of our economy--the global satellite market. It means jobs today and jobs tomorrow--both in Maryland and throughout our nation. I look forward to Lockheed Martin and COMSAT completing their merger without any further delay. 
   Second, this legislation encourages the privatization of INTELSAT, an inter-governmental organization, by including the leverage necessary to ensure that INTELSAT's privatization will conclude in a timely and pro-competitive manner. 
   Third, the conference agreement also reaffirms the ability of carriers to obtain Level III direct access. Level III direct access allows customers to enter into contractual agreements with INTELSAT to order, receive and pay for INTELSAT space segment capacity at the same rate that INTELSAT charges its signatories. This means that users of INTELSAT services will be able to purchase services directly from INTELSAT without going through COMSAT. 
   Fourth, the bill does not remove the current prohibition on Level IV direct access until after INTELSAT privatizes. Allowing Level IV access before privatization would have unfairly and unjustly permitted COMSAT's competitors to buy all of COMSAT's investment in INTELSAT below market value which would have weakened the value of this international asset. This would have significantly diminished the value of the Lockheed-COMSAT transaction. 
   I commend my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in the Senate and in the House for passing S. 376 and commend the President for signing this important legislation into law.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, the amendment is very simple. It states it is the sense of the Senate that the Federal budget will provide the framework and the funding necessary to ensure that all Americans cross the digital divide. 
   The goal of the legislation is to ensure that every child is computer literate by the eighth grade, regardless of race, ethnicity, income, gender, geography, or disability. It is the single most empowering tool we could pass this year. 
   This amendment would increase funds for teacher training and school technology, create 1,000 community-based tech centers, strengthen tax incentives for public-private partnerships, create an e-Corps within AmeriCorps, and be able to make wise and prudent use of Federal funds. 
   It will be absolutely crucial to get our children ready to be able to leapfrog into the future and participate in the new economy. 
   Mr. President, I really do hope the Senate will adopt this. If we could come to an agreement on a voice vote to accept it, I would be delighted and not insist on a rollcall vote. 
   I yield the floor.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. I am ready to do it anyway. Thanks to you and the Democratic leadership, President Bill Clinton, and AL GORE, we are talking about a plan to cross the digital divide. A few minutes earlier, Senator CHUCK ROBB of Virginia spoke eloquently and persuasively about how we needed to deal with the problem of wiring schools in the United States. I absolutely support that Robb amendment because we have schools that are deteriorating, and they are in such bad shape we can't wire them for the Internet. 
   While we are creating a new physical infrastructure for our schools, we also need to look to the future. We want to help our children by making sure that public education gets them ready for the new future and a new economy. This is why I believe very strongly that no child in the United States of America should ever face the digital divide. 
   What is the digital divide? The divide is between those who have access to technology and who have access to learning and how to use the technology. If you are on the right side and have access to technology, and access to those who will teach you how to use it, both as a person and a community, you will feel very empowered and have a bright future. But if you are on the wrong side of the divide, where you don't have access to technology--Mr. President, the Senate is not in order.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   What I was talking about was that if you have access to technology and access to those who can teach you technology, your future as a person, a community, and even our country, is bright. But if you are on the wrong side of the divide and don't have access to technology, and will never know how to learn to use technology, your future is quite dismal and, as a person, you could end up functionally obsolete in the United States of America. 
   The Presiding Officer comes from the State of Washington, which is one of the most robust, high-tech States in the United States of America. He knows from his conversations with those tech tycoons that what we are facing in the United States of America is a workforce shortage of people who know how to use technology. Also, not only in the new ``dot-coms'' or the new ``dot-commers,'' what we also face is a skill shortage, even in the old economy. 
   In my own hometown of Baltimore, where they make steel or build automobiles, we have gone from smokestacks to ``cyberstacks.'' Walk with me along the minivan plant in Baltimore or come with me in the steaming steelmills of Baltimore, and you will see steelworkers and automobile workers are now tech workers. 
   I want to be sure that every person in the United States of 
   America is ready for that new economy. That is why we want to emphasize K through 12. We will practice the basics from K through 12. We are going to ensure that no child is left out or left behind in this new economy. We want to practice in the budget the ABCs. We want to make sure there is universal access to technology in schools, libraries, and community centers. We want to practice the ``B'' which is the ``best'' trained teachers. We also want to practice a ``C'' called ``computer'' literacy for every child by the time they finish the eighth grade. 
   Those are our national goals. That is what I hope we are able to do. But in order to do that, we have to put our resources with our national commitment. 
   First of all, I truly believe that the Government cannot do this alone. That is why an amendment I will be offering later on will put aside $200 million in tax incentives to encourage public-private partnership. 
   Why is this important? Because the Government can't do it alone. The private sector is already doing important, exciting work, and improving access to technology. But technology empowerment can't be limited to a few ZIP Codes, or recycled factories, where great work is being done in my own hometown. We need to encourage private sector donations of high-quality technology, sponsorship of community centers, and the sponsorship of training. I have seen many examples in my own hometown. 
   While we look forward to providing technology, one of the most important things is to make sure our teachers are trained. If our teachers are not trained, our technology could end up in closets and our children could be left not learning what they need to learn. The budget amendment calls for $600 million for teacher training. 
   Everywhere I go, teachers tell me they want to help their students cross the digital divide. But they need the training to do this. Technology without training is a hollow opportunity. 
   In my own home State of Maryland, the superintendent of public education established what we call a ``tech academy'' so that public schoolteachers could come from across the State to learn how to use this. Guess what. Six hundred teachers came and 400 had to be turned away. We now have an incredible waiting list. 
   No teacher should have to stand in line to learn how to use technology so they can teach children how to use technology. This is why we want to make sure that young people coming up in our teacher schools learn technology. Those teachers who are the fourth grade reading specialists should know as much about technology as some computer whiz. 
   In addition to that, our amendment provides access--$400 million--for school technology and school libraries, for hardware and software technology everywhere. We want to make sure our school libraries are high-tech media centers. 
   Why is this important? 
   In my own community, in some schools we have a ratio of one computer per five children. 
   To the Senator from Georgia, I would note that in some of our private schools it will be mandated that every child come with a laptop. 
   But I say to my colleague and others who are listening, if you are a poor child, it is more likely you live in a poor 
   neighborhood. The poor neighborhood has poorer schools. They do not have technology in their classroom or a media center in their library. 
   Please, in the United States of America, with all the money we are going to spend in this budget, let's put $400 million to be sure our schools and our libraries do have the hardware and software where they need it. 
   Our children don't only learn in schools and in libraries, though those are crucial places. Many of them learn out in the community. This is why our amendment will provide $100 million to create 1,000 community technology centers. Community leaders have told me that we need to bring technology to where the children learn. They don't learn only in schools; they learn in communities. 
   I saw for myself what technology meant to a community center at a public housing project. The adults learned technology during the day and the children learned technology through structured afterschool activities sponsored by the Boys and Girls Clubs in the afternoon. 
   In my own town of Baltimore, I spoke to the Urban League to see what they were doing to help get our children ready for the future. They told me they had to forage for funds, and there was not one Federal dollar available to help the Urban League help those children get ready for the future. 
   Certainly, if we can spend $18,000 a year on one person in prison, we can spend the money to create 1,000 community centers to keep our children in school and get ready for the new economy. 
   Mr. President, in addition to that, speaking of the Boys and Girls Clubs, we are including in our amendment Senator BIDEN's excellent proposal to provide $20 million to place computers and trained personnel in those Boys and Girls Clubs. What a tremendous opportunity. 
   In April we are celebrating Boys and Girls Clubs Month. There are great alumni from the Boys and Girls Club. Michael Jordan is one; President Bill Clinton went to one when his mother worked as a nurse and the Boys and Girls Clubs was one of his afterschool activities. Boys and Girls Clubs have been training and helping young people stay on the right track for a number of years. We not only want to teach them about hoop dreams; we want to team them about technology. This is why this is so crucial. 
   We will also provide $25 million to create an e-Corps within AmeriCorps. This will provide funds for 2,000 volunteers to teach technology in their schools and community centers. 
   In addition, we want to make sure we provide private sector deployment of broadband networks in underserved urban and rural communities. We need these funds to build the super information highway with on and off ramps for all. 
   I have in my State the Mountain Counties, a nice tourism word for Appalachia. With the old economy fading in coal mining and without the railroad jobs and so on, we are trying to  create a super information highway there. Guess what. If you are a constituent in Cumberland, your on and off ramp is in Pittsburgh. This makes service slow and unreliable. It slows down e-commerce and prevents new jobs from coming to an area that badly needs them. These funds will be used to help the private sector bring the super information highway to every 
   corner. 
   We need to test new ways to bring technology into the home, with innovative applications. We need to look out for Native Americans. We are living in a very exciting time. The opportunities are tremendous to use technology to improve our lives, to use technology to remove the barriers caused by income, race, ethnicity, or geography. If we can help every one of our children and make sure they cross this digital divide, this will be the most important legislation this United States can pass. It will be as important as the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Technology is the tool, but empowerment is the outcome. 
   It could mean, through the work we do here, the death of distance as a barrier for economic development. But it also could mean the death of discrimination because poor children and children of color would be able to leapfrog into the future. 
   My amendment takes the Federal dollars and makes public investments in our schools, our community-based organizations, our libraries, our teachers, and, most of all, our children. At the right time, I will be offering my amendment. That is, indeed, a brief summary of this amendment. 
   Obviously, this isn't the most compelling thing on Senators' minds, and it is disappointing I have had to speak in an environment where everybody else's conversation was more important than the person speaking. That is OK because deep down I know America is listening. Deep down, I know this is a very important coalition issue. It brings people together of all different geographies, rural and urban, whether poor white or a child from a family of African, Latino, or Native American background. It also means if you are disabled, you will be able to learn the tools needed to ensure, though you might have a physical disability, you will not have barriers. 
   This amendment is about hope. This amendment is about opportunity. This amendment is about one more rung on the opportunity ladder of the United States of America. I think it has broad-based appeal on a bipartisan basis. I hope when the time comes to offer my amendment and when we have a rollcall vote, the men and women of the Senate will vote to ensure that our children can have a future and many children can leapfrog into the future, leaving behind the legacies of poverty. 
   I yield the floor.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise on an issue of critical importance to seniors in Maryland and across the United States. That issue is the need for Medicare coverage of prescription drugs. 
   ``Honor your father and mother'' is not only a good commandment to live by, it is a good public policy to govern by. It should be a priority not only in the federal law books, but in the federal checkbook. And I believe that providing a Medicare drug benefit is a perfect way of honoring our fathers and mothers. That is why I'm proud to stand in support of Senator ROBB's amendment, which says that a Medicare drug benefit is more important than tax cuts. 
   The Medicare Program has been a tremendous success story. It has reduced poverty among the elderly by almost two-thirds since it was created in 1965. But the world has changed in the last 35 years. In 1965, people feared the costs of hospitalization. One major illness, which years ago often resulted in a hospital stay of several weeks or even months, could bankrupt many families. Today, people fear the costs of chronic care. They need help with the costs of prescription drugs that control chronic conditions and keep people out of the hospital. Many of these life-saving medicines are the result of American medical science and breakthroughs made in this country. I feel very strongly that all Americans should have access to those breakthroughs. We must act now to ensure that they do. 
   In my home state of Maryland, almost 560,000 seniors rely on Medicare. That number is likely to increase to more than 1 million people by the year 2025. Unfortunately, 3 in every 4 of those seniors does not have decent, dependable private sector drug coverage today. At least one-third don't have any drug coverage at all, and their options for getting coverage are limited. Joining a Medicare HMO is an option for some, but not for seniors in the 17 rural counties of my state. And the other alternative, which is buying a Medigap policy, is expensive. The monthly premium for a policy with drug benefits averages about $136 nationwide, which means that Medigap policies are out of reach for many. 
   One of the most important things I do as a United States Senator is listen to the people and the stories of their lives. And the problems people are having getting the drugs they need is something I've heard a lot about lately. In the last 6 months, I've gotten more than 200 letters and literally thousands of telephone calls from seniors and their families about the hardships that the high cost of prescription drugs and lack of insurance coverage are causing them. For example, an 84 year old woman from the Eastern Shore who is blind and has diabetes told me that she takes 11 medicines every day and is spending $275 of her $800 monthly income on prescription drugs. The son of a 91 year old woman wrote me to say that his mother spends one-third of her income on her medications, and often takes her daily medicine every other day to make it last longer. This is simply unacceptable. Prescription medicines are now an essential part of modern medicine, and are an essential thread that must be woven into the safety net for seniors. 
   Thanks to the leadership of Senator DASCHLE, Senate Democrats have come together to agree on basic principles that should serve as a blueprint for action. We have agreed that a Medicare drug benefit should be: 
   1. Voluntary: Medicare beneficiaries who now have dependable, affordable prescription drug coverage should be able to stick with what they've got. 
   2. Accessible: A hallmark of Medicare is that all beneficiaries have access to dependable health care. The same should hold true of a prescription drug benefit. 
   3. Meaningful: A Medicare drug benefit should make a difference in the lives of seniors by helping protect them from excessive out-of-pocket costs. 
   4. Affordable: The benefit should be affordable both for beneficiaries and for the Medicare program. Medicare should contribute enough toward the prescription drug premium to make it affordable and attractive for all beneficiaries and to ensure the viability of the benefit. Low-income beneficiaries should receive extra help with prescription drug premiums and cost sharing. 
   This amendment simply says that we must provide a Medicare prescription drug benefit before we provide tax cuts. And I think that shows that we've got our priorities in the right order. The constituents who have written and called me to ask why they or their parents can't get the medicines they need don't want to hear about a tax cut. They want to hear that Medicare covers prescription drugs. That's why I will continue to fight to make access to prescription medicines a reality for seniors in Maryland and across the nation, and why I urge my colleagues to join me in support of Senator ROBB's amendment. Thank you.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise as a proud cosponsor of this important amendment for women who are diagnosed with breast and cervical cancer through the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (NBCCEDP) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). I am pleased to join Senators CHAFEE, SNOWE, GRASSLEY, HARKIN, and others in support of this amendment. This amendment says that we Senators believe that we should pass legislation to provide Medicaid coverage for certain women screened and found to have breast or cervical cancer under the CDC screening program. 
   Through March 31, 1999, the CDC screening program has provided more than one million mammograms and almost 1.2 million Pap tests. Among the women screened, over 6,200 cases of breast cancer and over 550 cases of cervical cancer have been diagnosed. Right now, the CDC screening program does not pay for breast and cervical cancer treatment services, but it does require participating states to provide treatment services. 
   The late Senator John Chafee, Senator SNOWE, Senator MOYNIHAN, and I along with others introduced the Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act of 1999 (S. 662) which currently has 57 cosponsors. This bill gives states the option to provide Medicaid coverage for breast and cervical cancer treatment to eligible women who were screened and diagnosed with these cancers through the CDC screening program. It is not a mandate for states. It is the Federal Government saying to the States ``we will help you provide treatment services to these women, if you decide to do so.'' I am pleased to be working with the bipartisan team of Senators LINCOLN CHAFEE, SNOWE, GRASSLEY, and MOYNIHAN to pass this important legislation. 
   Women screened and diagnosed through the CDC screening program depend on staff and volunteer time to find free or more affordable treatment; they depend on the generosity of doctors, nurses, hospitals, and clinics who provide them with free or reduced-cost treatment. The demands of managed care can also make it more difficult for physicians to provide free or reduced-fee services. In the end, thousands of people who run local screening programs are spending countless hours finding treatment services for women diagnosed with breast and cervical cancer. I salute the individuals who spend their time and resources to help these women. But we must not force these women to rely on the goodwill of others. Right now, the CDC is only screening 12-15 percent of the women who are eligible. As more women are screened, treatment efforts will become even more difficult. The lack of coverage for treatment services has hurt the program's ability to recruit providers, further restricting the number of women screened. 
   In short, it is clear that the short-term, ad-hoc strategies of providing treatment have broken down. Because there is no coverage for treatment, state programs are having a hard time recruiting providers; volunteers are spending a disproportionate amount of time finding treatment for women; and fewer women are receiving treatment. We can't expand the program to serve the other 85 percent of eligible women if we can't promise treatment to those we already screen. 
   The CDC screening program is celebrating its 10th anniversary in 
   2000. I am proud to be the Senate architect of the legislation that created the breast and cervical cancer screening program at the CDC. Over ten years ago we saw a need--low-income women were not receiving basic well-woman care--they were not getting their mammograms and Pap smears to detect breast and cervical cancer. At that time, I and others wanted to ensure that we not only diagnosed these low-income women with breast and cervical cancer, but that we also provided treatment for those cancers. But 10 years ago, we had great deficits and we simply did not have the money for a treatment component of the CDC screening program. So we made a down payment. We took the first step with the belief that it would not be the only step. Well, now the time has come to take the next step and include Federal resources for treatment for women who are diagnosed with breast and cervical cancer through the CDC screening program. 
   There are three reasons why we should act now to pass this important legislation. First, times have changed since the creation of the CDC screening program ten years ago. We are now running annual surpluses, instead of annual deficits. We have the resources to provide treatment to these women. I think we ought to put our money into ensuring that we save lives. Second, prevention, screening, and early detection are very important, but alone they do not stop deaths. Screening must be coupled with treatment to reduce cancer mortality. Finally, it is only right to provide Federal resources to treat breast and cervical cancer for those screened and diagnosed with these cancers through a Federal screening program. 
   I am proud that my own state of Maryland realized the importance of providing treatment services to women who were screened through the CDC screening program. Maryland appropriates over $6 million in state funds annually for the Breast and Cervical Cancer Diagnostic and Treatment Program for eligible low income Maryland women. The program has provided services to over 15,650 women in Maryland, including eligible women screened through the CDC screening program and eligible women screened outside the CDC program. The breast cancer mortality rate in Maryland has started to decline, in part because of programs like the CDC's. But not all states have the resources to do what Maryland has done. That's why this bill is needed. 
   This bill is the best long-term solution. It is strongly supported by the National Breast Cancer Coalition; the American Cancer Society; the National Association of Public Hospitals and Health Systems; the National Partnership for Women and Families; YWCA; National Women's Health Network; the American Medical Women's Association, and many more. 
   I urge the Senate Finance Committee to take up this legislation before Mother's Day and I urge the Senate leadership to promptly bring it to the full Senate for consideration. The Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act (S. 662) has 57 bipartisan cosponsors. President Clinton has included funding in his 2001 budget to give states the option of providing Medicaid coverage to women who have been diagnosed with breast or cervical cancer through the CDC screening program. The Commerce Committee of the House of Representatives has already unanimously approved this legislation (H. R. 1070). 
   We must act now to provide a treatment opportunity to all women who are diagnosed with breast or cervical cancer through the CDC screening program. Breast and cervical cancer treatment is not a partisan issue. It's a family issue. It affects mothers, sisters, and daughters, and their fathers, husbands, and children. I can't think of any better way to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program than by passing the Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this important amendment.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President. I oppose the burning of our Nation's flag. I oppose it today as I always have. I am deeply concerned about the desecration of the United States flag because of what it says about our culture, our values and our patriotism. 
   Our flag is the lasting symbol of America. To me, every thread in every American flag represents individuals who have laid down their lives in the name of freedom and democracy. 
   Yet I cannot support an Amendment to the United States Constitution which would, for the first time in our nation's history, narrow the reach of the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of speech. Instead of expanding the rights of Americans, this Amendment would constrict the freedoms which we fought so hard to win. 
   Instead, we should enact legislation that accomplishes the same goal--without trampling on our fundamental American rights. I have voted several times for legislation that would have provided protection of the flag through a statute, rather than a Constitutional amendment. 
   Senator MCCONNELL offered an alternative that sought to create a statutory solution that could have passed the muster of the Supreme Court. The McConnell amendment would have provided for fines or imprisonment for anyone who destroys a flag with the intent to incite violence or breach of peace. This amendment would have protected both our flag and our Constitution. I'm disappointed that it did not pass. 
   Our flag is a symbol of the principles that have kept our country strong and free. When we think of our flag, we think of everything that is good about this country--patriotism, courage, loyalty, duty and honor. Our responsibility is to live up to these standards--and to foster a new sense of citizenship and a new sense of duty. 
   We should honor our flag by rekindling these principles--not by amending our Constitution.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Today, I introduce the Digital Empowerment Act. The goal of this legislation is to ensure that every child is computer literate by the eighth grade regardless of race, ethnicity, income, gender, geography, or disability. 
   Yesterday, the Senate's Education Committee voted for my amendment to establish this as our national goal. This vote was taken on a bipartisan basis and was unanimous. Today, I am introducing this legislation to make this goal a reality. This bill has been a team effort. I reached out to the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, the Congressional Black Caucus, to my colleagues, the people throughout Maryland, ministers in Baltimore, business leaders, educators, and political leadership. Why? It is because a digital divide exists in America. Those who have access to technology and know how to use it will be ready for the new digital economy. Those who don't will be left out and left behind. 
   Low-income urban and rural families are less likely to have access to the Internet and computers. Black and Hispanic families are only two-fifths as likely to have Internet access as their white counterparts. Some schools have 10 computers in every classroom. In other schools, there are 200 students who share one computer. The private sector is doing important and exciting work, such as Power Up from AOL, but technology empowerment can't be limited to a few zip codes. What we need is a national policy and national programs. 
   Mr. President, I believe the best antipoverty program is an education. If we practice the ABCs, we will ensure that our children have a good education and will cross this digital divide. Crossing the digital divide is about technology and about children having access to technology. It is about teachers knowing how to teach children the tools of technology so they can cross this digital divide. 
   The ABCs are simply this: Access--each child must have universal access to computers, whether it is in a school, a library, or a community center. Many families cannot afford to buy computers for their homes, but children in America should have access to them through public institutions. 
   We also need to practice the B--best-trained teachers and, I might add, better-paid teachers. 
   But C would be computer literacy for all students by the time they finish eighth grade. 
   My Digital Empowerment Act will, first of all, create a one-stop shop for Federal education technology programs at the Department of Education. Why do we need this? Well, right now, our programs are scattered throughout the Department. School superintendents have to forage to be able to find that information, and when they do, they find the funding is absolutely spartan or skimpy. That is why my legislation also improves our schools in terms of access to technology and teacher training. 
   Teachers want to help their students cross the digital divide, but they are facing three major problems. One, they need technology. They need hardware and software. They need training to use the technology because without training of the teachers or librarians, it is a hollow opportunity. 
   In my own home State of Maryland, over 600 teachers from across the State volunteered to participate in a tech-prep academy so they could be ready. But hundreds were turned away. For every one teacher who can sign up for tech-prep training, four or five are standing in line to do so. 
   My bill addresses these concerns. We are going to double funding for school technology and for teacher training. We now spend less than half a billion dollars on training and technology for our schools. We would double that to $850 million. But we also have to make sure we go where children learn, and that is in 
   the community. Right now, what we find is that the only reliable source of revenue for wiring schools and libraries is the E-rate. But, the E-rate does not go to community centers. 
   Whether it is an African-American church or a community center in an Appalachian region or rural parts of the South or the upper regions of Alaska, what my legislation would do is help community centers. My legislation would create an E-corps within the AmeriCorps national service program. It would bring AmeriCorps volunteers with special technology training into our schools and into our communities. 
   I recently had a town hall meeting in an elementary school in Riverdale, MD. The teachers and students told me they need extra pairs of hands to help out in the computer lab to be able to teach the children. Also, we want to create 1,000 community tech centers. Community leaders have told me we need to bring technology to where kids learn, not just where we want them to learn. Our legislation would create 1,000 community-based centers that would be run by community organizations such as the YMCA and YWCA, Urban League, or a faith-based organization, where children could be there for structured afterschool activities, and also adults could be there earlier in the day to develop their job skills. 
   Government cannot do this alone. We want public-private partnerships. I want to use our Tax Code to encourage public-private partnerships. This bill uses our Tax Code to encourage the donations of technology, technology training, and technology maintenance for schools, libraries and community centers. 
   Mr. President, that is the core of our program. We are living in exciting times. The opportunities are tremendous to use technology to improve our lives, to use technology to remove the barriers caused by income, race, or ethnicity. Technology could mean the death of distance as a barrier for bringing jobs into the rural areas of our country. We want technology to be the death of discrimination where children have been left out or left aside. Bringing this technology into schools and libraries would enable children to leapfrog into the future. 
   Technology is the tool, but empowerment is the outcome. We want to be sure each child in the United States of America, by being computer literate by the time they are in the eighth grade, will be ready for the new economy. We hope that by setting that as a national goal we will get children to stay in school and know that the future lies in working in this new economy. 
   I thank everybody who worked on this bill with me. I thank everyone on my staff who helped me, including Julia Frifield, Jill Shapiro, and Andrea Vernot. This has truly been a team effort. I am pleased that I have 25 cosponsors from the U.S. Senate on this legislation. I hope that kind of bipartisan support will move this legislation forward. 
   I will conclude by saying this is a tremendous opportunity. This is not about a laundry list of new Government programs. We are here to make the highest and best use of the programs that exist, a wise and prudent use of taxpayer funds, and also to say to each child in America if you want to learn and get ready for the new economy, your Federal Government is on your side. 
   I give all praise and thanks to the Dear Lord who has inspired me to do this and gives me the opportunity to serve in the Senate. I truly believe one person can make a difference. I am trying to do that with this legislation. If we can work together, I know we will be able to bring about change--change for our children and change for the better.

    Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today as a proud cosponsor of the ``Federal Employees and Uniformed Services Group Long-Term Care Insurance Act of 2000.'' This important piece of legislation represents a carefully considered compromise between several bills currently pending in the Senate. 
   I would like to thank Senator CLELAND and Senator GRASSLEY for all of their hard work in coming to a consensus on how best to provide federal and military employees, retirees, and their families with the opportunity to purchase long-term care insurance. 
   Since my first days in Congress, I have been fighting to help people afford the burdens of long-term care. Ten years ago, I introduced legislation to change the cruel rules that forced elderly couples to go bankrupt before  they could get any help in paying for nursing home care. Because of my legislation, AARP tells me that we've kept over six hundred thousand people out of poverty and stopped liens on family farms. 
   I also fought for higher quality standards for nursing homes. Through the Older Americans Act, seniors have easier access to information and referrals they need to make good choices about long-term care. I am also working hard to create a National Family Caregivers Program, so that families can access comprehensive information when faced with the dizzying array of choices in addressing the long-term care needs of a family member. 
   These are important steps. But unfortunately, we haven't made much progress in the last few years. We've been stymied by partisan bickering, shutdowns, and inaction. The long-term care crisis needs a long-term care solution. I am pleased to say that this new bipartisan legislation puts an important down payment on this solution. 
   Despite past disagreements on approaches to financing long-term care, everyone agrees that the crisis is growing. Nursing home costs are projected to increase from $40,000 today to $97,000 by 2030. This will only get worse since the number of senior citizens will double over the next thirty years. Families are being forced to choose between sending a child to college or paying for a nursing home for a parent, or a parent-in-law. I think that is wrong. 
   Consider these sobering statistics:  
   At least 5.8 million Americans aged 65 or older currently need long-term care 
   As many as six out of 10 Americans have experienced a long-term care need 
   41 percent of women in caregiver roles quit their jobs or take family medical leave to care for a frail older parent or parent-in-law 
   80 percent of all long-term care services are provided by family and friends  
   Families desperately need the tools to help themselves and meet their family responsibilities. This bill is the first step in helping all Americans do just that. Let me tell you what our new legislation will do:  
   It will enable federal and military workers, retirees and their families to purchase long-term care insurance 
   It will provide help to those who practice self-help by offering employees the option to better prepare for their retirement and the potential need for long-term care 
   It will enable federal employees to buy long-term care insurance at group rates--they are projected to be 10%-20% below open market rates. 
   Participants will pay the entire premium but because of the lower premium this is a good deal for federal workers--and for taxpayers  
   I'm starting with federal employees for two reasons. First, as our nation's largest employer, the federal government can be a model for employers around the country. By offering long-term care insurance to its employees, the federal government can set the example for other employers whose workforce will be facing the same long-term care needs. Starting with the nation's largest employer also raises awareness and education about long-term care options. 
   I have a second reason for starting with our federal employees. I am a strong supporter of our federal employees. I am proud that so many of them live, work, and retire in Maryland. They work hard in the service of our country. And I work hard for them. Whether it's fighting for fair COLAs, lower health care premiums, or to prevent unwise schemes to privatize important services our federal workforce provide, they can count on me. 
   One of my principles is ``promises made should be promises kept.'' Federal retirees made a commitment to devote their careers to public service. In return, our government made certain promises to them. One important promise made was the promise of health insurance. The lack of long-term care for federal workers has been a big gap in this important promise to our federal workers. This legislation will close that gap and provide our federal workers and retirees with comprehensive health insurance. 
   Mr. President, I reiterate my commitment to finding long-term solutions to the long-term care problem. I am proud that this bipartisan bill takes an important step forward in helping all Americans to prepare for the challenges facing our aging population.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to support the Iran Nonproliferation Act. 
   We are faced with an historic opportunity to send a strong message to nations around the world--we will not sit by idle as goods, services or technology are transferred to Iran that contribute significantly to its ability to develop nuclear, chemical or biological weapons or ballistic or cruise missiles. 
   This legislation provides the Administration with useful tools to combat the spread of dangerous weapons technology and to discourage nuclear proliferation. It also enhances U.S. efforts to monitor Iranian proliferation. 
   This legislation demonstrates our commitment to prevent the proliferation of dangerous nuclear weapons to countries that threaten our national security as well as the security of allies--such as Israel and Europe. The Middle East is of vital strategic importance to the U.S.--and our interests and Israel's security are threatened by the continuing build-up of advanced conventional weapons by `rogue regimes' in the region. For this reason, U.S. support for Israel must go beyond economic and military aid to Israel--it must meet the very real challenges that will face Israel and the United States in this new century, such as limiting the threats of weapons of mass destruction. It is well documented that technology provided to Iran increases its ability to develop its own intermediate range ballistic missile that is capable of reaching Israel as well as our European allies. By limiting Iran's access to such technology we can better protect these countries as well as our own troops in the Middle East and Europe. 
   The people of Iran demonstrated in their recent elections an overriding desire to move away from the extremism of the previous government toward reform and moderation in the future--but it is too early to tell what this change will mean in practice. I hope that it is a sign that Iran will end its missile program and its support for international terrorism. But despite this positive step, the Iran Nonproliferation Act is still vital to combat the spread of dangerous weapons technology and, in particular, to monitor nuclear weapons proliferation to Iran. 
   This legislation also sends a strong message to Russia that U.S. aid and scientific collaboration will be limited if Russia doesn't stop missile proliferation to Iran. U.S. funding will be substantially limited unless the President certifies that the Russian Space Agency is not transferring technology to Iran. 
   As the ranking member of the VA-HUD subcommittee that funds the space program, I have been a strong supporter of the International Space Station. I supported Russia's participation in the space program for three reasons: 
   One, their technical expertise; 
   Two, to build stronger links between the United States and Russia; and 
   Three, to ensure that Russian scientists and engineers had civilian work--so they would not sell their skills to rogue governments. 
   Russia has failed to live up to its promises on the space station. I have no question of Russia's technical competence. But I have strong concerns about its failure to meet its end of the bargain. Russia has not adequately funded its share of the space station, resulting in delays and a cloud of uncertainty that hovers over the entire program. 
   Even more troubling is Russia's role in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Russia has exported technology, material and expertise to help Iran develop ballistic missiles. These missiles could carry chemical, nuclear or biological weapons--which could reach any target within about 800 miles of Iran. 
   Russia's former Prime Minister Chernomyrdin promised to end this assistance. We need to make sure the new Russian government fulfills this promise. I recognize that Acting Russian President Vladmir Putin has been receptive to restricting companies that sell missile technology and equipment to Iran. I hope his intentions are translated into action. Otherwise, our cooperation with Russia--both in space and elsewhere--may end. 
   We live in a dangerous world--where terrorists and rogue nations are developing the most repugnant weapons of mass destruction. Our action today will send a clear message to our allies and to our adversaries. By coming together to support this bipartisan legislation, we will demonstrate our unified commitment to limit nuclear proliferation and to create a safer more stable world.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I wish to take this opportunity to commend and congratulate George T. Costin, Library Technician, upon the occasion of his retirement from the Senate Library on February 8, 2000. For 32 years--27 in the Office of the Secretary of the Senate--George has labored selflessly every day supporting the work of the Senate. George left his home state of North Carolina in 1963 and a brief stop over in Washington lasted for more than three decades. 
   George began his Senate career with the Sergeant at Arms in 1967 and joined the Library staff in 1972. He has made our duties far easier and throughout the years he has been the Ambassador of Goodwill with his wonderful smile, kind words, and unmatched style. He was always proud of being part of the Senate Family. 
   George will be very busy in retirement with church activities, a demanding golf schedule, and the joy of a new grandson. Along with all of his friends, I commend George for his loyalty and dedicated service to the United States Senate. I know that all Senators will join me in thanking George, his wife Gloria, and his three children, Angie, Samantha, and George, Jr., for his dedicated and distinguished service. It is with deep appreciation that we extend our best wishes for many years of health and happiness.

    Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the Administration on the selection of Thomasina ``Tommy'' Rogers, a constituent and friend, to serve as the Chairman of the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. Ms. Rogers was confirmed by the U.S. Senate and has served on the Commission since November 1998. On June 4, President Clinton designated her Chairman. 
   Ms. Rogers, a resident of Upper Marlboro, MD, has held a number of high ranking positions in the federal government, both as a career civil servant and as a political appointee. She entered the Senior Executive Service in 1987. At the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, she served as Legal Counsel where she received numerous awards for exemplary performance. She was later nominated and confirmed to chair the Administrative Conference where she served until 1995. 
   Ms. Rogers received a law degree from Columbia University and an undergraduate degree in journalism from Northwestern University. She has served on the Boards of Directors of Children's National Medical Center in Washington D.C. and the American Arbitration Association since 1995. 
   Ms. Rogers is the first woman to be designated Chairman and the first African American to serve as a member of the Commission. She is married to another outstanding Marylander, and friend, Gregory Gill. They have a daughter, Cleo. 
   I want to commend the Administration for it's excellent choice and look forward to Ms. Rogers' tenure as Chairman.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I rise today in commemoration of January 2000, as National Biotechnology Month. In November, the Senate passed a resolution designating January 2000 as National Biotechnology Month. 
   Biotechnology is changing the face of medicine. The United States leads the world in biotechnology innovation. Approximately 1,300 biotech companies in this country employ more than 150,000 people. Biotech companies are on the cutting edge--working to develop innovative life-saving drugs and vaccines. The industry spent nearly $10 billion on research and development in 1998 while revenues totaled $18.4 billion. Product sales topped $13 billion. The industry recorded a net loss of $5 billion. 
   I'm proud that Maryland is home to over 200 biotechnology companies. Companies in Maryland are working to map the human genome and develop drugs to treat Alzheimer's, Parkinson's Disease, and diabetes. Biotechnology has grown in Maryland, in part because Maryland is a place for great medical innovations. Maryland is home to the ``golden triangle''--private sector biotech companies, federal research laboratories, and universities. Maryland houses the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), other federal labs, outstanding academic research institutions such as Johns Hopkins University and the University of Maryland, and a growing number of biotech companies. The combination of these public and private sector entities creates a unique environment for research and new ideas to flourish. 
   Biotech companies will likely have an increasingly important role in providing medicines in the 21st century. The number of biotechnology drug approvals is increasing. More than 350 biotechnology medicines are already in late-stage clinical trials for heart ailments, cancer, and neurological diseases and infections. Some of these drugs will likely lead the way to improved health and well-being for millions of Americans. I salute the biotechnology companies in Maryland and across the country as they work to improve the lives of patients everywhere.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Republican amendment. I believe it is a watered-down, slowed-down, pennies-to-the-poor approach. 
   Why raise the minimum wage? We are in the greatest prosperity that the United States of America has ever seen. We have the opportunity to raise the standard of living for the poor. I believe what we need to do, now that we have moved hundreds of thousands of people from welfare, is to make work worth it. 
   Who are the people we are talking about? We are talking about the working poor who raise our children, who care for our elderly, many working two or three jobs to hold the family together. 
   I believe we need to make a commitment to the working poor, as we cross into the new century, that if you live in the United States of America and you work, you should not be poor. 
   The amendment the Senator from Massachusetts proposed was modest. It was spread over a 2-year period. It would take us into 2001. Why should a day-care worker make less than someone who works 40 hours a week at a bank job? We need to make sure that in this country, in order to sustain the efforts we have made in improving the standard of living for people, if you work, you will not be poor. 
   I yield such time as I might have.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the life and legacy of a dear friend and colleague, Senator John Chafee. 
   I was deeply saddened yesterday to hear of Senator Chafee's passing. The Chafee family lost a dear husband, father and grandfather. My thoughts and prayers go out to Virginia, his children, and his grandchildren. The Senate lost one of our most principled and reasoned colleagues. Senator Chafee will be greatly missed here. The people of Rhode Island, whose needs and concerns guided his actions on a daily basis, lost an admired Senator. His impact will be felt in Rhode Island for generations to come. Our country lost a tireless leader who consistently fought for what he believed in, and for that, I am deeply saddened. 
   Senator Chafee was the kind of Senator that this country needs. In times of increasing partisanship, John Chafee always reached across the aisle to form alliances, to build compromises, to get things done. He let principles, not politics, be his guide. And that enabled him to be an unbending bridge between both sides that we have so desperately needed. 
   Senator Chafee's politics was the kind of politics this country needs. He inspired voters on both sides of the party line with his honest, independent politics. Senator Chafee always believed that persistent honesty and unshakeable integrity were the cornerstones of public life. His was always the quiet voice of reason. 
   And Senator Chafee was the kind of person this country needs. John Chafee devoted his life to public service--as a Marine, as a State legislator and minority leader in the Rhode Island House, as Governor of Rhode Island, as Secretary of the Navy, and as a United States Senator. He and his wife Virginia raised a beautiful family, and instilled in them the values of public service and integrity. I am proud to have worked with such a distinguished man. 
   We will always celebrate, and never forget, the work that was born of his public service, his commitment to his family, and his commitment to his principles. Senator Chafee's work here in the Senate has had a tremendous impact on our nation. He leaves a remarkable legacy. 
   We will always celebrate Senator Chafee's leadership on the Clean Air Act. We will always celebrate his fight to strengthen the Safe Drinking Water Act. We will always celebrate his hard work in authoring the Superfund program. The air we breathe and the water we drink is cleaner and safer because of his landmark efforts. 
   We will always remember his unwavering advocacy for a woman's right to chose. We will always remember his fight to enact the Family and Medical Leave bill. We will always remember his important work to curb gun violence in America. Our families are stronger, our constitutional rights have been protected, and our streets are safer because of his steadfast devotion to these causes. 
   In these ways and more, Mr. President, we will always remember and celebrate his quiet strength, his unwavering commitment to the people of his state, and to his own principles. Senator Chafee has had an indelible impact on our policy and our politics, on our culture and our country. And for that, we will always be grateful.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to speak against the Santorum amendment and on behalf of the Durbin amendment of which I am a cosponsor. I wish to speak on the merits of the amendment, but I will say a few words before I debate the amendment about an issue the Senator from Kansas has raised. I have had the opportunity to get to know and so respect the position of the Senator from Kansas. 
   The Senator spoke about the culture of death. I believe we should have a debate on the culture of death here in the Senate. I believe it should occur among Members privately, when we are having conversations in the lunchroom. I believe one of the things we should do as we end this century, which has been such a ghoulish, grim, violent century, is think about how we can affirm a life-giving culture. 
   I speak to my colleague from Kansas with all due respect and a desire to work with him on those issues. The Pope, the leader of my own faith, and the Catholic bishops of America have spoken about the culture of death. They say when we choose life, it is ending all forms of violence--the violence of poverty, hunger, armed conflict, weapons of war, the violence of drug trafficking, the violence of racism, and the violence of mindless damage to our environment. 
   In other statements from both the Pope and the bishops, they speak out on famine, starvation, the spread of drugs, domestic violence, and the denial of health care. 
   I say to my colleagues in the Senate, when we think about a defense against the culture of death, we need a broader view. We are need to talk not only about one amendment or one procedure--which I say is quite grim--but also to talk about what we are going to do to address these other critical issues. 
   We rejected a judicial nomination last week because of the nominee's position on the death penalty. I don't know how we can be against the culture of death and yet vote against a distinguished man who makes serious, prudent, judicial decisions on certain death penalty cases. 
   We defeated an arms control treaty, with no real serious opportunity for full debate and development of side agreements. There were legitimate ``yellow flashing lights'' about the agreement that deserved thorough debate. But we rushed to a vote with only hasty, last minute hearings and no opportunity for complete investigation of the treaty.  
   I say to my colleagues, let's look at what we are going to do to protect our own families and how we can look at promoting a culture of life. I say that with sincerity. I say it with the utmost respect for people whose position I will disagree with on this amendment. We need to reach out to each other, think these issues through, and put aside message amendments, put aside tactical advantages, put aside partisan lines. 
   I say to my colleague from Kansas, I know he is deeply concerned about the issues of culture in our own country. Many of those issues I do share. I reach out and say to my colleagues, let's think through what we are doing. 
   Having said that, I rise to support the Durbin amendment. 
   In this debate, I say to my colleagues, the first question is: Who really should decide whether someone should have an abortion or not? I believe that decision should not be made by government. I believe when government interferes in decisionmaking, we have ghoulish, grim policies. 
   Look at China, with their one child/one family official practice. The government of China mandated abortions. 
   Look at Romania under the vile leadership of Ceausescu, who said any woman of childbearing age had to prove she was not on any form of birth control or natural method. They were mandated to have as many children as they could. 
   I don't want government interfering. I think government should be silent. We have a Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade. We should respect that decision. I think it is in the interests of our country that government now be silent on this. We should move forward. Medical practitioners should make decisions on medical matters. It should not be left up to politicians with very little scientific or theological training. 
   There is a substantial difference on when life begins. Science and theologians disagree on this. Some say at the moment of conception. St. Thomas Aquinas, in my own faith, said the soul comes into a male in 6 weeks, but it takes 10 weeks for the soul to enter the body of a woman. We would take issue with Thomas Aquinas on that. Our Supreme Court said that given conflicting scientific viewpoints, fetal viability should determine to what extent a state may limit access to abortion. 
   The Durbin amendment is consistent with the Court's framework. It would ban all post-viability abortions except when the life or health of the woman is at risk. The Durbin amendment provides clear guidelines, which are narrowly but compassionately drawn, to allow doctors to use a variety of procedures, based on medical necessity in a particular woman's situation. It must be medically necessary in the opinion of not one but two doctors. Both the doctor who recommends this as a procedure and then an independent physician must certify that this is the medically necessary and appropriate course for a particular woman facing a health crisis. 
   This is why I think the Durbin amendment is a superior amendment. It acknowledges the grave seriousness of the possibility of a medical crisis in a late-term pregnancy that can only be resolved with the family and the physician. To single out only one procedure means other procedures could be used, equally as grim. What we want to do is preserve the integrity of the doctor-patient relationship, and make sure there is no loophole, by requiring two physicians to independently evaluate the woman's medical needs. 
   So I believe the Durbin amendment is a superior way to address this most serious issue, and I intend to support the Durbin amendment. I recommend to my colleagues that they, too, give the Durbin amendment serious consideration. 
   Let me say again what I think this debate is about. I believe it is about the right of women facing the most tragic and rare set of complications affecting her pregnancy to make medically appropriate or necessary choices. 
   This is not a debate that should take place in the U.S. Senate. This is a discussion that should remain for women, their health care providers, their families and their clergy. The Senate has no standing, no competency and no business interfering in this most private and anguishing of decisions a woman and her family can possibly face. 
   That is why I so strongly oppose the Santorum bill. It would violate to an alarming degree the right of women and their physicians to make major medical decisions. 
   And that is why I rise in strong support of the Durbin amendment. I support the Durbin alternative for four reasons. 
   First, it respects the constitutional underpinnings of Roe v. Wade. 
   Second, it prohibits all post-viability abortions. 
   Third, it provides an exception for the life and health of a woman which is both intellectually rigorous and compassionate. 
   Finally, it leaves medical decisions in the hands of physicians--not politicians. 
   The Durbin alternative addresses this difficult issue with the intellectual rigor and seriousness of purpose it deserves. We are not being casual. We are not angling for political advantage. We are not looking for cover. 
   We are offering the Senate a sensible alternative--one that will stop post-viability abortions, while respecting the Constitution. We believe that it is an alternative that reflects the views of the American people. 
   The Durbin amendment respects the Supreme Court's ruling in the Roe v. Wade decision. When the Court decided Roe, it was faced with the task of defining ``When does life begin?'' Theologians and scientists differ on this. People of good will and good conscience differ on this. 
   So the Supreme Court used viability as its standard. Once a fetus is viable, it is presumed to have not only a body, but a mind and spirit. Therefore it has standing under the law as a person. 
   The Roe decision is quite clear. States can prohibit abortion after viability, so long as they permit exceptions in cases involving the woman's life or health. Let me be clear. Under Roe, states can prohibit most late term abortions. And many states have done so. 
   In my own state of Maryland, we have a law that does just that. It was adopted by the Maryland General Assembly and approved by the people of Maryland by referendum. It prohibits post viability abortions. As the Constitution requires, it provides an exception to protect the life or health of the woman. 
   Like the Maryland law, the Durbin alternative respects that key holding of Roe. It says that after the point of viability, no woman should be able to abort a viable fetus. The only exception can be when the woman faces a threat to her life or serious and debilitating risk to her health. 
   The bill before us--the Santorum bill--only bans one particular abortion procedure at any point in a pregnancy. By violating the Supreme Court's standard on viability, this language would in all probability be struck down by the courts. 
   In fact, this language has already been struck down in many states because of this very reason. The proponents of the legislation know this. 
   The Durbin alternative, though, bans all post viability abortions. It doesn't create loopholes by allowing other procedures to be used. 
   I believe there is no Senator who thinks a woman should abort a viable fetus for a frivolous, non-medical reason. It does not matter what procedure is used. It is wrong, and we know it. 
   The Durbin alternative bans those abortions. It is a real solution. 
   On the other hand, S. 1692, proposed by Senator Santorum and others, does not stop a single abortion. For those who think they support this approach, know that it is both hollow and ineffective.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, once again the Senate is considering campaign finance reform. As my colleagues know, the House of Representatives in September passed a strong, bipartisan reform measure. Senators MCCAIN and FEINGOLD have put a bipartisan reform proposal before the Senate. 
   The House has acted overwhelmingly in favor of reform and the majority of Americans support them. It is imperative that the Senate pass a tough campaign finance reform measure this year. 
   I have consistently supported campaign finance reform since coming to Congress. As many of my colleagues know, I started my career in politics as a community activist, working to prevent a highway from demolishing my Fell's Point neighborhood. I don't want the next generation of community activists shut out of the political process. I want them to know that their efforts matter. I want to restore each American's faith and trust in government. This bill is an important step in restoring the faith of the American people and ensuring that our citizens have a voice in government. 
   Vote after vote in the past has shown that the majority of the United States Senate supports the McCain-Feingold reform proposal. Unfortunately, through parliamentary tactics and filibuster, a majority of the Senate has not been able to work its will on this issue. I hope this year will be different, and that we will pass and enact meaningful campaign finance reform. 
   During my time in the United States Senate, I have voted 19 times to end filibusters on campaign finance reform. So I know we have a fight on our hands. But it is time for action, and it is time for reform. The American people are counting on us. 
   I believe we need campaign finance reform for a number of reasons. First and most important, we need to restore people's faith in the integrity of government, the integrity of their elected officials, and the integrity of our political process. 
   Many Americans are fed up with a political system that ignores our Nation's problems and places the concerns of working families behind those of big interests. Our campaign finance system contributes to a culture of cynicism that hurts our institutions, our government and our country. 
   When Congress fails to enact legislation to save our kids from the public health menace of smoking because of the undue influence of Big Tobacco, it adds to that culture of cynicism. When powerful health care industry interests are able to block measures to provide basic patient protections for consumers who belong to HMOs, that adds to the culture of cynicism. Is it any wonder that Americans do not trust their elected leaders to act in the public interest? 
   It's time for the Senate to break this culture of cynicism. We can enact legislation to eliminate the undue influence of special interests in elections. 
   How does this bill do that? First of all, it stems the flood of unregulated, unreported money in campaigns. It will ban soft money, money raised and spent outside of federal campaign rules and which violates the spirit of those rules. 
   During the 1996 Presidential election cycle, the political parties in America raised a record $262 million. In just the first six months of the 2000 election cycle, the parties have raised an astounding $55.1 million. That's 80% more than they raised in the same period of the 1996 cycle. The need to shut down the growing soft money machine is clear. 
   This bill will also codify the Beck decision, by allowing non-union members who pay fees in lieu of union dues to obtain a refund of the portion of those fees used for political activities. Unions play a vital role in our political process. This provision enables unions to more accurately reflect the views of their members. 
   These are reasonable reforms. They will help get the big money and the secret money out of campaigns. They will help to strengthen democracy and strengthen the people's faith in their elected officials. 
   Mr. President, we can improve our political process, making it more fair and more inclusive, without compromising our rights under the Constitution. 
   By limiting the influence of those with big dollars, and increasing the influence of those with big hearts, we can bring government back to where it belongs--with the people. 
   The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act will help us to do that, and I am proud to support it and encourage my colleagues to do likewise.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator BOND, for working with me and producing what I think is an outstanding conference that we bring to our colleagues. We could not have done this without the help of Senator BYRD and Senator STEVENS, who got the committee over some very significant fiscal humps, and also our House colleagues who operated in a spirit of bicameral cooperation. I believe also the White House played a very constructive role in suggesting offsets to meet key national priorities. We think we come with a very good bill, and we are going to urge all of our colleagues to support it. 
   We got started on this bill in the spring. We got started a little bit late because of impeachment. Everyone wondered how would the Senate proceed after we had been through such a wrenching constitutional crisis. I can say in the VA-HUD subcommittee we did just fine. We moved with a quick step. I believe we probed the fiscal situations of the agencies as to what their needs were and, at the same time, how could we meet national priorities within the discipline of the thinking of a balanced budget. 
   I believe we do that. I believe today what we present takes care of national interests and national needs. I am confident this bill will be signed by the President. I am pleased what we were able to do it to meet our obligations to veterans. Promises made are promises kept to the people who saved Western civilization. This conference report also serves core constituencies, invests in our neighborhoods and communities, and creates opportunities for people and advances in science and technology. I believe that is an outstanding accomplishment. 
   I am very pleased we were able to provide a significant increase in funding for veterans' health care, $1.7 billion over the President's request, and not only providing health care as we know it but breaking new ground in creating primary care opportunities out in communities so that our rural  veterans do not have to drive hundreds of miles for their care. We have also increased the funding for VA medical research, with special emphasis on geriatric care, orthopedic research, and prostate cancer. At the same time, we are looking at new and innovative ways to begin to fund the compelling need for long-term care, increasing the funds from what we call the State Veterans Homes, Federal and State partnerships. 
   We are also taking care of America's working families in this bill. We fund the housing programs that help lives. We are going to have $11 billion in all section 8 housing vouchers, including 60,000 additional vouchers to enable people to have affordable, decent, and safe housing. We also maintained core HUD programs, we increased housing for the elderly by $50 million over the President's request, and increased funding so that more disabled Americans can find housing. 
   We didn't forget about the homeless. This will now be funded at over $1 billion. We wanted to make sure local communities have a major say in what is going to happen to them, and that of course occurs in the community development block grant which will be funded at $4.8 billion. 
   Whether it is improving the funding for community development financial institutions or empowerment zones, we were able to create more opportunity and yet meet taxpayer obligations. 
   In addition to that, we also wanted to look at where we were heading with our science and our technology. I am pleased our bill fully funds NASA and restores the severe cuts made to NASA in the House bill. This will save 2,000 jobs at Goddard Flight Center in Maryland, as well as the Wallops Flight Facility on the Eastern Shore. This legislation will fund NASA $13.6 billion. This means we will be looking at Earth science, we will be looking at how to fund the new generation of space telescopes, and at the same time we are going to upgrade the safety of the space shuttle. That means we are going to invest $25 million in the upgrading of the space shuttle while we maintain our commitment to the international space station. 
   We also fully fund the National Science Foundation, where I believe there will be new intellectual breakthroughs, particularly in information technology research. We also fund the National Service at $433 million, which is close to the President's request. This means that 100,000 members and participants across the country right now are engaging in community service programs at AmeriCorps, Learn and Serve America. We believe that every right has a responsibility, every opportunity has an obligation, and this is what National Service does; it rekindles the habits of the heart. 
   With regard to our EPA bill, this provides $7.5 billion in funding. This is $384 million over the President's request. At the same time, we declare an emergency and do $2.5 billion in emergency disaster assistance for all of the damage created by Hurricane Floyd. It is not true when they say: A billion here, a billion there, and that is the way Congress works. 
   We focused on how we can meet compelling human need; 
   how, in the last appropriations of this century, we wanted to make sure we had veterans' health care for the people who, five different times, answered the call of duty to be able to uphold our national interests around the world; to make work worth it by making sure if you are out there and you are working, perhaps at the minimum wage, we are willing to subsidize housing and therefore subsidize work so we could create a true, real safety net for those affected by welfare reform. 
   We also know America's genius is in its science and technology. As this century closes, we know we not only planted our flag at Iwo Jima and honor our veterans who did that, but we planted our flag on the Moon, which shows the United States of America continues to be a nation of pioneers. We do not seek to conquer other nations. We seek to win wars against cancer. We seek to win the battles of the mind in which we create new ideas, where we win Nobel prizes and then go on to win new markets. 
   This is what the VA-HUD bill is all about. I am very pleased to bring this to the Democrats. I thank my colleague, Senator BOND, for all of his courtesies and collegiality. 
   I thank John Kamarck, Carolyn Apostolou, Cheh Kim, and Julie Dammann on his staff for working so close with my staff. I want to especially thank Paul Carliner, Sean Smith, and Jeannie Schroeder, and most of all I thank the Senate for all its cooperation in moving our bill. 
   I yield the floor.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a colloquy with the distinguished chairman of the VA-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee. 
   Mr. President, regrettably, the FY2000 conference report contains a typographical error that was made during the final drafting of this conference report. Contrary to the intent of the managers and conferees, a $1,000,000 earmark for the New Jersey Community Development Corporation's Transportation Opportunity Center and a $750,000 earmark for South Dakota State University's performing arts center were accidently deleted from the list of EDI Special Purpose Grants due to a computer malfunction. 
   Unfortunately, we are not able to amend this conference report at this point, but I wanted to ask the distinguished chairman, Senator BOND, if he will work with me, Senator BYRD, and Senator STEVENS to ensure that these typographical errors are corrected in another appropriations bill before this session of Congress ends?

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to support the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty. 
   This is a sad day for the Senate. Despite limited debate on this issue, the appeal of the President and bi-partisan pleas of over 51 Senators to delay consideration of this treaty, the Majority Leader has decided to force our vote on this treaty. The very nature and timing of the issue requires that we come together and act in a responsible, non-partisan manner. We are faced with an historic opportunity to send nations around the world an important, powerful message--let's make sure it is the right message and that we vote to ratify this important treaty. 
   Ratification will strengthen--not weaken--America's national security. We must remember that ratification will not force America to abandon or alter its current practice regarding nuclear testing--we stopped nuclear testing seven years ago. And why did we stop nuclear testing? Because we have a robust, technically sophisticated nuclear force and because nuclear experts affirm that we can maintain a safe and reliable deterrent without nuclear tests. This is also one reason why we should ratify the CTBT. 
   Another reason to ratify the CTBT is that it will strengthen our national security by limiting the development of more advanced and more destructive nuclear weapons. As we all know, we have the most powerful nuclear force in the world. Thus, limiting the development of more advanced and destructive nuclear weapons limits the power of rogue nations around the world from strengthening their own nuclear arsenal. It allows America to maintain its nuclear superiority. 
   Full ratification and implementation of the CTBT will also limit the possibility of other countries from acquiring nuclear weapons. Furthermore, it will provide us with new mechanisms to monitor suspicious activities by other nations. For example, it provides for a global network of sensors and the right to request short notice, on-sight inspections in other countries. 
   But failure to ratify the CTBT will jeopardize our national security as well as the security of countries around the world. If we fail to act, the treaty cannot enter into force for any country. Let us not forget that nuclear competition led Pakistan and India to conduct underground nuclear testing over one year ago. Without this treaty, nuclear competition will only continue to grow and to spread. Without this treaty, underground nuclear testing will not only continue but will be carried out by even more countries--not by our allies, but rather, by our enemies. 
   I am dismayed that we are even forced to consider this vital treaty in light of the current unrest in Pakistan and India. Now, more than ever, we must demonstrate national unity. 
   We must listen to the experts who urge us to ratify the treaty--the Secretaries of Defense and Energy, the Directors of the National Weapons Laboratories and the Nobel laureates. We must listen to national leaders around the world beseeching us to ratify the treaty--asking us to act as a responsible international leader and to serve as a positive example for other nations to follow. And most important, we  must listen to the American people--the majority of whom are pleading with us to make our world a safer place and to ratify this treaty. 
   Let us not forget that 152 countries have signed the CTBT. America led these countries by being the first to sign the treaty. Other major nuclear powers, such as Britain, France, Russia and China followed our lead. To date, 41 countries have ratified. Although we will not be the first country to ratify, let us not be the first country to jeopardize its very existence. 
   We live in a dangerous world--where terrorists and rogue nations are developing the most repugnant weapons of mass destruction. We need to think clearly about what message we are sending today to the rest of the world--to our allies and to our adversaries. Our actions today will influence action by countries around the world. If we ratify, other countries will follow suit and ratify. Our failure to ratify will go beyond encouraging other nations to follow suit. It will prevent the very entry into force of this historic agreement. 
   Let us send a powerful message to our neighbors around the world and ratify this historic treaty. Let us ratify the treaty and guarantee a safer future for our children by strengthening the security of our country and of the world.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Bond Amendment. It's bad for American workers and bad for our economy. 
   OSHA must move forward with an ergonomics standard. Each year, more than 600,000 individuals in our private sector work force miss time due to ergonomic injuries, or musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). These injuries cost our economy over $80 billion annually, including approximately $60 billion on lost productivity costs. Nearly $1 out of every $3 in worker's compensation payments result from MSDs. 
   More importantly, these injuries cause terrible pain and suffering--as well as increased health care costs. OSHA's ergonomics standard is supported by overwhelming scientific evidence. The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) study concluded that workplace interventions can reduce the incidence of MSDs. When this study  was funded in 1998, the Appropriations Committee and the Administration agreed that funding this study was not a mechanism for delaying the OSHA standard. We must honor our agreement and let OSHA do it's work on behalf of working men and women in our country. 
   Mr. President, ergonomics is also a women's issue. Women account for nearly 75% of lost work time due to carpal tunnel syndrome and 62% of lost time due to tendinitis. Many of the women affected by MSDs are in the health care industry, including nurses, nurse aides and health care aides. Women in the retail industry are also disproportionately affected by ergonomic injuries. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to help improve workplace safety by joining me in opposing this amendment. As a great nation, it is our duty to protect our most valuable resource--our working men and women.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the Fiscal Year 2000 Appropriations bill funding the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services and Education. I would like to thank Senator SPECTER and Senator HARKIN for the tremendous job they and their staffs have done on an extremely large, complex, and vitally important appropriations bill. This bill is important because it meets the day-to-day needs of Americans as well as the long-range needs of our country. 
   However, I am concerned that the Senate has had to resort to gimmicks and tricks such as ``forward funding'' and ``emergency spending.'' When Congress resorts to these tricks, it means we're not doing our job right. The GM worker in Baltimore can't ``forward fund'' or declare his next trip to the grocery store ``emergency spending.'' If a mother can't pay for her children's health care using such devices, then Congress should not be able to resort to them to pay for our children's education, health care for the underserved, or job training. 
   I am pleased with a number of funding levels in this bill. I know that Senators SPECTER and HARKIN had a difficult task in funding so many programs that meet compelling human needs. As the Senator for and from the National Institutes of Health, I am very glad to see the $2 billion increase in NIH funding, which keeps us on pace to double NIH's budget over five years. I am particularly pleased with the $680.3 million for the National Institute on Aging (NIA). This is an increase of more than $80 million over last year. As we double NIH's budget, I believe that it is especially important to double NIA's budget. Our population is aging; by 2030 there will be about 70 million Americans age 65 and older, more than twice their number in 1997. This is clearly an investment in the future health of our nation. 
   Many of the day-to-day needs of our nation's seniors are met by the Older Americans Act (OAA). It is heartening to see the $35 million increase in funding for home delivered meals because it is greatly needed. We are seeing an increased demand for home delivered meals which assist more older persons in remaining in their homes and communities. The Committee has also provided a $1 million increase for the ombudsman program and an $8 million increase to $26 million for state and local innovations/projects of national significance (Title IV). 
   I am disappointed that other programs under the Older Americans Act did not see needed increases in funding. OAA programs have been level funded and losing ground for too long. I am also deeply concerned that there is no provision to fund the National Family Caregiver Support Program. This program would offer valuable services to assist our nation's caregivers by providing respite care, counseling, information, and assistance among other services. This program has strong bipartisan support. I would urge that we look at ways to provide the necessary resources for this program in Fiscal Year 2000 so that it can be funded once it is authorized. As the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Aging, I will continue to work with my colleagues on the HELP Committee to reauthorize the OAA during Fiscal Year 2000. 
   In addition, I was distressed by the drastic cut of almost $860 million to the Social Services Block Grant. However, I'm pleased that the Senate has restored these funds. The Social Services Block Grant provides help 
   to those who practice self help. In Maryland, this program funds adoption, case management, day care, foster care, home based services, information and referral, prevention and protective services to more than 200,000 people. 
   I must also mention the importance of funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). I am very aware of the funding constraints the we have been operating under and believe that the $30 million increase for CDC is a step in the right direction. However, it is below the President's budget request and does not go far enough. While I am appreciative of the efforts to increase funding to modernize CDC's facilities and improve public health infrastructure, CDC has been revenue starved for too long. Improving public health in our country requires investments in NIH, CDC, and FDA. I am thrilled with our support of NIH, but I believe that if we do not provide sufficient resources to CDC and FDA we are only doing part of the job. I would urge that we consider this as we move to conference on this bill and when we look at funding for these agencies next year. 
   I am also pleased at the funding levels of many of our national education programs and this bill is certainly better than the one that passed the House.  I am very concerned that the funding level for the bill overall has been reduced to pay for other programs. The spending caps put us in a tough position. And it is education that always suffers the most. 
   Like I said, even though the Senate funding levels are much better than the House, there are at least two major problems with the Senate bill. There is no funding in this bill for school construction and there is no funding in this bill for lowering class size and hiring 100,000 new teachers. Last year, we passed a bipartisan bill, and we all agreed to lower class size. We agreed that this is one of the most important things we can do for our kids and our classrooms. Yet this bill contains no money for class size. 
   There is also no funding for school construction. What happened to our commitment to make sure our kids are not attending classes in crumbling schools? I see there is $1.2 billion in the bill for something called ``Teacher Assistance Initiative.'' As far as I know, no one knows what this means exactly. Like Senator MURRAY said on the floor of the Senate last week, it clearly isn't class size reduction. 
   I have serious reservations about this bill. It does not live up to the commitment we made here in the Senate to reduce class size and hire 100,000 teachers. It does nothing to fix our broken down schools. And the House bill is even worse. 
   The House bill cuts $2.8 billion out of the President's education agenda to improve public schools. It denies 42,000 additional children the opportunity to participate in Head Start. It repeals last year's bipartisan agreement to fund 100,000 new teachers to create smaller classes. It combines Class Size Reduction, Eisenhower Teacher Training and Goals 2000 into a block grant funded at $200 million less than the authorized level and $396 million less than the President's request for comparable programs. 
   Given our recent tragedies in our schools, it is a shame that the House bill denies after school services to an additional 850,000 ``latch key'' children in 3,300 communities during the critical 2-6 p.m. hours when children are most likely to get into trouble. The bill also freezes federal funding to help schools to create safer learning environments and denies funding for an additional 400 drug and school violence coordinators serving 2,000 middle schools. 
   We need to work hard in conference. We are going to have to fight to keep our stand behind our kids. We cannot allow the House to gut these important programs. We cannot let the Senate ignore class size and school construction. I look forward to working with my colleagues to make sure we increase the Federal investment in education.

    Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to extend my sincerest congratulations to the town of Oakland, Maryland, as it enters its Sesquicentennial Year on October 10, 1999. Oakland, the county seat of Garrett County, enjoys a long and proud history in the State of Maryland. 
   Nestled in the Appalachian Mountains, Oakland is blessed with a natural beauty all four seasons, from snowy hills in winter to pastel flowers in spring to lush foliage in summer to gorgeous red, orange and gold trees in autumn. Even Oakland's early name, ``Yough Glades,'' conjures up images of river and forest, natural beauty and abundant resources. 
   Oakland's rich history tells a story of a small farming community which grew with the opening of the first sawmill, expanded with the arrival of the railroad and continues to grow with old and new livelihoods alike, all the while treasuring those qualities which make it special--beauty, peacefulness and small town charm. 
   ``A Brief History of Oakland, Maryland'' by John Grant describes the people, forces and events which shaped the town of Oakland. Three Indian trails met in a meadow on the western edge of Oakland and formed an entrance into the Yough Glades where Native Americans hunted in the forest and fished in the Youghiogheny River for hundreds and hundreds of years. White settlers followed in the 1790s as the fertile soil in ``Glades" country attracted more and more farmers. 
   Around 1830, the first combination gristmill and sawmill provided lumber for the homes and shops in the growing community. On October 10, 1849, the town which had been known by several different names including Yough Glades became ``Oakland.'' 
   The arrival of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in 1851 triggered a growth spurt in Oakland. Business and tradesmen frequented the newly built Glades Hotel and more people moved to the town. In 1862, Oakland incorporated a regular town government and in 1872 Oakland was selected as the County Seat of the newly formed Garrett County. The B&O Railroad continued its influence on the growth of the town with its construction of the Oakland Hotel in 1875. The hotel attracted many summer visitors, several of whom later built summer homes in Oakland. 
   Tragedy has struck Oakland more than once, and each time the town bounced back. The Wilson Creek flooded in 1896 and periodically over the next 70 years before a series of dams built in the late 1960s controlled the flooding. A devastating fire destroyed the business section of Oakland in 1898. The town used brick fire walls when rebuilding the downtown area, a farsighted decision which paid off in 1994 when fire struck again. This time only two buildings were destroyed. 
   Natural resources and beauty have long contributed to Oakland's economy and continue to do so today. The lumber industry, which began in the late 1800s, still provides jobs in Oakland. Coal, another natural resource, is found in the mountains near Oakland and adds to the economy of the town. And Oakland's natural beauty, which drew visitors to the Oakland Hotel in 1875, continues to attract people from all over the country seeking not only its beautiful vistas, but also its myriad of recreational opportunities all year round. Today, visitors to Oakland can choose from a variety of activities including hiking, biking, fishing, boating and skiing. 
   The town of Oakland reminds us of all that is good in our country. Oakland is a place where fire and rescue services are still staffed by volunteers, where folks greet each other with a friendly wave and hello, where people work together to support their schools and community, and where patriotism runs deep. In so many ways, Oakland is truly a ``Main Street Community,'' as the State of Maryland has so fittingly designated it. 
   Once again, I extend my congratulations to Oakland on their 150th anniversary and I invite all my colleagues to visit this Maryland treasure.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today as a cosponsor of Senator DASCHLE's bill to address the draconian cuts to Medicare under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA). I thank Senator DASCHLE for introducing this important piece of legislation. 
   I support this bill for two reasons. First, I believe the BBA went too far when it cut reimbursements to Medicare. Second, as we move towards the millennium and our senior population continues to grow, our seniors must be able to rely on a sound and secure Medicare Program. This bill will help them do just that. 
   When I travel throughout the State of Maryland, the issue my constituents want to talk about most is cuts in services for the elderly. I have worked long and hard to find solutions to these cuts. That is why I cosponsored an amendment to the recent tax bill which placed a priority on fixing Medicare before providing for a tax cut. That is why I am working on a new and improved Older Americans Act, and that is why I am cosponsoring Senator DASCHLE's legislation, which helps providers who are struggling under BBA cuts to Medicare. 
   The BBA is one of the reasons why we have a projected budget surplus. It put us on the right track of fiscal prudence, but it went too far in the case of Medicare by imposing deep cuts on providers: It cut reimbursements to home health agencies; it cut reimbursements to nursing homes; it cut reimbursements to Medicare HMOs. Our seniors and our providers are now feeling the effects of these cuts. 
   What exactly do these cuts mean? In my State of Maryland, this means that 34 Home Health Agencies have closed their doors and only two public Home Health Agencies remain. This is a particular problem in rural counties in Maryland. Agencies in these areas are committed to providing health care to those who cannot travel to hospitals or doctors offices. In fact, they are so committed to providing home-bound patients with care, I know some health care providers who have traveled to homes by a snowmobile in winter months just to get to a patient. But because of substantial cuts in reimbursements under BBA, these agencies are left with no choice but to close their doors; families lose these services, employees lose their jobs, and nobody wins. 
   Our Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNFs) also need the relief provided by this legislation. The BBA changed the way that payments are calculated so that facilities do not get paid more money when they provide expensive services such as chemotherapy or prosthetics. In some cases, the reimbursement is so low, that facilities cannot afford to take the patients who need a high level of care. I hear stories about patients who need chemotherapy treatment but cannot find a facility to provide it. Why? The answer is because Medicare doesn't pay enough to cover the cost of the chemotherapy treatment. Where does this patient go? They could go to a hospital, but frequently this is more expensive, or might not specialize in these services. Patients and their families do not want to hear complex stories about payment methodologies, or resource utilization groups. What these families want to hear is that their loved ones can get the care that they need. 
   My State of Maryland has also had a devastating problem with Medicare HMOs. Because of payment changes, reimbursements to many HMOs were cut. What are the effects of these cuts? One HMO in my state is projecting losses of over $5 million this year in the rural counties of Maryland alone. This HMO can no longer afford to cover Medicare patients so it is closing up shop. 14,000 senior citizens in Maryland will lose their Medicare HMO. Where do these seniors go? In the rural counties of Maryland, these seniors do not have any other Medicare HMO to choose. They all left--not because they weren't making a profit--these HMOs couldn't even break even. Rural counties throughout Maryland and the nation will have seniors with little or no access to the extra benefits many HMOs provide, including prescription drug coverage and preventive benefits such as dental, vision and hearing screenings. 
   Imagine if your 85-year-old grandmother, living on a fixed income, got a letter in the mail that says in 4 months she will no longer have a Medicare HMO. She might not understand what it means. Is she losing her health care coverage altogether? Is she losing her doctor? Is she losing her medicine coverage? In many cases, my constituents aren't wondering where they should go for a mammogram or prostate screening, but if they can even go at all because their HMO is leaving town. 
   Some will say these cuts aren't so bad--why can't you just buy a Medigap policy? For around $150 a month you could get some of the supplemental benefits that HMOs provide. But many of these senior citizens only have $11,000 or $12,000 a year in retirement income and many times their income is much less. These seniors cannot afford $150 a month for a Medigap policy, so many of them will be forced to make difficult choices between food, rent, health care and prescription medications. This legislation provides needed relief so that our seniors would not have to make these terrible decisions. 
   I also know that our non-profit health facilities are having a particularly rough time. These are providers such as Hebrew Home in Rockville, Maryland, or Mercy Hospital in Baltimore, who are struggling to provide care under current reimbursements. It is especially difficult for these providers because the care they provide is  frequently uncompensated. This is health care that they frequently do not get reimbursed for, also known as charity care. In many cases, they provide the health services to seniors who have no other place to go. If we do not take steps to fairly reimburse them, where will these seniors go to get the care they need? 
   One of my priorities as a United States Senator has always been to honor your mother and father. It is a good commandment and good public policy--in the federal law books and checkbooks. We must address these cuts in Medicare because our safety net for seniors is badly frayed, and senior citizens are being left stranded because many health care providers have no choice but to close their doors. 
   In 1965 when Medicare was created, the Federal Government promised that Americans who work hard all of their lives can count on Medicare when they retire. I believe that promises made should be promises kept. Senator DASCHLE's bill will help us keep the promise we have made to the Nation's senior citizens.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I, too, lend my support for this amendment. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his advocacy, and I thank the Senator from Missouri for the staff, along with my own staff, who helped find the funds. 
   For any person disabled or with AIDS, finding the kind of suitable housing with the appropriate physical architecture, the kind of things needed for the aged or for someone quite ill, is important. We need to make sure we provide the opportunity for people to be able to maintain self-sufficiency in the community and be able to get the treatment they need. 
   This goes a long way to adding help for 1,800 more people. I am willing to accept it.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I thank all of my colleagues for their kind words about the Senator from Missouri and myself. 
   Speaking on the amendment of Senator KERRY of Massachusetts, I want to reiterate the fact that there is very keen interest on the part of the subcommittee to continue to expand the voucher program. What we lack is really the wallet. We hope that as we move to conference, working very closely with the administration, we can find an offset to pay for new vouchers, and an offset that will not only take care of this year's appropriation but will be sustainable and reliable. 
   I am pleased to report to my colleagues in the Senate that I have had extensive conversations with the head of OMB, who is working on this, along with our Secretary of HUD, Andrew Cuomo. I do not believe the eloquent statements by my colleagues on the compelling human need to be reiterated by me. I do want to reiterate my support for increasing the voucher program in conference. I know that the President is deeply concerned about this, and should we not be able to proceed with an expansion, his senior advisers are already advising a veto. We are not there yet. 
   I say to my colleagues that this is a work in progress. They have outlined the compelling human need. I could give the same kinds of examples from my own State of Maryland, where, though we are enjoying a prosperous economy, there are still very significant ZIP Codes of poverty. So working together, we will be able to do that. 
   With that, I want to convey, first, my support, and, second, I believe we can move forward and listen to the Senator from Massachusetts in relation to the bill. 
   Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am proud to support Senator DASCHLE's amendment on education. 
   We were forced to forage for funds for the VA-HUD bill. The spending caps have put us in a terrible position, we have had to pit one group against another, and one of the biggest losers in this battle has been education. 
   There are three important things we need to do to get behind our kids, our teachers and our parents: 100,000 new teachers and counselors; technology in the classroom; and afterschool programs. 
   One of the best things we can do for our kids is to get 100,000 new teachers in the classroom. Smaller classes means that kids will get better supervision. 
   This is important for all kids, not just the ones that get into trouble; all children need help, some children just need extra help. 
   We want to make schools safe places without making them Fortress America. We need to support our teachers by hiring 100,000 new nurses and by hiring social workers and counselors. 100,000 new nurses in schools will promote early detection of warning signs. 
   I just visited a school where 75 percent of the children there were on medication. The nurse is oftentimes the first line of defense for when kids need extra help. Some of the frustration from kids stems from medical problems. Without nurses in the schools, these unnoticed medical conditions can lead to truancy and trouble. We need the experts in the schools who can deal with conflict resolution. 
   We also need structured after-school activities for kids that involves community based programs. We need to support our parents and make sure parents have the flexibility in the workplace to spend time with their children  after school. They need leave time. By the way, they also need a patients bill of rights that provides access to medical insurance for people that don't have it. 
   And we also need technology in the classrooms; computers in the schools, training for our teachers and our students so they are prepared to cross the digital divide and are ready for the 21st century. I look forward to fighting for you and getting behind our kids, our parents and our schools.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I, too, would like to express my very deep appreciation to the chairman of the full Appropriations Committee, Senator STEVENS, as well as the ranking member, Senator BYRD. On two occasions their direct intervention enabled us to move this bill, first to add the $7 billion, where we were below last year's funding. We were very appreciative because without that we could not have moved this or else we would have been in gimmicks and a variety of other things. Also, Senator STEVENS and Senator BYRD gave us the opportunity to add $600 million in veterans funding. Therefore no facility will be closed. We will be able to meet the needs of our veterans. 
   So I thank the Senator from Alaska as well as the Senator from West Virginia, Mr. BYRD, for helping us to move this bill. I also express my appreciation to Senator BOND for all his help in moving this bill, the consultation with the minority party, the collegial relationships, and essentially being able to meet the needs of the American people. 
   I thank Senator BOND's staff, Jon Kamarck, Carrie Apostolou, Cheh Kim, and Joe Norrell for all their hard work on this bill, and a special thanks to my own staff, Paul Carliner, Sean Smith, and Jeannine Schroeder. 
   I am proud of the bill we passed today because I believe it takes care of national interests and national needs. I also believe that this bill provides a solid bridge between the old century and the new century. In the old century, we saw the ravages of war and the ravages of the environment. 
   Now we are ready to complete our move from the industrial age to the information age, and the programs this bill funds will allow us to do that. 
   This bill provides an opportunity structure for home ownership and wider opportunities for educational advancement. In addition, it will allow us to stay the course in technology. Our mission is to honor the old century, but move swiftly into the new one. 
   The VA-HUD bill is about: meeting our obligations to our veterans, serving our core constituencies, creating real opportunity for people, and advancing science and technology. 
   Perhaps the most important is the need to ensure that we keep the promises we made to our veterans. The bill we passed today provides $19 billion in funding for veterans health care, and the Byrd-Bond-Mikulski-Stevens amendment provided $600 million in additional funding, an increase of $1.7 billion over the President's request. In addition, I am pleased that we were able to maintain funding for VA medical research at $316 million. 
   The VA plays a very important role in medical research for the special needs of our veterans, such as geriatrics, Alzheimers, Parkinson's and orthopedic research. The entire nation benefits from VA medical research--particularly as our population continues to age. 
   We also provide full funding to treat Hepatitis C, which is a growing problem among the veterans population, particularly for our Vietnam Veterans. This bill funds the State Veterans Homes at $90 million. The State Homes serve as our long-term care and rehabilitation facilities for our veterans. I am also pleased that the bill includes important language related to the Ft. Howard VA medical center that will ensure quality care during its transition to a mixed-use facility. 
   We have also made sure that we take care of our working families by funding housing programs that millions depend upon. The bill that we brought to the floor yesterday provides $10.8 billion to renew all existing section 8 housing vouchers. That means those who have vouchers will continue to receive them. I hope that should additional funding become available, we will be able to provide additional vouchers. I am pleased that we also maintained level funding for other critical core HUD programs. 
   Funding for housing for the elderly and the disabled has been increased by $50 million over last year, with additional funding for assisted living and service coordinators within the section 202 program. Homeless assistance grants are funded at the President's request. 
   In addition, we have funded drug elimination grants and Youthbuild at last year's level, and the Community Development Block Grant Program is funded at $4.8 billion. 
   I'm pleased that we were able to provide funds for several projects in my home state: $750,000 for the Patterson Park Community Development Corporation to establish a revolving fund to acquire and rehabilitate properties in East Baltimore; $1,250,000 for the University of Maryland--Eastern Shore for the development of a Coastal Ecology Teaching and Research Center; $1,250,000 for Prince Georges County for the revitalization of the Route 1 corridor. In addition, I have included report language that directs HUD to continue its efforts to bridge the information technology gap in communities through its ``Neighborhood Networks Initiative.'' 
   The Neighborhood Networks Initiative brings computers and internet access to HUD assisted housing projects in low income communities. This will help us to ensure that every American has the ability to cross what Bill Gates has called the ``digital divide.'' 
   I have seen the results of the Neighborhood Networks Initiative firsthand in Baltimore, and I look forward to seeing it in many other communities across the country. 
   With regard to NASA funding, I was extremely troubled by the House version of the bill. The House bill included devastating funding cuts to America's space agency, including the  Goddard Space Flight Center and Wallops Flight Facility. The House bill cuts 2,000 jobs at Goddard and Wallops. The Senate bill we pass today will save 2,000 jobs at Goddard and Wallops. I fought hard to restore funding for NASA, and I am truly pleased that this bill will save those jobs. NASA is fully funded in this bill, at $13.5 billion, the same as the President's request. Funding for the space shuttle, space station, and critical science programs are funded at the President's request. 
   National Service is funded at $423 million, a slight reduction from last year. I continue to hope that this funding can be increased as we move toward conference. National Service has enrolled over 100,000 members and participants across the country in a wide array of community service programs, including: AmeriCorps, Learn and Serve America, and the National Senior Service Corps. 
   With regard to the EPA, the Subcommittee has provided $7.3 billion in total funding. The Subcommittee increased funding for EPA's core environmental programs: $825 million for the drinking water state revolving fund, and $1.3 billion for the clean water revolving fund, including $5 million for sewer upgrades in Cambridge and Salisbury, Maryland. 
   Taking care of local communities infrastructure needs has always been a priority for me and this committee. We also provided $250,000 for a Kempton Mine remediation project. Superfund is funded at $1.4 billion, down slightly from last year. 
   I'm especially pleased that we were able to support the President's full request for the Chesapeake Bay Program Office--over $18 million--for FY 2000. The Chesapeake Bay Program Office is a leader in efforts to restore the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem for future generations. We also increased funding for the Chesapeake Bay Small Watershed Program that helps our small communities and prevents runoff and pollution. 
   FEMA has $1 billion in the disaster relief fund. The bill we pass today adds $300 million to the disaster relief fund. This will help people in the Eastern United States who are still dealing with the horrible aftermath of Hurricane Floyd. That is why I'm glad that this bill was passed, and that FEMA will continue to be able to help those who are affected by natural disasters. We will await any further Administration request for disaster assistance in light of Hurricane Floyd. 
   The National Science Foundation is funded at $3.9 billion, which is $250 million more than fiscal year 1999. This funding level will allow us to make critical investments in science and technology into the next century. The funding increase for NSF is an important step for maintaining our science and technology base. 
   Mr. President, I recognize that there may have been certain provisions in this bill that members may have disagreed with or opposed. I acknowledge their concerns. But I am very pleased that we worked together to pass this bill today, and I hope we can resolve any outstanding differences as this process continues. I believe the VA/HUD bill is good for Maryland, good for America, and good for the American people who rely on the programs it funds. 
   I thank Senator BOND and my colleagues once again for their support for this bill.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I compliment the Senator from Minnesota for his persistence and consistent advocacy for a group that is now called the atomic vets. He is absolutely right when he says that every year he offers the amendment and then, because of the pressures of conference, it evaporates. First of all, the atomic vets have no finer champion than the Senator from Minnesota, Mr. WELLSTONE. 
   From my perspective I support him. Tomorrow, when the call of the roll is made, I will be voting aye. 
   Mr. President, I thank our colleague from Minnesota for his eloquent comments within the timeframe that enabled Senators to move on to other responsibilities. I really appreciate his courtesy.

    Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the Bethesda Soccer Club Falcons for winning the Under-16 girls Maryland State Cup Championship. 
   The Falcons defeated their opponent, the Soccer Club of Baltimore Force, 11-0. This victory marked the team's seventh consecutive state title--one for every year that they have been eligible to win--which also happens to be a Maryland record. 
   Every Falcons team member was a contributor to this important victory. On the offensive, the game's leading strikers were Audra Poulin and Jenny Potter, who had three goals apiece. Jenna Linden added two goals to the team's fight, while Christi Bird, Stephanie Sybert, and Allison Dooley chipped in the remaining scores for the Falcons. This overpowering offense was aided by the passing and play-making abilities of the Falcons' talented mid-fielders: Beth Hendricks, Tara Quinn, Jennifer Fields, Susannah Empson, and Tanya Hahnel. 
   One of the keys to the Falcons' victory was their unwavering and steadfast defense which allowed no goals and only a few shots by the unrelenting Baltimore Force. This defense was anchored around defenders Caitlin Curtis, Amy Salomon and Alison West, while the goal posts were kept clear by goalies Anna Halse-Strumberg and Kerry York. 
   It was a fitting ending to the tournament in which the Falcons, through five games, outscored their hard-working opponents 29-0. The following day, the Falcons continued their winning efforts by defeating the Baltimore Soccer Club Pride--another great Maryland team. The Falcons finished in first place in the Washington Area Girls' Soccer Association Under-17 Premier Division. 
   Mr. President, as many of my colleagues know, I believe we must get behind our kids and support them in their hard work. The importance of this principle was demonstrated by Falcons coach, Richie Burke, who did just that. As a result, the team fought hard and produced a definitive victory. I'm proud to have such a great team and a fantastic coach in Maryland, and I'm proud of all the participants in the Maryland State Cup Championship for their hard work and dedication.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, once again we come to the floor of the Senate to discuss the appropriations for the VA-HUD appropriations bill. This is a very exciting time because this appropriation is really the bridge between the old century and the new century. I think our bill does reflect, in its funding levels, that we intend for it to be a bridge between the old century and the new century. 
   First of all, a word about the old century. We know that our American veterans, because of their bravery, their gallantry, and their self-sacrifice, saved America and saved Western civilization. That is why this subcommittee fought so hard to save their health care--a bridge from the old century, but a bridge to the new century. 
   We also, during this century, realized that in addition to the ravages of war, there were terrible ravages to our environment. Once again, in our legislation, we make a significant commitment to the protection of not only the environment of the American people but also of the whole world--again, a bridge from the old century to the new century. 
   It was in this century that America moved forward economically, first in its industrial age, and now toward the information age. But in the course of this century, we not only made a commitment to the progress of a few, we made a commitment to the progress of many. Through programs such as housing and urban development, we have continued to work to create a real opportunity structure for our American citizens. 
   What is the hallmark of the American opportunity structure? One is home ownership. Through the VA mortgage program, the FHA program, and other key programs, we create a wider opportunity for people to be able to own a home in the United States of America. 
   The other hallmark of the bridge from the old century to the new century is our passion for education. It was we, in the United States of America, whose continual social inventions created opportunities for people to pursue higher education. 
   When my great grandmother came from Poland, she certainly could read, but she wanted us to be able to do more than to be able to read the newspaper or read our scriptures. She wanted us to have a real education. It was out of the American people inventing night school, a community college, a GI bill of rights, that we were able to make sure ordinary people had access to higher education. This is why we continue to be so enthusiastic about AmeriCorps. Right this very minute, there are young people working in communities all over the United States of America, in public education, public safety, and other areas, to ensure that we help our communities. But they are earning a voucher that they can use to pay for their higher education. Once again, a bridge from the desires of the old century to the new century.  
   What, too, is the hallmark of the genius of the American people? It is our resourcefulness, our ingenuity, and our innovation. America is the nation of science and technology. It was in our great Federal laboratories that some of the greatest advances were made in the old century. We want to be sure we position them for the new century. Therefore, this appropriation continues to stay the course in science and technology, particularly in the environment, in NASA--our national space agency--and also in the National Science Foundation. 
   That is really what this bill is all about. When we rise on the floor and talk to our colleagues about numbers and data, we 
   sometimes sound like an annual report. But when we talk about what we want the Senators to vote on, we have to remember what our mission is. I believe the mission of the VA-HUD bill is to honor the old century, make sure we deal with the ravages and problems of the old century, and continue to position our country and our people for the new century. 
   This takes me, then, to some of the specifics of the bill. I really thank Senator KIT BOND, the chairman of the subcommittee, and his staff, for all of the collegial consultation we had during the preparation of this bill. 
   I say to my colleague from Missouri and to all Senators listening, that we know this is not a perfect bill, but it is a very good bill. We had the will but we did not have the wallet to be able to do what we wanted to do for the various agencies and programs. Hopefully, as we move through conference and as the issues around spending caps are resolved, new opportunities might occur that would allow us to meet funding levels that we think are appropriate. This bill is a work in progress, but the bill we bring here today is one that I feel satisfied to bring to the Senate. 
   A special thanks to Senators STEVENS and BYRD, who really foraged to find another $7.2 billion in budget authority and another $5 billion in outlays to be able to move this bill, with bipartisan support, to the Senate floor today. 
   The timing of this bill is noteworthy. Right now, a significant approach that we have with this bill is to make sure we fund the Federal Emergency Management Program. From Maine to Florida, and particularly with key residents in North Carolina, New Jersey, and in my own State of Maryland, we worry right now about the ravages of Hurricane Floyd. But in this bill, we continue our commitment to FEMA, and we include an additional $300 million for disaster relief funding. This means that FEMA is ready to help those communities recover from this devastating storm. Should the administration request additional funding for disaster relief, we will also be ready. 
   Let's go to VA. First of all, our obligation to our veterans is this: promises made need to be promises kept. What does the American veterans community want? They want to make sure that for the older veteran and the Vietnam and Korean war veteran, we continue to provide them with quality health care. But we need to make sure that VA, as it always has, continues to be a door of opportunity, particularly through the GI bill, for home ownership and education. 
   I would hope that one day the VA benefit would be a tool for lifetime learning and the subject of a new century discussion. 
   We have increased funding for VA by over $1 billion to a total of $18 billion for veterans' health care. This was really the recommended level that came from the Government Accounting Office. We know that the VA medical care could always be funded additionally, but right now that is what we bring, and we are now looking at an amendment with proper other resources to fund it. 
   Also, another significant part of the VA budget is that we maintain the funding for VA medical research at $316 million. The Veterans' Administration continues to play a very important role in medical research for the special needs of our veterans, including areas such as geriatrics, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and orthopedic research. The benefits of VA medical research are not limited to veterans. The entire Nation benefits because of VA medical research. 
   We continue to provide funding to treat something called Hepatitis C, a growing problem among the veteran population, particularly our Vietnam vets. We want to be sure that we help them with their problem and also do all we can to ensure that it is not spread in the wider population. 
   In addition, we have increased the funding for State veterans homes by $50 million over the President's request to $90 million. This is the same as last year. Why are the State homes so important? We know that long-term care is a growing issue, particularly with our World War II vets and our Korean vets. We believe in Federal and State partnerships. 
   No one jurisdiction of Government can carry the burden of long-term care by itself; and therefore, the additional funding for State veterans homes enables that wonderful partnership to occur between the Feds and the States and the veterans themselves. 
   We also come to a discussion on HUD. 
   The whole point of the Housing and Urban Development Agency is to be able to help communities in terms of being able to have economic development and for individuals to have economic empowerment. That is it. It is to fund primarily self-help initiatives or to reward self-help initiatives. Therefore, what we wanted to do in HUD was to stay the course for the community development block grant money, which goes directly to local communities with local decisionmaking. With this funding, mayors, county executives, or commissioners can decide for themselves what the best way to revitalize their communities is, and not have cookie-cutter solutions coming out of Washington. 
   At the same time, we wanted to be sure the poor have a way to a new life, particularly with the significant success of our Welfare-to-Work Program. This is why we have a program called HOPE VI where we took down the high rises, which were ZIP Codes of poverty, to really create a new opportunity. We want to do the same thing for section 8 so we do not continue to have the concentrations of poverty that we have. 
   This year, working together with the authorizers, we were able to be sure that everyone who has a section 8 contract--meaning a Government subsidy for housing--will continue to get their subsidy. This is no small matter. We have a lot of section 8's that are expiring. We wanted to be sure that if you had a section 8, and you were living in a neighborhood, moving from welfare to work, trying to get job training, you would not lose your subsidy. This was indeed a significant accomplishment in this bill. 
   Last year, working with the authorizers, we also added 50,000 new vouchers. The administration would like to add 100,000 new vouchers. I personally would like very much to do that. But right now, as I said, we do not have the wallet. I am working with the administration to find an appropriate offset not only to pay for new vouchers now, but to insist that anything new has to have a sustainable revenue stream in the future. This is important because we are concerned that though we have started, we want to be 
   able to continue it. That is a big yellow flashing light for me, and we need to be aware of that. 
   Another area that is very special to me is housing for the elderly. Once again, working on a bipartisan basis, we have been able to increase the funding for the elderly and disabled by $50 million. This will be very important as we also look at new ways to help the population as they age in place. 
   I am particularly appreciative of cooperation on developing some new concepts on assisted living and service coordinators to help aging seniors with their unique housing needs. 
   We also help increase the funding for the homeless and do other important things, which I want to discuss later. 
   With regard to NASA, I was extremely troubled by the House version of the bill. I was troubled because they cut NASA by $1 billion. 
   At the same time, I was also troubled that the House seemed to focus a lot of those cuts in my own home State. I do not take it personally, but it certainly was convenient for them, knowing I am the ranking member, to know that I would also mount a rescue mission for the programs in my State. 
   But it is in that State that we have mounted the rescue missions on Hubbell and in other areas. I really appreciate the collegial support of Senator  BOND to look at where we need to put our resources for a national purpose. This isn't about Maryland. 
   We have the great Federal laboratories in Maryland. I do not count NIH as only a Maryland Federal laboratory. It is a national Federal laboratory, and so is Goddard. The Goddard Space Flight Center is the flagship NASA center for Earth and science research. We want to make sure it continues to be able to do that. With the help of this subcommittee, we know we will continue to have those jobs. They will continue to fix Hubbell, have the next generation space telescope, and provide us with new opportunities in terms of protecting the environment. 
   I would like to also go on to National Service, which is funded at $423 million--a reduction from last year. I hope this funding can be increased as the bill moves forward. National Service has been a success. It has enrolled over 100,000 volunteers in a wide array of community programs. 
   I know the management and oversight is less than what is desired. I thank the Senator from Missouri for his limited patience; my patience is also limited. But we have to remember that the mission is working, even though the management and oversight could certainly be improved. 
   I also want to comment on the National Science Foundation. We are so proud of the National Science Foundation. We really do appreciate it, and it is funded at $3.9 billion in the bill, which is an addition of $250 million. 
   What is important about the National Science Foundation is that it was created to respond to be sure that America did not fall behind Russia in science and technology. America continues to lead the world in science and technology, particularly in information technology that has revolutionized the world. This is truly the information age. I appreciate the fact that, working together, we have increased the funding, particularly in those areas that will enhance research and development in the field of information technology. 
   Let me conclude by saying that I will talk more about this bill as we go on. That is the thumbnail sketch. But I do want to just say a couple more things in closing about this bill. 
   First of all, I am very appreciative that we have had the bipartisan support to continue the funding for the Chesapeake Bay Research Program. This was started by my very dear predecessor Senator Mac Mathias, and we all worked together on it. In fact, I was in the House when he started it. 
   But we had the support of four Presidents: Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George Bush, and Bill Clinton. That is exactly what 
   we need--bipartisan support to come up with solutions. 
   But the other thing I am really proud of in this bill is how we help our country continue to cross the digital divide. Bill Gates says we are at the digital divide. We will either be on one side or the other--whether you are a nation, whether you are a community, or whether you are a citizen. 
   I want to be one of the Senators who helps America and all of its citizens, particularly paying attention to rural communities and constituencies that have been left out and left behind, cross that digital divide. 
   In this bill we are doing it. Our funding for NASA helps us do this. The funding we have for the National Science Foundation puts the money in the Federal checkbook to make sure that we come up with the new ideas for the new products that will be part of continuing to cross the digital divide. 
   The Senate knows that one of my greatest passions in public life is to enable the poor to move out of poverty and into self-sufficiency. In this bill, through HUD, we fund something called the Neighborhood Networks Initiative--it has already been in operation; 500 residential computing centers have been established. These Neighborhoods Networks bring together local businesses, community organizations, and other partners. Right this minute in public housing, where we want to make sure people move from welfare to work and children have opportunities for a different way of life, we are creating little e-villages. In these communities, if you work hard, through either structured school activities or daytime use for adults, you can learn to use the computers. This newfound computer knowledge will help residents find good jobs at living wages well into the future. 
   Again, there are many things I could say about this bill and I will say them as we move along. I think we have a very good bill. We are working very closely with Senator BOND, with the leadership of our two parties in the Senate and with our administration. Hopefully, we will pass this bill sometime today, move to conference, and then move forward with the bridge from the old century to the new century. 
   Mr. President, I believe the VA/HUD bill is about four things: meeting our obligations to our veterans; serving our core constituencies; creating real opportunities for people, and advancing science and technology. 
   The VA/HUD bill takes care of national interests and national needs. This has been a tough year for the VA-HUD Subcommittee. Due to the budget caps, our original 602(b) allocation was billions of dollars below what we needed. Senator BOND and I agreed that we would not move a bill until we had a sufficient allocation. But thanks to Senators STEVENS and BYRD, we now have an additional $7.2 billion in discretionary budget authority and nearly $5 billion in outlays. This has allowed us to move this bill with bipartisan support to the Senate floor today. 
   Mr. President, the timing of this bill is noteworthy. Just last week, residents along the Eastern U.S. experienced the wrath of Hurricane Floyd. Everyone from Maine to Florida was affected by this storm, including my own State of Maryland. Many people, including the residents of North Carolina and New Jersey, are still without power and flooded from their homes. 
   Mr. President, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has $1 billion in the disaster relief fund to help state and local governments recover from this storm. The bill we present to the Senate today includes an additional $300 million for the disaster relief fund. That means FEMA is ready to help those communities recover from this devastating storm. Should the administration request additional funding for disaster relief, we will provide whatever is necessary to help those in need. 
   Mr. President, our first obligation is to keep the promises we have made to our Nation's veterans. I am proud to say that in this bill, we have kept those promises to the veterans and the VA employees. I am proud of the men and women who serve our veterans. From the in-patient hospitals to the out-patient clinics, the employees of the VA work long hours and sometimes under difficult conditions. We have increased funding for veterans healthcare by $1.1 billion over the President's request to a total of $18.4 billion for veterans healthcare. Some have argued that we should spend more on veterans healthcare. I consider the $18.4 billion we have provided in this bill to be a funding floor, rather than a funding ceiling. The General Accounting Office generally agreed with this approach as a starting point. 
   In a recent analysis of the VA healthcare budget for our subcommittee, the GAO concluded that a $1.1 billion increase over the President's request should be sufficient--assuming the VA's cost cutting program is successful. Nonetheless, I will continue to work with my colleagues to ensure VA has more than sufficient funding for our veterans healthcare needs. In addition, we have maintained funding for VA medical research at $316 million, the same as fiscal year 1999. 
   The VA plays a very important role in medical research for the special needs of our veterans such as geriatrics, Alzheimers, Parkinson's, and orthopedic research. The benefits of VA medical research are not limited to veterans. The entire nation benefits from VA medical research--particularly as our population continues to age. We also provide full funding to treat Hepatitis C, a growing problem among the veterans population, particularly for our Vietnam veterans. 
   We have increased funding for the State veterans homes by $50 million over the President's request to $90 million, the same as last year. The State homes serve as our long term care and  rehabilitation facilities for our veterans. They represents a uniquely successful partnership between the Federal and State governments. By increasing funding in this area, we keeping our promises to our veterans and meeting a compelling human need. 
   We have also made sure that we take care of our working families--by funding housing programs that millions depend upon. Our bill provides $10.8 billion to renew all existing section 8 housing vouchers. That means those who have vouchers, will continue to receive them. Unfortunately, we were unable to provide additional funding to add 100,000 new vouchers at this time. We simply could not find an additional $600 million in budget authority to cover the cost of 100,000 new vouchers. Many of my colleagues will remember that we added 50,000 new vouchers last year. But a tight allocation simply did not give us enough room to add more vouchers at this time. We maintained level funding for other critical core HUD programs. 
   Funding for housing for the elderly has been increased over last year. Funding for the elderly and disabled is $904 million, a $50 million increase over last year. We have including additional funding for assisted living and service coordinators within the section 202 program. 
   This has always been a top priority of mine and Senator BOND. We will always make sure that the housing needs of our elderly are met. We also must recognize that the housing needs of the elderly are changing--the elderly are aging in place. That's why we included additional funding for assisted living and service coordinators to help our aging seniors with their unique housing needs. 
   Homeless assistance grants are funded at the Presidents's request. In a time of prosperity, we will not forget those who are truly in need. In addition, we have funded drug elimination grants and Youthbuild at least year's level. 
   The Community Development Block Grant Program is funded at $4.8 billion. This is an increase of $50 million from last year and $25 million over the President's request. The CDBG program has been a very successful program targeting federal funds for economic development--with local control. In addition, I have included report language that directs HUD to continue its efforts to bridge the information technology gap in communities through its ``Neighborhood Networks Initiative.'' The Neighborhood Networks Initiative brings computers and internet access to HUD assisted housing projects in low income communities. This will help us to ensure that every American has the ability to cross what Bill Gates has called the ``digital divide.'' 
   With regard to NASA funding, I was extremely troubled by the House version of the bill. The House bill included devastating funding cuts to America's space agency. The Goddard Space Flight Center in my home state of Maryland, and the Wallops Flight Facility on Virginia's Eastern Shore both took a significant hit in the House bill. The House funding levels would mean the loss of over 2,000 jobs at Goddard and Wallops. The bill before the Senate today will save 2000 jobs at Goddard and Wallops. 
   NASA if fully funding in this bill, at $13.5 billion, which is the President's request. Funding for shuttle, space station, and the critical science programs are funded at the President's request. This will allow us to maintain this country's or science and technology leadership and reflects the Senate's commitment to science and technology as we enter the next millennium. 
   National Service is funded at $423 million, a slight reduction from last year. I hope this funding can be increased as the bill moves forward. National Service has been a success, enrolling over 100,000 volunteers in a wide array of community services. 
   With regard to the EPA, the subcommittee has provided $7.3 billion in total funding, an increase of $115 million over the President's request. The subcommittee has increased funding for most of EPA's major environmental programs: the bill provides $825 million for the drinking water state revolving fund; and $1.3 billion for the clean water revolving fund. Taking care of local communities infrastructure needs has always been a priority for this committee. 
   Superfund is funded at $1.4 billion, down slightly from last year, but brownfields is funded at $90 million, the same as last year. I know there is some concern over EPA's salary and expense account, and I hope we can address these concerns as the bill moves forward. 
   The subcommittee has also provided funding at or above the President's budget request for important FEMA programs: Emergency Management and Planning, Anti-Terrorism Programs, and the Disaster Fund. We will await any further administration request for disaster assistance in light of Hurricane Floyd. 
   The National Science Foundation is funded at $3.9 billion, which is $250 million more than fiscal year 1999. This funding level will allow us to make critical investments in science and technology into the next century. The funding increases for NSF is an important step for maintaining our science and technology base. 
   With regard to the Selective Service, we have restored funding for Selective Service at the President's request. The House eliminated funding for the Selective Service. 
    Mr. President, I recognize that there may be certain provisions that members may disagree with or oppose. I acknowledge the validity of their concerns, but I hope we can move the bill forward and resolve these differences along the way. I believe the VA/HUD bill that we present to the Senate today, keeps the promises to our veterans, helps our core constituencies, creates real opportunities and makes investments in science and technology. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the chairman. I note that Senator BINGAMAN also wants to be added as a cosponsor of the pending veterans amendment. 
   I am pleased to join with several of my colleagues to cosponsor this amendment to increase funding for VA medical care by $600 million. I appreciate especially Senator BYRD's continued, steadfast support for our veterans. We could not be offering this amendment without Senator BYRD and Senator STEVENS. Earlier, I talked about how pleased I was with the bill--promises made, promises kept. But we wanted to do more. We had the will, but we didn't have the wallet. This is exactly an example of what I was talking about. We had the will to be able to provide a safety net for veterans' medical health care. 
   We know that the cost of health care continues to be rising. We know that the discussion on how to reform Medicare is a work in progress within this institution and our colleagues in the House. It will have a tremendous impact on our veterans. We also know that the need for prescription medication among our veterans is escalating. Those wonderful breakthroughs we have are expensive. We want to make sure that if you have arthritis or if you are facing prostate cancer, you have the medical resources that are needed. So, yes, the amount we currently have in the bill meets minimum, spartan levels. 
   This $600 million will help us tremendously. It will benefit our veterans to assure that there will be no need to close VA clinics around the country. They will be sure that no inpatient facilities will close and ensure that veterans continue to get access to the quality health care they deserve. 
   First of all, I know that all over America the Veterans' Administration is analyzing what they should keep open, what they should close, and what should go to part time. The fact is, we can't have uncertainty. Why? We want continuity of care for the vets and the ability to retain good and excellent staff. If you don't know today that your VA medical center might be gone tomorrow, those nurses, technicians, lab people, facility managers, who now have great opportunities in the private sector, are being attracted and recruited to leave. We have to show certainty in terms of being able to provide care and give assurance to the personnel that we value them and we want to be able to fund them at the appropriate level. 
   So I really thank Senator BYRD and Senator STEVENS for identifying a way we could assure that inpatient and outpatient needs are met. I support this amendment. I am going to support it here and in conference. Once again, I thank the Chair. 
   I yield the floor.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I thank the ranking member of the veterans authorizing committee for his support for this amendment. Most of all, I thank him for his advocacy. He has continued to speak up on what are the contemporary needs of the Veterans' Administration, particularly in health care. The Senator has been very clear in the need to recruit and retain new personnel, to move to new methods of service delivery, how we can be both high tech and high touch. I thank the Senator for his support for this amendment and also thank the Senator for his advocacy. I look forward to working with the Senator not only in moving the bill but moving our agenda to help veterans and doing it together.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, first I thank the Senator from West Virginia, Mr. BYRD, for his assistance on this bill and his advocacy for veterans. We would not have even be able to move this bill to the floor had it not been for Senator STEVENS and Senator BYRD identifying the $600 million. We need to look at where we were 6 weeks ago. 
   Veterans' health care under the spending caps was down $1 billion. Thanks to the advocacy and ingenuity, I might add, of the chairman of the Appropriations Committee and the ranking member, we were able to come to the floor. That is why I also said in my opening statement that we had the will, but we didn't have the wallet. 
   Again, with Senator BYRD and Senator STEVENS identifying a window or a particular technique to declare $600 million in emergency, we will be able to ensure that nothing is closed. 
   I don't dispute the comments of the Senator from Minnesota about the need for more. I also don't dispute his comments about the need for better. The Senator from Minnesota is well known for his advocacy for veterans. We particularly congratulate him for his steadfastness in continuing to bring to our attention the plight of veterans with posttraumatic stress syndrome. 
   I also remember him speaking for the nuclear vets--those who were exposed to nuclear radiation where that trauma was not compensated for or identified. 
   I thank the Senator for what he has done, but I have to say his amendment violates the Budget Act. It breaks the spending caps. He and I know the Budget Act leaves much to be desired. The budget policy leaves much to be desired because the spending caps have prohibited us from meeting compelling human needs. 
   I know that some time this week President Clinton will be vetoing the tax bill. I am glad he is going to do that because then maybe we can get down to serious business about how we can fund Social Security, extend the solvency of Medicare, and meet compelling human needs. 
   I say to the Senator that I support what he wants to do in principle, but I will not be able to support his amendment because it violates the budget caps. But, again, the points that he has made are very well taken.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, this is a sad state of affairs. This last amendment offered by the Senator from New Hampshire is particularly troubling. We all agreed that we need to fund veterans' medical care. We all agreed that we needed to fund more. We all agreed when we worked in the full committee, in the Appropriations Committee, we wanted to do more. We had the will but we didn't have the wallet. 
   Working on a bipartisan basis, the chairman and ranking members of the Appropriations Committee found a way to add $600 million more to VA medical care. It is absolutely a good idea. We intend to support it. 
   Also, the chairman and ranking member, along with Senator BOND and myself, know that declaring it an emergency is a temporary technique because we are in a situation where we are operating under such tough spending caps. 
   The Senator from Minnesota has offered an amendment that violates the Budget Act because it busts the caps. We will oppose that. 
   The Senator from New Hampshire, a well-known advocate for veterans, a staunch supporter for the return of the MIAs, now offers an amendment. However, he takes it out of the Corporation for National Service, otherwise known as AmeriCorps. This is a sad state of affairs, that while we are trying to meet the compelling human need of our veterans, we are going to further reduce a self-help opportunity program for higher education, which is exactly what our veterans want Members to support. I will go into that in a minute. 
   I will oppose the amendment of the Senator from New Hampshire and support the tabling motion of the Senator from Missouri. Why? Not because I don't want to help veterans; we are helping the veterans in this bill. 
   But we are now pitting one good program against another good program in terms of its mission and purpose. Both veterans' medical and AmeriCorps leave a lot to be desired in the management area. But at the same time, if we stick to the mission, we can continue this bill. 
   I strongly believe in the importance of National Service and voluntarism. I helped create the original bill. I believe we need to do all we can to maintain an opportunity structure for access to higher education and also to teach the values of the habits of the heart--that for every right there is a responsibility, for every opportunity there is an obligation. 
   The National Service does that. Right now, there are 66,000 people who have participated in the program. They are out there doing very important community service, leveraging other volunteers. For that, they are earning a voucher toward their higher education. I do not think anyone can dispute the merits of a program that shows for every opportunity there is an obligation, for every right there is a responsibility. That is one of the core values for which our vets fought so hard. But the corporation has already taken a cut in funding. It is now being funded below last year's level and below the President's request. 
   The corporation was established to enhance those opportunities available for national and community service and to provide these educational awards for those who participate. Through the corporation, we help not only communities but those who volunteer as well. National Service participants may receive educational awards that can be used for full-time or part-time education, vocational ed, or job training. This is great. I know how much the Senator from Ohio believes in the great American opportunity structure. But this is not a giveaway; you have to do sweat equity in the community. 
   National Service does have its problems within its organization. Its oversight and its management do need to be improved. But we should not further reduce the funding of National Service; we should find a way to deal with the spending caps. This program is a success, and it must be maintained. 
   Earlier today we adopted that amendment to increase veterans' health care by $600 million. With this, it means that veterans' health care will be funded at $1.7 billion over the President's request. Senator BOND and I agree, the President's request was too skimpy. We agree with that. So we added in a billion in the committee. Now we are adding another $1.6 billion. So we believe we are working, as a work in progress, to meet the needs of veterans' health care. 
   But I do not want to see these generational issues here. I do not want to see old, sick vets pitted against young Americans who are willing to be working in disaster relief, tutoring people, and also serving the homeless--pitted against that. 
   Guess one of the other things that National Service is doing. We talk about it in our own report. The National Service volunteers are helping the homeless. They also have a particular outreach program to homeless vets. So it should not be either/or. National Service right now, as we speak--as we speak, there are over 10,000 volunteers providing tutoring in elementary schools. The Civilian Corps is a 10-month program on disaster relief. They are right there now in North Carolina. They are helping clean up other parts of our country. But we are saying no, we are not going to fund these programs because we want to fund veterans' health care? I think the vets would 
   say: We need our health care; we need our facilities open, with the best of the staff and the supplies and the prescription drugs we need. We agree with that. But I do not think they would want it at the expense of these young people. I really do not believe it. 
   One of the things National Service is doing is not only helping the community but it is called values. What do our vets stand for? Patriotism. Our young people are out there serving America. They stand for loyalty. These young people are learning loyalty and the habits of the heart. 
   Our veterans stood for self-sacrifice, neighbor helping neighbor, and the defense of the Nation. These young people are part of a national defense effort, eliminating poverty, illiteracy, helping the homeless. At the end of their 2-year program, they go on to school and they get on with their lives. Just as the Peace Corps, they are forming alumni associations, and they keep on giving, and they keep on recruiting people who give, many of whom will visit veterans' nursing homes. 
   So let's not pit one generation of Americans against the other. Let's make sure we follow a wise and prudent course to honor our veterans and to make sure that our young people have access to higher education, earning a voucher through their own sweat equity, but learning the values of the greatest generation that ever existed, those who fought for us in World War II. 
   I yield the floor.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maryland, Mr. SARBANES, and the Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. REID, for their compliments. I particularly want to thank the Senator from Maryland, my very dear and esteemed colleague. We have a wonderful alignment in Maryland with Senator SARBANES, the ranking member on authorizing and I on housing appropriations. I thank him for all of the work he has done in terms of our housing and our urban economic development initiatives, and also for being concerned to make sure that HUD serves not only urban America but our rural and suburban communities as well. I thank him for his steadfast belief that the American dream is home  ownership and for his desire to promote home ownership. I am particularly grateful for that, and we have done that in this bill. Also, he is a champion for the homeless, which, again, I believe we address in this bill. 
   Then there is the in-between group, those people working for self-help, working very hard to move from welfare to work. They often qualify while they are working for certain subsidies, be they food stamps and, in some cases, section 8 housing, essentially making work worth it. If you are willing to work hard every day, we are willing to at least subsidize housing for you and your family. So his presentation about the need for more section 8 vouchers, I believe, was an excellent one and one with which I am in complete agreement. 
   I say to my colleague from Maryland that this bill is a work in progress. To be able to find an offset or a new revenue stream to meet the need for new vouchers now and to be able to sustain them in the future is a set of actions I wish to take. I am working closely with the administration to find an offset that would be both reliable and sustainable, and I look forward to our continued working relationship. I welcome his ongoing support and collaboration. Again, this bill is a work in progress. I really do thank the Senator. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I, too, wish to, first of all, express my support for the people of North Carolina. I believe the way we express our support and our concern is not only with kind words, which we would like to say many, but with deeds. Right now James Lee Witt and other emergency management people are responding with gallantry and are trying to get a swift assessment of damage. We want to work with you, Senator HELMS and Governor Hunt, to really be able to get emergency assistance to the communities and to do it in a way that is swift, helpful, and also affordable. 
   I, too, have been hit by damage in my State. Senator BOND is right. One of the first things we did together was to be in Missouri because they had been hit by floods. A short time later we were hit by ice storms and floods. 
   You know what is so heartbreaking: After the floods and the waters come, then the water goes down, and you just see broken dreams, the hard work of lifetimes just washed away. You go  into a home, and there is the tattered photograph of the wedding picture, there is the mud-saturated picture of the graduation, and the appliances when you open the door. I think what I remember also, most of all, in addition to the tears, is the mud, the smell, and so on. 
   The first thing is that it breaks your heart. We want to make sure it does not break their pocketbook. That is what we can work on. 
   Hurt hearts. I believe the people of North Carolina will have so many communal ways that those hearts will be healed. But the immediate thing we can do is to make sure that the devastation to the pocketbook is not permanent and that they have the opportunity to restore a way of life. 
   So I just say to the Senator from North Carolina, Mr. EDWARDS, that he is not alone nor are those thousands and thousands of people. We have been thinking about you. We have been praying for you. Our hearts are filled with sadness that people have lost their lives. We really do not want to see the loss of their way of life.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, a comment on the remarks made by the junior Senator from Maine. I, too, share her concern to ensure that the needs of the homeless are recognized, and we try to do that in our bill. As she knows, under this bipartisan coalition, we increased funding for the homeless by $45 million. We have to talk about not only more but how it is distributed. 
   I share the Senator's concern about the rural homeless because it is not only isolated but it is often invisible because of distance and the very culture of small towns and also, I might add, in Maine, that Yankee spirit of ``we take care of our own,'' not wanting ``to turn to charity,'' yet at the same time facing very rugged winters, some of which now, with fall weather, are on their way. So when we think about Maine, it is not all L.L. Bean catalogs and fall foliage. It is some very serious problems. 
   We want to work with the Senator on it. Know that we face some of these same rural issues in our own home States. I thank the Senator for bringing even more heightened visibility in our debate.

Obviously, I appreciate the Senators' needs to defend their constituents' interests, and the plight of people losing businesses, of course, is significant to us all. I wish I would have known the time so we could have been better able to organize and plan our amendments. 
   I know the leadership of both parties is now consulting on what is the best way to proceed for the rest of the evening in terms of amendments to be offered. I know there are amendments that are being drafted, and I also know the two leaders are discussing what is the best way to come to closure on the number of amendments to be offered. So right this minute, because we missed a certain window to offer two important amendments, we are now involved in a process. But I am reluctant to yield the floor except to Senator BOND because I am going to stick on VA-HUD, and with all of the compelling issues in that bill.

As you know, he was prepared to offer them and then he moved on to other constituent meetings because we didn't know if we were in a filibuster or not. I didn't even know, and we are sorry that we could not pinpoint the time. 
   I say to the Senator from Missouri, just another few moments of patience. We are contacting Senator KERRY to see if he can break free from the meetings and come to the floor to offer his amendment within the next 20 minutes or so, or shorter. In the meantime, we also know the Senator is anxious, as I am, for a unanimous consent to be hotlined with a deadline for amendments to be filed. 
   As I understand it, we are waiting for the majority leader to see if he is in agreement with the UC as proposed by the Democratic leader. We are waiting, one, for Senator LOTT on the UC, and Senator JOHN KERRY, the Senator from Massachusetts, to come this evening. If he can, we will keep on going. If not, I am not quite sure what the other amendments are. I know the Senator from Missouri has a whole group of constituents who are a special affinity group for him that he is anxious to get to.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I concur with its adoption and want to congratulate the Senator from Maine, Ms. SNOWE, for this amendment. Her criteria on Veterans Equitable Resource Allocation--nicknamed VERA--is absolutely right. I hope the VA uses it as a model for looking at the delivery generally: Travel time to veterans' health care, waiting time for appointments, costs associated with additional community-based outpatients, and also not only the waiting period but what we heard in other debate is, sometimes they wait and then they are sent home, sending them back another 150 miles and coming back another 150 miles. I believe our veterans have marched long enough and they shouldn't have to march to get their health care.

I am ready to also accept this amendment and wish to note, though, this seems to be a pattern with VA, where our colleagues in the Congress have to keep giving them commonsense criteria on how to decide what is the best way to serve veterans. 
   We know we are in the veterans' health care business. We know we are not in the veterans' real estate business. But surely, clear criteria and talking with the people most affected would go a long way. 
   There was a saying in the early Polish Parliament that said:  
   Nothing about us without us.  
   I think that is the way the veterans feel. That is the way the Members of the Senate feel: Hello, Veterans Administration. Please, get to work on these criteria and follow what the Senate is telling you. 
   I am happy to accept this amendment and urge its adoption.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I wish to convey to the chairman of the subcommittee that the Senator from Massachusetts said he would be ready to go first thing in the morning. So I know of no other amendments this evening where the Senators are ready to offer them. My suggestion would be that we close out this evening and begin bright and early with the Kerry of Massachusetts amendments on section 8 and also the issue of housing for AIDS patients.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I oppose the Gorton amendment on CAFE standards. I oppose lifting the freeze on CAFE standards because it would hurt American workers, American consumers and our economy. 
   First, if we raise CAFE standards--we lose American jobs. More and more American workers are building larger cars and sport utility vehicles. That's because these are the cars that Americans want to buy. But if we raise CAFE standards, U.S. car makers will be forced to build smaller cars. That means higher costs--for new equipment, new product lines, new tests. I'd rather see these resources used to leapfrog to new technologies that make cars safer and more efficient. 
   Meanwhile, our foreign competitors won't have to do anything. They won't face new costs. So by raising CAFE standards, we'll put American workers at a competitive disadvantage with their foreign competitors. 
   Second, raising the CAFE standards means fewer choices and higher prices for American consumers. Americans are buying larger cars and SUVs because they're safer and better fit their families' needs. So by raising CAFE standards, consumers will have fewer large cars to choose from. They'll also face higher prices--since manufacturers will pass on their higher costs. 
   Finally, we cannot forget the reason why so many Americans are buying larger cars--because they are safer. If we have more small cars on the road, we will likely have more injuries and fatalities that result from car accidents. 
   We need to save America's economy, America's jobs and American lives. I urge my colleagues to join me in rejecting this effort to lift the freeze on CAFE standards.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I oppose the President's decision to grant clemency for the FALN terrorists. 
   I oppose clemency for two reasons. First of all, this clemency decision violates the tenets of our counter terrorism policy. Terrorism is one of the greatest threats facing our nation. We say that we will fight terrorism with every tool that we have. We say that we will make no concessions to terrorists. We say that we'll track the terrorists down--no matter where they are, no matter how long it takes. We say that we'll hold them accountable--and punish them to the fullest extent of the law. By granting clemency to terrorists, we are saying that these tenets don't always apply. What kind of message does it send to offer clemency to those who are guilty of the most heinous and cowardly crimes? 
   Terrorism is a real threat to America--and to individual Americans. Too many families are suffering the inconsolable loss of their loved ones--because some murdering thug wants to make a political point. Too many times, I have called grieving families to express my sorrow. After Pan Am 103 was destroyed over Scotland, I called the families of seven young people from Maryland who were brutally and callously murdered. We recently marked the tenth anniversary of this terrible crime--and we are still seeking justice. I also think about a young Navy diver from Maryland--Robert Stethem--who was murdered in a terrorist attack in 1985. The victims of terrorism deserve justice that is not watered down. 
   The second reason I oppose clemency is that I am not convinced that the terrorist have expressed sufficient remorse. Each of these individuals had many years to express remorse and renounce violence. I haven't heard that the FALN terrorists have changed their lives to reflect a change of heart. I haven't heard about any apologies or expressions of regret. Their renunciation of terrorism was tepid. It came only in exchange for their freedom. I don't consider this true remorse. I don't consider this worthy of clemency. 
   So I will support this resolution to disapprove of clemency for terrorists. I am sorry that the President chose to shorten the sentences of terrorists who feel justified in using violence to achieve their political goals.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am horrified by the atrocities occurring in East Timor--where an armed militia is using murder and intimidation to nullify the results of a free and fair referendum. The United States must join the international community in protecting the people of East Timor from mass murder and religious persecution. 
   During this century, we have seen horrifying examples of dictators and despots whose brutality begins with attacks on the peaceful men and women of the church. This is happening again in East Timor--where members of the Church are being brutally persecuted. 
   The stories coming out of East Timor are heart-wrenching. 
   Women and children are massacred within the sanctuary of their churches. Catholic priests, nuns and Caritas workers are being murdered as they try to protect their communities. Nobel Loreate Bishop Beli has been forced into exile. Churches, convents and schools are being burned. Thousands of men, women and children are fleeing from their homes in fear. They are taking refuge in the countryside--where there isn't enough food, water or medicine. 
   This brutality is occurring with the complicity of the Indonesian military. This is a military that has conducted twenty five years of repression in East Timor. It is a military that the United States has trained and armed. 
   The international community cannot stand by while civilians are brutally murdered. That is why I support President Clinton's statement of support for US participation in an United Nations peacekeeping force. The force would be led by regional powers--including our strong ally Australia. The United States would help to provide logistical support. 
   This peacekeeping force would have three goals: to protect the people of East Timor; to restore order and to enable the referendum for independence to be implemented. 
   The United States must stand up for our interests and our values. We must join our allies in protecting the people of East Timor and restoring peace and stability to their country.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, it is with great sadness that I rise to pay tribute to the life of Captain Jennifer Shafer Odom. She died on a mountainside in Colombia--where she was defending our Nation and our values. 
   This morning, her grieving family is at Dover Air Force Base--to bring their daughter home for the last time. 
   On July 23, Captain Odom was on an Army reconnaissance plane that was flying near a major drug-producing region of Colombia. During bad weather, the plane crashed into a mountainside--killing the five Americans and two Colombians on board. These brave soldiers were casualties in our war against drugs. They were fighting to keep drugs off our streets and out of our schools. They know that this is essential to our national security and our national values. 
   Captain Odom grew up in Brunswick, Maryland. She was a valedictorian at Brunswick High School. She was active in so many areas--from sports to theater. 
   As a scholar, an athlete and a leader--it's not surprising that she chose to attend the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. She wanted to use her many talents to serve her country. 
   She graduated from West Point in the top quarter of her class. She served in the United States Army with valor and distinction--raising to rank of Captain. 
   But it is not just for her accomplishments that she will be missed. I've spoken to her family several times in the past few days. What comes across is their pride in the kind of person that she was. She was so dear to her friends and neighbors that the entire community joined in a prayer chain to pray for her and for her family. 
   Captain Jennifer Shafer Odom served our country with distinction. Her courage and her sacrifice remind us that our freedom abides in the heroism of pilots like Captain Odom. 
   Her death was a tragedy--but her life was a triumph. She leaves behind a grieving husband, and her heartbroken parents. I ask my colleagues to join me in keeping Captain Odom and her family in our prayers.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the Democratic Emergency Relief Package for Agriculture. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this critical amendment. American farms are struggling to survive. This package creates a safety net for our farmers who are facing a devastating drought. 
   I support this amendment for three reasons. First it will help our farmers in Maryland who are suffering through an extreme drought. Second, it will help us maintain our agri-economy in the United States. Third, it is comprehensive because it helps farmers in all regions of the country. 
   My state of Maryland is suffering from the most severe drought in the State's history. Last week, Governor Glendening declared a state-wide drought emergency. This is the first time in Maryland's history that the Governor has had to take such drastic measures. Up to this point, water conservation efforts have been voluntary. Now, Marylanders will be required by law to conserve water. The United States Geological Survey officials are calling the drought of 1999 possibly the century's worst in the Mid Atlantic region. We can't stand by and let our farmers face this drought on their own. These are hard working, tax paying Americans who are facing a crisis. If we don't help them, we all lose. 
   Maryland has now been plagued by drought for the third consecutive year. The drought has destroyed between 30 percent and 80 percent of the crops in nineteen counties in Maryland. Loss of soybean, tobacco, wheat and corn crops is making this a very tough season for Maryland farmers. Our farmers need our help. Our farmers are losing crops and they are losing money--without help, they might lose their farms. Couple the drought with the record low prices, high costs and a glut in the market and that spells disaster for Maryland farmers. 
   I am already fighting with the rest of the Maryland delegation to designate Maryland farmland as disaster areas because of the drought. This means the Department of Agriculture will provide emergency loans to our farmers. But we need to do more. Loans need to be paid back. Loans do not provide any real long term assistance for our farming community. We must also provide grants for these farmers who are suffering most from the drought. The Democratic package contains direct payments to help our farmers. These grants could mean the difference between saving the family farm or selling out to the highest bidder. 
   Mr. President, the second reason I support this package is because it supports our family farms. Agriculture is a critical component of the U.S. economy. Our country was built on agriculture. Agriculture helps us maintain our robust economy. It is what fills our grocery stores with fresh, plentiful supplies of safe food for our families. It allows us to trade with other countries and build global economies and partnerships. It allows us to assist other countries whose people need food. Agriculture is the number one industry in the State of Maryland. We need to make sure U.S. agriculture is strong. We cannot allow natural disasters to ruin this crucial sector by putting farms out of business for good. These are good farmers who, through no fault of their own, have been put in devastating situations. These are farmers we need. I will not stand by and allow them to go under. We must pass this farm package to save our farmers. 
   Finally, Mr. President, I support this package because it supports farmers in all regions of the country. The combination of low prices, lack of adequate crop insurance and natural disasters has made it a challenge to draft a package that helps everyone. Different areas of the country suffer from one or all of these contingencies. As I mentioned, Maryland suffers from all three. This makes it especially hard for us. It also makes it especially vital that we pass this farm relief package today. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to vote to help our American farmers and to save our farms.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose what the Republicans are calling a tax cut. This so-called tax cut is a gimmick to get attention, to get votes, but not to get America what it needs. 
   The Republicans are trying to pander to every interest group in America and give them a tax break. And who doesn't want a tax break? 
   I oppose these tax cuts for three reasons. First, these tax cuts are premature. They are based on a projected surplus of funds that we do not have. We all know that this surplus exists on paper only. It is no more than a promissory note and we don't know if that note can or will be delivered. 
   Second, these tax cuts are irresponsible. With no surplus, we are spending money before we have it. We are on a collision course between monetary and fiscal responsibility. Shouldn't we combine our monetary and fiscal responsibilities to get the country in the right direction towards growth in the future? 
   Third, these tax cuts are callous. We are giving money away that we don't have--when we've not even met the compelling needs of our country: We've not fixed the draconian Medicare cuts stemming from the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. We've not ensured the long-term solvency of Social Security and Medicare. We've not addressed the spending caps--which are forcing cruel cuts in critical services for veterans health, and children's education, and which are crippling scientific research. 
   The Medicare cuts in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 have already caused 34 Home Health agencies in my state to close--only two public Home Health Agencies remain in Maryland. Maryland is also facing a managed care crisis. Because of Balanced Budget Act of 1997, 18,000 people in Maryland will lose access to supplemental benefits such as prescription drug coverage and preventive health benefits. 
   Republicans may say that a tax cut will allow these senior citizens to use the money from a tax cut to buy supplemental coverage, such as Medi-Gap and that they are returning ``choice'' and ``freedom'' to the American people. But what about the forty-percent of Medicare beneficiaries who do not even submit tax returns because their incomes are so low. Those people will not see a dime of the tax out. They will still not have any way to afford prescription drugs like heart medication or insulin for diabetes, because their HMO left town. 
   Spending caps will threaten our ability to meet compelling human needs; to maintain the national security of the United States; and to stay the course on research and development. 
   Because of the spending caps, veterans of this nation are facing a 10% cut in health care. 
   Because of the spending caps, our members of the military will continue to be forced to shop in consignment shops and use food stamps because they are not making enough money. Mr. President, we cannot have a second-hand military. These are people who put their lives on the line to protect our nation. They should not have to use food stamps to feed their families and shop in second-hand stores for clothing. 
   Because of the spending caps, our continued technological advancement will be jeopardized. America must maintain its competitive edge if we are to maintain our leadership in science and technology. 
   I am not opposed to tax cuts when it is the right time to do so. I believe it is the right time for tax cuts when there is a real and actual surplus or an incredible recession and we need to stimulate consumption. It is clear that neither of these conditions exists today. 
   We need to get back to basics--to save lives, save communities, and save America. I urge my colleagues to join me in rejecting this phony tax cut.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, later today Senator JOHN KERRY, Senator ROCKEFELLER and I will make a motion which protects our senior citizens in the wake of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. I would like to talk about this but I also rise to support the amendment offered by the Senator from New Mexico, Senator BINGAMAN. As usual, his amendment is well thought out. It brings intellectual rigor, sound public policy, and responsible fiscal policy to this debate, and really meets a compelling human need. 
   How I wish the rest of this debate reflected the Bingaman amendment, because I believe we have embarked upon a debate on these tax cuts which are, indeed, reckless. I believe the other party is practicing very reckless economics. First of all, we don't really have a surplus; we have a promissory note of a surplus. No. 2, we are looking at an area where we are not sure what the projections will be, and we need to be prudent. Therefore, we should use the taxpayers' dollars to meet compelling human needs, national security, and stay the course in terms of our research and development. 
   While we are in the midst of debating bloated tax cuts, we have marines who are on food stamps. I don't see how we can meet our national security commitment, do a tax cut, and have marines on food stamps. The marines say ``semper fi''--``always faithful.'' They are faithful to the United States and we have to be always faithful to the Marine Corps and to the military. Right over there in Quantico, they are getting food stamps and they run consignment shops. That is not right. 
   The Senator from New Mexico offers this excellent amendment that says: Stay the course on education. 
   When I travel in my own State, people don't come up to me and say: I have a marriage penalty. They say: I am married, I have children, and I want them to have the same kind of good education I did. Barb, make sure we have sound public schools, well-trained teachers, and structured afterschool activities. That is what the Bingaman amendment does--it lets reserve funds stay the course for our children. 
   While we are looking at Senator BINGAMAN's amendment, there is another compelling human need that needs to be addressed. We have to reserve certain funds to correct the draconian effects of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 on Medicare. The motion that I am cosponsoring will provide $20 billion to fix many of the problems in Medicare reimbursement. My colleagues might recall that in 1997 we passed a Balanced Budget Act. We were going to save money on Medicare. But we went too far in our cuts. HCFA went too far in its regulations. Guess where we find ourselves? In my own home State, 34 home health care agencies have closed. I have 10 public home health agencies, primarily in rural counties, some who travel on snowmobiles to treat home-bound patients, and eight have closed because of the budget cuts. There is a terrible problem, and we need to go back and correct the draconian cuts of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. 
   We also have a situation where we have skilled nursing facilities that are teeter-tottering on closing. Some might say: Oh, that is a profit-making industry. Stella Morris isn't profit making. Hebrew Home isn't profit making. But I will tell you they will now have to find funds through private, philanthropic dollars even though the Government should be providing funds. 
   We have people in my own home State who are being turned away from nursing homes because they are so sick, they have such complicated illnesses, that the nursing home can't take them because of the skimpy, spartan reimbursement policies that are the result of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. 
   Some of those spartan reimbursements went to Medicare HMOs. I always thought that Medicare HMOs for seniors were a risky proposition because our old-timers are sick. They need complicated prescription drugs. I thought that these HMOs that were essentially making a profit may have some problems. However, these HMOs also provide seniors with extra health benefits that they cannot get in regular Medicare, oftentimes for no extra money. 
   Now, I will tell you that the nonprofit HMO in my own State--Blue Cross Blue Shield--is pulling out of 17 rural counties in my State, as of 3 weeks ago in 17 counties, and 18,000 people will lose their Medicare + Choice HMO. Why? Because Blue Cross Blue Shield is losing $5 million, and they can't afford to provide services. 
   Dear colleagues, I ask you to reexamine the premise under which we are operating. 
   No. 1, the surplus is not yet available. It is a promissory note. Let us move with prudence. Let us meet compelling human needs. Let us meet our national security responsibility and stay the course in research and development. 
   Let's support the Bingaman amendment on education. Let's deal with the issues that came from the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. Let's make sure our marines aren't on food stamps. 
   Let's make sure that those on food stamps and their children have access to public education so that in the next generation they won't have to be on food stamps. 
   Then we truly have been responsible. We are then getting our country ready for the millennium. 
   I would like to say one final word in closing. I thank the Senator from New Mexico for his strong advocacy for veterans, and particularly for veterans with disabilities. The Senator knows that we have an 18-month backlog. He has spoken to me about this. 
   In his State, they have billboards complaining about the VA backlog. 
   I bring to the Senator's attention that in VA-HUD appropriations, we  have under this budget allocation a 10-percent cut. We will not be able to deal with that backlog. 
   In fact, while we are opening tax loopholes, we might even be closing veteran hospitals. 
   I yield the floor. 
   I thank the Senator.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise with great sadness today to pay tribute to the lives of John F. Kennedy, Jr., his wife Carolyn, and her sister, Lauren Bessette. My thoughts and prayers are with these families, for at this very moment, as we know, they are at sea to bring these wonderful, outstanding young Americans to a final rest. 
   We in the Senate, of course, feel very close to this tragedy because of our affection for our own colleague, Senator TED KENNEDY. We in Maryland feel very close to this family because we are the home to Eunice and Sarge Shriver, to Mark Shriver, who has taken his place in the House of Delegates, and our own Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, who lost a brother just a few months ago. As the eldest of  the Kennedy cousins, she has endured much. She is living a life of service that certainly would make her father as proud as those of us in Maryland. 
   The entire Kennedy family has suffered so much. They have also given so much. It is a family of war heroes, Senators, Congressmen, and a President of the United States. They are also defenders of the poor, environmentalists, educators, and artists. They fight to give every American an opportunity to build better lives for themselves and to build stronger communities. 
   Many of us in this Senate were inspired to lives of public service because of John F. Kennedy. As a young social worker, I thought he was talking to me when he called our generation to service. When he said, ``Ask not what your country can do for you--but what you can do for your country,'' I believed it. I wanted to do something. That is why I committed myself even more forcefully to my own career in social work. 
   He practiced passionate, active idealism that was different from anything we had seen before in politics. That is why we hoped his son would continue that legacy. In many ways he had already begun to do that. 
   John Kennedy, Jr., could have lived the life of the idle rich, but he did not. He worked several years as a D.A. in New York, and recently he created a magazine to bring young people into politics who were indifferent to it. He endured intense press interest with grace and good humor. It seemed as if he understood his family was a part of the lives of all Americans. 
   While we all know the Kennedys, we cannot forget the Bessette family. They are suffering unimaginable pain with the death of two of their daughters. Carolyn Bessette Kennedy also lived in the spotlight. She, too, handled the attention with grace and charm. She had the same passion for life as her husband. Her sister Lauren was also making her own career in investment banking. 
   Wherever we turn, the Kennedys have touched America. We have been there for their hopes, their dreams, and their good days. We want our dear friend, Senator KENNEDY, the entire Kennedy family, and the Bessettes to know they are not alone today. We mourn with them, and we thank them for their contributions to America and for their own call to duty and to public service. 
   God bless them and God bless America that we have in our midst a great legacy. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, the issue, which I wish to discuss, is the mapping of our country's shoreline. As the chairman knows, the National Ocean Service runs a Coastal Mapping Project which is responsible for mapping the nearly 95,000 miles of the US shoreline in an accurate, consistent, tide-coordinated, and up-to-date manner. 
   I'm concerned that nearly 30 percent of the US shoreline has not been mapped. In addition, one-quarter of what has been mapped as mapped prior to 1970 with severely outdated technology. Since this data is used as the official shoreline on NOAA's nautical charts and is used by the government and the private sectors, it is important to keep up with the changes that result from coastal development and natural processes, which can be drastic. 
   This year, there was an increase over both FY99 funding levels and the administration's FY00 request within the Committee's recommendation for the ``Mapping and Charting'' account. Would you agree, Mr. Chairman, that it is the recommendation of the Committee that $2 million of those funds can be used for shoreline mapping within the Coastal Mapping Project.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I would like to engage the Chairman of the Commerce, Justice, State Subcommittee in a colloquy. 
   I am deeply concerned that the Subcommittee bill does not include the full Administration request for funding of the International War Crimes Tribunals. 
   We are all horrified by the crimes against humanity that occurred in Kosovo. Recent reports state that as many as 10,000 people were murdered. An untold number of women were raped. Hundreds of thousands of people were driven from their homes. The War Crimes Tribunal needs adequate funding to gather evidence, to pursue and to try those who are responsible for these crimes against humanity. 
   Congress provided additional funding for the War Crimes Tribunals in the Supplemental Appropriations bill. These funds were necessary to provide emergency assistance to the War Crimes Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. Before we provided this funding, Chief Justice Louise Arbour said that she had only seven investigators available for Kosovo. However, full funding for the War Crimes Tribunal is necessary for fiscal year 2000, if we are to continue ongoing investigations in Bosnia or Rwanda. 
   The Chairman of the Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations Committee is a strong supporter of law enforcement--both in the United States and abroad. I ask him to join me in supporting the full request for funding of the International War Crimes Tribunals during the Conference on the Commerce, Justice and State Department Appropriations bill.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, twenty five years ago today, Turkish troops invaded and divided the nation of Cyprus. This illegal and immoral division of Cyprus continues today--dividing a country and creating instability in the Mediterranean. 
   During the early days of the Turkish occupation, six thousand Greek-Cypriots were killed. Over two hundred thousand were driven from their homes. Many of the missing, including some Americans, have never been accounted for. 
   Little has changed in the past quarter century. Today, forty thousand Turkish troops remain in Cyprus. The Greek-Cypriots who remain in the northern part of the island are denied basic human rights such as the right to a free press, freedom to travel, and access to religious sites. 
   I am disappointed that we have made no progress in ending the occupation of Cyprus. 
   This year, as we mark this somber anniversary, I urge my colleagues to join me in recommitting ourselves to bring peace to Cyprus. 
   First of all, we must continue to make the resolution of the Cyprus problem a priority. President Clinton and Secretary of State Albright have focused more attention on this region that any other Administration. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke and Ambassador Tom Miller have done an excellent job trying to bring both sides together. As Ambassador Holbrooke assumes his new responsibilities at the United Nations, we must encourage the Administration to replace him with an emissary of equal stature. 
   The second priority is that we must continue to provide humanitarian assistance to the people of Cyprus. Each year, Congress provides fifteen million dollars to foster bicommunal cooperation in Cyprus. These funds are used for education, health care, and to help both communities to solve regional problems--such as to improve water and energy supplies. 
   These funds are an investment in stability in a strategically important region of the world. I'm pleased that the Senate Foreign Operations Appropriations bill includes this funding. As a member of the Subcommittee, I will continue to fight to ensure that the final legislation includes this funding. 
   The third priority is that Congress should pass the Enclaved People of Cyprus Act. Senator OLYMPIA SNOWE and I introduced this legislation to call for improved human rights for the Greek Cypriots living under Turkish control. I urge my colleagues to join us by cosponsoring this legislation. 
   Mr. President, the crisis in Cyprus has brought two NATO allies to the brink of war. The occupation is also a human tragedy that should enrage all of us who care about human rights. We must continue to work toward a peaceful and unified Cyprus.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise as a cosponsor of the Woodrow Wilson Bridge Financing Act of 1999. 
   The Woodrow Wilson bridge is the only federal bridge in the country. This bridge used to be a bridge over troubled water. Now it is a troubled bridge over the Potomac River. We need a new bridge--not only because of the significant increase in the volume of commuters, interstate travelers and trucks that use the bridge, but also for public safety. The construction of this bridge must be completed in a timely way. 
   I support this legislation for two reasons. First, it provides the funding that we need to finish constructing the Woodrow Wilson bridge. Second, it makes the project compliant with the  Clean Air Act as required by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. 
   Specifically, this legislation provides the authorization for an additional $600 million for the bridge. This $600 million is in addition to the $900 million that has already been committed by the federal government. It will provide $150 million per year from 2004 to 2007. 
   The legislation also commits the surrounding states to contribute their fair share to the construction of the bridge. Since federal funding makes up 80% of the cost of the bridge, the Capitol Region jurisdictions are committed to providing the remaining 20%. In fact, the states have to provide at least $0.67 for every $1 provided from the Highway Trust fund. Together, the federal and state governments will be able to provide what we need to build the bridge. 
   The Woodrow Wilson Bridge Financing Act of 1999 is an innovative, creative and resourceful response to what was once a big problem for the entire metropolitan area. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Just for a point of information and clarification back to the Senator from Pennsylvania, in a meeting yesterday with the women of the Senate--a bipartisan meeting, I might add--I believe we were told there is a hold on this among our colleagues. Perhaps we can work together to lift that hold to ensure that the bureaucracy concerns are dealt with so we can go on with the mutual humanitarian concerns that I know we share on both sides of the aisle. 
   Again, I thank the Senator for his leadership on this in the most sincere, kind way.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Democratic whip for yielding me this time. 
   Mr. President, I am troubled about the pending amendment because one of its components my colleagues might not be aware of is that it strips the Democratic provision to provide continuity of care. 
   This is pretty serious because what continuity of care means. What does continuity of care mean? Under our proposal, continuity of care means just because your company changes HMOs, you should not have to change your doctor, or if your doctor is put out of the network, you shouldn't have to leave your doctor. 
   I hope we can make sure that we keep continuity of care in. If we lose it, we are going to have our own amendment. Senator Bob KERREY and I are going to offer our own amendment on continuity of care. I will tell you why we feel so strongly about it. 
   We think the most important thing in getting well is the doctor-patient relationship. You need to have a doctor who knows you, and you need to keep your doctor who has prescribed a course of treatment and who knows you as a person, not as a lab test, not as a chart. We do not believe doctors are interchangeable. We believe you should be able to keep your own doctor. Let me tell you what the Democratic provision does. Under the Democratic proposal, if your company changes HMOs, you get to keep your physician through at least a 90-day transition period. 
   So if you are a diabetic or if you are engaged in a particular course of treatment, you get to keep your doctor. 
   Then we have three provisions that make sure you keep your doctor when you are facing significant medical circumstances. What would be a significant medical circumstance? It means, for instance, when you are pregnant. We think that when you are having your baby and you have an OB/GYN and a course of treatment, you should be able to keep that same doctor all the way through your pregnancy and through your postpartum recovery. 
   Why is that important? Suppose you are a diabetic, or suppose you have kidney problems, or suppose you have a whole variety of other medically indicated symptoms that require very special monitoring; you can't just change your doctor. We certainly don't want to change doctors in late-term pregnancies. We have talked a lot on this floor about late-term pregnancies. Well, let's make sure you get to keep the same doctor during late-term pregnancies. 
   Let's take another issue. If you are terminally ill, under the Republican school of thought you would lose your physician--if you are terminally ill and your company changes providers. We think if you are dying of cancer, if you are in the last stages of any illness, or if your child is in the last stages of illness, you shouldn't have to change your doctor. We truly believe that when a little boy or girl is dying of leukemia and the family is facing the heartbreak of that, they should at least be able to keep the same doctor through the course of treatment. 
   The other exception we provide is if you are in an institution or a facility. So if you are in a mental facility and you are getting well, you are working hard to get well, let's keep the doctor while you are keeping up the fight to get well. If you are also recovering from a stroke and you are in a rehab center, we say you should be able to keep your doctor and the same set of providers throughout that course of treatment. 
   We are being bashed on this floor about how we are for lawyers. Well, I am not for or against lawyers, but I am for doctors. I am really for the doctors and the other appropriate health care providers. I think that if you are pregnant, or terminally ill, or if you are in an institution trying to get better, you ought to be able to keep your doctors, and maybe we would not have to turn to the lawyers. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. FRIST addressed the Chair.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, we are in the closing hours of this debate now. I want to thank the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts for his steadfast advocacy not only this week, but his whole life has been devoted to making sure that people have access to health care, and to believing that in the United States of America there is an opportunity structure where we give help to those people who try to practice self-help--we have done that in education and in our legal framework--and also to be sure that if you have something happen to you in terms of your physical, emotional, or mental well-being, you should have access to health care in the greatest country in the world. 
   I thank Senator KERREY for offering this amendment. I think it is an outstanding amendment and I am pleased to be a cosponsor. I lend my voice to this amendment that the Senator has offered, and I hope that at least once this week we can pass an amendment 100-0, and that we put the profits of an insurance company aside, put the politics of party aside, and that we take a moment to think what is in the best interest of the American people. 
   I hope that on this amendment we can come together. Senator KERREY's amendment is one that I offered in the committee. It was defeated along party lines. But I understand committees. That is the way it goes. But I don't understand how we are doing this on the floor of the Senate because, first of all, we are advocating continuity of care. What does that mean? 
   It means just because your boss changes insurance companies, you don't have to change your doctor. It also means if your physician is pushed out of a network, you are not pushed aside from seeing that physician. 
   Why is this important? It is important because doctors are not interchangeable. The hallmark of getting well and staying well is the relationship between a doctor and a patient. We have known this throughout history. This is nothing new. This goes back to Hippocrates and the earliest basis of medicine. Your doctor knows you as a person--not as a chart or a lab test. Your doctor knows you, your history, your family's history. Your doctor knows what is best for you and how to act in the most prudent way in regard to what is medically necessary or medically appropriate or medically indicated. 
   Why is this important? 
   There are those who will say this will cost too much. I say, if we don't have it, it will be penny-wise and pound-foolish. 
   If you are dumped from seeing the doctor you currently have and you have to start all over again, that doctor is going to have to take a complete physical. The doctor is going to have to take complete tests and in many instances start all over with you. Diabetes is treatable and diabetes is manageable, but if you are a diabetic and go to a new doctor, that doctor has to know you and your history and your family history, and start again with complicated tests and complicated evaluations. That is penny-wise and pound-foolish. You should stick with your own doctor, or at least come up with a transition plan. 
   What about the terminally ill? 
   This amendment Senator KERREY has offered says if you are terminally ill, or your family member, or your child, is terminally ill, you get to keep your doctor. What happens if your child has a terminal illness? You are struggling with this illness. Imagine being a father wanting to be at the bedside of a child who is terminally ill. Instead he is in the other room calling an insurance company finding out if his son's doctor is in his new plan's network because the company he works for has changed HMOs. So he is up there not talking to the doctor about his son, or not even talking to his son, but trying to figure this out. 
   I think that is cruel. I think it is cruel and unusual punishment. 
   What happens if you are recovering from a stroke and you are in a rehabilitation hospital? 
   Under the Kerrey-Mikulski amendment, you will get to keep your doctor during that rehabilitation, so you can return and not be having to try to find out who your physician is going to be. 
   What happens if you have been admitted to a mental hospital for an acute psychiatric episode and you have chronic schizophrenia, but you also have a physician who has been treating you, who knows you, and in those 90 days you have to change doctors just when you are trying to get your mental health back again? 
   This is what we are talking about--continuity of care, so for those undergoing an active course of treatment and for all Americans who have insurance you would get at least 90 days to come up with a transition plan. 
   But in three categories--if you are terminally ill; also if you are within an institution or facility; or if you are pregnant--you get to keep your doctor for a longer period. 
   We think this is what should happen. This isn't just BARBARA MIKULSKI making this up. 
   I will submit a letter from the Consortium of Citizens with Disabilities. These are people who strongly support the Kerrey-Mikulski amendment. 
   This is what they say:  
   Protecting continuity of care is not some wonky technicality. It will have a real impact on the quality of care for many people with disabilities and anyone who is undergoing active treatment. Consider for a moment what could happen to a child with cerebral palsy if their parent's employer changed health plans and there was no opportunity to adequately plan a transition to new plan and new providers. It can be assumed this child would be receiving ongoing physical therapy.  
   This could be potentially expensive and exhausting for the family. There may be a variety of other reasons for this.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, it has been interesting to me that during the two hours I have been here, in the time allocated to this amendment, no one from the other side has debated the merits of the Kerrey-Mikulski amendment. 
   We have heard about the health care plan, we heard about Mrs. Clinton's health plan, but no one challenged the fact that the American people should have continuity of care. Just because a business changes their insurance company, you should not have to change your doctor. 
   Also, we heard a great deal about the States--let the States do it. I bring to the attention of my colleagues, only 22 States have a continuity-of-care provision; 28 States do not. So, 28 States are vulnerable to the lack of a continuity-of-care provision. 
   Also, all 50 States have a Constitution. So why should we have one ourselves? Why should we have one? The reason we have a Federal Constitution is that we are one nation under a law that should protect all American people and we also have a Federal Constitution that we love and cherish because we have a Bill of Rights. 
   Imagine if we were still waiting for the 14th amendment, if we were doing it one State at a time. Imagine if we women had gotten the right to vote, if we had done it one State at a time. Do you think the railroads would have let us have the direct vote by the people of the Senate? No; I think we would still be choo-choo-ing along under the old system. 
   Let's talk about the cost. I think that is a fallacy in the argument. This Congress is going to debate in the next week or two a tax bill that could plunge us into a deficit. Sure, we think we have a surplus, but it is a promissory note surplus; it is not a guaranteed surplus. So while we are going to talk about cost, just wait until we start talking about that tax bill. 
   The other thing is, we did not hesitate to pass the national ballistic missile system. I will tell you something. My constituents in Maryland are more at risk for their lives and safety from insurance gatekeepers preventing them from having access to the medical care they need than they are of some missile striking us in Baltimore, Crisfield, Hagerstown, or all around the State, or this country. 
   So let's not talk about cost. And let's not invent phony arguments. Let's go back to what we are debating, the Kerrey-Mikulski amendment that says let's provide continuity of care. It is very straightforward. It would allow for a transition that, when a doctor is no longer included as a provider under a plan, or employers change plans, it would provide 90-day transitional care for any patient undergoing an active course of treatment with a doctor. 
   That means if you have diabetes, it means if you have high blood pressure, it means if you have glaucoma, that you can at least have a transition plan to have someone meet your needs. 
   Then we make three exceptions. We make them for pregnancy, we make them for terminal illness, and we make them for someone who is institutionalized. 
   A patient who is dying should not have to change a doctor in the last days of his or her life. If you are pregnant, I think you ought to have the doctor through post-partum care that is directly related to delivery. That's what we are fighting for today, and I hope we pass this amendment. I yield the floor.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I say to my colleagues in the Senate and to those listening everywhere, I rise to congratulate the U.S. Air Force on their gallantry and their bravery in risking their lives to take much-needed medicine to a woman who is now a scientist working in Antarctica on a National Science Foundation expedition. 
   This woman recently discovered a lump in her breast and needs medical treatment. She cannot leave Antarctica until the middle of October because of the horrendous weather conditions. She can't get out and nobody can get to her. But God bless the U.S. Air Force. They were willing to step forward at great risk to themselves to take the much-needed medicine, and at a very specific moment, drop the six packages that will be able to provide her with treatment, through the genius of telemedicine. 
   Imagine the terror of a woman who discovers a lump in her breast. Imagine if this lump is discovered while you are serving at a remote research station on the South Pole, which is completely inaccessible during many months of the year. A plane has never landed on the South Pole during the winter. So how could she hope to get the medical supplies she needed for treatment? 
   This is the situation faced by a woman serving at the National Science Foundation's Amundsen-Scott research station at the South Pole. She could neither leave the station nor expect outside help until October. We all know when a lump is discovered, immediate treatment is essential. That is part of what we have been arguing about. 
   But guess what. This is when our U.S. Air Force became involved. We are all so proud of what they do to protect America's values and interests around the world. Most recently, they were successful in ending genocide and ethnic cleansing in Kosovo. 
   But on this mission to the South Pole, they were called on to act as humanitarians. Flying from New Zealand, the 23-person crew had to fly their aircraft for nearly a 7,000-mile round trip. They had limited visibility. They had to make their drop with great precision--since the medicine and equipment could not be exposed to the harsh conditions for more than a few minutes. Personnel on the ground also showed great skill and courage. They came outside in 70-below degree weather to plot the drop site with a great big letter ``C'' so the supplies could be dropped in the right spot, and they could be there at the right time to get it. 
   All Americans were awed by their skill and bravery. It was led by Major Greg Pike and his crew. They made their drop successfully, returned safely, and the supplies are now being used. 
   For those of us who saw the news, we know the U.S. Air Force risked themselves because if that plane ran into difficulty, they were at a point of no return. When they opened up the plane to be able to drop this much-needed medicine, they had to put special gear on because they themselves were facing temperatures at 150 degrees below zero. But they did it because they had the ``right stuff'' to make sure she had the right medicine. I tell you, it was quite a moment to see. Those great guys also sent her a bouquet of flowers and pictures of themselves and their families. 
   Mr. President, this also reminds us of the bravery of our National Science Foundation staff who have also worked in very difficult conditions to conduct the important scientific research. 
   We say to her, to the lady in the Antarctic, if she can watch us on C-SPAN: God bless you. We are pulling for you,  and we say here in the Senate, God bless the U.S. Air Force. 
   I yield the floor.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, we are at a fork in the road today. We are at a fork in the road to show whether we really are engaged in a debate over partisan politics or whether we are engaged in a debate over how we can best help patients in the United States of America. 
   I urge my colleagues, in the situation we now find ourselves, to put partisan politics aside and reach out to what is in the best interests of patients, what is in the best interests of the people of the United States of America. That is why I think the suggestion of taking the Snowe amendment and attaching it to the Dodd amendment would show the American people that in this debate, at this time, at this moment, we are willing to put patients above politics. That is what I hope we can do. 
   There is much to be commended in the Snowe amendment. It is a very good amendment. I congratulate the Senator from Maine on this amendment. I would so like to support it. Unfortunately, it knocks out the Dodd amendment providing patients with access to clinical trials. 
   The Senator from Maine has had a longstanding reputation of really being an advocate for providing access to clinical trials. I recall with great fondness our battles, going back to the days in the House of Representatives, when she and Congresswoman Schroeder cochaired the women's caucus. We fought to get women included in the clinical trials at NIH. The Senator from Maine and all others will recall when we were systematically excluded. We worked together on a bipartisan basis when she came to the Senate. Working with her, Congresswoman MORELLA, and Congresswoman Schroeder, we were able to literally call NIH's bluff on their shallow and unscientific reasons for not including women in clinical trials. 
   When President Bush appointed Bernadine Healy as head of NIH, Senator KENNEDY and I worked to establish the Office of Women's Health at NIH, and now women are included in the clinical trials. What a hollow victory it will be today if we deny them the access to the very clinical trials we fought so hard to open up for women. 
   I am sorry we have come to this. At this fork in the road, let's not make another fork in the road over partisan politics. We can show the American people that we really want to be concerned about patients. We have done it before. We have done it with the people in this room. Some of the greatest pleasures and joys of my life have been working on a bipartisan basis, opening up clinical trials and establishing quality standards for mammograms. 
   So I am going to offer one more opportunity, and I plead with my colleagues to allow this to happen. I want to have the Snowe amendment attached to the Dodd amendment. 
   Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that S. 1344, the Daschle substitute amendment, be modified with language from the Snowe amendment, No. 1241, prohibiting drive-through mastectomies and requiring coverage for second opinions.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to continue the discussion of the Patients' Bill of Rights and lend my voice to the Graham amendment for access to emergency care without penalty by an HMO when any prudent person presents their symptoms. 
   Before I do that, I congratulate the Senator from Rhode Island for his most eloquent and insightful remarks. For my colleagues, the Senator from Rhode Island has devoted his life to protecting the lives of Americans. As a West Point graduate serving in the U.S. military, he did that abroad, and now he does it in the Senate Chamber standing up for America's children. I thank him for his devotion and his gallantry. I am happy to be an able member of the Reed platoon. 
   I am pleased today to join with Senator BOB GRAHAM and other colleagues in speaking out about the people who go to an emergency room and want to be treated for their symptoms without fear of not having their visit covered by their HMO. When it comes to emergency care, people are afraid of both the symptoms they face as well as being denied coverage by their insurance company. 
   ``ER'' is not just a TV show; it is a real-life situation which thousands of Americans face every day. Yet I hear countless stories from friends and neighbors and constituents, as well as from talking to ER docs in my own State, who tell me they are afraid to see their doctor or take their child or parent to the emergency room because they will not be reimbursed and will be saddled with debt. 
   Patients must be covered for emergency visits that any prudent person would make. That means if they have symptoms that any prudent person says could constitute a threat to their life and safety, they should be reimbursed. The prudent layperson standard is at the heart of this amendment. It is supported by the American College of Emergency Physicians which has stated that the way the Republican bill is written, it ``must be interpreted as constraints on a patient's use of the `prudent layperson' standard.'' 
   The Republican bill only goes part way. We need to restore common sense to our health care system. 
   Let me give an example, the case of Jackie, a resident of Bethesda, MD. She went hiking in the Shenandoah mountains. She lost her footing and fell off a 40-foot cliff. She had to be airlifted to a hospital. Thanks to our American medical system, she survived. After she regained consciousness and was being treated at the hospital for these severe injuries, Jackie learned that her HMO refused to pay her hospital bill because she did not get prior authorization. 
   This is outrageous. Imagine falling off of a 40-foot cliff, waking up in a hospital and being told that your HMO will not cover your bills because you did not call while you were unconscious. 
   In America, we think if you need emergency care, you should be able to call 911, not your HMO's 800 number. 
   Incredibly, some of my colleagues in the Senate say that all these stories are anecdotes and they are horror stories. These are not anecdotes. We are talking about people's lives. 
   If you would come with me to the emergency rooms at Johns Hopkins Hospital, the University of Maryland, Salisbury General on a major highway on the Eastern Shore, all over the State, you would learn that many people come to the ER because of not only accidents but they are experiencing symptoms where they wonder if their life could be threatened or the life of  their child. The child is having acute breathing, and you do not know if that child is having an undetected asthma attack; or a man sitting at Oriole Park suddenly has shortness of breath, pains in his left side and leaves to go to the ER at the University of Maryland next to Camden Yards. Should they call 911 or should they call 800 HMO? I think they should call 911, and they should worry about themselves and their family and not about reimbursement. 
   So when we come to a vote, I really hope that we will pass the Graham amendment. The Republicans say they have an alternative. But it does not guarantee that a patient can go to the closest emergency room without financial penalty. Do not forget, it covers only 48 million Americans; it leaves out 113 million other Americans. 
   Let's do the right thing. Let's make sure that patients with insurance cannot be saddled with huge bills after emergency treatment. 
   I thank the Senate and yield the floor.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I thank Senator Robb and Senator KENNEDY for their support of this very crucial legislation. We, the women of the Senate, really turn to men we call the ``Galahads,'' who have stood with us and been advocates on very important issues concerning women's health. 
   Often we have had bipartisan support. I ask today that the good men on the other side of the aisle come together and support the ROBB amendment. We have raced for the cure together. We have done it on a bipartisan basis. Certainly, today we could pass this amendment. I challenge the other party to vote for this amendment because what it will do is absolutely save lives and save misery. 
   There are many things that a woman faces in her life, but one of the most terrible things that she fears is that she will go to visit her doctor and find out from her mammogram and her physician that she has breast cancer. The worst thing after that is that she needs a mastectomy. Make no mistake, a mastectomy is an amputation, and it has all of the horrible, terrible consequences of having an amputation. Therefore, when the woman is told she can come in and only stay a few hours--after this significant surgery that changes her body, changes the relationships in her family, she is told she is supposed to call a cab and go back home; it only adds to the trauma for her. 
   Well, the ROBB amendment, which many of us support, really says that it is the doctor and the patient that decides how long a woman should stay in the hospital after she has had the surgery. Certainly, we should leave this to the doctor and to the patient. An 80 year old is different than a 38 year old. This legislation parallels the DAMATO legislation that had such tremendous support on both sides of the aisle. I say to my colleagues, if we are going to race for the cure, let's race to support this amendment. 
   Mr. REID addressed the Chair.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, what does a woman do in a few days before she is scheduled to have a mastectomy? How should she spend her time? What should she be doing? Should she be on the phone calling her HMO, trying to figure out what will happen to her after surgery? Who will take care of her, how long will she be in the hospital? Should she be on the phone, dealing with bureaucracy? Should she be dealing with paperwork? Should she be on the phone, dealing with an insurance gatekeeper? 
   No, I do not think that is what she should be doing and I think the Senate will agree with me. I think she should be with her family. I think she should be talking with her husband, because he is as scared as she is. He is terrified that she might die. He is wondering how can he support her when she comes home. 
   She needs to talk to her children so that they understand that even though she is going in for an operation, they know their mother will be there when she comes back home but she might not be quite the same. She needs to be with her family. She needs to be with her clergyman. She needs to be with those who love her and support her. 
   This is what we are voting on here today. Who should be in charge of this decision? When a woman has a mastectomy she needs to recover where she  can recover best. That should be decided by the doctor and the patient. We hear about these drive through mastectomies, where women are in and out in outpatient therapy. They are dumped back home, often sent home still groggy with anesthesia, sometimes with drainage tubes still in place or even at great risk for infection. 
   Make no mistake, we cannot practice cookbook medicine and insurance gatekeepers cannot give cookbook answers. An 80-year-old woman who needs a mastectomy needs a different type of care than a 38-year-old woman. And a 70-year-old woman whose spouse himself may be 80 might have different family resources than a 40-year-old woman. 
   Even the board of directors of the American Association of Health Plans states this: ``..... the decision about whether outpatient or inpatient care meets the needs of a woman undergoing removal of a breast should be made by the woman's physician after consultation with the patient.'' 
   As I said earlier, we go out there and we Race for the Cure. Now we have to race to support this amendment. Let's look at what we have done with our discoveries. We in America have discovered more medical and scientific breakthroughs than any other country in world history. It is America who knew how to handle infectious diseases. It is America who comes up with lifesaving pharmaceuticals. 
   We have been working together on a bipartisan basis to double the NIH budget. We have joined together on a bipartisan basis to have mammogram quality standards for women. Now we have to join together on a bipartisan basis and pass this amendment. 
   We must continue our discovery, we must continue our research, and we must continue to make sure that we have access to the discoveries we have made. 
   This is what this amendment is all about. It allows a woman and her physician to make this decision. 
   Some time ago very similar legislation was offered by the former Senator of New York, Mr. D'Amato. People on the other side of the aisle had cosponsored this bill. What we are saying here is, if you cosponsored it under Senator D'Amato, vote for it under the Robb-Mikulski-Boxer-Murray amendment. This should not be about partisan politics. 
   Let's put patients first. Let's understand what is going to happen to a woman. Let's understand what is going to happen to her family. And let the doctors decide. I told my colleagues a few weeks ago--I recalled a few months ago I had gall bladder surgery. I could stay overnight because it was medically necessary and medically appropriate. Surely if I can stay overnight for gall bladder surgery a woman should be able to stay overnight when she has had a mastectomy. 
   I yield the floor.

    Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to reflect on the passing of a truly remarkable woman: Washington Post Editorial Page Editor Meg Greenfield. A tough, tenacious and trailblazing woman, Ms. Greenfield had a sharp intellect, a vibrant sense of humor, and a keen political instinct. 
   Meg Greenfield was at the center of many of Washington's intellectual, cultural and political developments in the past three decades. Her fiercely independent eye for news gave her the ability to cultivate relationships with individuals from every political, cultural and economic background. Her insightful portraits of life in our nation's capital were profound and memorable. 
   Ms. Greenfield forever changed the access and acceptance women have in the field of journalism. She astutely examined tough issues such as global disarmament and international affairs which were traditionally seen as ``male'' issues. She commanded respect and demanded fairness and impartiality from her staff. 
   In 1978, Ms. Greenfield moved the world with her commentary on issues of international affairs, civil rights and the press. For her efforts she claimed the much coveted Pulitzer Prize for editorial writing. One year later, she moved into the post of Editor for the Washington Post editorial page. A responsibility she undertook with dignity, grace, a keen wit and what she would call ``the sensibility of 1950s liberals--conservative on foreign policy and national defense, but liberal on social issues'' for over 20 years. 
   For these and many other reasons I admired Meg Greenfield and her vastly important work. She also played a critical role in my own career. When I ran for the United States Senate, I met with the Washington Post editorial board, and I had heard about the tough, no-nonsense Meg Greenfield. I was very impressed with her, and she believed in me and my ideas for Maryland. 
   The endorsement I received from the Washington Post in the 1986 Democratic primary was a turning point in the campaign. I was running against two very good friends of mine: the terrific Congressman from Montgomery County, Mike Barnes, and Maryland's Governor Harry Hughes. The confidence and support I received from Meg Greenfield and the Post editorial board gave me pride and momentum, and helped lead me to victory. 
   Meg Greenfield's colleagues at the editorial page wrote the day after her death, ``The anonymity typical of editorial pages could not disguise the hand of Meg Greenfield. As a writer her work was often instantly recognizable.......for its felicity and stateliness and not least for its wry and mischievous humor. As an editor she imprinted her special blend of a wise skepticism and a reach for the public good on a long generation of Post editorials.'' In this tribute, they describe not only her as the consummate professional, but as the wonderful and caring woman that she was. 
   Meg Greenfield will be dearly missed in the many circles of Washington life. Her spirit and legacy will inspire us for years to come.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the amendment offered by Senator DEWINE. 
   The bill reported by the Senate Appropriations Committee would enable federal employees, whose health insurance is provided under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan, to receive coverage for abortion services. 
   The DeWine amendment would prohibit coverage for abortion, except in cases of life endangerment, rape or incest. It would continue a ban which has prevented federal employees from receiving a health care service which is widely available for private sector employees. 
   I oppose this Amendment for two reasons. First of all, it is an assault on the earned benefits of federal employees. Secondly, it is part of a continuing assault on women's reproductive rights and would endanger women's health. 
   We have seen vote after vote designed to roll back the clock on women's reproductive rights. Every year, on this Appropriations measure and on many others, the assault on a woman's constitutional right to decide for herself whether or not to have a child continues. This amendment continues that assault. 
   Well, I support the right to choose. And I support federal employees. And that is why I strenuously oppose this amendment. 
   Let me speak first about our federal employees. Some 280,000 federal employees live in the State of Maryland. I am proud to represent them. They are the people who make sure that the Social Security checks go out on time. They make sure that our nation's veterans receive their disability checks. At NIH, they are doing vital research on finding cures and better treatments for diseases like cancer, Parkinson's and Alzheimers. There is no American whose life is not touched in some way by the hard work of a federal employee. They deserve our thanks and our support. 
   Instead, federal employees have suffered one assault after another in recent years. They have faced tremendous employment insecurity, as government has downsized, and eliminated over 200,000 federal jobs. Their COLAs and their retirement benefits have been threatened. They have faced the indignity and economic hardship of three government shutdowns. Federal employees have been vilified as what is wrong with government, when they should be thanked and valued for the tremendous service they provide to our country and to all Americans. 
   I view this amendment as yet another assault on these faithful public servants. It goes directly after the earned benefits of federal employees. Health insurance is part of the compensation package to which all federal employees are entitled. The costs of insurance coverage are shared by the federal government and the employee. 
   I know that proponents of continuing the ban on abortion coverage for federal employees say that they are only trying to prevent taxpayer funding of abortion. But that is not what this debate is about. 
   If we were to extend the logic of the argument of those who favor the ban, we would prohibit federal employees from obtaining abortions using their own paychecks. After all, those funds also come from the taxpayers. 
   But no one is seriously suggesting that federal employees ought not to have the right to do whatever they want with their own paychecks. And we should not be placing unfair restrictions on the type of health insurance federal employees can purchase under the Federal Employee Health Benefit Plan. 
   About 1.2 million women of reproductive age depend on the FEHBP for their medical care. We know that access to reproductive health services is essential to women's health. We know that restrictions that make it more difficult for women to obtain early abortions increase the likelihood that women will put their health at risk by being forced to continue a high-risk pregnancy. 
   If we continue the ban on abortion services, and provide exemptions only in cases of life endangerment, rape or incest, the 1.2 million women of reproductive health age who depend on the FEHBP will not have access to abortion even when their health is seriously threatened. We will be replacing the informed judgement of medical care givers with that of politicians. 
   Decisions on abortion should be made by the woman in close consultation with her physician. These decisions should be made on the basis of medical judgement, not on the basis of political judgements. Only a woman and her physician can weigh her unique circumstances and make the decision that is right for that particular woman's life and health. 
   It is wrong for the Congress to try to issue a blanket prohibition on insuring a legal medical procedure with no allowance for the particular set of circumstances that an individual woman may face. I deeply believe that women's health will suffer if we do so. 
   I believe it is time to quit attacking federal employees and their benefits. I believe we need to quit treating federal employees as second class citizens. I believe federal employees should be able to receive the same quality and range of health care services as their private sector counterparts. 
   Because I believe in the right to choose and because I support federal employees, I urge my colleagues to join me in defeating the DeWine Amendment.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, our foreign policy must reflect our values. That's why I oppose the Silk Roads Strategy Act amendment. 
   The sponsors of this legislation say that we should build stronger ties with the nations of the South Caucasus and Central Asia. I agree. We must promote peace, democracy and economic growth in this important region. But to do this, we can't ignore basic human rights or fundamental American values. 
   The Silk Roads Strategy Act would enable the President to waive Section 907 of the Freedom Support Act. Section 907 prohibits most direct American aid to Azerbaijan until it takes demonstrable steps to cease all blockades against Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh. Section 907 has been modified in recent years to enable humanitarian aid and aid provided by the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, the Trade Development Agency and the Export Import Bank. Yet Azerbaijan has done nothing to end the embargo and has been recalcitrant in the OSCE peace process. 
   American foreign aid is not an entitlement. We have a right to place conditions on our assistance. We have a right to demand that countries receiving US aid live up to certain basic humanitarian standards. 
   For almost ten years, Azerbaijan has maintained a blockade of Armenia. This blockade prevents the delivery of basic human needs--including food, medicine and fuel. What does this mean for the people of Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh? It means terrible human suffering. It means a high infant mortality rate and poor maternal health. It means hunger. It means shortages of the basic needs of life--food, medicine and energy. 
   Senator MCCONNELL has offered a second degree amendment that would maintain Section 907. This is a reasonable approach. The McConnell amendment would enable us to strengthen relations with the Caucasus--without compromising our values. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the McConnell amendment--and in opposing the Silk Roads Strategy Act.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I come here today to talk about something that is very compelling to the women of this country; that is, the Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   The Patients' Bill of Rights is a women's issue, because it is the women of America's families who often make the decisions that are very important in terms of the health care of their family. They are the ones who often read the fine print of insurance documents. They fill out the paperwork in order to make sure their children have access to the health care they need. They are often the ones on the front line either trying to get health insurance for their families or also ensuring they have the best benefit package. 
   But, guess what. When it comes down to them getting the health care they need, they are often denied it. They are often denied having access to an OB/GYN who is the primary care provider for most American women, because they are called ``a specialist.''  
   Also, when they face a tremendous problem in their lives, such as a mastectomy, they are often denied the time they need to get the care they need because of the insurance gatekeepers. 
   We call this the drive-by mastectomy situation. We call it a drive-by mastectomy, because a procedure is performed on a woman, she is driven to the hospital, and she is driven out of the hospital--sometimes within hours. 
   What is a mastectomy? Make no mistake, the term ``mastectomy'' is a technical term. But what it really means to a woman is that it is a breast amputation with all of the horror, terror, and trauma that an amputation brings out. When one faces such a horrific procedure, certainly you should have the kind of care you need. And that should be decided by the doctor and the patient--not by an insurance gatekeeper. 
   What does a mastectomy mean? For every woman in the United States of America, the one phrase that she is terrified to hear is: You have breast cancer. The next phrase that she is terrified to hear is: It has gone so far that we have to do a mastectomy. 
   It is traumatic for her, because it is not only body altering, but it is family altering, and it is relationship altering. When one looks at one woman facing a mastectomy, she needs to discuss this with her spouse. He is as scared as she is. He is terrified that she is going to die. He is terrified about how he can support her when she comes home from the hospital. And then they know they have to sort out a relationship under such difficult situations. 
   When a woman has a mastectomy, they need to recover where they recover best. That is decided by the doctor and the patient. Women are sent home still groggy from anesthesia and sometimes with drainage tubes still in place, with infection, and are not sure if that is the right place. 
   Make no mistake. We can't practice cookbook medicine. Insurance gatekeepers can't give cookbook answers. An 80-year-old who needs a mastectomy needs a different kind of care than a 38-year-old woman. 
   We go out there, and we race for the cure. I think it is wonderful. We do it on a bipartisan basis. But if we find the cures, we need access to the clinical trials. It is being denied in the Republican Patients' Bill of Rights. We need to be able to talk to our own OB/GYN. That is called ``a specialist''; we can't do that. 
   We need to have access to the care. This is the United States of America. We have discovered in this century more medical and scientific breakthroughs than any other century in American history. It is in America where we found how to handle infectious diseases. It is in America where we have come up with lifesaving pharmaceuticals. It is in America where we have had lifesaving new surgical techniques only to find that in America, though we invented something to save your life, we also invented insurance gatekeepers that prevent you from having access to those lifesaving mastectomies. This can't be so. 
   If we are going to really take America into the 21st century, we must continue our discovery. 
   We must continue our research, and we have to have access to our discoveries. 
   The Republicans, through Senator D'Amato, offered legislation on drive-by mastectomies. When the Republicans offered their bill in the committee, it was strikingly absent. Senator MURRAY and other Members offered the D'Amato amendment. However, along party lines it was rejected, 10-8. Certainly what was good for D'Amato a year ago should be good now, at least to have the opportunity to debate this year. 
   The Democratic alternative Senator MURRAY and other Members want to offer simply says that decisions should be made by the doctor in consultation with the patient. 
   A few months ago I had gallbladder surgery. I could stay overnight for my gallbladder surgery because it was medically necessary and medically appropriate. Surely if I can stay overnight for gallbladder surgery, a woman should be able to stay overnight if she has had a mastectomy. 
   I yield the floor.

    Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of General Eric K. Shinseki's appointment as the Army's thirty-fourth Chief of Staff. As a highly decorated officer and a dedicated member of our nation's Armed Forces, I know that General Shinseki will prove to be a valuable member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
   In his thirty-three years of service, General Shinseki has served the Armed Forces in both the continental United States and overseas. He served in the United States Army Hawaii, as well as at Fort Shafter with Headquarters, United States Army-Pacific. From March 1994 to July 1995, General Shinseki was the Executive Officer of the 1st Squadron of the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment at Fort Bliss, Texas. 
   From August 1997 until November 1998, Shinseki was the Commanding General of the United States Army-Europe and 7th army. He concurrently led NATO soldiers as the Commander of the Allied Land Forces Central Europe in Germany. Additionally, General Shinseki has served as Commander of the Stabilization Force in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and as the Army's Vice Chief of Staff. 
   As my colleagues know, I am a strong supporter of our men and women in uniform. I understand the difficult sacrifices they make every day in defense of our country--and our ideals. I honor the hard work and commitment that sacrifice demands. Just  as they fight for us, I fight for them and federal policies that support them. 
   As a result of General Shinseki's military service, he has earned the Defense Distinguished Service Medal, a Legion of Merit with oak leaf cluster, a Bronze Star Medal with ``V'' Device and two oak leaf clusters, a Purple Heart Award with oak leaf cluster, and a Meritorious Service Medal with two oak leaf clusters. 
   Mr. President, I know that General Eric K. Shinseki will be an instrumental contributor to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Throughout his career he has shown his capability as a leader. His leadership and his military successes will help him to succeed as the new Army Chief of Staff. I look forward to working with him on the restructuring of TECOM to ensure that Aberdeen remains the home of Army testing. I am happy to know that General Shinseki shares the Maryland delegation's view of how important Aberdeen Proving Ground is to the Army, Maryland, and the United States. I wish General Shinseki the best in his new position.

    Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Administration's proposal to reauthorize the Older Americans Act (OAA). The Older Americans Act is a vital program that meets the day-to-day needs of our nation's seniors. Through an aging network that involves 57 state agencies on aging, 660 area agencies on aging, and 27,000 service providers, the OAA provides countless services to our country's older Americans. The OAA was last reauthorized in 1992 and its authorization expired in 1995. The time is long overdue for Congress to reauthorize this program. That is why, as the Ranking Democrat on the Subcommittee on Aging, I am working with the Chairman of the Subcommittee to introduce a bipartisan bill in the Senate to reauthorize the OAA. That's why I am here today to introduce the Administration's plan to reauthorize the Act as a courtesy and to remind my fellow colleagues about the importance of passing an OAA reauthorization bill. 
   Many Americans have not heard of the Older Americans Act. They've probably heard of Meals on Wheels and maybe they know about the senior center down the street. But our country's seniors who count on the services provided under the Act couldn't do without them. Whether it's congregate or home delivered meals programs, legal assistance, the long-term care ombudsman, information and assistance, or part-time community service jobs for low-income seniors. This Act covers everything from transportation to a doctor's appointment to a hot meal and companionship at a local senior center to elder abuse prevention. 
   But we're not going to just settle for the status quo. We must make the most of this opportunity to modernize and improve the OAA to meet the needs of seniors. That's why I'm including the National Family Caregiver Support Program in this bill I'm introducing today. Through a partnership between states and area agencies on aging, this program will provide information about resources available to family caregivers; assistance to families in locating services; caregiver counseling, training, and peer support to help them deal with the emotional and physical stresses of caregiving; and respite care. We must get behind our nation's caregivers by helping those who practice self-help. Caregivers often put in a 36 hour day: taking care of the family, pursuing a career, caring for the senior who needs care, and finding the information on care and putting together a support system. We need to  support those who are providing this invaluable care. 
   I want to reauthorize the OAA this year before the new millennium when our population over age 65 will more than double. I'm pleased that our colleagues in the House are moving in this direction as well. I urge my colleagues here in the Senate to act promptly once a bill is voted out of committee and support our nation's seniors by reauthorizing the Older Americans Act.

    Ms. MIKULSKI. 
   Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Seniors' Access to Continuing Care Act of 1999'', a bill to protect seniors' access to treatment in the setting of their choice and to ensure that seniors who reside in continuing care communities, and nursing and other facilities have the right to return to that facility after a hospitalization. 
   As our population ages, more and more elderly will become residents of various long term care facilities. These include independent living, assisted living and nursing facilities, as well as continuing care retirement communities (CCRCs), which provide the entire continuum of care. In Maryland alone, there are over 12,000 residents in 32 CCRCs and 24,000 residents in over 200 licenced nursing facilities. 
   More and more individuals and couples are choosing to enter continuing care communities because of the community environment they provide. CCRC's provide independent living, assisted living and nursing care, usually on the same campus--the Continuum of Care. Residents find safety, security and peace of mind. They often prepay for the continuum of care. Couples can stay together, and if one spouse needs additional care, it can be provided right there, where the other spouse can remain close by. 
   Most individuals entering a nursing facility do so because it is medically necessary, because they need a high level of care that they can no longer receive in their homes or in a more independent setting, such as assisted living. But residents are still able to form relationships with other residents and staff and consider the facility their ``home''. I have visited many of these facilities and have heard from both residents and operators. They have told me about a serious and unexpected problem encountered with returning to their facility after a hospitalization. 
   Hospitalization is traumatic for anyone, but particularly for our vulnerable seniors. We know that having comfortable surroundings and familiar faces can aid dramatically in the recovery process. So, we should do everything we can to make sure that recovery process is not hindered. 
   Today, more and more seniors are joining managed care plans. This trend is likely to accelerate given the expansion of managed care choices under the 1997 Balanced Budget Act. As more and more decisions are made based on financial considerations, choice often gets lost. Currently, a resident of a continuing care retirement community or a nursing facility who goes to the hospital has no guarantee that he or she will be allowed by the managed care organization (MCO) to return to  the CCRC or nursing facility for post acute follow up care. The MCO can dictate that the resident go to a different facility that is in the MCO network for that follow up care, even if the home facility is qualified and able to provide the needed care. 
   Let me give you a few examples: 
   In the fall of 1996, a resident of Applewood Estates in Freehold, New Jersey was admitted to the hospital. Upon discharge, her HMO would not permit her to return to Applewood and sent her to another facility in Jackson. The following year, the same thing happened, but after strong protest, the HMO finally relented and permitted her to return to Applewood. She should not have had to protest, and many seniors are unable to assert themselves.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the amendment offered by Senators MURRAY and SNOWE. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this amendment. 
   This amendment would repeal the current ban on privately funded abortions at US military facilities overseas. 
   I strongly support this amendment for three reasons. First of all, safe and legal access to abortion is the law. Second, women serving overseas should have access to the same range of medical services they would have if they were stationed here at home. Third, this amendment would protect the health and well-being of military women. It would ensure that they are not forced to seek alternative medical care in foreign countries without regard to the quality and safety of those health care services. We should not treat US servicewomen as second-class citizens when it comes to receiving safe and legal medical care. 
   It is a matter of simple fairness that our servicewomen, as well as the spouses and dependents of servicemen, be able to exercise their right to make health care decisions when they are stationed abroad. Women who are stationed overseas are often totally dependent on their base hospitals for medical care. Most of the time, the only access to safe, quality medical care is in a military facility. We should not discriminate against female military personnel by denying safe abortion services just because they are stationed overseas. They should be able exercise the same freedoms they would enjoy at home. It is reprehensible to suggest that a woman should not be able use her own funds to pay for access to safe and quality medical care. Without this amendment, military women will continue to be treated like second-class citizens. 
   The current ban on access to reproductive services is yet another attempt to cut away at the constitutionally protected right of women to choose. It strips military women of the very rights they were recruited to protect. Abortion is a fundamental right for women in this country. It has been upheld repeatedly by the Supreme Court. 
   Let's be very clear. What we're talking about here today is the right of women to obtain a safe and legal abortion paid for with their own funds. We are not talking about using any taxpayer or federal money--we are talking about privately funded medical care. We are not talking about reversing the conscience clause--no military medical personnel would be compelled to perform an abortion against their wishes. 
   This is an issue of fairness and equality for the women who sacrifice every day to serve our nation. They deserve access to the same quality care that servicewomen stationed here at home--and every woman in America--has each day. I urge my colleagues to support this important amendment to the 2000 Department of Defense Appropriations Bill.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Imported Food Safety Act of 1999.'' I am proud to be the sponsor of this important legislation which guarantees the improved safety of imported foods. 
   The health of Americans is not something to take chances with. It is important that we make food safety a top priority. Every person should have the confidence that their food is fit to eat. We should be confident that imported food is as safe as food produced in this country. Cars can't be imported unless they meet U.S. safety requirements. Prescription drugs can't be imported unless they meet FDA standards. You shouldn't be able to import food that isn't up to U.S. standards, either. 
   We import increasing quantities of fresh fruits and vegetables, seafood, and many other foods. In the past seven years, the amount of food imported into the U.S. has more than doubled. Out of all the produce we eat, 40% of it is imported. Our food supply has gone global, so we need to have global food safety. 
   The impact of unsafe food is staggering. There have been several frightening examples of food poisoning incidents in the U.S. When Michigan schoolchildren were contaminated with Hepatitis A from imported strawberries in 1997, Americans were put on alert. Thousands of cases of cyclospora infection from imported raspberries--resulting in severe, prolonged diarrhea, weight loss, vomiting, chills and fatigue were also reported that year. Imported cantaloupe eaten in Maryland sickened 25 people. As much as $663 million was spent on food borne illness in Maryland alone. Overall, as many as 33 million people per year become ill and over 9000 die as a result of food borne illness. It is our children and our seniors who suffer the most. Most of the food-related deaths occur in these two populations. 
   These incidents have scared us and have jump-started the efforts to do more to protect our nation's food supply. Now, I believe in free trade, but I also believe in fair trade. FDA's current system of testing import samples at ports of entry does not protect Americans. It is ineffective and resource-intensive. Less than 2% of imported food is being inspected under the current system. At the same time, the quantity of the imported foods continues to increase. 
   What this law does is simple: It improves food safety and aims at preventing food borne illness of all imported foods regulated by the FDA. This bill takes a long overdue, big first step. 
   First, it requires that FDA make equivalence determinations on imported food. This was developed with the FDA by Senator KENNEDY and myself in consultation with the consumer groups. 
   Today, FDA has no authority to protect Americans against imported food that is unsafe until it is too late. Last year, the GAO found that FDA lacks the authority to require that food coming into the U.S. is produced, prepared, packed or held under conditions that provide the same level of food safety protection as those in the U.S. This means that currently, food offered for import to the U.S., can be imported under any conditions, even if those conditions are unsanitary. The Imported Food Safety Act of 1999, will allow FDA to look at the production at its source. This means that FDA will be able to take preventive measures. FDA will be able to be proactive, rather than just reactive. 
   That means that when you pack your childrens' lunches for school or sit down at the dinner table, you can rest assured that your food will be safe. Whether your strawberries were grown in a foreign country or on the Eastern Shore, in Maryland, those strawberries will be held to the same standard. You won't have to worry or wonder where your food is coming from. You won't have to worry that your children or families are going to get sick. You will know that the food coming into this country will be subject to equivalent standards. 
   Secondly, this bill contains strong enforcement measures. Last year, the  Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, under the leadership of Senator SUE COLLINS, held numerous hearings on the safety of imported food. These enforcement measures are largely a product of those facts uncovered during those hearings. Senator COLLINS developed these enforcement provisions and introduced a bill which focuses on enforcement. I refer those with special interest in enforcement to also consider her bill. 
   Finally, this bill covers emergency situations by allowing FDA to ban imported food that has been connected to outbreaks of food borne illness. When our children, parents and communities are getting seriously sick, the Secretary of Health and Human Services can immediately issue an emergency ban. We don't have to wait till someone else gets seriously sick or dies. We no longer have to go through the current bureaucratic mechanism that is inefficient and resource intensive. We can stop the food today, to protect our citizens. 
   My goal is to strengthen the food supply, whatever the source of the food may be. This bill won't create trade barriers. It just calls for free trade of safe food. It calls for international concern and consensus on guaranteeing standards for public health. 
   This bill is important because it will save lives and makes for a safer world. Everyone should have security in knowing that the food they eat is fit to eat. I'd like to thank FDA for their advice and consultation in developing this legislation. I also want to thank the Consumer Federation of America for their insight and recommendations. 
   I look forward to working on a bipartisan basis to enact this legislation. I pledge my commitment to fight for ways to make America's food supply safer. This bill is an important step in that direction.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about an issue that is critical to saving children's lives. That issue is guns in the hands of our children. The events of Columbine have been a wake up call for the American people. Guns don't belong in the hands of kids. We must do everything we can to see to it that children cannot buy guns. We also need tougher penalties for illegal possession and crimes committed with guns. This is about America's children and getting behind our kids. This is about keeping our kids safer in their schools and safer on our streets. 
   I respect the Constitution and the right of law-abiding citizens to own guns. I understand that many people own a gun for self-protection. The fear of crime is a real issue for many Americans. I believe people should be able to protect themselves. I also know people enjoy using guns for sport. Many Americans enjoy hunting, and I do not want to interfere with lawful sport. 
   My support for reasonable steps to protect kids does not go against my support for people's right to protect themselves or their right to hunt. We can take measures to save lives without infringing on the Constitution. 
   One of my biggest concerns is the safe storage of guns in the home. I think it makes sense to require trigger locks for guns while children are in the home. There have been too many tragic accidents with children that could have been prevented. 
   Guns are too easily available to our young people. We must require gun show participants to comply with the same laws as gun shop owners. This would cut off a deadly supply of firearms to our Nation's children and dangerous criminals. The guns used in the Columbine massacre were purchased from gun shows. I was very disappointed that the Lautenberg amendment did not pass. This amendment would have closed the gun show loophole. What passed instead was an amendment giving a gun show participant the option of conducting a background check. Now, what gun show participant is going to choose to take the time and effort when the gun seller in the next booth is willing to sell a gun with no questions asked? 
   I was happy to support an amendment which would toughen the penalties for possession of semiautomatic assault weapons. The presence of semiautomatic weapons on our streets is a deplorable situation. Assault weapons have one purpose--to kill the largest number of people as quickly and efficiently as possible. They have no legitimate hunting or sporting use. I want to see them taken off our streets. 
   We must get behind our kids and teach them that character counts. We have to teach them respect for guns and respect for human life. We must listen carefully to them and help them when they are in trouble. We need to give them constructive goals to work toward. We must give them opportunities to live a rewarding life. Then they can respect themselves and others and not resort to guns and violence to demand the attention they need. We want kids to turn toward each other--not against each other.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I know we have been discussing the juvenile justice bill now for several days. I would like to compliment the leadership on both sides of the aisle for trying to move this bill. But this is not about a bill. It is not about an amendment. It is not about money. It is about America's children and how are we going to get behind our children so they are safer in their schools and safer on their streets. 
   There are two aspects of this bill where I have had a longstanding passion. Number one is making sure we have the support services in our schools to back up our teachers and help our children. And number two is after school so we can provide meaningful, structured activities for kids so they will not only 
   have a place to go but a place to benefit from both learning and character building. 
   This is why in this legislation I support the Democratic initiative to put more mental health counselors into the schools and also to put school social workers and school nurses into the schools. Our teachers are very busy. I hope we pass the 100,000 new teachers initiative, so we have smaller class sizes so our teachers can give more attention to our children. But, while our teachers are in the classroom, there are other support services that help those children while they are in school. 
   I want to see more school nurses in our schools to help our kids. Mr. President, a school nurse often provides the early detection and warning for other problems the children have. They know whether our children need eyeglasses or a hearing aid. Sometimes a child who doesn't have needed eyeglasses is a child headed for trouble out of frustration. It is often the school nurse who begins identifying the early warning signals of emotional problems. Or if a child is under treatment, it is that school nurse who is supervising that the child is taking his or her medication and staying on the medication. This is what helps our kids. 
   Let me talk about the school social worker. This is not about Freud, this is not about Jung, this is not about in-depth counseling. This is making sure we know where these children are in terms of some aspects of the problems they are having. If a child is referred to a school social worker, that means the child is teeter-tottering and could go one way or the other. Often a child comes to school troubled because of problems at home. It could be a mother who has a substance abuse problem. It could be a father who is without a job. A school social worker first and foremost listens to the child and helps the family. Often it is the school social worker who takes the child in a teeter-totter situation and makes sure they do not go off on the wrong track. It is the school social worker that can get them back on the right track. 
   These are the kinds of things we want to have in our juvenile justice bill. Yes, we need more security. But I tell you, while we are looking for more cops in the schools, let's also get more counselors into the schools to be able to help our kids and our teachers. 
   Our children are lonely. Our children are very lonely. Listen to them. They often turn to each other and, as we saw in some communities, they turn on each other. We have to reach out to our children so they have a significant adult they can relate to in their lives. Hopefully, it is their parents. That puts you on first base. Hopefully, they can relate to a good teacher. That can put you on second base. But often what puts you on the third base and brings you home is structured, afterschool activities. Our most famous general, Colin Powell, is devoted to these afterschool activities. It is the single most important prevention program for children. Afterschool can help kids avoid trouble. Or help them to move on, exercising the great talents they have. I visited the afterschool programs in my community. I even had townhall meetings with children in these communities. It was fantastic. 
   You say: What do you like about the afterschool program? 
   They say: At 3 o'clock we leave school and we walk in here and we are greeted with a snack and we are greeted with a smile. Often it could be a police officer in a PAL Program, a Police Athletic League, or it could be part of the Boys and Girls program. Then they learn. Often they do their homework. They even have computer classes. 
   They are learning. They have activities. Then they move to sports or other programs. For the kids who go into sports, it is not only about playing basketball, it is about learning sportsmanship. This is about character building, confidence building, and so on. We can do no more important things than getting behind our teachers, supporting our families, and having these services. 
   I hope we do not think our children should be taught in a prison-like atmosphere. We need to make sure they are safe. Let's have enough teachers, enough counselors, and enough support so the schools are not only safe, but our children's learning is sound. 
   I yield the floor.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Sarbanes substitute amendment to the Financial Services Modernization Act. I salute him for his leadership in seeking financial services reform that prepares us for the new century. 
   I agree that we should reform our financial services. There is no doubt that changes in law have lagged behind changes in our banking and financial services industries. 
   This amendment is a great improvement over the underlying bill. It would provide greater protections for consumers. It would also maintain the Community Reinvestment Act--which is so important in enabling low income communities to help themselves. 
   However, I would like to raise a number of what I call ``flashing yellow lights'' or warning signals that we should be aware of before enacting financial services modernization. We should proceed with caution to avoid irrevocable changes when the savings of hard working families and the viability of our communities could be put in jeopardy. 
   For example, financial services reform would make it easier for banks, securities firms and insurance companies to merge into oligopolies. The savings of many would be controlled by a few. Americans will know less about where their deposits are kept and how they are used. 
   What would be the effect of these mergers on consumers? I am concerned that these mega institutions could lead to higher fees and fewer choices for consumers. 
   Marylanders used to have savings accounts with local banks where the teller knew their name and their family. We have already seen the trend toward mega-mergers, accompanied by higher fees, a decline in service, and the loss of neighborhood financial institutions. This legislation accelerates that trend. 
   In addition, what would be the affect of this legislation on the alarming increase in foreign takeovers of US banks? I support increased globalization, but what will happen when home town banks are taken over by companies that have no roots or commitments to the community? 
   With a globalization of financial resources, the local bank could be bought by a holding company based outside the United States. Instead of the friendly neighborhood teller, consumers would be contacting a computer operator in a country half-way around the globe through an 800 number. Their account could be subject to  risks that have nothing to do with their job, their community or even the economy of the United States. I know that impersonalized globalization is not what banking customers want when they talk about modernization of financial services. 
   So I will support the Sarbanes amendment. It goes further in answering my concerns. But I hope we will be able to address these concerns more fully as we move forward with this legislation. 
   they generally do not have a city to serve, much less an inner city. 
   Third, in the last 9 years, Federal regulators have performed 16,380 CRA evaluations of these banks--evaluating them annually. These banks report that it costs them between $60,000 and $80,000 a year to comply with CRA. Yet, at the end of 9 years and 16,380 evaluations, just three small rural banks have been found to be substantially out of compliance. One million--excuse me, one trillion. Excuse me, let me be sure I have my figure here. At the end of this process, with small banks having spent perhaps $1,310,400,000,000 complying with paperwork in the name of evaluating community lending, we have found just three banks out of compliance. Not only does the substitute eliminate this provision that ends this senseless wasting of small bank resources that cost local communities and deny them access to credit, but it imposes confiscatory penalties that would make a bank, if it fell out of compliance with CRA, potentially subject to a $1 million fine, not just on the bank but on the bank officer or on the bank director. 
   We have two letters here, one from the Independent Bankers and one from the ABA, raising the point that one of the toughest things to do now in this period of massive lawsuit liability is to get good people to serve on a bank board. Both the Independent Bankers of America and the ABA have written urging us not to adopt a provision that would make it virtually impossible for small banks, especially, to get qualified officers and board members because of the liability costs. I urge my colleagues to reject this substitute.

    Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the Association of Mapping Seniors (AMS) on the 25th Anniversary of their founding. 
   The AMS is a distinguished organization of former employees at mapping and imagery agencies like the National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA). Their important work has been invaluable to both our national policy makers, and our national security. 
   Mr. President, the data produced by these dedicated Americans has been key to understanding our world and making it safer. Mapping and imagery not only help us support our men and women in uniform, but also help us develop our cultural understanding of ourselves in terms of population, growth, religious and economic clusters, and more. I want to commend each and every member of the AMS for their indispensable service to our country, our community, and our culture. 
   I am also proud to note that Maryland has been home to many devoted members of this important organization. As many of my colleagues know, I am a strong and unyielding supporter of federal employees, and these men and women are no exception. I want to thank them, Mr. President, for their outstanding service to our country, and to honor them in celebration of the 25th Anniversary of the Association of Mapping Seniors.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Medicare Social Work Equity Act of 1999. I am proud to sponsor this legislation which will amend section 4432 in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 which prevents social workers from directly billing Medicare for mental health services provided in skilled nursing facilities (SNF's). This bill will also ensure that clinical social workers (CSW's) can receive Medicare reimbursement for mental health services they provide in skilled nursing facilities. I am honored to be joined by my good friends Senators MURRAY, INOUYE, HOLLINGS, WYDEN, JOHNSON, REID, and BINGAMAN who care equally about correcting these inequities for social workers and about ensuring quality mental health services for nursing home residents. 
   The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) changed the payment method for skilled nursing facility care. Before BBA, reimbursement was made after services had been delivered for the reasonable costs incurred. However this ``cost-based system'' was blamed for inordinate growth in Medicare spending at skilled nursing facilities. 
   The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 phased in a prospective payment system for skilled nursing facilities that was fully implemented on January 1, 1999, for Medicare part A services. Payments for part B services for skilled nursing facility residents are to be consolidated. This means that the provider of the services must bill the facility instead of directly billing Medicare. The consolidated billing provision has been delayed indefinitely by the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) while it addresses Year 2000 (Y2K) compliance issues. 
   However, Congress was careful to not include psychologists and psychiatrists in this consolidated billing provision. Social workers were included, I think by mistake. Clinical social workers are the primary providers of mental health services to residents of nursing homes, particularly in underserved urban and rural areas. CSW's are also the most 
   cost effective mental health providers. 
   This legislation is important for three reasons: First, I am concerned that section 4432 inadvertently reduces mental health services to nursing home residents. Second, I believe that the consolidated billing requirement will result in a shift from using social workers to other mental health professionals who are reimbursed at a higher cost to Medicare. Finally, I am concerned that clinical social workers will lose their jobs in nursing homes or will be inadequately reimbursed. 
   In addition, this bill ensures that clinical social workers can receive Medicare reimbursement for mental health services they provide in skilled nursing facilities. An April 1998, HCFA rule would have effectively eliminated Medicare reimbursement for clinical social worker services provided to residents of SNF's, whether or not their stay was being paid by Medicare, Medicaid, or a private payer. It would have deemed all mental health services provided to nursing home residents ``required'' services, not distinguishing between the mental health diagnosis and treatment services provided by CSW's and the required medically-related social services provided at the SNF. 
   Facilities would likely bring in a psychiatrist or psychologist (if available) because services provided by them could still be billed separately This would affect seniors in many rural and underserved areas where CSW's are often the only available mental health provider and have developed relationships over time with these SNF patients. HCFA delayed this rule for two years. However, clarification is needed in the law to ensure that CSW's can be reimbursed by Medicare for the mental health services they provide to inpatients in SNF's. This bill makes that necessary change. 
   I like this bill because it will correct inequities for America's social workers, it will assure quality of care for nursing home residents, and will assure cost efficiency for Medicare. This bill is strongly supported by the National Association of Social Workers, Clinical Social Work Federation, American Psychological Association, American Group Psychotherapy Association, Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, National Mental Health Association, National Council for Community Behavioral Health Care, National Association of Protection and Advocacy Systems, Anxiety Disorders Association of America, and the Mental Health and Aging Network of the American Society on Aging. I now look forward to the Senate's support of this important legislation.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today, I rise to talk about an issue that is very important to me, very important to my constituents in Maryland and very important to the people of the United States of America. 
   For the third Congress in a row, I am joining in a bipartisan effort with my friend and colleague, Senator OLYMPIA SNOWE, to end an unfair policy of the Social Security System. 
   Senator SNOWE and I are introducing the Social Security Family Protection Act. This bill addresses retirement security and family security. We want  the middle class of this Nation to know that we are going to give help to those who practice self-help. 
   What is it I am talking about? We have found that Social Security does not pay benefits for the last month of life. If a Social Security retiree dies on the 18th of the month or even on the 30th of the month, the surviving spouse or family members must send back the Social Security check for that month. 
   I think that is a harsh and heartless rule. That individual worked for Social Security benefits, earned those benefits, and paid into the Social Security trust fund. The system should allow the surviving spouse or the estate of the family to use that Social Security check for the last month of life. 
   This legislation has an urgency, Mr. President. When a loved one dies, there are expenses that the family must take care of. People have called my office in tears. Very often it is a son or a daughter that is grieving the death of a parent. They are clearing up the paperwork for their mom or dad, and there is the Social Security check. And they say, ``Senator, the check says for the month of May. Mom died on May 28. Why do we have to send the Social Security check back? We have bills to pay. We have utility coverage that we need to wrap up, mom's rent, or her mortgage, or health expenses. Why is Social Security telling me, `Send the check back or we're going to come and get you'?'' 
   With all the problems in our country today, we ought to be going after drug dealers and tax dodgers, not honest people who have paid into Social Security, and not the surviving spouse or the family who have been left with the bills for the last month of their loved one's life. They are absolutely right when they call me and say that Social Security was supposed to be there for them. 
   That is what our bill is going to do. That is why Senator SNOWE and I are introducing the Family Social Security Protection Act. When we talk about retirement security, the most important part of that is income security. And the safety net for most Americans is Social Security. 
   We know that as Senators we have to make sure that Social Security remains solvent, and we are working to do that. We also don't want to create an undue administrative burden at the Social Security Administration--a burden that might affect today's retirees. But it is absolutely crucial that we provide a Social Security check for the last month of life. 
   How do we propose to do that? We have a very simple, straightforward way of dealing with this problem. Our legislation says that if you die before the 15th of the month, you will get a check for half the month. If you die after the 15th of the month, your surviving spouse or the family estate would get a check for the full month. 
   We think this bill is fundamentally fair. Senator SNOWE and I are old-fashioned in our belief in family values. We believe you honor your father and your mother. We believe that it is not only a good religious and moral principle, but it is good public policy as well. 
   The way to honor your father and mother is to have a strong Social Security System and to make sure the system is fair in every way. That means fair for the retiree and fair for the spouse and family. That is why we support making sure that the surviving spouse or family can keep the Social Security check for the last month of life. 
   Mr. President, we urge our colleagues to join us in this effort and support the Social Security Family Protection Act.

    Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, on March 25, the game of baseball experienced a tremendous loss when former Baltimore Orioles' manager, coach and minor-league player Cal Ripken, Sr., passed away at the age of 63. 
   Cal Ripken, Sr. was a monumental figure in Baltimore's baseball heritage. For nearly four decades, Cal Sr. was the heart of the Baltimore Orioles' organization. He exemplified everything that is good about baseball and about America--hard work, dedication and integrity. He taught his sons, Cal Ripken, Jr. and Bill Ripken, to play baseball when they were young and inspired in them his own legendary love of our national pastime. 
   In 1987, Cal Sr. was named manager of the Orioles, and became the first father to manage two sons simultaneously at the major league level. Ripken Sr. retired in 1992, having spent 36 years with the Orioles' organization. 
   I will never forget going to the ball park, year after year, and seeing the competitive fire Cal Ripken Sr. brought to the Orioles. He knew how to bring out the best in the players he coached and managed. 
   Cal Ripken, Sr. will be remembered for what he instilled in his family, in Baltimore and in all of us: work hard, show up every day, and always give it everything you've got. His spirit will live forever in the hearts of every Baltimore Oriole and every Oriole fan.

    Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate a group of young constituents and journalists at Rockville High School's newspaper, The Rampage. This year, the students on the staff of The Rampage and their journalism teacher, Kevin Keegan, won recognition as the best student newspaper in Maryland for the seventh year in a row. I am proud of these students for putting their minds and their hearts into creating a first-rate newspaper for the Rockville community. 
   More than 200 years ago, when the Framers of the United States Constitution created the First Amendment, they recognized and enshrined the importance of a free press in a democratic society. With its declaration that no law could abridge the freedom of the press, the First Amendment also bestowed on our Nation's journalists a  unique and special role. The Nation has given reporters the awesome responsibility to help communicate the needs of the Nation, report on and analyze the functioning of government, and chronicle the day-to-day events that affect our communities. In return, we hope those journalists recognize the importance of their responsibility and carefully tend their role as stewards of public information. 
   To maintain this profoundly important and delicate relationship, it is essential that journalists have strong training in writing, investigation, and ethics. That is why I am so proud of The Rampage, its staff, and its advisor. Mr. Keegan is teaching the important fundamentals of journalism, instilling in these young people the power and obligation of a free press, and encouraging them to grow personally and professionally in the process. Along the way, their hard work and commitment has earned these young journalists great respect and renown. 
   I would like to say a special word of thanks to The Rampage advisor, Mr. Keegan. He is well-known in Rockville and across the state for his commitment to teaching and to his students. As a journalism teacher and advisor for 20 years and coach of Team Maryland, a state all-star academic team, Mr. Keegan embodies all that is great and good about education in America. He inspires students personally, challenges them academically, and donates enormous amounts of energy and time to give kids the extra attention and encouragement they need to succeed. In 1997, he was recognized statewide when Hood College in Frederick honored him with its Maryland Distinguished Teacher award. 
   Mr. President, I have worked with quite a few journalists in my years of public service. I have been proud that many Maryland reporters and news outlets have earned national reputations and honors. But I am uniquely proud of The Rampage today because they represent great hope for maintaining a strong free press and a strong democratic society. In their ranks we may well find some of the next generation's Pulitzer Prize winners. I congratulate them today on their tremendous accomplishments and wish them all the best for their future endeavors. Maryland is very proud of them.

    Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today, I am introducing a bill to modify a harsh and heartless rule of government that is unfair and prevents current workers from enjoying the benefits of their hard work in their retirement. This legislation is very important to me, very important to my constituents in Maryland, and very important to government workers and retirees across the nation. I want the middle class of this Nation to know that if you worked hard to become middle class you should stay middle class when you retire. 
   Under current law, there is something called the Pension Offset law. This is a harsh and unfair policy. Let me tell you why. 
   If you are a retired government worker, and you qualify for a spousal Social Security benefit based on your spouse's employment record, you may not receive what you qualify for. Because the Pension Offset law reduces or entirely eliminates a Social Security spousal benefit when the surviving spouse is eligible for a pension from a local, state or federal government job that was not covered by Social Security. 
   This policy only applies to government workers, not private sector workers. Let me give you an example of two women, Helen and her sister Phyllis. 
   Helen is a retired Social Security benefits counselor who lives in Woodlawn, Maryland. Helen currently earns $600 a month from her federal government pension. She's also entitled to a $645 a month spousal benefit from Social Security based on her deceased husband's hard work as an auto mechanic. That's a combined monthly benefit of $1,245. 
   Phyllis is a retired bank teller also in Woodlawn, Maryland. She currently earns a pension of $600 a month from the bank. Like Helen, Phyllis is also entitled to a $645 a month spousal benefit from Social Security based on her husband's employment. He was an auto-mechanic, too. In fact, he worked at the same shop as Helen's husband. 
   So, Phyllis is entitled to a total of $1,245 a month, the same as Helen. But, because of the Pension Offset law, Helen's spousal benefit is reduced by 2/3 of her government pension, or $400. So instead of $1,245 per month, she will only receive $845 per month. 
   This reduction in benefits only happens to Helen because she worked for the 
   government. Phyllis will receive her full benefits because her pension is a private sector pension. I don't think that's right, and that's why I'm introducing this legislation. 
   The crucial thing about the MIKULSKI Modification is that it guarantees a minimum benefit of $1,200. So, with the MIKULSKI Modification to the Pension Offset, Helen is guaranteed at least $1,200 per month. 
   Let me tell you how it works. Helen's spousal benefit will be reduced only by 2/3 of the amount her combined monthly benefit exceeds $1,200. In her case, the amount of the offset would be 2/3 of $45, or $30. That's a big difference from $400, and I think people like our federal workers, teachers and our firefighters deserve that big difference. 
   Why should earning a government pension penalize the surviving spouse? If a deceased spouse had a job covered by Social Security and paid into the Social Security system, that spouse expected his earned Social Security benefits would be there for his surviving spouse. 
   Most working men believe this and many working women are counting on their spousal benefits. But because of this harsh and heartless policy, the spousal benefits will not be there, your spouse will not benefit from your hard work, and, chances are, you won't find out about it until your loved one is gone and you really need the money. 
   The MIKULSKI modification guarantees that the spouse will at least receive $1,200 in combined benefits. That Helen will receive the same amount as Phyllis. 
   I'm introducing this legislation, because these survivors deserve better than the reduced monthly benefits that the Pension Offset currently allows. They deserve to be rewarded for their hard work, not penalized for it. 
   Many workers affected by this Offset policy are women, or clerical workers and bus drivers who are currently working and looking forward to a deserved retirement. These are people who worked hard as federal employees, school teachers, or firefighters. 
   Frankly, I would repeal this policy all together. But, I realize that budget considerations make that unlikely. As a compromise, I hope we can agree that retirees who work hard should not have this offset applied until their combined monthly benefit exceeds $1,200. 
   In the few cases where retirees might have their benefits reduced by this policy change, my legislation will calculate their pension offset by the current method. I also have a provision in this legislation to index the minimum amount of $1,200 to inflation 
   so retirees will see their minimum benefits increase as the cost of living increases. 
   I believe that people who work hard and play by the rules should not be penalized by arcane, legislative technicalities. That's why I'm introducing this bill today. 
   Representative WILLIAM JEFFERSON of Louisiana has introduced similar legislation in the House. I look forward to working with him to modify the harsh Pension Offset rule. 
   If the federal government is going to force government workers and retirees in Maryland and across the country to give up a portion of their spousal benefits, the retirees should at least receive a fair portion of their benefits. 
   I want to urge my Senate colleagues to join me in this effort and support my legislation to modify the Government Pension Offset.

    Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I introduce the Hazardous Occupations Retirement Benefits Act of 1999. This legislation will grant an early retirement package for revenue officers of the Internal Revenue Service, customs inspectors of the U.S. Customs Service, and immigration inspectors of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
   Under current law, most Federal law enforcement officers and firefighters are eligible to retire at age 50 with 20  years of Federal service. Most people would be surprised to learn that current law does not treat revenue officers, customs inspectors and immigration inspectors as federal law enforcement personnel. 
   This legislation will amend the current law and finally grant the same 20-year retirement to these members of the Internal Revenue Service, Customs Service, and Immigration and Naturalization Service. The employees under this bill have very hazardous, physically taxing occupations, and it is in the public's interest to have a young and competent work force in these jobs. 
   The need for a 20-year retirement benefit for inspectors of the Customs Service is very clear. These employees are the country's first line of defense against terrorism and the smuggling of illegal drugs at our borders. They have the authority to apprehend those engaged in these crimes. These officers carry a firearm on the job. They are responsible for the most arrests performed by Customs Service employees. The Customs Service interdicts more narcotics than any other law enforcement agency--over a million pounds a year. In 1996, they seized 180,946 pounds of cocaine, 2,895 pounds of heroin, and 775,225 pounds of marijuana. They are required to have the same law enforcement training as all other law enforcement personnel. These employees face so many challenges. They confront criminals in the drug war, organized crime figures, and increasingly sophisticated white-collar criminals. 
   Revenue officers struggle with heavy workloads and a high rate of job stress. Some IRS employees must even employ pseudonyms to hide their identity because of the great threat to their personal safety. The Internal Revenue Service currently provides it's employees with a manual entitled: `Assaults and Threats: A Guide to Your Personal Safety' to help employees respond to hostile situations. The document advises IRS employees how to handle on-the-job assaults, abuse, threatening telephone calls, and other menacing situations. 
   Mr. President, this legislation is cost effective. Any cost that is created by this act is more than offset by savings in training costs and increased revenue collection. A 20-year retirement bill for these critical employees will reduce turnover, increase productivity, decrease employee recruitment and development costs, and enhance the retention of a well-trained and experienced work force. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me again in this Congress in expressing support for this bill and finally getting it enacted. This bill will improve the effectiveness of our inspector and revenue officer work force to ensure the integrity of our borders and proper collection of the taxes and duties owed to the Federal Government.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise not to rebut the amendment by the Senator from Michigan but to make an opening statement about this budget and certain very crucial items in it. 
   I compliment Senator LAUTENBERG for his strong advocacy as the ranking member of the Budget Committee and his longstanding championship for those people who have been left out and left behind. Sir, I thank you for your role not only in this budget but what you do every day in the Senate. 
   Through the best efforts, I am very concerned that the fiscal year 2000 budget resolution really does not adequately address the solvency of Social Security, nor does it address adequately the solvency of Medicare--the two most important programs that the United States has, domestically, and the ones that Americans universally rely upon and plan their life around having in a reliable way, that has reliability and continuity, and that the entire private sector assumes will be there as they plan private sector products. 
   Now, preserving Social Security and Medicare must be our Nation's top priority, and I believe the original efforts by the Lautenberg group were there. What we have before us today, I believe, does not protect Social Security. 
   Now, we say a lot in the Senate about family values. Well, I believe there is a value that comes out of the Judeo-Christian ethic I believe in, and it is called honor your father and honor your mother. I believe it is not only a good commandment to live by, I think it is a good commandment to govern by. 
   We should not only have it in our prayer books. We should have it in the Federal checkbook. This is why I am so adamant that we must save Social Security first and preserve the solvency of Medicare. 
   When we look at Social Security, we want to make sure that we protect those who have the least resources with them--those without pensions, those without IRAs, those without 401(k)s. These are the people who we know represent, as we speak, now, over 40 million people. If there are 40 million Americans without health insurance, you had better believe they are going to be the same 40 million who do not have 401(k)s. To them ``K'' means Kellogg, and it is a cereal. It is not a life security system. 
   I am particularly concerned about women. And I am particularly concerned about both men and women who, at the end of the day and near the end of their lives, will have no reliable pension program to look out for them. 
   This is what the Social Security issue is all about. I want to be sure that in any debate we have--whether it is on the budget, or whether it is the Social Security bills--I want to ensure that Social Security is universal and portable, that it is a guaranteed benefit, that it is inflation proof, and looks out, as I said, for those who do not have anything else going for them. 
   I have a particular interest in this as it affects women. That is because I truly believe that Social Security is a woman's issue. Without it, over half of all elderly women would now be living in dire poverty. Yes. Women today are working more outside the home, yes, and earning more than past generations. But in reality, their lifetime earnings, access to pensions, and ability to save continues to be less than men. That is why Social Security is a woman's issue. Let me elaborate. 
   First of all, women live longer. The life expectancy rate for women is 65, 4 years longer than for men. That means they will need income security for a longer period of time. Also, the equity that we placed in Social Security is absolutely crucial. Why? Because right now women do not get equal pay for equal work, making 70 percent of what men make for similar jobs. They will get less Social Security because their benefits are based in part on wages. That means the hard-working female x ray technician who puts in 40 hours a week might take home $28,000 a year instead of the financial worth that her male counterpart has. 
   We need a Social Security system, too, that women can count on, that respects values of work inside the home and acknowledges it in retirement. This is why the spousal benefit is so crucial and why we need to preserve it. Women move in and out of the paid marketplace to do some of the most important work--raising children and caring for elderly parents and their relatives. Take, for instance, someone who works in an office as an executive assistant. She got her high school diploma, didn't go to college, worked full time for 5 years, but leaves the workforce to raise her children. She might do that for 7 years and then return part time. Notice that she lost 7 years in  her contribution, and then is a part-time wage earner, and then often has to go back at an entry wage. This woman needs to know that Social Security is there for her, and that she is not penalized for what she did, which was the unpaid work for providing the most invaluable service to America; that is, 
   raising America's children. 
   Certain ideas have been proposed to reforming Social Security which would have a devastating impact on women. Having reliance on private retirement accounts would hurt women disproportionately. Again, women earn less money, unequal pay, leave the paid workforce to raise children, or care-give, and would have less to ``invest.'' Reducing the Social Security COLA would hurt women. And there are other reforms. 
   But the point that I make is that Social Security as it now stands is the best deal for women. Sure, we need to make reforms. Sure, we need to look at the other ideas. That is why we should not cut or dramatically alter Social Security. Sure, it can pay benefits into 2032. But we have to look ahead to be sure that there is solvency of Social Security. 
   That is why we support the Lautenberg effort. We want to be sure that for women who have worked all of their lives, in the home or outside the home, there will be a guaranteed benefit with a full cost of living, that it will have a progressive benefit formula that helps the low-income wage earners, and that there is a spousal and survivor benefit for married women, divorced and widowed. The only way we can do that is if we take the surplus and put 62 percent aside, and also 15 percent for Medicare. Otherwise, this is a hollow budget full of promise and hollow on opportunity. 
   Mr. President, I salute the efforts of Senator LAUTENBERG. I am deeply disturbed that we are not setting aside 62 percent as we talked about. I do not believe the other party adequately protects Social Security, adequately protects Medicare, and I believe that ultimately the American people will wake up to this. 
   As it stands now, I will vote no for this budget.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, the Senate is now considering the gravest decision we are ever called upon to make. Do we send our troops into harm's way to defend America's values and interests? Do we use our military to seek to end the brutal repression in a faraway country? 
   After careful thought and serious discussions with our Secretary of State, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Secretary of Defense, I will support U.S. participation in strategic NATO air strikes against Serbian military targets. Our objective is to stop the killing and to weaken Yugoslav President Milosevic's ability to further hurt the people of Kosovo. These objectives are crucial to achieving durable peace and security in Europe. 
   There are two primary reasons that I support the limited use of force. First of all, we must prevent further Serbian acts of genocide and ethnic cleansing. Serbian actions have resulted in terrible human suffering. The Serbs abolished the Parliament and government of Kosovo in 1990. In response, the Kosovar Albanians maintained a policy of nonviolent resistance for seven years. During this time, Milosevic ethnically cleansed Kosovo--driving over 400,000 people out of their homes and destroying hundreds of villages. For those who wouldn't flee, Milosevic sought to starve them out--destroying farm land and blockading the shipment of food. 
   Reports from last night indicate that further humanitarian catastrophes are imminent. Serbia is moving aggressively to overrun and drive thousands more ethnic Albanians from their homes. The Serbs have deployed 40,000 army and police units in Kosovo. Over the past weekend, over 10,000 Kosovars were forced to flee their homes fearing 
   for their lives. And for good reason: a brutal Serbian attack on the village of Racak in January resulted in the death of 45 civilians. 
   Some of my colleagues have argued that we should consider military action only if further humanitarian atrocities occur. We cannot wait for genocide to occur before we act. 
   Our second goal must be to stop this war from spreading and from threatening stability and our national interests throughout central Europe. The ethnic tensions in Kosovo could spread to Albania, Macedonia and even to our NATO allies, Greece and Turkey. Serb actions threaten the stability of the entire region. 
   I would not support the use of military force unless we had first exhausted all other options. There are three ways that America can best exert our leadership. First, through diplomacy. There is no question that we have done everything possible to resolve the Kosovo crisis peacefully through diplomacy. Second, we can apply sanctions or rewards. We have applied sanctions to Serbia for many years with little tangible result. And third, we can use our military to fight for our interests and our values. That is the decision we face today. After exhausting diplomatic and economic options, do we now use our military to force the Serbs to end their intransigence and repression? 
   The military action proposed by President Clinton meets three principles I consider before supporting military action. 
   First of all, whenever possible, military action should be multilateral. In Kosovo, we will be acting as part of NATO--with the nineteen allies sharing the burden. 
   Second, the military actions should be strategic and proportional. We are authorizing air strikes against military targets--like bases, military storage depots, and command and control centers--and against key infrastructure--like roads and bridges that Serbs use to reinforce Kosovo. 
   And third, military actions must be intended to achieve a specific goal. In this case, we are seeking to prevent further atrocities and to weaken Milosevic's ability to hurt the people of Kosovo. 
   Mr. President, I am disturbed by the process that was initially established  for this vote. The Senate should vote on whether or not to authorize the use of force. Plain and simple. Instead, we are asked to cast a cloture vote on a second degree amendment to an appropriations bill. That is not the way to conduct foreign policy in the Senate. 
   That is why I voted against cloture on this matter--and I will vote for a bipartisan resolution to authorize U.S. participation in NATO air strikes against Serbia. 
   Mr. President, I still hope that the Serbs will back down. But if they don't, the Senate must show that we back our troops one hundred percent. Our airmen have excellent training and the best equipment in the world. They will have the participation of our NATO allies. And they will have the prayers and support of the American people--who recognize their heroism.

    Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to join my distinguished colleagues Senators CHAFEE, MOYNIHAN, SNOWE, and to introduce legislation providing breast and cervical cancer treatment services to women who were diagnosed  with these cancers through the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (NBCCEDP). This bill would give states the option to provide Medicaid coverage for the duration of breast and cervical cancer treatment to eligible women who were screened through the CDC program and found to have these cancers. This is a bill whose time has come. 
   In 1990, I was proud to be the chief Senate sponsor of the Breast and Cervical Cancer Mortality Prevention Act which created the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (NBCCEDP) at the CDC. The time was right for us to create that program. Since its inception, the CDC screening program has provided more than 721,000 mammograms and 851,000 Pap tests to more than 1.2 million women. Among the women screened, over 3,600 cases of breast cancer and over 400 cases of invasive cervical cancer have been diagnosed since the beginning of the program. In Maryland alone, the state had provided more than 54,000 mammograms and 35,000 Pap tests, and diagnosed over 450 women with breast cancer and 15 women with invasive cervical cancer. 
   Now as we prepare to enter the 21st century, it is time for us to finish what we started and provide treatment services for breast and cervical cancer for women who are screened through this program. We made the down payment in 1990 and we've been making payments ever since, but it's time for the final payment. It is time to do the right thing. We screen the women in this program for breast and cervical cancer. But we don't provide the federal follow-up to ensure that these women are treated. 
   The CDC screening program does not pay for breast and cervical cancer treatment services, but it does require participating states to provide treatment services. A study of the program done for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that while treatment was eventually found for almost all of the women screened, some women did not get treated at all, some refused treatment, and some experienced delays. While states and localities have been diligent and creative in finding treatment services for these women, the reality is that the system is overloaded. The CDC study found that when it came to treatment services, state efforts to obtain these services were short-term, labor-intensive solutions that diverted resources away from screening activities. 
   Of those women diagnosed with cancer in the United States, nearly 3,000 women have no way to afford treatment--they have no health care insurance coverage or are underinsured. One woman in Massachusetts reported that she cashed in her life insurance policy to cover the costs of her treatment. These women depend on the time of staff and volunteers who help them find free or more affordable treatment; they depend on the generosity of doctors, nurses, hospitals and clinics who provide them with free or reduced-cost treatment. In the end, thousands of women who run local screening programs are spending countless hours finding treatment services for women diagnosed with breast cancer. I salute the efforts of these individuals who spend their time and resources to help these women. 
   But we must not force these women to rely on the goodwill of others. These treatment efforts will become even more difficult as more women are screened by the NBCCEDP, which currently services only 12-15% of all women who are eligible nationally. The lack of coverage for diagnostic and treatment services has also had a very negative impact on the program's ability to recruit providers, further restricting the number of women screened. The CDC study also shows there are already additional stresses on the program as increasing numbers of physicians do not have the autonomy in today's ever increasing managed care system to offer free or reduced-fee services. While CDC has expanded its case management services to help more women get treatment, even CDC admits that ``more formalized and sustained mechanisms need to be instituted to ensure that all women screened have ready access to appropriate treatment and follow-up.'' It is an outrage that women with cancer must go begging for treatment, especially if the federal government has held out the promise of early detection. We should follow through on our responsibility to treat the cancer that these women were diagnosed with through the CDC program. 
   That's why I've introduced this important legislation with my colleagues. This bill gives states the option to provide Medicaid coverage for the duration of breast and cervical cancer treatment to eligible women who were screened through the CDC program and found to have these cancers. This is not a mandate for states; it is the federal government saying to the states ``we will help you provide treatment services to these women, if you decide to do so.'' By choosing this option, states would in effect, extend the federal-state partnership that exists for the screening services in the CDC program to treatment services. 
   I'm proud that my own state of Maryland realized the importance of providing treatment services to women who were screened through the CDC screening program. Maryland appropriated over $6 million in state funds to establish a Breast and Cervical Cancer Diagnostic and Treatment Program for uninsured, low income women. The breast cancer mortality rate in Maryland has started to decline, in part because of programs like the CDC program. But not all states have the resources to do what Maryland has done. That's why this bill is needed. It provides a long-term solution. Screening alone does not prevent cancer deaths; but treatment can. It's a cruel and heart-breaking irony for the federal government to promise to screen low-income women for breast and cervical cancer, but not to establish a program to treat those women who have been diagnosed with cancer through a federal program. 
   It is clear that the short-term, ad-hoc strategies of providing treatment have broken down: for the women who are screened; for the local programs that fund the screening program; and for the states that face increasing burdens. Because there is not coverage for treatment, state programs are having a hard time recruiting providers, volunteers are spending a disproportionate amount of time finding treatment for women, and fewer women are receiving treatment. We can't grow the program to serve the other 78% of eligible women if we can't promise treatment to those we already screen. 
   This bill is the best long-term solution. It is strongly supported by the National Breast Cancer Coalition representing over 400 organizations and 100,000's of women across the nation; the American Cancer Society, the National Association of Public Hospitals and Health Systems, the National Partnership for Women and Families, YWCA, National Women's Health Network, Oncology Nursing Society, Association of Women's Health, Obstetric, and Neonatal Nurses, the Rhode Island Breast Cancer Coalition, Y-ME, and Arm in Arm. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor and support this critical piece of legislation and make good on the promise of early detection.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the Murray/Kennedy Class Size Amendment. This amendment continues a major six year effort to help local school districts hire 100,000 teachers nationally. It is one the most important pieces of legislation the Senate will consider this year. This amendment will strengthen our schools today and build a framework for the future. 
   Last year we made a down payment by including $1.2 billion in the budget for class size. This year, we must continue the fight for our schools and the fight for our kids. We must give our schools the support they need to lower class size. We must get behind our kids by passing this critical legislation. 
   Last year, we worked together in a bipartisan fashion to reduce class size in the FY99 Omnibus Appropriations Act. Last year we got $1.2 billion in the Omnibus to reduce class size using highly qualified teachers. Nationally, this allowed us to hire some 30,000 new teachers this year. My state of Maryland alone received $17.5 million and will get about 425 new teachers this summer. 
   Mr. President, I have visited these classrooms and I have talked to these kids. These children have told me over and over again that they want to learn. They have told me they need more individualized attention. I have received letters from kids in school who are begging for our help. They tell me their schools are overcrowded and the teachers can't control the large classrooms. They tell me they are scared to go to school and that they can't learn because the teachers are too busy trying to manage the overcrowded classes. 
   Mr. President, this is a sad time for our students. A child should never fear going to school. We need to work and work hard to ensure that our efforts are not short circuited because of politics. I have told many teachers and students about the important strides we made last year to make sure they will have smaller and more effective classrooms. These children are excited about having more opportunities to learn. They are eager to learn to read and learn about science and technology. They are excited about all the wonderful possibilities that lie ahead for them with a proper education. But we need to do more. By passing this amendment today, we in the Senate  have an opportunity to prove our commitment to education. 
   Efforts are already underway in my state of Maryland to reduce class size. I have heard from at least five counties in my state that they have class reduction programs already in place or in development. The schools in Montgomery County, Maryland, for example, are reducing class size for reading at the primary grade level. In the primary grades, they have started a program where there are only 15 students per teacher for a 90 minute reading block. They are also reducing class size in math at the middle and high school levels and have added an extra math teacher to each school to ensure success in algebra. I applaud these efforts, but they need federal help to do more. 
   These programs started this school year and are being phased in over the next three years focusing initially on low-performing schools. And do you know what these programs will do? They will prepare Maryland kids for the new millennium. They will prepare our children to go onto college and gain the important skills they will need in the future. These class reduction programs are the building blocks that will help prepare our kids to be our future leaders. 
   The American people are counting on us to help fix an education system which failed so many children. Our education system has been ignored for far too long. If we don't pass this amendment today, we are sending the wrong message to the American public. Because of our efforts last year, our schools will be able to hire new teachers this summer. If we don't pass this amendment, we are telling those school that we are not committed to improving America's education system. We need to continue this effort to provide 100,000 new teachers for America. Let's get behind our kids and pass this amendment.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. I rise today as an original cosponsor of Senator BOXER's After School Education and Anti Crime Amendment. I am very pleased to support this important legislation with Senator BOXER. One of my highest priorities as Senator is to promote structured, community-based after school activities to help kids stay safe. I will support this amendment for three reasons. First, there is a desperate need in this country for constructive after school programs for our youth. Second, it authorizes increased funding for after school programs. Third, this amendment specifically includes Police Athletic Leagues as part of the after school effort. 
   Mr. President, America's youth needs our help. Kids need constructive after school activities to keep their young minds healthy and active. In many families today, both parents have to work. And that's if they are lucky enough to have two parents. Many kids are raised by single moms who hold down one or more often, even two jobs just to make ends meet. I talk to single moms in my state of Maryland who can barely get by. Many of them hold down steady jobs while trying to go to school. They are trying to improve themselves so they can get better jobs and take care of their families. These parents can't always be there after school to supervise their children. They cannot leave their jobs at 3:30 when school lets out. They cannot quit their jobs because even if there are two parents working, they still need every dime. 
   So what do we tell these people to do with their kids after school? What if they aren't lucky enough to have grandparents or aunts and uncles to take care of the kids after school? Most of these parents can't afford the high costs of day care. Do we just blame the parents when their kids get in trouble? No. This is a responsibility for us all. This situation presents a problem for us all. Gangs, drugs, and violent crimes has become an epidemic among our children. These kids are the future of our country. One day, they will be our leaders. Here in Congress we have the ability and the duty to save our youth. And this amendment helps communities build after school programs for our youth. 
   I also support this amendment because it authorizes $600 million for after school programs. This money will allow 1.1 million kids each year to go to an after school program. In the budget last year, we put $200 million in after school programs. Last year, we made the downpayment. This year, the President has tripled that amount to $600 million. And what will this funding mean? It means that after school programs could get more space. They could hire more staff and add programs and services. It means that these program can serve more young people. 
   Mr. President, I will also support this amendment because it specifically includes Police Athletic Leagues as part of the after school effort. I have made it a priority to do all I can to help the PAL programs in Maryland. We have 27 PAL centers in Baltimore, Maryland. The first PAL center in Maryland was in 1995, in northeastern Baltimore, located in a transformed convenience store. Our PAL centers were not started with the help of the federal government. The success of this program is due to the hard work of the Baltimore Police Department and the support and involvement of members of the community. But now it's time for the federal government to help fund the PAL centers and the excellent work that they do. 
   The PAL centers provide adult role models for our kids. They promote character & responsibility. The people there help kids with their homework. They teach them about art, cultural activities and sports. This is all part of our effort to get behind our kids and combat juvenile crime. PAL centers help to make our streets safe and give kids the tools for success. These programs recognize that we need to give kids alternatives to the streets. 
   Mr. President, after school programs must be a priority. We don't have the luxury of funding after school programs just because we want to do something extra for our kids. After school is not an extra anymore. After school programs are now a necessary fact of life. We need to give kids a fighting chance. I will be fighting to enact this bill into law and I encourage all of my colleagues here to get behind our kids and vote for this amendment.

    Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate one of our local news outlets, WTOP Radio, on their 30th anniversary. Thirty years ago, on March 9, 1969, WTOP began its news broadcasts. Today, WTOP has become a vital source of news and information in the nation's capital. Along the way, Dave McConnell, WTOP's congressional correspondent, has become a familiar voice to Washington residents and one of our nation's most respected journalists. 
   America's Constitution is unique and special in the responsibility it has bestowed on our nation's press corps--in print, on TV, and on the radio. With our revered First Amendment, the nation gives reporters the awesome responsibility to help communicate the needs of the nation and report on the day-to-day governmental events that affect all Americans. In return, we hope those reporters recognize that responsibility and carefully tend their role as stewards of public information. 
   WTOP has taken that responsibility seriously and sought to provide high-quality, timely information for residents in the greater Washington area. For thirty years, WTOP has covered the news as it happened--in Washington and around the world. From the War on Poverty to the War in Iraq, WTOP's reporting has kept millions of Washingtonians informed. They have tracked legislation that affects residents in Virginia, the District of Columbia, and Maryland, and helped bring perspective to issues facing the nation. 
   As important, WTOP provides a critical service to local residents in alerting them to breaking local stories. In addition to their comprehensive news coverage, they have warned residents of dangerous weather, alerted commuters to traffic snarls, and celebrated sports victories of our Orioles, Ravens, and Redskins. WTOP's committed staff are part of the daily lives of countless Washingtonians who listen as they brush their teeth, drive to and from work, or cook the evening meal. My constituents in Maryland's DC suburbs rely on them to get information they need to know to stay informed, stay healthy, and stay tuned. 
   I commend the WTOP family and its listeners on 30 years of service to the greater Washington area and welcome 30 more years. Our nation's capital, and our nation, are proud of their work and appreciative of their commitment.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am very proud to introduce this Resolution with my colleague Senator HUTCHISON, who, like me, is a former Girl Scout. This Resolution designates next week as National Girl Scout Week. I am so happy that we are able to recognize the important achievements of the Girls Scouts with such broad bipartisan support. Scouting instills the values that really matter--duty, honor, patriotism and service. I am so proud to honor the Girl Scouts for all they do to prepare our young women to be leaders for the future. 
   As a Girl Scout, you participate in a broad range of activities--from taking nature hikes to taking part in the arts. You serve in local food banks and learn about politics. The skills, values and attitudes you learn as a Girl Scout can help guide you through your life. As your skills grow, so will your self confidence. Eventually you will earn your badges which will serve as symbols that you are succeeding and doing something constructive for your community. You learn the importance of treating other people fairly and with the dignity they deserve. You have the confidence to know that you can reach your goals. You can learn to be a leader. 
   In today's hectic world, Scouts are more important than ever. Young boys and girls desperately need before and after school activities to keep their active minds' focused. They need adult role models like their Girl Scout leaders, who are dedicated to inspiring young people. 
   As the Senator from Maryland, one of my highest priorities is to promote structured, community-based after school activities to give children more help and more ways to learn. After school activities also keeps children stay out of trouble and keeps them productive. That's just what the Girl Scouts do. They promote character & responsibility. They teach the arts and cultural activities. They give kids the tools for success. 
   I applaud the Girl Scouts. I also thank them for what they did for me and what they do for millions of young women across the country. I hope the Resolution that Senator HUTCHISON and I have introduced here today calls more attention to the good work of the Girl Scouts. I hope it shows that there are solid after school activities that children can actively participate in while learning real life skills. Mr. President, I congratulate the Girl Scouts as they celebrate their 87th anniversary. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this important Resolution.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President: I am proud to support the Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's, and Marines' Bill of Rights. This legislation fulfills the promises made to the men and women of our armed forces. 
   Our men and women in uniform stand for everything that is good about our country--patriotism, courage, loyalty, duty and honor. They deserve our full support--not just with words but with actions. 
   I am alarmed about the problems of recruitment and retention facing our military. Improved pay and benefits are essential to recruiting and retaining the best people to serve our country. We are all concerned about the problems the services are having in meeting their recruitment goals. We're also troubled that so many of the highest skilled military choose to retire early. 
   This legislation will address these problems. By providing a 4.8 percent pay increase, we will help to close the gap between military and civilian pay. We will provide special incentives to those serving in critical specialties. We will also improve educational benefits and health care for our active military and retirees. 
   I am pleased that the Senate has amended this bill to improve benefits for the National Guard and Reserves. They are our nation's 911--always ready in time of emergency at home or abroad. They deserve recognition for their important role. 
   This bill also includes the Sarbanes/Warner/Mikulski amendment that puts the Senate on record on behalf of our federal employees. Our civilian workforce is essential--whether they work at our defense bases, at the National Institutes of Health or at any other federal facility. They have the same patriotism, honor and dedication as our military--and they can't be left behind on pay or benefits. 
   I share my colleagues concerns about the cost of this legislation. It will require tough choices and it may require some changes in conference. I hope that these issues will be considered in the context of our entire defense budget.  
   Mr. President, if we are to maintain the world's best military, we need to invest more in our most important national security resource--the men and women of our armed forces. This legislation will show that we support our American military--both with our words and our actions. 
   Mr. CRAIG: Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to speak about S. 4, the Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's, and Marines' Bill of Rights Act of 1999. 
   For too long, Idahoans have been contacting me to express their concerns about quality-of-life issues for service members. I am pleased that this bill is a step to address some of the most urgent quality-of-life needs of the men and women in uniform, and their families. It contains a much needed pay raise, and reforms the current military pay tables. It also provides more options for retirement benefits, and increases educational benefits through changes to the Montgomery G.I. Bill. These quality-of-life improvement will help to ensure that we are able to recruit and retain the best personnel. 
   However, despite my support for this bill, it is important to keep in mind that this bill will do nothing to change one of the factors driving so many of the best and the brightest away from service. This legislation will not decrease the operational tempo of our troops. 
   In the last five years the President has sent U.S. forces abroad in major engagements some 50 times in comparison to 18 times during the Reagan Administration and 14 times during the Bush Administration. To exacerbate the problem, the number of men and women in uniform has been significantly reduced over the last decade. Simultaneously, the number of deployed missions has nearly quadrupled. Not only are U.S. soldiers forced a work longer and harder than ever before, they are also sent on deployment for longer period of time than before. 
   We continue to enforce the so-called ``peace'' in Bosnia, maintain a presence in Haiti, and in recent days President Clinton was virtually promised to deploy, on a moments notice, 4,000 soldiers again make peace in Kosovo. 
   Frankly, I find the Administration's eagerness to engage in non-traditional military missions such as humanitarian and peacekeeping endeavors not only a dangerous foreign policy proposition, but extremely detrimental to doing the very thing S. 4 is trying to accomplish--ensuring real quality-of-life for service men and women. I would be willing to bet that a number of soldiers might consider foregoing a pay raise if it meant that he or she wouldn't miss another Thanksgiving or Christmas away from home and loved-ones. 
   Let me close by saying, I am pleased that the Senate has made this important legislation the first item of business in the new session of Congress. I certainly believe that the young men and women of Idalho's 366th Wing at the Mountain Home Air Force Base deserve a raise, better retirement benefits, and better options for educational opportunities through the Montgomery GI Bill. However, the President must also carefully consider the impact of the current operational tempo on our troops, and work to better this tremendous impediment to true quality-of-life.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. Chief Justice, I will vote against the articles of impeachment accusing the President of the United States of perjury before a grand jury and obstruction of justice. 
   The Republican House Managers have asked the Senate to remove the President from office, overturning a free and fair election in which 100 million Americans cast their vote. Short of voting on whether or not to send our sons and daughters to war, I can envision no more profound decision. 
   I have taken this responsibility as seriously as anything I have done in my life. A little over a month ago, I escorted the Chief Justice into this chamber and stood with my colleagues when we took a collective oath, as an institution, to render impartial justice in this trial. Then, we individually signed our names and pledged our honor to faithfully fulfill our oath. That was an indelible and profound moment. 
   I have sought to fulfill both responsibilities--to be impartial and to render justice. I have sought to be impartial, which I view as a test of character and will. And I have sought to pursue justice, which to me includes the responsibility to perform the homework--do the reading, review the evidence and weigh the facts. 
   I have listened carefully, and with an open mind, to the presentations of the Republican House Managers and the President's Counsel. I have reviewed the evidence. I have read all of the key witnesses' testimony before the grand jury. I have intensely studied the law pertaining to perjury and obstruction of justice, discussed the issue with respected lawyers, developed an appropriate standard of proof, and reviewed the House testimony of Republican and Democratic former prosecutors for their views on the charges. Finally, I have read what our nation s founders wrote about impeachment during those months in 1787 when the Constitution was formed, and considered the writings of many of today's finest scholars. 
   As I reviewed the historical underpinnings of impeachment, I have reflected on the intentions of the Founding Fathers who developed our famed system of ``checks and balances''--our Constitution. That system, designed with the precision of Swiss watchmakers and the concern of loving parents, has served our nation very well over the last 200 years and served as a guidepost for nations around the world as they struggled to establish democracies. 
   I wondered what the Framers of the Constitution would think of this trial--how they would counsel us. In fact, we can use their rationale and their framework to guide us as we reach conclusions about the evidence and as we determine whether that evidence merits removing a president from office. 
   Using all this as my guide, I have concluded that the evidence presented by the House Managers does not meet a sufficient standard of proof that President Clinton engaged in the criminal actions charged by the House. I conclude that the President should not be removed from office. 
   In coming to that conclusion, I have used the highest legal standard of proof--``beyond a reasonable doubt,'' which is required in federal and state criminal trials. I believe that removing a president is so serious, and such an undeniably tumultuous precedent to set in our nation's history, that we should act only when the evidence meets that highest standard. The United States Senate must not make the decision to remove a President based on a hunch that the charges may be true. The strength of our Constitution and the strength of our nation dictate that we be sure--beyond a reasonable doubt. 
   The House Managers' case is thin and circumstantial. It doesn't meet the standard of ``beyond a reasonable doubt.'' 
   The first article of impeachment, charging the president perjured himself before the grand jury, has not been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. 
   For instance, the House Managers claim that President Clinton committed perjury when he used the term ``on certain occasions'' to define the number of times he had inappropriate contact with Ms. Lewinsky. The Managers  believed the term ``on certain occasions'' meant fewer than the 11 times that were counted by Federal investigators and they labeled it ``a direct lie.'' 
   But there is no clear numeric or legal definition of ``certain occasions.'' To disagree about the definition of ``certain occasions'' is not perjury. And it is not material whether it was 11 times or ``on certain occasions.'' President Clinton admitted the relationship, which was the material point. 
   The Republican House Managers also claimed President Clinton committed perjury by not recalling the exact date, time, or place of events that occurred two years before. This was because other witnesses recalled things slightly differently. I do not believe this is or can be perjury because well-established court standards state that ``the mere fact that recollections differ does not mean that one party is committing perjury.'' 
   Overall, the House Manager's assertions rest on Mr. Clinton's vague and unhelpful responses to the Independent Counsel's questions. While those responses may be frustrating to the Independent Counsel, the Republican House Managers, and, perhaps the American public, they are not perjurious as defined by law. 
   Similarly, the case presented by the Republican House Managers has not presented sufficient direct evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the President obstructed justice. Instead, the House Managers relied on extensive conjecture about what the President may have been thinking. In fact, there is direct and credible testimony by multiple witnesses that is directly contrary to the House Managers conjecture, leaving ample room for doubt. 
   The Republican House Managers also did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that there was a causal connection between Ms. Lewinsky s job search and the affidavit she gave in the Jones lawsuit. Ms. Lewinsky testified clearly and repeatedly that she was never promised a job for her silence. That testimony is not challenged by any other witness. In fact, other witnesses support that testimony and her most recent deposition by the House Managers confirms it. 
   From the outset of this trial, I established that I would use a two-tier analysis for my deliberations. First, I would determine whether the evidence proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the president was guilty of the charges. Second, I would then determine whether or not those charges rose to the level of ``high crimes and misdemeanors''--the standard required by the Constitution for conviction and removal of a 
   president. 
   Since my analysis of the charges brought by the Republican House Managers determined that they had not been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, the question of determining high crimes and misdemeanors is, I believe, moot. I will say, however, that I am again taken by the wisdom and prescience of the Founding Fathers in addressing this point. I, like many, have read and re-read the work of Alexander Hamilton with particular interest. On March 7, 1788, he wrote ``Federalist 65,'' outlining the reasons for, and consequences of, an impeachment trial in the Senate. In that writing, Mr. Hamilton asserted that the proper subject of an impeachment trial would be ``the abuse or violation of some public trust ..... as they relate to injuries done immediately to the society itself.'' 
   I believe it is clear from those words, and the words of others who drafted the Constitution, that impeachment was not intended to be used for an act that did not meet that standard it was not meant to be used for punishment of the president. I believe that the Framers intended the last resort of impeachment to be used when a presidential action was a clear offense against the institutions of government. I do not believe that President Clinton's conduct, as wrong as it was, rises to that level. 
   I wish to choose my words judiciously for I believe the behavior of the president was wrong, reckless and immoral. President Clinton has acknowledged that his behavior has harmed his family and the nation, and that his behavior, in the end, is what brought us to this day. Mr. Clinton engaged in an illicit, inappropriate relationship and tried to hide it out of shame and the fear of disgrace. Those actions are clearly deplorable and should be condemned in the most unequivocal terms. But the evidence simply and profoundly does not prove criminal wrongdoing. 
   Certainly, the impeachment process has been a difficult period in our nation's history. It has challenged the strength of our institutions and the strength of our nation. But, Mr. Chief Justice, I still find reason for tremendous hope. 
   First, I find hope in the unflagging commitment of the United States Senate to do the right thing for the right reason. I am proud to be a part of this Senate that was ably led by Mr. LOTT and Mr. DASCHLE and conducted this trial in a serious, bipartisan, reflective, and cooperative spirit. 
   I am reassured that Alexander Hamilton and other constitutional Framers saw fit to charge the Senate with the responsibility to try such a case. I hope and believe that we have fulfilled their expectations to be a sufficiently dignified and independent tribunal, one that could preserve ``unawed and uninfluenced, the necessary impartiality'' between the parties in this trial. I would like to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for meet their responsibilities with such commitment, honor, professionalism, and concern for this body and the judgment of history. I will modestly presume that history will say we discharged our duty well. 
   I will never forget one of our finest hours--when, early in the process, we convened in the old Senate Chamber to deliberate. I had the honor to preside, with my Republican colleague Mr. MACK, over that colloquy in which we established a process that would maintain the dignity of the Senate and provide a framework for conducting the trial. That precedent set an important tone for the proceedings that followed and I believe that the good will generated in that historic meeting held throughout our deliberations. 
   Finally, I also find tremendous hope in the growing national consensus that we must move forward together to address pressing problems in our neighborhoods, communities and cities. Over the last month, the nation has cried out for a focus on education, preserving Social Security and Medicare, investing in our economy, and providing global leadership. 
   We should now heed those calls. I will not say that now we must ``return to the nation's business.'' In fact, as difficult and time consuming as this process has been, I believe fulfilling our duty to ``render impartial justice'' has been the nation's business. I am hopeful that with the conclusion of this trial, we may all return to the work of making our nation more prosperous, our families stronger, our children better educated, our communities more cohesive, and our world safer at home and abroad. I believe we will move on knowing that we have fulfilled our constitutional responsibilities with diligence and honor. 
   Thank you.

    Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, the United States Senate experienced a great and sudden loss on Friday night with the untimely death of our legislative clerk, Scott Bates. Mr. Bates was, in many ways, a symbol of the endurance and integrity of our institution, and his passing is a time of sadness for our Senate family. 
   For thirty years, Scott Bates was a faithful, dedicated and passionate servant of the United States Senate. He devoted his life to ensuring that our legislative body operated with efficiency, precision and dignity. Neither I nor my colleagues, nor any of our predecessors here will ever forget the clear, powerful voice of Scott Bates--calling the roll, announcing our votes, or just saying ``hello.'' 
   Scott Bates was a man of honor and humility. He was a mainstay of our sacred institution for three decades. I join my colleagues in mourning his passing and celebrating his life. To his wife, Ricki, who is still recovering in the hospital, we wish you a speedy recovery--please know that you and your three children, Lori, Lisa and Paul, are in our thoughts and prayers. You will remain a cherished part of the Senate family.

    Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the Wellstone/Harkin motion. This motion would allow open Senate debate during the Impeachment trial. Mr. Chief Justice, the American people should not be excluded from one of the most important Senate deliberations in United States history. 
   The result of the debates and discussions over the next days or weeks could require the removal of the President of the United States for the first time in our nation's 222 year history. In our deliberations, my colleagues and I will contemplate no less than reversing the outcome of an election in which nearly 100 million Americans cast their vote. Such a significant decision, a decision with such profound consequences, should not be reached behind closed doors. 
   I believe my constituents and all Americans deserve to hear Senate deliberations from Senators--not leakers and speculators and commentators. 
   From my earliest days as a Baltimore social worker to my tenure as a United States Senator, I have lived by the principle that the public has a right to know and a right to be heard. This principle is no less important when a Presidential Impeachment trial is underway. It is more important than ever. 
   Now, some of my colleagues have said that these deliberations should be closed because we are jurors and jurors' deliberations are kept secret in a court of law. But let me tell you that this Senate tribunal cannot be compared to a simple court of law. Of course, the law is the foundation for our work in the Senate. But as my colleague from Iowa, Senator HARKIN, noted during the trial, we are more than jurors. 
   We are representatives of our nation. We are given responsibilities to deliberate on matters of public importance and vote in the public interest. Never was that more true than in the Senate Trial in which we are now engaged. 
   The United States Senate is, ultimately, the public's institution--not ours. It is for them we work and it is to them we owe our continued service. I hope and believe we serve the institution well and that our stewardship gives credit and credence to the wisdom of our Founding Fathers. By keeping our deliberations open, we will do service to the American public we serve, this institution we cherish, and those Founding Fathers we revere. 
   I absolutely will not support closing the doors to the public and hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting the Sunshine motion.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I'm proud to join my colleagues in introducing the Democratic agenda for the 106th Congress. I am so proud that the people of Maryland have returned me to the United States Senate for a third term. I promised to continue fighting for their agenda. 
   That agenda means keeping a robust economy. It means fighting for a safety net for seniors. Maryland's agenda means getting behind our kids and our families. It means fighting for safe streets and a safer world. It means that we have to continue to invest in science and technology. The legislation we are introducing today will help us achieve these goals. It is a Democratic agenda--and it's Maryland's agenda. I would like to highlight a few initiatives that are particularly important. 
   Our agenda strengthens the safety net for seniors. I believe that when we say ``honor your mother and your father,'' it is not only a good commandment to live by but it is good public  policy to govern by. What does that mean? First of all, it means helping Americans with long term care. 
   Since my first days in Congress, I have been fighting to help people afford the costs of long-term care. Ten years ago, I introduced legislation to change the cruel rules that forced elderly couples to go bankrupt before they could get any help in paying for nursing home care. Because of my legislation, the American Association of Retired Persons tells me that we've kept over six hundred thousand people out of poverty and stopped liens on family farms. 
   The Democratic agenda will make it easier for families to provide long term care. The agenda also includes my bill to provide long-term care insurance to federal employees and retirees. This provision is a down-payment on extending long-term care insurance to everyone. It will create a model for other employers to use in providing long-term care insurance for their workers. 
   The Democratic agenda also includes measures to expand access to Medicare for individuals aged 55 to 64, and, importantly, calls for reauthorizing the Older Americans Act, an effort I helped lead in the last Congress. Although we did not complete action on the reauthorization last year, I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will recognize how critical the OAA programs are to American seniors. In 1994, the last year OAA was authorized, it provided health and welfare information to 3 million seniors, served 240 million meals to low- and moderate-income seniors, and provided more than 800,000 seniors with critical transportation to and from doctor visits and other needed services. 
   We also recognize that we must get behind our kids and families. We know that our children are our most important resource. Our Democratic agenda puts these words into action. We put the Public Schools Excellence Act at the top of our agenda. That bill will improve achievement by helping communities lower class sizes and help teachers get the training they need for the twenty-first century. 
   We're also helping communities create structured after school initiatives. The Democratic agenda will enable one million children to participate in safe and constructive after school programs. We'll do this by helping schools and community groups set up after school programs that provide academic enrichment, tutoring, recreation or other beneficial activities. 
   But we know that we've also got to get behind our families by making sure they have high-quality, affordable health care. The Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights will do just that. It will provide consumers of HMO health care enforceable patient protections. Democrats believe that health care decisions need to be made in the consultation room, not the board room. 
   This legislation will provide 161 million Americans with critical protections for their health care. It will ensure the right to treatment that is medically necessary by the most appropriate health care provider, using best practices. It will provide continuity of care and patients will have the right to hold their health plans accountable for medical decisions even if it means taking the company to court. Right now, we don't have managed care--we have manacled care, and the Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights will help make sure we put patients ahead of profits. 
   We're also fighting for a safe world for our children to grow up in. The Democratic crime initiative focuses on prevention, police and punishment. It continues to put more cops on the streets. It helps schools stay free of drugs and violence. And it gives law enforcement more tools to fight international drug pushers and terrorists--who threaten the safety of our world. 
   We will also focus on ensuring our nation's food supply is safe for consumption. S. 18, The SAFER Meat and Poultry Act, will be a top initiative in the coming Congress. Every person should have confidence that food is fit to eat and imported food is as safe as food produced domestically. Our food supply has gone global. We need global food safety. Too frequently, Americans suffer food borne illness and even death due to the contamination of imported foods. Just last year, infected raspberries were found in my home state, in Montgomery County. 
   I introduced the Safety of Imported Food Act 1998 and will work with the Democratic leadership to implement safe, effective, and common-sense improvements to our food inspection process, and authorize enforcement tools needed to revolutionize the process and ensure compliance with safety laws. 
   The Democratic agenda seeks to strengthen our economy by increasing the economic security of working Americans. It does this by increasing the minimum wage and by decreasing taxes that unfairly target working families--like the marriage penalty. 
   Mr. President, the Democratic agenda is the American agenda. It will help us meet the day to day needs of the American people--and it will also help prepare our nation for the twenty-first century.

   Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Federal Employees Group Long-Term Care Insurance Act of 1999''. This important legislation will provide long-term care insurance to federal employees and retirees. It will also create a model for other employers to use in providing long-term care insurance for their  workers. I am proud that this legislation is part of the Democratic agenda for long term care--which includes the $1,000 tax credit for families who are paying the costs of long-term care. 
   Since my first days in Congress, I have been fighting to help people afford the burdens of long-term care. Ten years ago, I introduced legislation to change the cruel rules that forced elderly couples to go bankrupt before they could get any help in paying for nursing home care. Because of my legislation, AARP tells me that we've kept over six hundred thousand people out of poverty and stopped liens on family farms. 
   I also fought for higher quality standards for nursing homes. Through the Older American Act funded senior centers, I've made it easier for seniors to get the information and referrals they need to make good choices about long-term care. Those same centers offer case managers to help families navigate the dizzying array of choices when faced with choosing long term care for a family member. 
   These are important steps. But unfortunately, we haven't made much progress in the last few years. We've been stymied by bipartisan bickering, shutdowns and inaction. 
   Meanwhile, the costs of long-term care have exploded. Nursing home costs are projected to increase from $40,000 today to $97,000 by 2030. This will only get worse since the number of senior citizens will double over the next thirty years. Families are being forced to chose between sending a child to college or paying for a nursing home for a parent. 
   Families desperately need help to help themselves and meet their family responsibilities. 
   This bill is a down payment on making long term care available for all Americans. Let me tell you what my legislation will do: 
   It will enable federal workers and retirees to purchase long-term care insurance. 
   It will provide help to those who practice self-help by offering employees the option to better prepare for their retirement and the potential need for long-term care. 
   It will enable federal employees to pay at group discounted rates. The purchasing power of the federal workforce will empower them to get the best deal. 
   Federal employees would pay the entire premium for their long-term care insurance, but that premium will be 15% to 20% less than they would pay individually on the open market. This is a good deal for federal workers--and for taxpayers. 
   I'm starting with federal employees for two reasons. First, as our nation's largest employer, the federal government can be a model for employers around the country. By offering long-term care insurance to its employees, the federal government can set the example for other employers whose workforce will be facing the same long-term care needs. We can use the lessons learned to help other employers to offer this option to their workers. 
   I have a second reason for starting with our federal employees. I am a strong supporter of our federal employees. I am proud that so many of them live, work, and retire in Maryland. They work hard in the service of our country. And I work hard for them. Whether it's fighting for fair COLAs, against disruptive and harmful shutdowns of the federal government, or to prevent unwise schemes to privatize important services our federal workforce provide, they can count on me. 
   Promise made should be promises kept. Federal retirees made a commitment to devote their careers to public service. In return, our government made certain promises to them. 
   One important promise made was the promise of health insurance. We promised our federal workers and their families that they would have health insurance while they were working and during their retirement. The lack of long-term care for federal workers has been a big gap in this important promise to our federal workers. My legislation will close that gap and provide our federal workers and retirees with comprehensive health insurance. 
   I am proud that Senator SARBANES and Senator ROBB join me in introducing this bill, and that our colleague Congressman CUMMINGS has introduced this legislation in the House. I hope that we will soon be joined by a bipartisan group of Senators who care about helping American families to cope with the costs of long term care. 
   Mr. President, long term care requires long term solutions. My legislation is part of the solution. It is an important step forward in helping all Americans to prepare for the challenges of aging.

    Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the contribution of an outstanding Marylander, Mr. Les Chittenden. I hope my colleagues will find inspiration in this story of devotion and persistence. 
   Les and his wife Mary lived in an apartment building in Columbia, Maryland where handicapped access and parking were limited. When Mary became ill and required the use of a wheelchair, the Chittendens discovered just how inadequate the handicapped facilities at their building were. 
   Mr. President, Les Chittenden was not content to simply accept the situation. He fought to change it. His devotion to his wife of 36 years motivated  him to take on the powers that be and propose solutions to make disabled residents safer each time they parked their car and entered the building. Even though agreeing on and implementing a solution proved to be difficult, Mr. Chittenden still refused to give up. 
   Five months after he began his fight to improve access for disabled residents, Les' beloved wife Mary passed away. Mr. President, I want to send my condolences to Mr. Chittenden and his family during this difficult time. 
   But, Mr. President, I also want to send my congratulations and my admiration. Shortly after his wife's passing, Mr. Chittenden returned home one weekend to find that his hard work paid off at last--a new handicapped ramp and several new handicapped parking spaces were added to the building as a result of his persistent efforts. 
   I want to share this story with my colleagues today because I think it's important that we honor the meaningful contributions of Americans like Les Chittenden. Mr. Chittenden is a wonderful example of how one person can make a valuable difference in our communities. Mr. Chittenden's story is an inspiration to us all.
