   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, in the era of the Internet, in the era of the microchip, at the dawn of the twenty-first century, I am concerned that the most prosperous, productive and inventive nation in the world conducts its elections for its highest offices in some areas in ways that are outdated, slow, inaccurate, and inaccessible to many. 
   That is why, Mr. President, I rise as an original sponsor of the ``Voting Study and Improvement Act,'' which I am proud to introduce today with my colleague CHUCK SCHUMER of New York. 
   The long national nightmare that the 2000 Presidential election has become has taught us, Republican and Democrat alike, that we need to improve the  instruments of voting and the means of electing our federal office holders. 
   Both rural and urban areas have unique difficulties not only with accessibility to voting, but also in funding improvements in their voting systems. A rural State like Kansas has problems with voting that are different than those faced by a State such as New York. Our legislation recognizes these differences, and will allow each State to implement the changes they believe are best for them. What is the best system for voting in Kansas may not be the best system for voting in New York. What is the best system for voting in some parts of Kansas may not be the best system for voting in another part of Kansas. 
   That is why CHUCK SCHUMER and I can agree to sponsor this legislation together today, and that is why we agree that something must be done. I am pleased to rise with CHUCK SCHUMER today to introduce the Voting Study and Improvement Act. 
   This is the first bipartisan attempt to provide grant money to States to implement alternate means and instruments of voting that provide swifter and more accurate results, and are less susceptible to partisan interference and differences of opinion 
   Let me be clear: unlike some legislation that has been introduced in this regard, this is not a federal mandate of election standards. We provide the means to States to implement the changes that they deem are most fitting for their unique needs. 
   In addition, unlike some other legislation that is being proposed in this area, we do not create a new federal agency or bureaucracy. We use the existing expertise and personnel of the Federal Election Commission to study possible improvements to our current voting system, and make recommendations for changes. 
   Given the magnitude of controversy surrounding the 2000 Presidential election, it is tempting to create a new agency with new powers to solve these problems. Given these problems, it is also tempting to create a federalized system of voting for federal elections. However, Senator CHUCK SCHUMER and I believe these decisions are best left to the individual States to decide. States are as different as my home State of Kansas is from CHUCK's home State of New York, and they are the ones who can best decide how to improve their own voting systems. 
   I encourage my colleagues to join Senator SCHUMER and myself in supporting this common-sense, bipartisan legislation, and help bring our nation's elections into the twenty-first century.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I wish to take some time this evening to discuss an issue on which I held a hearing, along with Senator GORDON SMITH, yesterday. It concerns something that is very troubling: The arming of Iran, which occurred recently, and concerns an agreement that was made by Vice President AL GORE with then-Prime Minister of Russia Viktor Chernomyrdin on allowing Russia to convey armaments to Iran and avoid U.S. sanctions law. 
   I do not want to discuss so much that part of the issue, although it is an important part of it, but I want to get to the issue of an agreement made between the Vice President and then-Prime Minister of Russia Viktor Chernomyrdin to allow the conveyance of this equipment, military hardware--we are talking submarines, tanks, attack helicopters, a lot of equipment. 
   It was stated by the Vice President in this agreement--and we found this out when it was leaked to the press 14 days ago, in the New York Times--that we will not sanction Russia for allowing this to take place. 
   I asked the administration in the hearing I held yesterday and I asked by letter today signed by a number of my colleagues: Let us see the agreement the Vice President entered into with Viktor Chernomyrdin. To date, the administration has refused to convey that document to us. We held a closed session yesterday. We said: Convey it to us in closed session. They refused. 
   This afternoon, a group of Senators and myself sent a letter to the Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, restating our position that the administration should share with the Congress the documents relating to the Gore-Chernomyrdin agreement which allowed Russia to sell conventional weaponry to Iran and not be sanctioned under U.S. law. 
   If we have not received the documents by noon on Monday, the Foreign Relations Committee will be forced to issue--and pursue issuing--a subpoena to receive those documents from the administration. 
   This letter was signed by Senator GORDON SMITH; myself, who chaired the hearing yesterday; along with Chairman MCCAIN of the Commerce Committee; Senator LUGAR; Chairman SHELBY of the Intelligence Committee; Chairman WARNER of the Armed Services Committee; Chairman THOMPSON of the Governmental Affairs Committee; and Senators NICKLES and LOTT of leadership. 
   In it we express our disappointment with the administration's continued stonewalling and refusal to provide documents related to the Gore-Chernomyrdin agreement. They refused to even allow us to see documents which have been published in the press, which is how we learned about them. These were published in the New York Times. That is how we learned about this taking place. 
   Essentially, now, the administration is asking us to trust them. But the fact that almost everything we have learned about this secret deal has come from the New York Times and the Washington Times--and not the administration--makes such trust difficult. 
   Congress has the right and the responsibility to review all the relevant documents and to judge for itself whether the transfers the Vice President signed off on were covered by U.S. nonproliferation laws. 
   Unfortunately, until the New York Times broke the story 14 days ago, Congress had not seen this written, signed agreement between the Vice President and the Russian Prime Minister. In open session hearing yesterday, I asked them to deny this, that this had been conveyed to the Congress. What we heard was that the administration had ``telegraphed'' the contents of the agreement, that they had ``briefed'' but they were unable to say that they had transmitted this document to the Congress, as they were required to do. 
   In essence, they said to us: Look, we were telling you that the Vice President was meeting with Mr.  Chernomyrdin. We told you that they were discussing a number of issues. That should be good enough. 
   Well, it isn't. Now we are saying to the administration: Show us the documents that have now been--some of them have been leaked to the press. Tell us what the agreement was. Because we want to determine whether or not laws were violated. 
   To date, they have continued to stonewall and to refuse to provide the documents to us. We provided, as I stated, a closed session for them to provide it to us in case there were national security concerns. They refused to do so. 
   The decision to allow Russia to escape the consequences of providing Iran with conventional weapons is one which affects not only the security of the American military personnel in the gulf but also the security of our allies in the region. This is not the type of agreement which should have been kept from the American people, and it certainly is not something that Members of Congress should have learned about first in the press. 
   The Vice President is saying this deal with Russia slowed down and prevented more weapons transfers from Russia to Iran. The fact is that the Russians did not keep their side of the bargain. 
   I have held a number of hearings on Russian arms transfers to Iran over the last 4 years. As a matter of fact, I held six 
   hearings on the topic of Iran's weaponry buildup. At each of these hearings we have seen and have had experts cite the level and the amount of weaponry that has been transferred from Russia to Iran. At almost all these hearings--as a matter of fact, I think all of them--we had an administration witness there. We said to them: Stop this flow of weaponry from Russia to Iran. We are going to face this weaponry or our allies in the region are going to face this weaponry. 
   At each of these hearings the administration would say: Yes, it is terrible that Russia is conveying this weaponry to Iran. We are trying to stop it. Then I would ask: Are you sanctioning Russia for doing this? They would say: Well, no, we are not doing this. We are not sure it rises to that level. We are not sure we should do this. And all along, there was this secret agreement in the background that they had agreed to--the Vice President had--that they would not sanction Russia. And they did not disclose that at any of these hearings nor even allude to the fact that that existed. Until we found out about it 14 days ago in the New York Times, I did not know this existed. 
   This should have been conveyed to the Congress. We should have been brought in so we could appraise whether or not these sanctions should have happened with this level of weaponry that has been flowing from Russia to Iran. 
   I have a compilation now, from open sources, of some of the weapons that have been transferred. These are all weapons which pose a direct threat to our forces in the gulf as well as to our allies. This is a list gleaned from various press sources and other open sources. And we do not have the list of the weapons the administration agreed to let Russia supply to Iran. 
   Yes, the press is reporting there was an annex to the Gore-Chernomyrdin agreement that listed the level of weaponry, the amount of weapons that could be conveyed from Russia to Iran, and that this would not be sanctioned. We need to see that annex. We need to see what was agreed to be allowed to be conveyed. We know some of what has been conveyed because of open sources in the press. We do not know what was in the agreement between Vice President Gore and Mr. Chernomyrdin. So the Congress is continuing to be left in the dark about what laws, if any, have been broken. 
   The administration claims that the weaponry is not destabilizing and therefore not subject to sanctions anyway. When you look at the list, the public list, I submit that any and all of these weapons pose a direct threat to our soldiers and sailors in this region. They include submarines. They include attack helicopters. They include attack aircraft, mines, and torpedoes. I think that would be and is destabilizing in the region. It is destabilizing. It is clear that this so-called deal did not stop these transfers from occurring. 
   The main problem here, that I am complaining about this evening, is not the weaponry, although I think that is a terrible problem and one we are going to have to face. It is going to be very problematic for us and our allies to face in the future. The main problem is we are not being given the opportunity to look at these documents--the agreement--ourselves, to determine the legality of this deal and whether or not it falls into the categories of an agreement that should have been transmitted to Congress by law, and then whether, in fact, this deal allowed Russia to circumvent the law. 
   By stonewalling on providing us with the material to allow us to see their side of this issue, the administration is raising even more questions than were raised by the initial New York Times article. Why are they refusing to provide these documents? Is there something they are hiding? Provide it to us in closed session. Yet they have continued to refuse to do that. 
   The administration has an obligation to submit these agreements to the Congress. They never revealed there was a written and signed agreement which binds both sides and binds the United States into skirting U.S. laws. 
   Now, a couple of laws I think are in play here, whether or not they have been violated. We have not heard from the administration about these. They say they have not, overall, been violated. But the Gore-McCain Act is one, I believe--as we look at it and study it, if we are able to get the information--that was probably violated. Allowing Iran to have this sort of weaponry is one that would violate this law. 
   Mr. President, I want to go through a series of charts here to maybe put down clearly what has taken place to date. 
   Fourteen days ago, there was an article that appeared in the New York Times. I am summarizing here about what took place. Fourteen days ago, an article appeared in the New York Times stating that a secret agreement had been reached between Vice President GORE and then-Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin allowing Russia to avoid sanctions required under U.S. weapons proliferation laws for selling arms to Iran. This is what was in the newspaper, signed by AL GORE and Viktor Chernomyrdin. There is attached to this--we have not seen it, but it has been reported--an annex listing weaponry that can be conveyed. 
   They are saying here: In light of the undertakings contained in this joint statement--in the aide-memoire--the United States is prepared to take appropriate steps to avoid any penalties to Russia that might otherwise arise under domestic law with respect to the completion of the transfers disclosed in the annex for so long as the Russian Federation acts in accordance with these commitments. 
   So here is the Vice President of the United States signing an agreement with Mr. Chernomyrdin saying we are going to not enforce U.S. domestic law on these transfers. 
   Now my question to you, to all of the people, and to the administration, is: Does the Vice President have this authority to waive these sanctions? No, he does not have the authority to waive these sanctions. Under the law, they have to issue the sanctions. 
   Now they can choose later to find a way out, to waive them afterwards, but they cannot just waive these sanctions. The Vice President does not have the authority to do this. He enters into an agreement saying: We will take appropriate steps to avoid any penalties to Russia that might otherwise arise under domestic law with respect to the completion of the transfers disclosed in the annex for so long as the Russian Federation acts in accordance with these commitments. 
   I want to go to Secretary Albright's letter to Ivan Ivanov, the Foreign Minister of Russia, about this aide memoire where she says:  
   Without the aide memoire which we just looked at--  
   This is the Gore-Chernomyrdin agreement--  
   Russia's conventional arms sales to Iran would have been subject to sanctions based on various provisions of our laws.  
   This is her letter to the Russian Foreign Minister, January 13 of this year. The Secretary of State is saying, if we hadn't agreed in this signed secret agreement that we would not sanction you, you would have been subject to  sanctions. The Secretary of State is saying it. You would ``have been subject to sanctions based on various provisions of our laws.'' 
   This is the other part that was in the secret agreement with Chernomyrdin, that ``we are prepared to take steps'' that I previously read. The administration itself is saying, look, we agreed with you not to sanction you, but if we hadn't agreed to it, you would have been subject to U.S. sanctions law. Does the Vice President have the authority to waive U.S. sanctions? He doesn't have that authority to do this. Yet that is what he did. 
   I want to show you some of what we are talking about, the weaponry that has been conveyed. This is one piece of equipment, Russian attack submarines for Iran, three Kilo-class attack submarines have been conveyed under this agreement. We have, as I mentioned, attack helicopters, airplanes. The administration was saying, look, we are not going to sanction you because we have secretly agreed not to sanction you. 
   I don't want to go on a long time about this. I just want to continue to raise this issue because I am deeply troubled about a couple of things. 
   No. 1, for 4 years I have been holding hearings about conveyance of weaponry from Russia to Iran and pressing the administration, what are you doing to stop this conveyance of weaponry from Russia to Iran, because our allies will face this equipment in the future. They wring their hands and say, it is terrible what is going on. And then nothing would happen. 
   Now, 14 days ago, I found out the reason nothing is going to happen--a secret agreement was agreed to that they weren't going to sanction Russia. They were going to let it go ahead and continue to happen. Now we face heightened danger in the Persian Gulf. This equipment is there, and some of it is still being conveyed. 
   No. 2, we have asked the administration, show us the agreement. You should have shown it to us when it took place so we could understand what this is. I believe there was a violation of the law then. We need to see these documents now. They say nothing illegal has taken place. OK, then, fine. Show us the documents. 
   A letter was sent today. We want to see the documents of this agreement. We don't want to continue to read about it in the newspaper. We want to see the documents. Convey them to us; send it in a closed session. If there is national security interests, we want to see these documents. That is what we are saying now. 
   What I am also saying is, what I have stated this evening, if we don't have these by noon on Monday, we will seek a subpoena to receive these documents and get them from the administration. 
   I think this is highly suspect, what has taken place by the administration. We are only now finding out about it. We need to see what it was that the administration agreed to, what it is that is still taking place between Russia and Iran, and why the United States is not stepping in to stop this. 
   I believe you will be hearing more about this unless the administration comes forward and comes clean. I hope they do. I hope they tell us: Here it is, and here is all of what we agreed to. Here is why we agreed to all of this. Here is why we think this is working, rather than it isn't. 
   But right now, all we have are secret deals that somehow are getting leaked out to the newspapers, and we don't even know what the agreement is. We don't know what it is. We deserve to know what that agreement is.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to retain the important ag tax provisions contained in the Senate version of the upcoming tax package that will soon be before us. I have not seen the final tax bill as of yet, but word is that most if not all of the agricultural tax provisions are being stripped from the bill at the will of the House. I hope this is not true. I cannot imagine why we would choose to leave out farmers from important tax relief at a time when this Congress has clearly recognized the economic hardships in farm country today. 
   I plead with my colleagues to include these necessary provisions in any final tax package. 
   Specifically, I am talking about a provision that came from a bill Senator DASCHLE and I introduced--along with 31 co-sponsors--to clarify that Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) payments made to farmers for taking agricultural land out of production for environmental improvement--are not  subject to self employment social security taxes--a rate of up to 15 percent of the payment amount. 
   The CRP has been a great success for this nation. The program provides financial incentives for improving and preserving environmentally sensitive land--taking it out of production and enhancing its environmental benefit. The CRP program increases water quality, wildlife habitat and prevents soil erosion--all factors which have become even more important in light of recent concerns about nonpoint source pollution in our nation's waterways. 
   The Senate has strongly supported this measure--passing it by unanimous consent earlier this year on the death tax debate--and our Senate leadership has held firm in fighting for this needed provision, but for some reason, our fine colleagues in the House have decided to make an issue of this provision and are trying to strike it from the tax package. 
   It makes no sense to yield to the House on this matter. The provision, as currently contained in the Senate tax package--will only cost $292 million over 5 years--but that money and the clarity it brings to our nation's farmers is worth far more than can be said in this time of farm economic stress. This provision allows farmers to plan and better use their resources next year because they will no longer have to wonder or worry about whether the IRS is going to come after them for a conservation tax they didn't know they owed. 
   Currently, there is confusion over whether CRP income should be taxed owing to a recent court case in the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals which overturned a 1998 Tax Court ruling that CRP income is not subject to social security taxes. The Tax Court found and I concur, that because it is a rental payment the government makes in exchange for farmers taking environmentally sensitive land out of production, CRP payments should be treated the same as other contractual agreements made by farmers for land use--and be exempt from self-employment taxes. 
   The new court ruling creates a discrepancy between active farmers who take part in CRP--which are now subject to the tax--and landowners who do not farm but take part in CRP and are exempt from the tax. 
   This tax correction is just common sense. Now more than ever we should appreciate the need for conservation and the co-benefits of wildlife, air and water quality it provides. We should not allow a tax to create confusion and a disincentive for farmers to trust and work with government for the good of the environment. 
   Numerous ag groups support this bill including the National Corn Growers, National Wheat Growers, American Soybean and Cattlemen's Beef Associations--along with the National Farmer's Union and the American Farm Bureau. This is our only opportunity to address this important issue. 
   In my state of Kansas alone, $102.7 million in CRP payments were issued in 1999. Are we really going to tell farmers that this money--promised them for conservation purposes--will now be additionally taxed? This would amount to a disincentive for farmers to participate in environmental and conservation programs. Is that the message this Congress really wants to send? 
   Again, I urge my colleagues to include this important provision--and all the ag tax provisions that have been so carefully worked out and included in the Community Renewal and New Markets Act. We cannot afford to leave this important work undone.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to put on the record my concerns about numerous provisions contained in this year's conference report of the Ag appropriations bill. Specifically, I am greatly concerned that this year's bill single-handedly turns back a number of reforms made by the 1996 farm bill and moves us further away from an agriculture policy that looks to the markets rather than government for survival. The danger of following such a philosophy is that government is not likely to have the will to sustain the ag industry indefinitely, so that when the political will to support agriculture dries up, there will be massive calamity. 
   There are legitimate ag emergencies occurring in the country right now. My family is still on the farm, Kansas is the 4th largest agricultural-producing state in the Nation--and I myself served as Secretary of Agriculture for the State of Kansas before coming to the U.S. Senate. I am not here to find fault with providing additional aid to farmers. Indeed, it is in our national interest to do so. My problem is not with the concept of government assistance to farmers--but rather in the shape this assistance is beginning to take--especially this year. 
   Specifically, I am referring to the treatment of pet commodities like sugar and tobacco--which have been exempt from the market-oriented reforms faced by most other commodities--including the wheat growers of my state, for example. These reforms were set forth in 1996 to move farmers closer to the market. Some of my Democratic colleagues have accused us of abandoning a financial safety net for farmers--I don't see how they can honestly make that claim since farm spending has gone up dramatically since the '96 law was enacted. The Congressional Research Service notes that program payments combined with emergency spending for calendar year 1999 reached $22.7 billion--the highest ever and we have continued to provide substantial support to our farmers in 2000--well above that which would have been allowed under previous farm bills. If this conference report merely continued this tradition of backing up the market-reforms of the 1996 farm bill, I would have no problem--but this conference report takes serious steps to undermine those reforms--and that is wrong. 
   This conference report contains a provision to change the 1996 farm bill language on marketing loans for sugar--now, instead of having to meet a certain threshold, non-recourse loans will be guaranteed for the next two years. This clears the way for additional payments to sugar producers on top of an already complex quota system which allows them to control the amount of imported competition. We don't do this for wheat, corn or soybeans--we should not do it for sugar. 
   One of the most egregious parts of this bill is language which will promote increased tobacco production from the same government which is trying to decrease domestic demand for tobacco products. 
   Currently, co-ops can and do purchase low quality or remaining tobacco not bid on by cigarette companies in order to artificially keep the price high. This bill will now allow the co-ops to then sell, this inferior tobacco to the government (through Commodity Credit Corporation funds). This measure is estimated to cost the government $510 million and cuts out flute-cured tobacco grown in North Carolina--which means there will likely be a similar fix that doubles the cost to the taxpayer. 
   After obtaining this left-over tobacco, the U.S. is not allowed to market this tobacco domestically for fear of displacing the controlled market and we will not be able to unload it on the world market due to restrictions about exporting tobacco and the already high amounts of world production that are much cheaper than this U.S. price-inflated tobacco--especially since this is the inferior ``left-over'' tobacco. 
   To make matters worse, this language prevents this government action from affecting the quota limits for tobacco growing. This means that once the oversupply is wiped out by selling excess tobacco to the government, tobacco quotas will increase and allow for the growing of more tobacco--which will lead to the need for another bailout next year. 
   For no other commodity do we have a situation like this: the U.S. government actively encourages a reduction in the use of tobacco, particularly by children--and now the same government is going to subsidize and encourage expanded tobacco production. This is one of the worst market-distorting abuses I've ever seen--at a time when we have repeatedly told farmers of most other commodities to turn toward the market and adjust to the new world economy. 
   Unfortunately, the Senate does not have the opportunity to vote on these measures--we are forced to vote for these offensive programs because they are tied to an agriculture appropriations bill which is so important to our Nation--which provides a measure of unilateral sanctions reform many of us in this body have fought for--for years. This is no mistake--the numerous faulty measures contained in this bill were added at the last minute in conference--precisely because they would never pass on their own, nor should they. 
   It is truly a disappointment that the conference report to such an important bill contains the very means to undermine the market reforms this Congress has pushed for, because of the interests of a few. 
   This bill is a very important one--and just as the conference predicted, it is too important for me to vote against--but I fell compelled to express my frustration, and my disappointment in this process--and the hypocrisy it creates.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, there is a tragedy ongoing in the Middle East, and the first thing I want to do is express heartfelt sorrow for the families of those who have lost their lives. 
   The events of the last two weeks are deeply disturbing, and the clear first step is to find a way to calm the violence. The onus is on Yasser Arafat and the Palestinian Authority to call a cease fire. If the Palestinian leadership and the Palestinian people are in the midst of a quest for a state, and are trying to prove they have the maturity to lead more than a terrorist organization, the moment of truth has come  and gone. What many have long suspected about the Palestinian leadership is being confirmed: They are not committed to peace, they are committed to victory. 
   Unfortunately, the reaction of the international community to the violence in the Middle East has only emboldened Yasser Arafat. For proof we need look no further than the one-sided, dishonest U.N. Security Council resolution that passed last weekend. The resolution ignores the role of the Palestinians in the violence now taking place. It unfairly blames Israel for sparking the violence, forgetting that it is the right of any person of any religion to visit the Temple Mount. The United States' failure to veto this resolution is an embarrassment--a sell-out of our friends, a sell-out of the peace process. 
   Arfat insists on an international inquiry into the violence before he will call for its cessation. But is it any wonder that Prime Minister Barak is reluctant to accept such an inquiry when the international community has ranged itself so clearly on one side. Condemn first and ask questions later. 
   The actions of Arafat and the Palestinian Authority on the question of treatment of holy sites are equally troubling. First, the use of Ariel Sharon's visit to the Temple Mount and the use of that holy site to incite violence: How can we believe any commitment to allow access to all people of all faiths when the Palestinians believe it is their right to sow mayhem after one visit? 
   Second, the sacking of Joseph's Tomb. Palestinian police stood by as a mob of Palestinians destroyed Joseph's tomb in Nablus--a location from which Israeli forces had retreated in an attempt to calm the situation. They ripped apart Torah scrolls and desecrated a holy place. I have heard it said that the authenticity of the site has been questioned. I can just picture the mob looking for that certificate of authenticity before they went ahead and destroyed a holy book of the Jews. 
   There is no excuse--no excuse--for the behavior of the Palestinians or their leadership. Prime Minister Barak has offered concessions previously through taboo by most Israelis. Chairman Arafat has responded by demanding yet more and using violence to get it when negotiations failed. He has broken every agreement made in the past months and years, and has released dozens of notorious Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists in recent days. Perhaps Israel's intensified reaction following the mob killing of three Israeli soldiers will convince Arafat that he cannot win with violence. But I wonder. 
   And for the United States, being an honest broker does not necesitate our staying neutral. It should mean embracing a policy of honesty and telling one side when enough is enough. Instead, the Clinton-Gore Administration has shied away from the kind of frankness needed from our nation, and has stood aside in the face of an international political assault on our most important friend in the Middle East. 
   That lack of resolve is noticed. It has been noticed by those who defy sanctions on Iraq. It has been noticed by the Palestinians. And it was surely noticed by those who attacked the U.S.S.Cole and murdered six, maybe more American servicemen. When will this nation show the resolve needed to crush the cowards and criminals who threaten us and our allies? 
   I hope that the diplomatic efforts underway can lead to a calming of the situation and that the future will see a lasting peace between Israel and the Palestinians. However, for this peace to be truly lasting--and truly be peace--it must come when the parties are ready, on a timetable agreed by them. More important, it can only come when the Palestinians are ready to take upon themselves the mantle of nationhood and abandon their legacy of terrorism. And finally, peace will come when those who stand with the United States know that they have a forthright and loyal ally and those who stand against us fear our resolve.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I would like to make a few remarks todays regarding the recent proposals put  forth by the Nevada Gaming Commission yesterday that would place a $550 cap on all legalized gambling on college sports and prohibits all gambling on high school and the Olympic sporting events. I believe that the proposed rule changes in Nevada are a significant first step in protecting our student athletes and the integrity of college sports. 
   The Chairman of the Nevada Gaming Commission stated yesterday that the changes proposed ``will provide protection for Nevada athletes and for Nevada games. They will also protect athletes in the other 49 states. The proposals are intended to discourage illegal bookmakers and fixers from attempting to use Nevada's legal sports books as a place to place bets.'' 
   It is obvious from these proposals that the Nevada Gaming Commission knows that gambling has an unseemly influence on our colleges and universities. Ironically, while Nevada is the only state where legal gambling on collegiate and Olympic sporting events occurs, Nevada's own gaming regulations currently prohibit gambling on any of Nevada's teams because of the potential to jeopardize the integrity of those sporting events. The frequency of gambling scandals over the last decade is a clear indication that legal gambling on college sports stretches beyond the borders of Nevada, impacting the integrity of other state's sporting events. 
   While I am encouraged by the proposed rule changes from the Nevada Gaming Commission, I do not believe it goes far enough. I will continue to insist that the Senate take up and pass, The Amateur Sports Integrity Act, which is in response to a recommendation made by the National Gambling Impact Study Commission (NGISC), which last year concluded a two-year study on the impact of legalized gambling on our country. The recommendation called for a ban on all legalized gambling on amateur sports and is supported by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), coaches, teachers, athletic directors, commissioners, university presidents, school principals and family groups from across the country. 
   Banning all legalized gambling on amateur sports serves notice that betting on college games or student athletes are not only inappropriate but can result in significant social costs. The National Gambling Impact Study Commission Report recognized the potential harm of legalized gambling by stating that sports gambling ``can serve as gateway behavior for adolescent gamblers, and can devastate individuals and careers.'' 
   Some of its findings include: more than 5 million Americans suffer from pathological gambling; another 15 million are ``at risk'' for it; and about 1.1 million adolescents, ages 12 to 17, or 5% of America's 20 million teenager engage in severe pathological gambling each year. 
   According to the American Psychiatric Association: Pathological gambling is a chronic and progressive psychiatric disorder characterized by emotional dependence, loss of control and leads to adverse consequences at school and at home. Teens are more than twice as vulnerable to gambling addictions than adults because they are prone to high-risk behaviors during adolescence. Ninety percent of the nations compulsive gamblers start at an adolescent age. According to the Minnesota Council on Compulsive Gambling, gambling on sporting events is a favorite preference of teenage gamblers. 
   A study conducted by the University of Michigan found that most student athletes gamble. According to this study, ``72% of students athletes have gambled in some way since entering college (80% among male student athletes).'' Many student athletes gamble on sports. This study found ``35% of all students athletes have gambled on sports while attending college (45% among male student athletes).'' This study found that a considerable number of student athletes acted in ways that call into question the integrity of their contests. ``Over 5% of male student athletes provided inside information for gambling purposes, bet on a game in which they participated, or accepted money for performing poorly in a game.'' 
   A study recently conducted by the University of Michigan found that ``84% of college referees said they had participated in some form of gambling since beginning their careers as referees. Nearly 40% also admitted placing bets on sporting events and 20% said they gambled on the NCAA basketball tournament. Two referees said they were aware of the spread on a game and that it affected the way they officiated the contest. Some reported being asked to fix games they were officiating and others were aware of referees who ``did not call a game fairly because of gambling reasons.'' 
   Gambling on college kids is banned in 49 states. Prior to 1992 when any state could have allowed gambling on amateur sporting events, they didn't. No states have asked to have this federal law repealed. Why do you think that is? It is because it is inappropriate. 
   The bottom line--it is inappropriate to bet on college kids. This is about protecting the integrity of amateur athletics, it is about the effect that legal, government sanctioned betting has on the games, it is about the gateway college sports betting provides youth gamblers, and most importantly, it is about the impropriety of betting on teenagers.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, today the Senate will begin debate on the conference report to accompany H.R. 3244, the sex trafficking victims legislation. I want to start this discussion and debate off with thanking my good friend and colleague, Senator PAUL WELLSTONE. He and I have worked together on this bill the entire year. We have come at this from different points of view. I think we have worked together and come up with an excellent proposal and package. I hope for unanimous support from the Senate. 
   We got near that in the House, with a vote of 377-1. I have spoken with that one person who deeply regrets voting against us on this bill. It was actually for another provision that was in the bill. This is an important piece of legislation. 
   The sex trafficking victims legislation is here under a previous order, and there will be up to 7 hours of debate on the conference report we are going to discuss. Senator THOMPSON will raise a point of order against the report and is expected to appeal the ruling of the Chair. Therefore, a vote on the appeal, as well as a vote on adoption of the conference report, is expected to occur during this afternoon's session. The Senate will also consider the VA-HUD appropriations bill and the conference report to accompany the Agriculture appropriations bill, with votes on both expected to occur prior to today's adjournment. 
   I thank my colleagues for their attention.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, let me start this debate and discussion with the story of Irina. Irina's story appeared in the New York Times not that long ago, and it is similar to the story of a number of women with whom I have met and who have been caught in this situation of sex trafficking--young ladies I met with in Nepal, and several testified in committee. I think Irina's story tells in graphic detail why this is a problem and why the Senate needs to act.  
   Irina always assumed that her beauty would somehow rescue her from the poverty and hopelessness of village life. A few months ago, after answering a vague ad in a small Ukrainian newspaper, she slipped off a tour boat when it put in at Haifa, hoping to make a bundle dancing naked on the tops of tables. 
   She was 21, self-assured and glad to be out of Ukraine. Israel offered a new world, and for a week or two everything seemed possible. Then, one morning, she was driven to a brothel, where her boss burned her passport before her eyes. 
   ``I own you,'' she recalled his saying. ``You are my property and you will work until you earn your way out. Don't try to leave. You have no papers and you don't speak Hebrew. You will be arrested and deported. Then we will get you and bring you back.''  
   That was her master. The article goes on.  
   It happens every single day. Not just in Israel, which has deported nearly 1,500 Russian and Ukrainian women like Irina in the past three years. But throughout the world, where selling naive and desperate young women into sexual bondage has become one of the fastest-growing criminal enterprises in the robust global economy. 
   ..... Many end up like Irina. Stunned and outraged by the sudden order to prostitute herself, she simply refused. She was beaten and raped before she succumbed. Finally she got a break. The brothel was raided and she was brought here [to another place], the only women's prison in Israel. Now, like hundreds of Ukrainian and Russian women with no documents or obvious forgeries, she is waiting to be sent home.  
   This is a quote from Irina:  
   ``I don't think the man who ruined my life will even be fined,'' she said softly, slow tears filling her enormous green eyes. ``You can call me a fool for coming here. That's my crime. I am stupid. A stupid girl from a little village. But can people really buy and sell women and get away with it? Sometimes I sit here and ask myself if that really happened to me, if it can really happen at all.'' 
   Then, waving her arm toward a muddy prison yard, where Russian is spoken more commonly than Hebrew, she whispered one last thought: ``I am not the only one, you know. They have ruined us all.''

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, Irina's story is told all too often and is reenacted all too often around the world today. Our Government estimates that between 600,000 and 2 million women are trafficked each year beyond international borders. They are trafficked for the purpose of sexual prostitution by organized crime units and groups that are aggressively out making money off the trafficking of human flesh. It is wrong. This bill seeks to deal with that wrong and that tragedy that has occurred and is occurring around the world today. 
   This is significant human rights legislation that this body is going to pass. I hope, predict, and pray that it will pass today. It is significant human rights legislation for those poor young victims who are trafficked and who are caught sometimes with the view that, ``I am just stupid, I got caught in this,'' but who live this horrible, hellish life they have been put into and trafficked into and can't find their way out. 
   The conference report is entitled ``The Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000.'' As I mentioned previously, it passed the House of Representatives on Friday, October 6, by a vote of 371-1. 
   The Senate will vote on this conference report today, with the lead underlying bill being the Brownback-Wellstone anti-trafficking legislation. Senator WELLSTONE and I have been working for the last year on this legislation, which is a companion to the Smith-Gejdenson bill in the House known as the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000. 
   I want to thank and recognize my staff, Sharon Payt and Karen Knutson, two people who have worked tirelessly and endlessly to deal with this particular issue. 
   Our anti-trafficking bill is the first complete legislation to address the growing practice of international ``trafficking'' worldwide. This is one of the largest manifestations of modern-day slavery internationally. Notably, this legislation is the most significant human rights bill of the 106th Congress, if passed today, as hoped for. This is also the largest anti-slavery bill that the United States has adopted since 1865 and the demise of slavery at the end of the Civil War. Therefore, I greatly anticipate this vote today in the Senate on this legislation. 
   Senator WELLSTONE's and my trafficking bill, which passed in the Senate on July 27 of this year, was conferenced to reconcile the differences with the House bill, and the conference report was filed on October 5, Thursday, of last week. The final conference package contains four additional pieces of legislation which are substantially appropriate to our bill. Most significant among those bill amendments is the Violence Against Women Act, known as VAWA, which provides relief and assistance to those who suffer domestic violence in America. Thus, the additional four bills included in this conference report include the Violence Against Women Act. This is a reauthorization of the initial bill which was passed in 1994 as part of the Omnibus Crime Control Act; this legislation renews several grant programs to assist law enforcement officers, social service providers, and others dealing with sexual crime and domestic violence. 
   Also in this package is Aimee's law, which provides for interstate compensation for the costs of incarceration of early-release sex offenders who commit another sex crime in a second State. It is based on the circumstances of what happened in a Pennsylvania case where a murderer was released early out of a Nevada prison, went to Pennsylvania, and kidnapped and brutally raped and murdered a young girl there who was in the very flower of life and coming forth. This law is built upon that terrible crime that took place in Pennsylvania. 
   Also in this package is the 21st Amendment Enforcement Act, which allows for State attorneys general to enforce their State alcohol control laws in Federal court, including laws prohibiting sales to minors, which strengthens the grant of authority to States under the 21st amendment to the Constitution; and the Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act, which authorizes the payment of foreign seized assets to American victims of international terrorism. 
   The last step to adopting this legislative package in Congress rests with the Senate today. 
   Before I continue describing this urgently needed legislation, I would like to take a few moments to thank some key people who have brought us to this point today. Some of them are in the Galleries as I speak. They are people of heart, courage, and intelligence whose advocacy made a way for this bill--whose dedication pried open the doors and let the light shine into this darkness. 
   Among them is Senator WELLSTONE who started this work long before I came on board. He and his wife, most notably, 3 years ago started advocating on this particular issue. I know he stands firmly and strongly today as one of the principal advocates to set this aside, and he brought this forward and seeks to go forward from here to help those who are victims of these crimes. 
   I also thank Congressmen CHRIS SMITH and SAM GEJDENSON. I would also like to thank Gary Haugen of the International Justice Mission and Dr. Laura Lederter of the Protect Project at Johns Hopkins University. Dr. Laura Lederter of the Protect Project at Johns Hopkins University is the foremost authority in the country on tracking from where and to where these victims are trafficked. 
   I have up here one of the maps she introduced of women who have been trafficked out of Russia and Ukraine with the fall of the Soviet Union. With the increased travel out of there to freedom, we have seen a huge amount of trafficking also taking place. These are the routes out of Russia and Ukraine and where they go--to Canada, to the United States, to Mexico, to Europe, to Africa and Asia, to Australia and New Zealand. This is the work of her project. 
   I also want to thank Michael Horowitz of the Hudson Institute, and Gloria Steinem, whom I am not noted to thank, is part of this coalition; 
   Chuck Colson, Jessica Neuworth, William Bennett, the National Association of Evangelicals, the Southern Baptist Convention, among others I'm sure I'm forgetting. I would also like to thank the staff for both the Senate and House, including Joseph Rees, David Abramowitz, Charlotte Oldham-Moore, Jill Hickson, Mark Lagon, and my staff Karen Knutson and Sharon Payt. Thank you all. We are here today at final passage because of all your efforts. 
   This legislation is our best opportunity to challenge the largest manifestation of slavery worldwide, known as ``trafficking.'' This practice of trafficking involves the coercive transportation of persons into slavery-like conditions, primarily involving forced prostitution, among other forms of slavery-like conditions. 
   Trafficking is the new slavery of the world. These victims are routinely forced against their will into the sex trade, transported across international borders, and left defenseless in a foreign country. This bill also addresses the insidious practice known as ``debt bondage,'' wherein a person can be enslaved to the money lender for an entire lifetime because of a $50 debt  taken by the family for an emergency. This is a common practice in countries throughout the South Asian region. 
   People of conscience have fought against the different manifestations of slavery for centuries. This anti-slavery legislation is in the tradition of William Wilberforce and Amy Carmichael of England, who were ardent abolitionists against different forms of slavery. Amy Carmichael was a British missionary to India at the turn of last century, in the early 1900's. Upon arrival, she was mortified to discover the routine practice of forced temple prostitution. This was and continues to be a practice wherein young girls, from age six onward, are dedicated to the local temple, and are then forced into prostitution against their will to generate income. Upon this morbid discovery, Amy Carmichael began to physically steal the young girls away from this incredibly degrading form of slavery, hiding the girls to escape the inevitable backlash of violence. Eventually, the government outlawed this practice of forced temple prostitution, as a result of her efforts. However, it bears noting that this terrible practice continues today, in a lesser degree, in rural villages throughout South Asia, including India. 
   This bill challenges the myriad forms of slavery including sex trafficking, temple prostitution, and debt bondage, among other forms. 
   This new phenomenon of sex trafficking is growing exponentially. Some report that it is, at least, $7 billion per year illicit trade, exceeded only by the international drug and arms trade. Its victims are enslaved into a devastating brutality against their will, with no hope for release or justice, while its perpetrators build criminal empires on this suffering with impunity. Our legislation will begin to challenge these injustices. 
   This is the new slavery of the world, Dr. Kevin Bales of the University of Surrey in England recently testified for us before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He astutely observed that the new slavery has a peculiar quality which does not look like the old forms associated with lifetime bondage as a chattel slave, but it is slavery nonetheless. 
   Sex trafficking is among the most common forms of the new slavery and typically entails shorter periods of bondage, usually asking for 5 to 6 years, or whenever something like AIDS or tuberculosis is contracted, after which the victim is thrown out on the street, broken, without community or resources, left to die. I have met with people caught in that condition. 
   Women and children are routinely forced against their will. Sex traffickers favor girls aging in the range of 10 to 13. 
   I have a number of other things I could say, but my time is limited. I know a number of people want to speak on this bill. I ask to reserve the remainder of my time. I will turn the floor over to Senator WELLSTONE. 
   I ask unanimous consent on any quorum calls that might be called during the discussion of this conference report, that time be allotted and assessed against all allocated time to speak under the bill, including myself and Senator WELLSTONE, along with Senator BIDEN, Senator HATCH, and Senator LEAHY, who have all been allocated time. I ask the quorum calls be equally divided between those who have time under the bill.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. I am happy to respond to the Senator from Minnesota. 
   This was raised in conference committee under thorough discussion about this new standard of ``extreme hardship involving unusual and severe harm.'' There was a fear on the part of some conferees that some judicial interpretations over the term ``extreme hardship'' might be too expansive; specifically, the conferees objected to an interpretation that the applicant could prove ``extreme hardship'' by showing he or she would miss American baseball after being deported from the United States. So this language should be interpreted as a higher standard than some of these expansive interpretations of ``extreme hardship.'' 
   At the same time, however, this language should not exclude bona fide victims who would suffer genuine and serious harm if they were deported. There is no requirement that the harm be physical harm. I repeat, there is no requirement that the harm be physical harm or that it be caused by the trafficking itself. 
   The harm or the hardship does not have to be caused by the trafficking itself. The purpose of inserting the phrase ``unusual and severe'' is to require a showing that something more than the inconvenience and dislocation that any alien would suffer upon removal might occur. 
   I wish to make it clear in future interpretations of this act, while this is higher than extreme hardship, it doesn't require physical harm; it doesn't require the harm be associated with the trafficking, to be able to allow an American to qualify under this new definition within the act. 
   I thank my colleague from Minnesota for allowing me the opportunity to clarify this particular issue.

If others of my colleagues desire to speak on this bill, I urge them to come to the floor and speak now or forever hold their peace on this particular piece of legislation. 
   The item I wish to speak on now is Aimee's law. This is a part of this overall conference report that has passed the House, as I mentioned, by 371-1. Aimee's law was prompted by the tragic death of a college senior, Aimee Willard, who was from Brookhaven, PA, near Philadelphia. Arthur Bomar is a convicted murderer who was earlier paroled from a Nevada prison. Even after he had assaulted a woman in prison, Nevada released him early. Bomar traveled to Pennsylvania where he found Aimee. He kidnapped, brutally raped, and murdered Aimee. He was prosecuted a second time for murder for this terrible crime in Delaware County, PA. 
   Aimee's mother, Gail Willard, has become a tireless advocate for victims' rights and serves as an inspiration on this particular piece of legislation. 
   This important legislation would use Federal crime-fighting funds to create an incentive for States to adopt stricter sentencing laws by holding States financially accountable for the tragic consequences of an early release which results in a violent crime being perpetrated on the citizens of another State. Specifically, Aimee's law will redirect Federal crime-fighting dollars from a State which has released early a murderer, rapist, child molester, to pay the prosecutorial and incarceration costs incurred by a State which has had to reconvict this released felon for a similar type of crime. 
   More than 14,000 murders, rapes, and sexual assaults on children are committed each year by felons who have been released after serving a sentence for one of these very same crimes. 
   Convicted murderers, rapists, and child molesters who are released from prisons and cross State lines are responsible for sexual assaults on more than 1,200 people annually, including 935 children, including Aimee Willard. 
   The reason I point this out is because Aimee's law previously passed this body by a vote of 81-17. As I mentioned, it redirects Federal crime funds from a State that has released early a murderer, rapist, or child molester, to pay the prosecutorial and incarceration costs incurred by a State which has had to reconvict this felon for a similar crime. 
   The formula for early release is if the criminal served less than 85 percent of his original sentence, and if a State kept a criminal in prison less time than the national average for a sentence of the same crime. 
   To counter concerns raised by the National Governors' Association, this does not federalize any crimes. I emphasize that, it does not federalize any crimes. It simply upholds State standards regarding murder, rape, and child molestation. 
   Sex offenders have one of the highest recidivism rates of any crime, thus, requiring more stringent standards in amount of the sentence served. 
   This only affects Federal crime funds which are transferred from State 1 to State 2 where a crime has been committed of a similar type by the criminal who was released early from State 1. 
   The reason I go through this at some length is because some of my colleagues have a concern about this. I understand there will be a point of order raised against this as being part of the overall package. There will be a vote on that point of order. 
   If people want to get this bill dealing with sex trafficking, the Violence Against Women Act, the international terrorism aspect of this bill, the Internet alcohol enforcement of this bill through, they need to vote against those who seek to strip this particular provision out of the bill because if they strip this provision out, the bill has to go back to the House for it to be voted on, and it will have to be voted on again in the Senate. 
   We do not have the time to do it. It will kill the bill. If people vote to strip this provision out of this particular bill and send it back to the House, and it has to come back here, it will kill the bill. We do not have time to do that. 
   While some raise federalism arguments, most of our colleagues have already voted in favor of Aimee's law; 81 have voted in favor of it already. There are some arguable federalism principles involved. I think most of those have been worked out with the National Governors' Association. There is a strong advocacy group that has worked to get these standards where, if a person has been convicted in one State, they should serve their time rather than being released to commit a similar crime in another State. That is the direction of this. 
   I plead with my colleagues: Do not remove this provision. Do not support the point of order because, if you do, it is going to kill everything. It will kill the sex trafficking bill. It will kill the Violence Against Women Act. Do not do it. Most people have already supported this particular provision, Aimee's law. 
   I wish to say a couple of things on other issues before we break for the policy luncheons. I particularly appreciate my 
   colleagues, Senator LAUTENBERG and Senator MACK, for their provisions on the Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act. I understand Senator HATCH will speak later about the 21st Amendment Enforcement Act on VAWA. We have had an excellent discussion this morning on the importance of this legislation protecting women who are subject to domestic violence. This is reauthorization of important language and important legislation and strengthening of it as well. That is an important feature. 
   I appreciate Senate majority leader TRENT LOTT bringing this issue to the floor. It is a good package of protection for both domestic and international women and children subject to violence. That is the theme that runs through this set of acts. It is protection for women, protection for children, protection domestically, and protection internationally. 
   I am very pleased with this legislation. It is a key piece of legislation to pass during this session of Congress to provide that level of protection. I am glad it has been done on a bipartisan basis. Mostly my colleagues from the other side of the aisle have spoken this morning supporting this legislation. Support is similarly strong on our side  of the aisle. It is good to have that support back and forth. 
   Rather than using up the rest of my time, I simply say to my colleagues who want to speak, please come to the floor. I anticipate we will be voting on this legislation by the middle of the afternoon. We will be recessing for policy luncheons from 12:30 p.m. until I believe 2:15 p.m., which is the normal recess time. 
   This will be a good time for people to comment on this important legislation. I plead with them: Do not strike this particular provision, Aimee's law, because it will sink the entire bill. It is a good bill. It is good legislation. It previously passed both Houses overwhelmingly. Let's get it done. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time, and I yield the floor.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I yield myself 3 minutes. I want to recognize the leadership of my colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator SANTORUM, in this provision. This is something he fought for to put in this overall package, to keep in this overall package, and it was something when we started down this road, frankly, I was saying I want a little, clean, simple bill to deal with sex trafficking. And several Members on the House side, and Senator SANTORUM on this side, fought to put this in. 
   The more I studied this, the consistency of the flow was there with this. This is dealing with trying to protect people who have been subject to domestic crimes, domestic violence, to protect people who have been subject to trafficking and protect people who have been subject to, frankly, early release and high recidivism offenders in other States, such as what happened, unfortunately, in his State in the case of Aimee Willard. 
   I applaud my colleague's work. I note one other thing. Other colleagues look at this and raise questions about does this really fit within the overall package, and one can make their decision one way or the other. But the point is, if this is pulled out, the bill has to go back to the House. We don't have time, so it effectively kills the bill. The House has already voted 371-1 for this package. It is a package and if this gets pulled out, it has to go back to the House. The House is going out on Friday for a funeral of one of its Members. Tomorrow, it has its calendar set up. It kills the bill, so everything else gets killed as well, regardless of what the arguments are. I plead with colleagues and say let's look at this and go ahead and support the entire package and not support the motion to strike the Aimee's law provision.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I note that we are planning on a vote at 4:30. Senator THOMPSON has the time reserved from 3:30 to 4:30. I note for my colleagues that if anybody wishes to speak on this particular bill, Senator THOMPSON has an entire hour reserved. Under the unanimous consent order, we immediately go to both votes--the vote on the appeal of the ruling of the Chair for Senator THOMPSON, and immediately we will go to a vote on final passage of the conference report. 
   If anybody seeks to speak on this bill, they should do so at the present time because otherwise it will be allocated to Senator THOMPSON. 
   I will use a couple of minutes of my time at this point. I note that within the bill there is the Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act that has been spoken of by Senator LAUTENBERG and Senator MACK, which seeks justice for victims of terrorism that is taking place. That is in the bill. I think it is an important part of the legislation. I hope we will have some discussion taking place on that as well.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I note the hour of 3:30 approaches. Senator THOMPSON has a lot of time. 
   If we are able to pass this legislation today, we still have a hurdle left to go. This is a major victory for women and children subject to violence here and abroad. This is a major piece of legislation for us to be able to pass through this body. It is late in the session. We are already past the time scheduled for adjournment. To be able to get this legislation passed at this time is a significant accomplishment. The Senator from Delaware pushed aggressively and hard on VAWA, as a number of people did on other items. 
   This is a good day, a great day for the Senate to stand up and do some of the best work we can to protect those who are the least protected in our society, to speak out for those who are the least protected here and around the world. 
   This is a great day for this country, and it is a great day for this body. 
   I am pleased we are wrapping up this portion of the debate. I think we have had a good discussion. We will have the vote on the appealing of the point of order by the Chair. I plead with my colleagues, with all due respect to my colleague from Tennessee, to vote against my colleague from Tennessee so we can proceed to pass this important legislation. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, rather than not using the time, I thought it wise to go ahead and use this time to visit about this important vote that will be taking place. There may be some people who are just now focusing on what is happening. 
   We have a base bill with sex trafficking. The Violence Against Women Act is the base of the bill, and it is put together in an overall piece of legislation with the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, Aimee's law, Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act, and the 21st Amendment Enforcement Act. This is the combined bill soon to be voted on. 
   A point of order has been raised and ruled against by the Chair, and we will be voting on appealing the ruling of the Chair. I hope my colleagues will vote in favor of the Chair and we will go to the final bill for a vote. To vote against the Chair and subtract Aimee's law, sends the bill back to the House, and we don't have time to get this done. 
   This is an important day for women and children subject to violence, both domestically and abroad. It is an important day that this body is going to follow the House and put in place needed protections for people, women and children, subject to this violence, both domestically and abroad. 
   It is an important day for those who have worked as advocacy groups and defenders of the defenseless, including people trafficked across international borders, with their papers burned and told: You owe. 
   This is important also for women in abusive relationships, physically abusive, who need help. 
   This addresses both of those issues. I think it is important this body, in the waning days of this session, go out with a strong statement that we are there with you; we are supporting those who are victimized in these situations, domestically and abroad. We are speaking out for those who, in many cases, have no voice. 
   I can still see the girls I met in Nepal who were trafficked at 11 and 12 years of age, coming back to their home country and to their villages, 16, 17 years of age, in terrible condition, having been subjected to sex trafficking, beaten by brothel owners, in some cases locked up at night, raped repeatedly, and told, ``You have to work this off; I own you,'' and then released to go home when they contract horrible diseases. 
   In not all cases that works that way, but in too many cases it does work that way. 
   This body is speaking today. We are speaking on behalf of those who are so defenseless in these particular types of situations. 
   I want to recognize some people who have been particularly helpful on this. Senator LEAHY has worked very hard with us on this, through many of the issues he has had on this. Senator WELLSTONE and I have worked on the trafficking. Senator BIDEN and Senator HATCH have worked on the Violence Against Women Act. This has been a true bipartisan and bicameral effort. CHRIS SMITH and SAM GEJDENSON in the House, Republican and Democrat, have worked with us to get this through. Chairman HYDE of the Judiciary Committee in the House has worked to get this on through. My staff, Karen Knudsen and Sharon Payt, have worked very hard. The outside advocacy groups range from Gloria Steinem to Chuck Colson in support of this legislation, saying this is something we need to speak out about; this is something we need to do. 
   I want to recognize the leader, TRENT LOTT. In these waning hours of the session, there are about 150 different bills that want to get to the floor. Senator LOTT has said this one is coming to the floor. Not only did he say it is coming to the floor, he gave us all day on October 11 to be able to carry this on through and get this through. This is precious time. It could have been spent and was being pushed to be spent on a number of different issues. Instead, Senator LOTT said, no; we will go ahead and let this issue come forward. We will take the whole day debating it. People can be heard on this particular issue. Then we will have two votes at the end of the day. 
   That is a great statement on his part in support of women and children who are subject to these horrifying conditions, both domestically and abroad. I applaud his effort and his leadership and his work getting this done. 
   I just came from a press conference with Senator SANTORUM on Aimee's law, an important piece of legislation concerning what happened to Aimee Willard, an act perpetrated by a person was released early from prison in Nevada and went to Pennsylvania. She was an all-American lacrosse player at George Mason University. She was traveling, her car was taken over by this guy who had been previously convicted and released early out of a Nevada prison, then he takes her, kidnaps her, rapes her, and murders her. 
   This is legislation that does not federalize crimes, but it encourages States to step up and say: If a person is convicted of one of these crimes, keep him in for at least 85 percent of what he was sentenced for; or if they go to another State and commit this recidivism crime, then the State that has to prosecute and incarcerate this person, the criminal who did this, they can get part of the Federal moneys from the State that let the person go free early. 
   I think it is a sensible approach to try pushing this on forward. It is a good piece of legislation. It is something that deserves passage. Here in these waning hours of this session, I would just say I am very pleased to be a part of this body that would stand up  and speak out and step forward on important legislation like this for the defenseless, for the voiceless, for those who are in harm's way. I applaud that. I hope my colleagues will vote as the House did, overwhelmingly, for this legislation. It passed in the House 371-1. 
   If I can encourage you any more, I say pull out a picture from your billfold, pull out a picture of a child or grandchild. Those are the ages, somewhere between 9 and 15, who are the most frequently trafficked victims. Young ages. Aimee Willard was a young age--not quite that young. But you get young ages of people who are subjected to this. We are stepping up and doing something on their behalf. 
   Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for the time I have been able to use for this. I urge the President to sign this legislation when it gets to his desk. I am hopeful he will. I do not know of any reason he would not sign this legislation. This will be a major accomplishment of this Congress that is going to be completed at this time. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the athletes from Kansas who participated in the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia. Each of these athletes contributed in his or her own way to the success of the American Team. It is my pleasure to recognize the following athletes from Kansas for their efforts in the Olympic Games: Maurice Greene, Nathan Leeper, Passion Richardson, Christie Ambrosi, Sarah Noriega, Tara Nott, and Melvin Douglas. 
   Each of these athletes deserves to be commended on their perseverance and dedication to their respective sports. The devotion of these athletes has been rewarded with the opportunity to represent the United States as Olympic Athletes. Not only have these athletes represented America, but they have also made the citizens of their home State of Kansas proud. 
   The spirit of these athletes is encouraging and is to be applauded. America's team could not have finished on top without the help of these special Kansans. Every four years the world comes together in this ultimate show of athleticism. These Kansan athletes will be forever a part of this honorable tradition. It gives me great pleasure to recognize the accomplishments of these athletes. 
   Maurice Greene maintained his role as the fastest man on Earth by winning the Men's 100 meter race. He also helped the 4x100 relay team run their way to another gold medal for the American Team. 
   Nathan Leeper rose to high aspirations in the high jump competition. After leaving the sport for a short time, Nathan made the ultimate comeback as a member of this Olympic Team.  
   Passion Richardson helped the women's 4x100m Relay team run their way out of the rounds into the finals. this competition was Passion's Olympic debut and her participation in this event is the epitome of teamwork and dedication. 
   Christie Ambrosi helped the women's softball team grab the gold medal for America. Her hard work as an outfielder and strong hitting skills brought the team home with gold medals along with their gloves. 
   As a member of the Women's volleyball team, Sarah Noriega rose beyond the expectations. Sarah helped launch the team into the medal round, proving that the team has a great future ahead. 
   Tara Nott made Olympic history as the first woman to go home with gold from a Women's Olympic Weightlifting competition. Christie had no problem carrying her gold medal home to Kansas. 
   Melvin Douglas is no stranger to the Olympic games, as the Sydney competition as his second Olympic appearance. His perseverance in the sport has proven that great athletes can come at any age. 
   Again, Mr. President, I congratulate these Kansas Athletes on their outstanding accomplishments. All of these athletes have made Kansas and United States of America very proud.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague from Wyoming allowing me to speak on a topic that we will be taking up fully tomorrow. Tomorrow this body will take up the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000. That will be the business of the day. Tomorrow we will vote on two bills associated therewith. The development of this legislation has been in progress for most of this year, and there are several pieces in this bill. 
   What I will do today is discuss with my colleagues what is in this bill, why it is important, why it passed the House of Representatives 371-1, and why it is important that we address this important issue at this particular time. 
   Senator WELLSTONE and I have been working on this legislation for this past year. It is the companion piece to a bill that passed in the House, sponsored by CHRIS SMITH and SAM GEJDENSON. The House bill is known as the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000. 
   Our antitrafficking bill is the first complete legislation to address the growing practice of international trafficking worldwide. This is one of the largest manifestations of modern-day slavery internationally. Notably, this legislation is the most significant human rights bill of the 106th Congress if it is passed tomorrow as is expected. This is also the largest anti-slavery bill the United States has adopted, arguably, since 1865 and the demise of slavery at the end of the Civil War. Therefore, I greatly anticipate this vote tomorrow in the Senate on this very important legislation. 
   Senator WELLSTONE's and my trafficking bill, which passed in the Senate on July 27 of this year, was conferenced to reconcile the differences with the House bill. The conference report was filed on October 5, Thursday of last week. The final conference package contains four additional pieces of legislation which are substantially appropriate to our bill. 
   Most significant among those bill amendments is the Violence Against Women Act, which is part of this overall conference report--it is known as VAWA--which provides relief and assistance to those who suffer domestic violence in America. It is an important part of the package. It is a key piece of legislation that this body has previously passed. I am glad that it is part of this package. And it will pass as well with this overall package so we can help people caught in domestic violence. 
   Thus, the overall four bills included in this conference report are: The sex trafficking bill that I mentioned at the outset; VAWA, the Violence Against Women Act; Aimee's law, which provides for interstate compensation for the costs of the incarceration of early-released sex offenders who commit another sex crime in a second State. The 21st Amendment Enforcement Act is also in this overall conference report. It allows for State attorneys general to enforce their State alcohol control laws in Federal court, including laws prohibiting sales to minors, which strengthens the grant of authority to States under the 21st amendment to the Constitution. The final piece of legislation 
   in this conference report is the Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act, which authorizes the payment of foreign seized assets to victims of international terrorism. 
   The last step to adopting this legislative package rests with the Senate tomorrow. As I stated previously, it cleared the House on Friday by a vote of 371-1. 
   This legislation is our best opportunity to challenge the largest manifestation of current slavery worldwide, known as trafficking. I want to describe that term and what this bill does to get at what is taking place in the form of trafficking. 
   This practice of trafficking involves the coercive transportation of persons into slavery-like conditions, primarily involving forced prostitution, among other forms of slavery-like conditions. 
   Trafficking is the new slavery of the world. These victims are routinely forced against their will into the sex trade, transported across international borders, and left defenseless in a foreign country. 
   This bill also addresses the insidious practice known as ``debt bondage,'' wherein a person can be enslaved to the money lender for an entire lifetime because of a $50 debt taken by the family  for an emergency. This is a common practice in countries such as India and Nepal, among other places throughout the South Asian region. 
   People of conscience have fought against the different manifestations of slavery for centuries. 
   I might note that my State came into the Union under the fight of whether or not it would be a free or slave State in the 1860s. That was the big fight. In my State, we had bleeding Kansans, where they were referred to as those who were pro-slavery and those who were abolitionists. 
   The freedom forces fought guerrilla warfare to determine whether the State would be slave or free. The first election was actually stolen by the slave-State proponents, and there was a constitution they put forward that would allow slavery in Kansas. The free-State forces overtook them. They had a free election. The free-State ballot was elected and won. Kansas came in as a free State--probably one of the decisive events in setting off the Civil War--because then the balance of power in Washington shifted. 
   Under the Kansas-Nebraska Act, Nebraska was thought to come in as a free State, Kansas as a slave State, and Washington's balance of power would be maintained. When the abolitionists moved out of the Northeast to Kansas to settle, and to make sure it would be a free State, that tipped the balance of power and clearly led, according to historians, to the start of the Civil War. That is the history of my State. It is a noble one of fighting for freedom. 
   This anti-slavery legislation is in the tradition of William Wilberforce and Amy Carmichael of England, who were ardent abolitionists against slavery in the 19th and 20th centuries. Amy Carmichael was a British missionary to India at the turn of the last century and in the early 1900s. Upon arriving in that country, she was mortified to discover the routine practice of forced temple prostitution taking place. This was and continues to be a practice where young girls, from age 6 onward, are dedicated to the local temple, and are then forced into prostitution against their will to generate income. 
   Upon this morbid discovery, Amy Carmichael began to physically steal the young girls away from this incredibly 
   degrading form of slavery. She would then hide the girls so they would escape the inevitable backlash of violence against these little girls. Eventually, the government outlawed this practice of forced temple prostitution as a result of Amy Carmichael's efforts. However, it bears noting that this terrible practice continues today in some rural villages throughout South Asia. 
   This bill challenges the myriad forms of slavery, including sex trafficking, temple prostitution, and debt bondage, among other forms. 
   This new phenomenon of sex trafficking, unfortunately, is growing exponentially. Some report that it is, at least, a $7 billion-per-year illicit trade, exceeded only by the international drug and arms trade in the illegal category. 
   Its victims are enslaved into a devastating brutality against their will, with no hope for relief or justice, while its perpetrators build criminal empires on this suffering with impunity. Our legislation will begin to challenge these injustices. 
   This is the new slavery of the world. As hard as it is to believe, women and children are routinely forced against their will into the sex trade internationally. They are usually transported across international borders so as to ``shake'' local authorities, leaving the victims defenseless in a foreign country, virtually held hostage in a strange land. The favored girls are in the age range of 10 to 13 years old. 
   I hope some people here can look at their own children or grandchildren and ask how this could possibly happen to somebody so young. 
   This bill is the first complete legislation to address this practice known as sex slavery, which has risen dramatically in the past two decades. It has risen dramatically with the increase of child pornography, sex tours in Eastern Asia, and the general popularizing of the sex industry worldwide. This mass trafficking of women and children, which includes both girls and boys, has been compared to some of the slave trade practices in the 18th and 19th centuries. 
   Professor Laura Lederer of Johns Hopkins University has identified the trafficking routes internationally. I want to put some of these routes up on a chart so my colleagues will be able to see where she has tracked these routes to take place. 
   You can see on the chart the trafficking routes from Russia and the Newly Independent States to other places around the world. We actually had a lady in the Foreign Relations Committee who testified she had been trafficked out of the Ukraine into Israel. 
   You can see all these routes being described going into Canada, into the United States, into Mexico, into Europe, and into other places in South Asia, into Australia and into South Africa. 
   These are the trafficking routes on which Professor Lederer has worked. She has studied this for nearly 10 years, describing and trying to put a finger on where these routes go. 
   This chart shows trafficking routes going into the United States. By our own Government estimates, about 50,000 girls are trafficked into the United States annually by this sex trafficking, this sex prostitution business. These are the routes shown here on this chart, with 50,000 girls per year trafficked into the United States. According to the State Department estimates, these are the routes coming in from Asia, 
   the ports of entry they come in to the United States. Here on this chart is shown the routes coming from Central America and South America. 
   Shown here on this chart are the routes coming in from Europe and Africa and the ports of entry where they have been trafficked. Again, Dr. Lederer's Protection Project work showcases the same. Here is where they are coming from. 
   It is of note to say, as well, that by our Government estimates this is a growing practice. It is growing more because organized crime is getting more and more into it. We heard testimony in committee that organized crime is actually favoring going into this over drugs because they can sell their product more than one time. And in some places where they traffic in prostitution it is not illegal. So they are going into it in a nonillegal category, where it is a legal business. The category of sex trafficking is growing rapidly. 
   Other routes that have been discussed with us in committee include girls sold or abducted from Nepal into India. Nepalese girls are prized because of their beauty and their inability to defend themselves given the situations out of which they are coming. 
   In Eastern Asia, most abductees are innocent tribal girls from isolated mountain regions; they are forced into sexual service, primarily into Thailand and Malaysia. 
   I met with some of these Nepalese girls as they had returned, being taken back from the brothels of India. I met with them in January of this year in Katmandu. It was despicable to see these girls, many of them taken at 11, 12 years of age, coming back 16, 17 years old, two-thirds of them having AIDS and/or tuberculosis. It is a deplorable situation. 
   This is how the traffickers obtain their unsuspecting victims. Fraud is commonly used by traffickers against villagers in underdeveloped areas. Typically the buyer promises the parents that he or she is taking their young daughters to the city to become a nanny or domestic servant, giving the parents a few hundred dollars as a down payment for the future money she will earn for the family. Then the girl is transported across international borders, deposited in a brothel and forced into the trade, until she is no longer useful, having contracted some disease. She is held against her will on the false premise that she must work off her debt which was paid for the cost of her transportation, which typically takes several years. In fact, in India it is common for indentured laborers generally, not even sex workers, simply manual labor, to work 10 years or more to pay off a $50 debt. 
   The use of force to obtain the victim is common in the cities, where a girl is physically abducted, beaten, and held against her will, sometimes in chains. I have talked with these girls myself, as they appeared in two hearings that Senator WELLSTONE and I held before  the Foreign Relations Committee. Some of them came in disguise because they feared the retribution their families might suffer back home, for reason of their testimony in exposing the slave trade mafia. That is how insidious and widespread this practice is. 
   Existing laws internationally fail to make clear distinctions between victims of sexual trafficking and the perpetrators. Also, the victims frequently do not have legal immigrations status in the countries into which they are trafficked, and the victims are punished even more harshly than the traffickers. 
   Our legislation establishes an entirely different approach of punishing the perpetrators but not the victims. Our legislation also facilitates important and baldly needed advocacy to raise awareness regarding sexual trafficking throughout the world. 
   Additional legislative measures include: 
   Providing new criminal punishment with enhanced sentences for persons convicted of operating such slavery enterprises in the U.S., as present criminal statutes are inadequate to obtain sentences commensurate with this new form of sex trafficking and slavery; 
   Establing a reporting and advocacy mechanism at the State Department which would monitor efforts taken by foreign countries to criminalize, punish and combat international sex trafficking within their borders; and 
   Assistance for victims in the U.S., including authorization of grants to shelters and rehabitation programs. 
   The legislation further includes the creation of a new form of visa for trafficking victims. This will substantially allow for more aggressive prosecution, as well as the protection of these witness victims. 
   It enhances cooperation and assistance with law enforcement agencies in foreign countries for the investigation and prosecution of international sexual trafficking, as well as promoting assistance in drafting and implementation of legislation. 
   And it promotes the creation of worldwide awareness programs to alert unsuspecting, potential victims of this practice. 
   Senator WELLSTONE and I believe this is the first sex trafficking legislation to pass around the world. We are hopeful it will become a model for other countries to deal with this pernicious, insidious practice that is part of the dark side of the new globalization of the economy. 
   I support the expansion of the economy. The globalization taking place can be a very positive thing, such as what is taking place today with the signing of permanent normal trade relations with China by the President that this body passed. But we also have to recognize that there are dark aspects of globalization; this being one of them. We need to deal with that as well. 
   Trafficking victims are the new enslaved of the world. Until recently, they had virtually no advocates, no defenders, no avenues for escape, except death, to release them from their obscene circumstances. This is changing rapidly, and a new human rights movement is forming on behalf of these victims and against the trafficking networks. 
   This growing movement runs from right to left, from William Bennett and Chuck Colson to Gloria Steinem; all are involved in supporting this legislation. Our legislation is part of that movement, providing numerous protections and tools to empower these brutalized people towards re-capturing their dignity and obtaining justice. 
   Trafficking has risen dramatically in the last 10 to 15 years with experts speculating that it could exceed the drug trade in revenues in the next few decades. It is sadly observed that drugs are sold once, while a woman or child can be sold 20 and even 30 times a day. This dramatic increase is attributed also to the popularizing of the sex industry worldwide, including the increase of child pornography and sex tours in Eastern Asia that I previously mentioned.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I want to speak for a few minutes on a conference report, a bill we have been working on all year, including a couple of other provisions that have now been added. We are ready to move forward with it. That is what the vote will address tomorrow. 
   I have put forward this bill on sex trafficking with Senator WELLSTONE. He and I don't get together on too many bills, so when we do, it is a bit noteworthy. We come from different perspectives, different viewpoints. I think we both have good hearts but our heads take us in different directions. But on this subject of stopping sex trafficking, we don't disagree. We have worked together all year to get this bill through which challenges this practice known as sex trafficking. 
   Throughout the world, globalization has a dark side. We are seeing increasing numbers of young women, even girls, being trafficked from poorer countries to richer countries into the prostitution business. They have been tricked, forced, coerced and defrauded into working as prostitutes against their will. There are about 700,000 women and girls, according to our Government's estimates, being moved each year from poorer countries to richer countries into the prostitution business. Our Government estimates that approximately 50,000 women and children are trafficked annually into the United States, primarily from Asia and Central America. 
   This is clearly a terrible practice. Many of these are young girls who are tricked and deceived into forced prostitution believe they are going to a different country for another purpose. For example, those trafficked to the United States are promised a job as a dish washer, or a factory worker. Something that pays better than the job opportunities available in their own, typically poorer, countries. However, once the victims get here, there is no decent job waiting for them. Instead, the trafficker will take their papers and passport so that they have no legal identification. Then they are given false papers, if any. This begins to prepare them for their new life of forced prostitution, making it very difficult to track down and rescue the young woman or girl who has been trapped. There is a point very early in this process where the trafficker says something like the following to his victim, ``You are mine and you will do what I say. You will work in this brothel as a prostitute and you have no choice.'' At this point, she had become a slave in one of the most degrading fashions imaginable. 
   Senator WELLSTONE and I heard testimony to this effect. We have had two hearings in the Foreign Relations Committee on this subject of trafficking. At both hearings, we had victims testify to such experiences. At one hearing, we had three women who had been trafficked--all had been tricked into traveling to another country believing a good job was waiting on the other side, and once they got there, they were forced into prostitution. This is what they were subjected to. One young woman said that once she was moved into the United States, she was subjected to 30 clients a day, six days a week. If she refused, she was beaten without mercy. It is a dark, dark business. 
   In January of this year I was in Nepal. I met with a number of girls who had returned from India, where they were forced to work in the brothels in Bombay. These were young girls, frequently from villages, not particularly knowledgeable in the ways of the world. They were young and very innocent when the trafficker had 
   taken them away. The trafficker had told one girl's parents, ``I can get her a job in a rug factory in Bombay.'' The family was poor, they needed income, and they believed him. So they agreed, and gave their daughter away to the trader who forced her into prostitution against her will. And she had no choice. 
   I met girls who had been trafficked at age 11, 12, and 13. The girls I saw in Nepal, in Katmandu, had returned from this devastating life. Some had escaped by running away, though many cannot since they are in chains or are locked away. Others were thrown out by the brothel because they had contracted AIDS or TB. When they returned at the age of 16, 17, or 18, two-thirds of them had AIDS and were waiting to die, having no proper medicine. 
   As I stood there with the woman who runs this place of restoration for these young women, she pointed around the room whispering: She is dying, she is dying, she is dying. These were girls of 17 years old, 16 years old, or younger. They were people who had had their youth stolen from them, were deceived or forced into this practice, and then, finally, received a death sentence of AIDS. I saw that. I talked with these survivors of trafficking. Once you see that, you know you have to try to help to stop this. This is wrong, and this terrible practice is increasing. It is happening to 700,000 women and children, girls, each year worldwide.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I stand in support of the American Competitiveness in the Twenty-First Century Act (S. 2045) which I have co-sponsored with Senators ORRIN HATCH and SPENCER ABRAHAM. This legislation would increase the number of H-1B visas for skilled labor available to U.S. employers from 115,000 to 195,000 slots, starting next fiscal year, among other measures. 
   This is direly needed legislation. Alarmingly, this year's allotment of H-1B visas ran out very early this year, in March. As a result, hundreds of thousands of highly skilled positions have gone unfilled throughout America. 
   America is currently riding a very high wave of record economic growth, unmatched in our generation. With that expansion, the number of available jobs which have gone unfilled has increased dramatically. Unfortunately, we have begun to place a cap on this extraordinary economic expansion by limiting the pool of skilled laborers that companies can draw upon by the present limited visa allotment. 
   The hardest hit sector is the computer industry. This industry functions in six months cycles, with new products being developed and marketed within this short period of time. The computer industry suffers a severe lack of qualified information technicians. Less workers means a longer development period which means a loss of competitive edge. This ultimately results in a loss of market, business and jobs. In this scenario, everyone loses, including the economy, American consumers, companies and workers. 
   To avoid this wasteful and unnecessary result, we must adopt this legislation and expand the visa slots so that American companies can continue to grow. This is an urgent problem which cannot wait until next year. If we fail to pass this legislation, we could significantly jeopardize our notable competitive edge in a fierce global market.  
   Some falsely charge that this legislation gives away our most lucrative jobs, while skipping over American workers. This is not true. Clearly, American 
   employers would rather select American workers first over foreign guest workers who must be processed through a burdensome immigration bureaucracy involving significant time delays and complications. This visa process is costly and cumbersome for employers, and can easily be avoided by hiring American workers. However, American businesses cannot fill these positions with only American workers anymore and are forced to search overseas for badly needed talent. Our economy has expanded that significantly and these workers are needed that badly. 
   If we do not allow American-based businesses to meet this skilled labor need, some may move their operations to other countries which will gladly accommodate them. Why would we encourage this unfortunate result when we can attain just the opposite, that of attracting new and vibrant businesses, by expanding our labor pool? 
   In addition to the new visa allotments, this legislation creates 20,000 new college scholarships to train American workers in greater numbers. This encourages more degrees among Americans in math, computer science, and engineering--all areas of expertise presently suffering a shortage. Thus, this bill addresses both present and future worker needs. 
   On October 1st the new fiscal year began, and the Immigration and Naturalization Service estimates that we will use up the entire allotment of H-1B visas before the end of this December. In other words, the H-1B visa allotment will be used up in three months. That leaves the balance of nine months of no additional visas for desperate American computer companies, among other businesses, which will suffer this serious lack of workers. 
   That's bad business and bad politics, which can be corrected with this bill. Americans continue to dream bigger and create greater innovations, generating an unmatched prosperity which we should encourage, not discourage. That's why we should support the American Competitiveness in the Twenty-First Century Act of 2000.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I join my colleague from Alabama in noting that what the President is doing on SPR, in my view, is a diversion. It is not solving the fundamental problem we have with the energy supply in this country--either the refining capacity that has been limited, as the Senator from Alaska, Mr. MURKOWSKI, has spoken of, or the supply of the raw resource, about which the Senator from Alaska and others have spoken. We need to be able to get access to that, and this administration has stopped that from taking place. They stopped it from taking place on our shores and stopped an expansion of biomass, biofuels, and ethanol production. They have not been supportive of expansion there as well. They stopped expansion in places such as in Central Asia, in which I have done a fair amount of work. There are large reserves of hydrocarbons and oil and gas there. They have done nothing to bring this on-line. Yet countries in that region of the world--many of which most people haven't heard of--have, I believe, the third largest pool of hydrocarbons in the world. They are seeking ways to get it out to the West in an oil and gas pipeline. This administration hasn't done anything to get that started. 
   So here we are today with high fuel prices, with no end in sight. Despite the President's diversion by using SPR and the misuse of this program--the way it was set up at least, the fundamental problem remains. We have to deal with the supply issue, and this administration hasn't done that. I applaud my colleague from Alabama for addressing that issue.

The administration, each step along the way, has continued to thwart, stall, and say things that were positive but with no action. That is what I have seen taking place in pushing for marginal well tax credits for  small oil well production such as we have in Kansas. We need to encourage this domestic production. Let's have a tax credit for these marginal oil wells that produce less than 10 barrels a day. You get positive comments from the administration, but then nothing happens. On biofuels or Central Asia, there is enormous capacity in that region for oil and gas. Yes, this takes place, but what are you going to do to cause this to happen? What is your strategy? Nothing is put forward. 
   Here we are with high gas prices and high heating oil. My parents burn propane to heat their home. They are paying a 
   significant premium price now. All of these things are taking place, and then their answer is to tap this 1 1/2 day supply, instead of dealing with fundamentals which they have failed to do over a period of time. So we have been warned. I hope we can press the administration, and I hope this is something to which people pay attention.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to address something about which the occupant of the chair has a great deal of concern. A bill was introduced recently by Senator GRASSLEY from Iowa. I support his bill, the Packers and Stockyards Enforcement Improvement Act of 2000. I think this is a commonsense approach to a very difficult agricultural antitrust concern taking place. I applaud Senator GRASSLEY's approach and endorse his Stockyards Enforcement Act of 2000. 
   Concerns about concentration and market monopolization have risen in recent years, with the remaining low prices that farmers have received and the struggle that we have had to adopt and adapt to the globalized commerce that we see taking place. 
   I was visiting yesterday with my dad, who farms full time in Kansas, and my brother who farms with him, about concerns regarding the concentration and the low prices taking place and what is happening around them. 
   What Senator GRASSLEY has done is request a GAO study, and he found that the USDA has not adequately put forward efforts of enforcement in the packers and stockyards field, and that needs to take place. He is taking the GAO study and putting it into legislative language. I believe it would be prudent and wise for this Congress to pass that language. 
   Senator GRASSLEY's bill spells out specific reforms that will make a direct difference in the way antitrust issues and anticompetitive practices are dealt with. Specifically, the bill will require USDA to formulate and improve investigation and case methods for competition-related allegations in consultation with the Department of Justice and the Federal 
   Trade Commission; integrate attorney and economist teams, with attorney input from the very beginning of an investigation, rather than merely signing off at the end of the inquiry. 
   It turns out that the GAO study reports that the economists are looking at the cases early on but the attorneys are not. The attorneys need to be involved at the very outset. By the nature of these charges, they are legal issues and should be looked at by attorneys at the very outset. It would establish specific training programs for attorneys and investigators involved in antitrust investigations. It would require a report to Congress on the state of the market and concerns about anticompetitive practices. 
   Senator GRASSLEY, today, chaired a hearing that further illuminated the problems, needs, and solutions. 
   Senator GRASSLEY's bill comes after a thorough examination of USDA's enforcement of the Packer's and Stockyards Act by the GAO. That report, released last week, found numerous problems in the way the agency approaches these investigations. I have to say, as somebody whose family is directly involved in farming, who has been secretary of agriculture for the State of Kansas, it troubles me when the Department is having difficulties enforcing this very important area of the law. 
   This bill simply puts into law these GAO recommendations for USDA reform. This bill is necessary because USDA has been struggling to address many of these concerns raised by the GAO in terms of antitrust enforcement over the past 3 years. This issue has been raised in the Kansas State Legislature this last session with a great deal of concern about really who is watching. Are they properly prepared and adequately staffed to look into these antitrust investigations and allegations? This bill gets reforms done within a year and ensures that the law is being enforced. 
   Today's agricultural markets are in tough shape. Prices are too low. We cannot, however, make assumptions about concentration as the cause without having accurate information and thorough investigations. Under Senator GRASSLEY's bill, this process will be greatly improved because it requires USDA to retool and devote more resources to the area of antitrust enforcement. 
   This bill avoids the pitfalls of lumping the innocent in with the guilty and instead sorts out anticompetitive practices where they occur. These reforms are necessary to restore producer confidence in the Packers and Stockyards Act and USDA's ability to police this increasingly concentrated industry. 
   Again, I thank Senator GRASSLEY for his wise approach on this tough issue and his continued sincere concern for the farmers of this Nation. This has been an excellent effort to move forward by Senator GRASSLEY.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today in support of H.R. 4444, the U.S.-China Relations Act of 2000. This bill is the most significant foreign policy-related legislation that we have debated during the 106th Congress. 
   H.R. 4444 presents tremendous new export opportunities for our manufacturers, farmers, and service providers. While China has had excellent access to the U.S. market for 20 years, U.S. access to China's enormous market has been limited. With the enactment of this legislation, and China's accession to the WTO, that situation is about to change. 
   The United States is finally going to enjoy virtually unfettered access to China's vast market. The impact on my State of Kansas will be substantial. China agreed to end corn export subsidies, increase import quotas for wheat and corn, and reduce soybean tariffs. China agreed to lower its tariff on beef from 45 to 12 percent and on pork from 20 to 12 percent. China agreed to accept USDA safety certification for meat and pork exports. 
   And agriculture is not the only sector in my State that will benefit from China's accession to the WTO. Black & Veatch will see lower tariffs on imported equipment, which will reduce the contract cost of projects won in China. Boeing will have a more stable economic environment in which to sell airplanes to China's airlines. 
   Granting Permanent Normal Trade Relations status to China will increase our exports to the world's most populous country. But, more importantly, bringing China into the WTO will put the PRC on a collision course with economic and political liberalization. 
   Mr. President, China has been ruled by the Communist Party with an iron grip for more than 50 years. But WTO accession comes with a price. WTO accession will usher the forces of globalization into China in a very permanent way. Globalization will be good for China's economy because it will integrate China's economy into the world's economy. Globalization will also force the systemic reform of China's inefficient state-owned enterprises and banking system. 
   But globalization will also have a much more profound effect on China. Globalization will force upon China the infrastructure necessary for greater political liberalization. Globalization will require China to have a stronger adherence to the rule of law and property rights. Globalization will create a stronger middle class in China that will demand greater freedom with which to enjoy their new position. Globalization will bring the internet into tens of millions of Chinese homes, exposing the Chinese people to Western standards of political and religious freedom, and human rights. 
   I ardently believe that PNTR and human rights must go hand in hand. It is important to note that my positive position on PNTR gives me a door to 
   walk through to raise a number of human rights issues with the Chinese Government, including religious liberty and the development of the rule of law. 
   Somehow, an intellectual myth has been adopted, dictating only two ways to deal with China. Either grant PNTR status but never raise these issues, which gives an unfortunate, unbridled affirmation regarding known abuses. Or the second method which mandates  a complete isolation from any relationship other than that of repeatedly dunning this government with ill will and no positive incentives. Such vitriol does not work with people and it does not work with governments, and ultimately, nothing changes for those who suffer. 
   I propose a third way which calls for a relationship where we genuinely raise these issues in a serious, sustained dialogue. I do, in fact, raise these issues continuously. This way, will in the end, get religious prisoners free, and create an independent judiciary not ruled by Communist dogma, and give China pause the next time another Tiananmen Square breaks out. Ultimately, this way engenders freedom and human rights better than either of those other two methods. After all, isn't that what this is all about? 
   One final note: I hope that the Chinese Government does not think that the tabling of the Thompson amendment is the end of the proliferation debate in the Senate. China must stop engaging in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The Clinton administration has failed miserably to curb such proliferation. That is why there has been support to legislate antiproliferation policy in the absence of an executive proliferation policy. 
   Mr. President, China must stop making weapons of mass destruction available to rogue nations around the world. We need to open up trade with China to increase our exports and to increase the exposure of the Chinese people to economic and political liberalization. But trade must not come at the expense of national security. Ignoring China's proliferation activities while we increase our trade ties with China would be a grave mistake. We must be vigilant and enforce current U.S. law as it pertains to proliferation. The Clinton administration's failure to do so has jeopardized national security. Congress must not permit future administrations to make the same mistake. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Alabama, Senator SESSIONS, for his role in this matter. As a former attorney general, he brought up some excellent points about what these do when you put a child and a video game in a first person shooter role and you reward them for mass killings. You give them points. Particularly at the end, some of these games give a reward which is a particularly grisly killing scene. He pointed out that when you train children in this type of situation, this is harmful to them psychologically, and it is something to which we should be limiting their access. 
   He also brought a lot of personal insight from his background as an attorney general, and that was really helpful. I hope we are going to be able to draw more attention to parents in the country about these products because it has a harmful effect. 
   Some of our military actually buy the same products and train our military personnel on the video games. They use it as a simulator. They do it as a way of trying to get people to  react and also to get them up on what is called their ``kill ratio.'' In World Wars I and II, we had problems with soldiers who would not shoot to kill because it was not a natural reaction. They would tend to shoot around. So they had to figure out how to get that ratio up in the military. The problem is when you do that with a child in an unsupervised game--the same game being used by military personnel as a simulator of combat conditions--that can be very harmful. 
   We found out yesterday at the hearing that it is not only rated for a mature audience, it is not supposed to be used by a child. The industry itself rates it ``mature,'' but they market it to the child. They are target marketing it to children, according to a Federal Trade Commission study. 
   I will speak about the Federal Trade Commission report that was aired in the Commerce Committee yesterday on marketing of violent entertainment products to our children. I want to talk about what that report brought forward, what we saw at the hearing yesterday, and some conclusion and things I think we can move forward on in dealing with this problem. 
   At the outset, I recognize the work of one of my staff members, Cherie Harder, who has done outstanding work in the time she has been with me in the Senate in raising the visibility of this issue. 
   It has been said that every good idea goes through three stages: First, it is ridiculed; second, it is bitterly opposed; last, it is accepted as obvious. 
   Over the past 2 years, I have chaired three hearings in the Commerce Committee on the effectiveness of labels and ratings, the impact of violent entertainment products on children. The first hearing on whether violent products are being marketed to our children happened about a month after the Columbine killings took place in Colorado. When we started out in these hearings, these ideas I put forward were ridiculed, bitterly opposed shortly afterwards; but now, in reviewing the FTC report, the fact that harmful, violent entertainment is being marketed to kids is now being accepted as clear and obvious. 
   We have come a long way. This is an important Federal Trade Commission report. When I introduced the legislation last year to authorize the FTC report, which was cosponsored by several of my colleagues, I did so because of overwhelming anecdotal evidence that violent adult-rated entertainment was being marketed to children by the entertainment industry. It has been said that much of modern research is corroboration of the obvious by obscure methods. This study corroborates what many of us have long suspected, and it does so unambiguously and conclusively. It shows, as Chairman Pitofsky of the FTC noted, that the marketing is ``pervasive and aggressive.'' 
   It shows that entertainment companies are literally making a killing off of marketing violence to kids. The problem is not one industry. It can be found in virtually every form of entertainment--music, movies, video games. Together they take up the majority of a child's leisure hours. The message they get and the images they see often glamorize brutality and trivialize cruelty. 
   Take, for example, popular music. The FTC report notes that 100 percent of sticker music--that is music that has been rated by the industry rating board itself as not appropriate for the audience under the age of 18. The survey by the FTC was of the entertainment industry target-marketing to kids. This is both troubling and fairly predictable--troubling in that the lyrics you see that we previously discussed are target-marketed to young kids--mostly young boys--whose characters, attitudes, assumptions, and values are still being formed and vulnerable to being warped, and predictable in that there are few fans for such music who are over the age of 20. 
   Movies are equally blatantly marketed to kids, and they are appalling in their content. Movies have great power because stories have great power; they can move us; they can change our minds, our hearts, and even our hopes. 
   The movie industry wields enormous influence. When used responsibly, their work can edify, uplift, and inspire us. But all too often that power is used to exploit. 
   I have seen some movies that are basically 2-hour long commercials for the misuse of guns. 
   The movie industry has the gall to target-market teen slasher movies to child audiences and then insist that the R ratings somehow protect the movie industry. From reading the FTC report, it seems clear that the ratings protect the industry from the consumers rather than the consumers from the industry. 
   Take video games. When kids play violent video games, they do not merely witness slaughter; they engage in virtual murder. Indeed, the point of what are called the first-person shooter games--that is virtually all of the M-rated games, sticker games that the industry itself says are inappropriate for an under-age-18 audience--the object is to kill as many characters as possible. The higher the body count, the higher your score. Often bonus points are given for finishing off your enemy in a particularly grisly way. Common sense should tell us positively that reinforcing sadistic behavior is a bad idea, and that in itself cannot be good for children. 
   We cannot expect that the hours spent in school will mold and instruct the child's mind but that hours spent immersed in violent entertainment will not. We cannot expect that if we raise our children on violence, they are going to somehow love peace. This is not only common sense, it is a public health concern. 
   In late July, I convened a Public Health Summit on Entertainment Violence. At the summit, we released a joint statement signed by some of the most prominent associations in the public health community. These are some of them: The American Medical Association; the American Academy of Pediatricians; the American Psychological Association; the Academy of Family Physicians; the American Psychiatric Association, and the Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychologists. All of them signed the same document. I will only read a portion of that document to you. This portion of it 
   reads this way: 
   ``Well over 1,000 studies point overwhelmingly to a causal connection''--not correlation, causal connection--``between media violence and aggressive behavior in some children. The conclusion of the public health community based on over 30 years of research is that viewing entertainment violence can lead to increases in aggressive attitudes, values, and behavior, particularly in children.'' 
   There is no longer a question as to whether disclosing children to violent entertainment is a public health risk. It is just as surely as tobacco or alcohol. 
   The question is, What are we going to do about it? What does it take for the entertainment industry and its licensees and retailers to stop exposing children to poison? 
   There is an additional element that this generally excellent FTC study fails to cover. That is the cross-marketing of violence to kids. 
   There is ample proof that the entertainment industry not only directly targets children with advertising and other forms of promotion but also markets to them via toys and products that the entertainment industry itself rates as inappropriate for children. 
   Walk into any toy store in America and you will find dolls, action figures, hand-held games, Halloween costumes based on characters in R-rated movies, musicians noted for their violent lyrics, and M-rated video games. Maybe I am particularly sensitive to this because I have five children. But I know this is accurate. 
   There is an equally egregious aspect of marketing violence to children and cross-marketing of violent products to kids--one that has not yet adequately been investigated. We need to do so. I look forward to working with the FTC to ensure that this is done as well. 
   Another media step we need to take is to ensure that these industries enter into a code of conduct. 
   Consumers and parents need to know what their standards are for these industries; how high they aim; or how low they will go. 
   I have introduced legislation--S. 2127--that would provide a very limited antitrust exemption that would enable but not require entertainment companies to enter into a voluntary code of conduct--have them set a floor, a base below which they won't go to get products out to children.  
   We had a very telling exchange yesterday in committee. We had two executives from the movie industry and two from the video game industry. I asked them several times, Is there any word, is there any image so grisly, so bad, is there any example so horrible that you wouldn't put it in music or into a video game? Is there anything, any word, any image? We have some music that is very hateful toward women and harmful. Is there anything that you wouldn't include, that you could say here today you wouldn't put in music or in a video game? They wouldn't state anything that they wouldn't put in--nothing at all. 
   We need them to set an industry code of conduct where they would set the standard below which they wouldn't go because many of them are saying if you don't do it, somebody else will. They will chase it. These billion-dollar industries think they don't have to go this low. But why not engage them in setting a 
   voluntary code of conduct? They need to do so, and we need to pass this legislation to allow them to do it. 
   There are other steps we should consider, but a rush to legislate is not one of them. Frankly, imposing 6-month deadlines on an industry that is actively fleecing money is unlikely to bring about lasting reform such as that suggested by the Vice President. We need to encourage responsibility and self-regulation. We need a greater cooperation from the corporations regarding their view of what they can do to help our children morally, physically, and emotionally--for the well-being of our children rather than harming them. This FTC report is an important step in that direction because although it concentrates on the tip of the iceberg, it does shed light on the magnitude of the problem that we have with the entertainment industry. It shows kids are being exploited for profit and exposes a cultural externality in this market. 
   Ultimately, we asked the entertainment executives to come in front of the Commerce Committee yesterday--and in 2 weeks the movie industry--to work with us and to appeal to their sense of corporate responsibility and citizenship. Our appeal is this: Please just do the right thing. Stop marketing violence to our kids. If you believe a product is inappropriate for somebody under the age of 18, then don't target-market to that child that same product that you yourselves rate inappropriate for a child under the age of 18. Just stop it. Just do not do it. 
   If the industry persists, the FTC has stated that they are going to do an investigation into whether or not some members of the industry who are doing this are liable to charges of false and deceptive advertising of these products. 
   As I mentioned, a code of conduct would be an appropriate step forward for the industry to take. 
   Yesterday, we discussed the music industry making widely acceptable and available to parents the lyrics that are in the music because, right now, those are not readily accessible or available to parents. But ultimately, we all protect the first amendment, and nobody is for censorship. I state that again. Nobody is for censorship. But we need to appeal to this industry to just do the right thing and stop target-marketing their products to our children. It is just wrong, and they need to stop it.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, Senator MCCAIN and I are bringing this bill forward. I think the majority leader has proposed 2 hours of debate. I am willing to do that at any time, any place. We would do it now here on the floor, but we can go to the middle of the night if people would like to. This has cleared the Commerce Committee; 14-2 was the vote when this cleared through. 
   There is a hue and cry across the country. Virtually every college in America has asked for this legislation because they are having problems on their college campuses dealing with betting on their athletes. This is affecting the moral values. It is giving a black eye to our college campuses. There is one place in the country that this goes on legally. It is in Nevada. It is a loophole that has been there, and it is time for us to deal with it. We only need 2 hours to deal with it. I think we can take care of this within the timeframe that is left. I applaud the leader and hope we can get to this yet during this session.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I would like to clarify an additional provision of the legislation. It is my understanding that Section 60117(b)(3) is aimed at penalizing pipeline companies that either refuse to turn over records, reports, or information concerning an incident that is identified in a written request from the Secretary or refuse to produce the records, reports or information in a timely fashion. While it is critically important to ensure that companies actively aid the agency's investigative process by promptly providing information related to an incident, there may be situations where a company goes to great lengths to cooperate with an investigation, but for a variety of reasons falls short of fully satisfying the requirements of Section 60117(b)(3). For example, the information solicited in a written request may be unclear or otherwise subject to multiple interpretations. A company may promptly provide the information that it believes to be fully responsive to the request only to find out later that the information is somehow deficient either because it is incomplete, in a different form, or of a different character than that contemplated by the agency. In these situations, despite the best of intentions, a company may find out many days or weeks later that it is nonetheless subject to cumulative daily civil penalties. I am seeking clarification that Section 60117(b)(3) is intended only to cover those situations where the information that the Secretary seeks is clear, but the company refuses to provide the information at all or within the time prescribed in the written request--not situations where a company makes a good faith effort to meet the requirement but is deemed to have failed because of a written request for information this is subject to interpretation or ambiguously written.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, as the father of five children--two of whom came into our family through international adoption--I take special interest in the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption. The treaty signers hope to improve the international adoption system and provide more homes for the children who need them. 
   Like many active adoption professionals and leaders of the American adoption community, I support the mission of the treaty to protect the rights of, and prevent abuses against, children, birth families, and adoptive parents, involved in adoptions. The treaty will not only reassure countries who send their children outside their borders, it will also improve the ability of the United States to assist its citizens who seek to adopt children from abroad. 
   While the treaty will provide significant benefits, I had serious concerns that the proposed method of implementation would have caused more harm than good. After study, it became clear to me that there are few nonprofit private entities in existence that have the funding, staff, and experience necessary to develop and administer standards for entities (agencies) providing child welfare services. Small community based agencies especially would have found it costly and burdensome to deal with only one or possibly two large and most likely distant accrediting entities. For the season, I have repeatedly expressed concerns that many states, especially rural and sparsely populated areas, risk being left with no adoption agencies authorized to help their residents with foreign adoptions. 
   As I have stated before, I believe it is important for each state to regulate adoption agencies as it deems appropriate to meet the widely varying needs of its families with the resources available in that state. Working closely with the sponsors of this bill, I proposed an amendment that allows public entities (other than a Federal entity), including an agency or instrumentality of State government having responsibility for licensing adoption agencies, to serve as an accrediting entity. (In other words, a state government may serve as an accrediting entity). 
   In this way, States may continue to participate in intercountry adoption--making sure that interested parties meet the Hague requirements. Giving states the option to continue to participate in intercountry adoption would ensure that small and medium sized agencies have at least one accrediting entity choice that is local, familiar, and easily accessible. 
   In addition, in order to further lessen the initial burden of federal accreditation on small and medium sized agencies, I worked with the sponsors of this bill to minimally increase the temporary registration period for small and medium sized agencies. Thus, they would have more time to prepare for federal accreditation--a process that may prove to be costly and burdensome  but is considered necessary by many in the adoption community. 
   My initial concerns regarding certain provisions of the implementing legislation stemmed from a number of areas including my own experience of having recently adopted two children from other countries, and contact with numerous other families who would either love to adopt a child, but can't afford it, or who have adopted a child under the present system and had great success. 
   Like many Americans, I am firmly committed to finding permanent, safe, and loving homes for children who have been orphaned or are in foster care. I am hopeful this legislation will help secure that dream without adding a significant overlay of federal bureaucracy and red tape. 
   At this time, I would like to recognize and thank one of my staff members, Amanda Adkins, for help on this legislation. Amanda was truly diligent in her efforts to make this a better bill and to work for the needs of rural Kansans. I thank her for her dedication. 
   Many families spend their entire life savings to realize their dream of having a child. I look forward to continuing to work with the sponsors of this bill as we monitor the implementation of this important treaty.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I recognize my colleague from Minnesota today, for legislation that he and I have been working on together has passed this body. It previously passed the House, and now will go to conference. It is The Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000. It is a bill--one of the first perhaps in the world--to address the growing ugly practice of sex trafficking where people are traded into human bondage--again, into the sex and prostitution business around the world. It is an ugly practice that is growing. More organized crime is getting into it. It is one of the darker sides of globalization that is taking place in the world. 
   It is estimated that the size of this business is $7 billion annually, only surpassed by that of the illegal arms trade on an illegal basis. If those numbers aren't stark enough, the numbers of the individuals involved is stark enough. 
   Our intelligence community estimates that up to 700,000 women and children--primarily young girls--are trafficked, generally from poorer countries to richer countries each year, and sold into bondage; raped, held against their will, locked up, and food withheld from them until they submit to this sex trade. That is taking place in our world in the year 2000. Our intelligence community estimates that 50,000 are trafficked into the United States into this ugly traffic. 
   I had a personal experience with this earlier this year. In January, I traveled to Nepal and met with a number of girls who had been trafficked and then returned. They had been tricked to leave their villages. Many of them were told at the ages of 11, 12, or 13: Come with us. We are going to get you a job as a housekeeper, or making rugs, or some other thing in Bombay, India, that will be much better than what you are doing now. 
   Their families don't have the wherewithal to pay their livelihood. Their families are poor as can be. They are not able to feed them, and the families say: Go ahead. 
   They then take them across the border. They take their papers from them. They force them into brothels in Bombay or Calcutta or somewhere else and force them into this trade. 
   Some of these girls make their way back at the age of 16 or 17 years of age. Two-thirds of them now carry AIDS and/or tuberculosis. Most of them come home to die. 
   It is one of the ugliest, darkest things I have seen around the world. 
   The Senate took the step today to start to deal with this practice that is occurring around the world, and that is occurring in the United States. 
   My colleague, Senator WELLSTONE, and I worked this legislation together to be able to get it moved through this body. 
   I am so thankful to him and other people who have worked greatly on this legislation to get it passed. 
   I particularly want to recognize, on my staff, Sharon Payt, who has leaned in for a long time to be able to get this done. 
   This is the new, modern form of slavery. 
   Trafficking victims are the new enslaved of the world. Until lately, they have had no advocates, no defenders, no avenues of escape, except death, to release them from the hellish types of circumstances and conditions they have been trafficked into. 
   This is changing rapidly--a new movement of awareness is forming to wrench freedom for the victims and combat trafficking networks. This growing movement runs from `right' to `left,' from Chuck Colson to Gloria Steinem, and from SAM BROWNBACK to PAUL WELLSTONE. Our legislation, which passed today, is part of that movement, providing numerous protections and tools to empower these brutalized people toward re-capturing their dignity and obtaining justice, and getting their lives back. 
   Trafficking has risen dramatically in the last 10 to 15 years with experts speculating that it could exceed the drug trade in revenues in the next few decades. It is coldly observed that drugs are sold once, while a woman or child can be sold 20 and even 30 times a day. This dramatic increase is attributed also to the popularizing of the sex industry worldwide, including the increase of child pornography, and sex tours in Eastern Asia. As the world's dark appetite for these practices grows, so do the number of victims in this evil manifestation of global trade. 
   The victims are usually transported across international borders so as to `shake' local authorities, leaving them defenseless in a foreign country, virtually held hostage in a strange land. Perpetrating further vulnerability, often they are ``traded'' routinely among brothels in different cities. 
   This deliberate ploy robs them of assistance from family, friends, and authorities. 
   The favorite age for girls in some countries is around 13 years of age. I have a 14-year-old daughter and it almost makes me cry to think of somebody being taken out of the home at that age and submitted and subjected and forced into this type of situation. Thirteen is the favorite age. There is a demand particularly for virgins because of the fear of AIDS. Now, imagine, your daughter, your sister, your granddaughter in that hellish condition. 
   International trafficking routes are very specific and include the Eastern European states, particularly Russia and the Ukraine, into Central Europe and Israel. Other routes include girls sold or abducted from Nepal to India--the Nepalese girls are prized because they are beautiful, illiterate, extremely poor with no defenders, and compliant, making it easy to keep them in bondage. In Eastern Asia, most abductees are simple tribal girls from isolated mountain regions who are forced into sexual service, primarily in Thailand and Malaysia. These are only a few of the countless but repeatedly traveled routes. 
   One of two methods, fraud or force, is used to obtain victims. Force is often used in the cities wherein, for example, the victim is physically abducted and held against her will, sometimes in chains, and usually brutalized through repeated rape and beatings. Regarding fraudulent procurement, typically the ``buyer'' promises the parents that he is taking their daughter away to become a nanny or domestic servant, giving the parents a few hundred dollars as a ``down payment'' for the future money she will earn for the family. Then the girl is transported across international borders, deposited in a brothel and forced into the trade until she is no longer useful having contracted AIDS. She is held against her will under the rationale that she must ``work off'' her debt which was paid to the parents, which usually takes several years, if she remains alive that long.

    Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, today, I rise to recognize The Call D.C., a group of young people who will gather in Washington, D.C. September 2, 2000 to strengthen and renew their commitment to God, their families and their local communities. 
   The Call D.C. is a non-denominational gathering of youth and their parents, youth leaders, pastors, and Church leaders who are unified in their steadfast commitment to strengthening their faith in God and their concern for their local communities and our nation. 
   I have long been greatly concerned about the state of our culture, and the state of our society. Young people today are barraged with images of violence, hate, and vulgarity that pour forth from our airwaves and our entertainment. The challenges young people face seem to grow more difficult, and more pervasive. Where once we, as a society, felt free to affirm faith in God, and adherence to high standards, such beliefs are now often called into question. 
   It is thus even more exciting to see many young people, such as these young people, who are willing to lead by example and focus their efforts on steadily improving their families, communities and our nation. These young people, who represent communities and religions from around our nation, will come together on September 2 and use their assembly as a time to pray for strengthen their faith in God, their commitment to their families through reconciling with their parents, and nurturing their walk with God. 
   These young people remind us of our solemn duty not just as parents, teachers, business leaders or public servants but as citizens of this great nation--``a nation under God .....,'' I commend them for reminding us that we must first focus on God and he will strengthen us and enable us to build up our families, our local communities and our nation. I applaud all the participants of the Call D.C. and thank them for their work and their commitment and their heart for God.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the International Carbon Sequestration Incentive Act. I am joined by Senators DASCHLE, DEWINE, BOB KERREY, GRASSLEY and BYRD. 
   Environmental issues have traditionally been filled with controversy--pitting beneficial environmental measures against hard-working small business and state interests. It is unfortunate that the atmosphere surrounding environmental debate is filled with accusations of blame rather than basic problem-solving. 
   From listening to the public discourse concerning environmental issues, one would thing there is no other choice but to handicap our booming economy in order to have a clean environment, despite the fact that pollution is often, unfortunately, an unavoidable consequence of meeting public needs. 
   Mr. President, I stand here today to illustrate that there is a better way to deal with important environmental concerns. There is a way to encourage the best rather than expecting the worst. There is a way to create environmental incentives and environmental markets, rather than only environmental regulations. There is a way to chip away at environmental challenges, rather than demagoging an ``all or nothing'' stance. 
   This bill--the International Carbon Sequestration Incentive Act, takes a pro-active, incentive-driven approach to one of the most difficult environmental issues of our time--global climate change. 
   Specifically, this bill provides investment tax credits for groups who invest in international carbon sequestration projects--including investments which prevent rainforest destruction and projects which reforest abandoned native forest areas. These projects will reduce the amount of carbon dioxide emitted into the air--helping to offset climate change since carbon dioxide is one of the main greenhouse gases. 
   This bill achieves these environmental benefits by promoting carbon sequestration--the process of converting carbon dioxide in the atmosphere into carbon which is stored in plants, trees and soils. 
   Under this bill, eligible projects can receive funding at a rate of $2.50 per verified ton of carbon stored or sequestered--up to 50% of the total project cost. The minimum length of these projects is 30 years and the Implementing Panel can only approve $200 million in tax credits each year. 
   Why do this? Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas believed to contribute to global warming. While there is debate over the role in which human activity plays in speeding up the warming process, there is broad consensus that there are increased carbon levels in the atmosphere today. 
   Until now, the only real approach seriously considered to address climate change was an international treaty which calls for emission limits on carbon dioxide--which would mean limiting the amount that comes from your car, your business and your farm. This treaty--the Kyoto treaty, also favored exempting developing nations from emission limits--putting the U.S. economy at a distinct disadvantage. Approaching the issue of climate change in this fashion would be very costly and would not respond to the global nature of this problem. 
   Instead, my approach encourages offsetting greenhouse gases through improved land management and conservation--and by engaging developing nations rather than cutting them out of the process. 
   In addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, sponsored projects under this bill will also help to preserve the irreplaceable biodiversity that flourishes in the Earth's tropical rain forests and other sensitive eco-systems. In addition to diverse plant life, these projects will be protecting countless endangered and rare species. 
   This bill requires investors to work closely with foreign governments, non-governmental organizations and indigenous peoples to find the capital necessary to set aside some of the last great resources of the planet. Rain forests have been called the lungs of the Earth--helping to filter out pollution and provide sanctuary for numerous pharmaceutical finds which may one day cure many of our human diseases. 
   This bill rewards the partnership and pro-active vision of companies that want to be part of the solution to climate change. We are lucky in the fact that private industry is already looking at this issue and working to find a way to contribute. An example of what this bill would promote can be seen by looking at the Noel Kempff Mercado National Park in Bolivia. 
   As you can see by looking at these photos [DISPLAY FOREST SCENES], Noel Kempff is a beautiful, biodiverse part of the world. This park spans nearly 4 million acres in Bolivia, hosts several hundred species of rare and endangered wildlife--including 130 species of mammals, 620 species of birds and 70 species of reptiles--not to mention 110 different species of orchids and grasses.  
   This park was in direct danger of deforestation. The land would have been cleared and eventually turned into large commercial farming operations. The loss of this park would have led to carbon dioxide emissions of between 25-36 million tons as well as increased commercial agricultural competition. 
   Instead, the Bolivian government came together with The Nature Conservancy, American Electric Power and other investors to preserve the park and conduct extensive verification of the carbon being stored in trees and soils of the now protected area. 
   Companies like American Electric Power, BP Amoco and PacifiCorp want to invest in projects like Noel Kempff because they want to promote the role of carbon sequestration as a means to combat climate change. These companies have taken a big step in contributing to the solution--think how much more good they, and other companies, could do if there were incentives to encourage this activity. 
   In the U.S., we are lucky enough to have programs like the Conservation Reserve Program and federal parks--which help preserve some of the natural resources of this great nation. Unfortunately, developing countries do not have access to the kind of capital it takes to make similar investments in their own countries. It is therefore, a worthy investment in the world environment--since climate change is a global problem, to chip away at this problem by doing what we know helps reduce pollution and greenhouse gases: planting and preserving trees. 
   This bill is designed to encourage more participation in projects like the Noel Kempff Park. By using limited and very targeted tax credits, we have an opportunity as a nation--to take a leadership role on climate change without crushing our own economy. This bill also furthers the goal of including developing countries in the climate change issue--since any agreement to reduce greenhouse gases must ultimately include these areas which will become the largest emitters. 
   Mr. President, I do not pretend that this bill will resolve the climate change issue. That is not my intent. Rather, this bill takes the view that where we do agree that good can be achieved--we should move forward. It is my hope that this bill will contribute to the solution on climate change and help to re-shape the way we view environmental problems.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. As recently as this morning, upon Chairman Arafat's arrival back in Gaza, Arafat said:  
   There is an agreement between us and the Israeli government made in Sharm-El-Sheikh that we continue negotiations until Sept. 13th, the date for declaring our independent state, with Jerusalem as its capital, whether people like it or not.  
   By itself, the threat undermines confidence in the Palestinians' commitment to the peace process and, in effect, would abrogate the foundation of the Oslo accords that all outstanding final status issues will be resolved through negotiations. 
   Allow me, for a moment, to review the history here. More than 50 years ago, the United Nations created two states: Israel and Palestine. The creation of a homeland for the Jews in Israel was unacceptable to the Arabs, and five Arab states attacked the newly created state. When all was said and done, Israel was a reality, and the nominal Palestine ended up in the hands of Jordan. We never heard about Jerusalem then. 
   In fact, when the PLO was created in 1964, Jerusalem was never even mentioned. 
   When Jordan lost the West Bank and Jerusalem in 1967, then the question of Palestine and Jerusalem became important once again. In fact, we are told that the reason Yasser Arafat walked out of Camp David was because he did not get all of east Jerusalem and the Old City. In other words, when Arafat did not get through the peace process what he could not get through war, he decided to walk away from peace. 
   One thing has become clear to me in the last few years. The Oslo agreement was nothing less than an admission on the part of the Palestinians and the PLO that Israel would never be defeated in war. The Palestinians entered into a peace process because they had no other choice. Now I am forced to question just how committed they are to that process. If the aim is to win through negotiations what they could not through war, then what kind of a process is it? 
   There are no ambiguities here: Either the Palestinians are committed to the process, and to a negotiated outcome, or they are not. Arafat's threat to declare a Palestinians state on September 13, 2000 is an abrogation of the peace process, and as such, an abrogation of any understanding with the United States regarding the PLO and Mr. Arafat as negotiating partners. 
   U.S. assistance to the Palestinians is predicated upon good faith negotiations in a peace process. Nothing else. Nothing. For those that have some doubt, I remind them that as far as U.S. law is concerned, the Palestine Liberation Organization is a terrorist organization. 
   I and many of my colleagues have always stood ready to accept the outcome of a negotiated peace between Israel and the Palestinians. We have done so reluctantly, because of fears about what a Palestinian state would do, how it would survive, about the commitment to democracy, and real fears about terrorism. 
   We will not stand idly by and accept a non-negotiated solution, contrary to the Oslo Accords, contrary to the spirit of a peace process. Should Mr. Arafat go forward and declare a Palestinian state, the bill that Senator SCHUMER and I are offering today will preclude the expenditure of funds to recognize that state and preclude further assistance to any Palestinian governing entity. It instructs the President to use the voice and vote of the United States in the United Nations bodies to stop recognition or admission of a Palestinian state. 
   I hope Chairman Arafat chooses the path of peace. However, if he does not, this legislation makes very clear that the relationship between the U.S. government and the Palestine leadership will change. 
   We will not recognize the unilaterally declared Palestinian state and we will strongly urge all others not to do so. Either there is peace through a process or there can be no peace. If that is what Yasser Arafat wants, it is a terrible crime against the Palestinians, and a mistake that history will not forget.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I want to make a few remarks on an issue very important to our young student athletes, as well as our colleges and universities. It is a piece of legislation that, if the appropriations continue to be held up on the other side of the aisle, I think we should consider. We should go to this piece of legislation. 
   The legislation is the Amateur Sports Integrity Act, which was passed out of the Commerce Committee by a 16-2 vote. There was strong bipartisan support for the legislation and introduction of the bill. Senator LEAHY and I introduced the bill. Basically, the legislation closes the one loophole on college gambling. 
   Presently, you cannot gamble legally in this country on college athletics. You can't bet on the Road to the Final Four, the NCAA basketball tournament, football and bowl games--except in one State in the country, and that is Nevada. That is what has led to a number of problems we have had of expanded sports gambling on amateur athletics and expanded cases where student athletes have fallen to the whims of people promising them some help if they will shave a point or two off the game. So we are trying to close that one loophole in Nevada so it is clear that it is illegal to bet on college sports in the United States. 
   This bipartisan legislation is in direct response to a recommendation made by the National Gambling Impact Study Commission, which last year concluded a 2-year study on the impact of legalized gambling on our country. The recommendation called for a ban on all legalized gambling on amateur sports and is supported by the NCAA, coaches, teachers, athletic directors, commissioners, university presidents, school principals, and family groups from across the country. Those groups are all strongly supportive of this legislation. 
   In my home State, Roy Williams, the basketball coach at the University of Kansas, considered taking the job at North Carolina but decided against it--happily, in my opinion. He is a strong proponent of this legislation. These are the people supporting this who know about the threat of gambling on amateur athletics. These are the people who are fighting the problem on the front lines 24 hours a day. These groups support our legislation which will prohibit all legalized gambling on high  school and college sports, as well as the Summer and Winter Olympic Games. 
   The Nation's college and university system is one of our greatest assets. We offer the world the model for postsecondary education. But sports gambling has become a black eye on too many colleges and universities. 
   Gambling on the outcome of sporting events tarnishes the integrity of sports and diminishes the esteem in which we and the rest of the world hold U.S. postsecondary institutions. This amendment would deal with that problem. It would remove the ambiguity that surrounds gambling on college sports and make it clearly illegal in all 50 States in the United States. 
   We should not gamble with the integrity of our colleges or 
   the future of our college athletes. Our young athletes deserve legal protection from the seedy influences of the gambling, and fans deserve to know that athletic competitions are honest and fair. 
   Gambling scandals involving student athletes have become all too common over the past 10 years. In fact, there have been more gambling scandals in our colleges and universities in the 1990s than in every other decade before it combined. These scandals are a direct result of an increase in gambling on amateur sports. 
   It was just 2 years ago, during the Final Four, that we learned of the point-shaving scandal at Northwestern University involving their men's basketball team. This scandal involved both legal and illegal gambling on several Northwestern games. Kevin Pendergast, a former Notre Dame place kicker who orchestrated the basketball point-shaving scandal at Northwestern University, has stated--and I think this is clear, and it points to where we have a problem and why this is a problem and something we should take care of. In other States, it is illegal. Here is what the guy who masterminded that point-shaving case at Northwestern said:  
   My relationship with sports gambling continued off and on and ended with a $20,000 bet placed in a sports book in Las Vegas. This was part of three basketball games that have been mentioned by Senator Brownback in the Northwestern point-shaving incident. The majority of the monies wagered in these games were legally wagered in Nevada. And by legally wagered, I mean you walk up to the sports book and place a bet on one team or the other. Now it was obviously illegal because of what was going on behind the scenes, but like I said, the majority of the monies wagered in this situation were wagered in a legal manner in sports casinos in Nevada.  
   That was the big case that broke 2 years ago. He went to a number of college athletes and said, ``We are not talking about losing the game. Don't lose the game. We just want you not to win it by as much as the margin.'' 
   That is what we are talking about--the point spread. We will be able to wager money on the game, and if you are ahead by five points and the margin says six on it, just don't score. We are learning, as we have gone through hearings, that you don't do this on offense; you do it on defense. If you want to shave points, it is not that you miss the free throw or the shot; you actually let your player get by you on an offensive move. It is less obvious to the other people watching that that is something that is going on. So actually people have thought this through quite a bit on how you allow shaving to take place. 
   That is what Kevin Pendergast said on this one particular case that broke 2 years ago. 
   In fact, the last two major point shaving scandals involved legalized gambling in Las Vegas sports books. The point-shaving scandal involving Arizona State University is believed to involve more money than any other sports gambling case in the history of intercollegiate athletics and involved legalized gambling and organized crime. 
   A study recently conducted by the University of Michigan found that 84 percent of college referees said they had participated in some form of gambling since beginning their careers as referees. Nearly 40 percent also admitted placing bets on sporting events and 20 percent said they gambled on the NCAA basketball tournament. Two referees said they were aware of the spread on a game and that it affected the way they officiated the contest. Some reported being asked to fix games they were officiating and others were aware of referees who ``did not call a game fairly because of gambling reasons.'' Just a few months ago, newspaper articles from Las Vegas and Chicago detailed how illegal and legal gambling are sometime interconnected. 
   I get irritated sometimes at the referees in games. But if I thought there was anything going on where they were gambling on the games and that it was affecting their calls, imagine how poisonous this would be to them and to the integrity of the sport that is taking place. 
   The National Gambling Impact Study Commission Report recognized the potential harm of legalized gambling by stating that sports gambling ``can serve as gateway behavior for adolescent gamblers, and can devastate individuals and careers.'' Some of its findings include: 
   More than 5 million Americans suffer from pathological gambling; 
   Another 15 million are ``at risk'' for it; and 
   About 1.1 million adolescents, ages 12 to 17, or 5 percent of America's 20 million teenagers engage in severe pathological gambling each year. 
   According to the American Psychiatric Association: 
   Pathological gambling is a chronic and progressive psychiatric disorder characterized by emotional dependence, loss of control and leads to adverse consequences at school and at home; 
   Teens are more than twice as vulnerable to gambling addictions than adults because they are prone to high-risk behaviors during adolescence; and 
   Ninety percent of the nation's compulsive gamblers start at an adolescent age; 
   According to the Minnesota Council on Compulsive Gambling, gambling on sporting events is a favorite preference of teenage gamblers. 
   We are talking about the gateway behavior, the pathological gambling, and 90 percent of it starts as teenagers. Where does it generally start? One of the favorite gateways is sports gambling. 
   Opponents of our legislation have tried to discredit our efforts by insisting that we should be focusing our efforts on curbing illegal gambling, not legal. I agree that we should be looking at ways to help law enforcement and institutions for higher education combat illegal gambling. The NCAA has undertaken numerous steps to combat gambling among student athletes and stated during the Commerce Committee hearing its intention to do even more. 
   I want to list some of the steps they proposed and are doing. 
   They are sponsoring educational programs for student athletes, including development of a sports wagering video; partnershiping with several professional organizations; assisting in bringing Federal and local enforcement officers to camps across the country; continuing to broadcast antisports gambling through public service announcements during NCAA championship games aired on CBS and CNN, most recently aired 18 times during the 2000 basketball championship games, and will continue to run during championship games this year. 
   They developed a ``don't-bet-on-it booklet,'' created in partnership with the National Endowment for Financial Education to educate students about the dangers of sports gambling and to acquaint them with good financial management strategies. 
   They distributed these to at least 325,000 NCAA students. 
   The NCAA established policies that prohibit gambling on professional or college sports by college athletic personnel, student athletes, athletic conferences, and NCAA employees. 
   They prohibit student athletes from competing if they knowingly provide information to individuals concerning games. 
   They prohibit student athletes from competing if they solicit a bet on any intercollegiate game, or if they accept a bet on any intercollegiate team, or if they accept a bet on any team representing the institution, or participate in any gambling activity that involves an intercollegiate athlete through a book maker, or any other method employed by organized gambling. 
   They have instituted background checks on men and women basketball  officials to try to deal with the study that I just mentioned by the University of Michigan about the number of referees who have been involved in gambling. 
   The NCAA has been working in partnership with the National Association of Student Personnel and Administrators on implementation of on-campus surveys aimed at obtaining data related to gambling behavior of college students. The goal is to enlist 50 institutions to participate in the project. I hope the results will be available later this year. 
   The NCAA is working with several of the largest athletic conferences to assist in the development of comprehensive research on student athletic gambling behavior. They have other programs they are working with as well. 
   My point in mentioning all of that is there were charges made at the hearing in the Commerce Committee that the NCAA isn't doing enough. I agree. They are not. They are not stepping up and doing more. That should not be an excuse for us not doing what is right here, which is to ban the gambling on student sports. We shouldn't be subjecting our student athletes to this type of pressure. 
   Opponents have claimed that this is a state issue, not a federal one. This argument doesn't hold water. Congress already determined this is a federal issue with the passage of Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) in 1992. Ironically, while Nevada is the only state where legal gambling on collegiate and Olympic sporting events occurs, Nevada's own gaming regulations prohibit gambling on any of Nevada's teams because of the potential to jeopardize the integrity of those sporting events. 
   If it is good for the goose, it is good for the gander. This should be banned everywhere. 
   During a press conference on my legislation earlier this year I encouraged colleges and universities from across the country to ask the Nevada Gaming Control Board to prohibit any wagers from being ``accepted or paid by any book'' on their respective athletic teams in Nevada. Unfortunately, the board refused the NCAA's request, stating that ``the same level of protection is already extended within each of these states.'' What they failed to mention was that no state, except for Nevada, allows betting on college teams from other states. 
   The frequency of gambling scandals over the last decade is a clear indication of legal gambling of college sports stretching beyond the borders of Nevada, impacting the integrity of States' sporting events in other places. 
   I said to the Nevada Gaming Control Board: If you take UNLV off the books, allow a way for the University of Kansas and Kansas State University to get off the books. Let our board of regents petition the Nevada Gaming Board that if they don't want to be on the books, Kansas State University can be pulled off, the Governor can send a letter officially requesting, or the legislature can even pass a resolution saying the request be pulled off the books. Give us a way out to protect the integrity of our universities. 
   They denied the request. They said they would not do it because if we wanted out, there will be a whole bunch more who want out. Should that not tell us something right there, as well? 
   I am a strong advocate of States rights. However, States rights meet a State's authority to determine how best to govern within that State's own borders; they do not have a right to impact the integrity of Kansas sporting events. They do not have the authority to set laws allowing a State to impose its policies on every other State while exempting itself. Gambling on college sports, both legal and illegal, threatens the integrity of the game. That threat extends beyond any one State's borders. 
   I realize a ban on collegiate sports gambling will not eliminate all gambling on college sports. However, as Coach Calhoun stated in his testimony during the hearing: It is a starting point. 
   It is an important starting point. This is exactly what this legislation is about, a beginning. It will send a clear signal to our communities and, more importantly, a clear message to our kids: Gambling on student athletics is wrong and threatens the integrity of college athletes. 
   I believe it is important that every Senator voting on this legislation should ask him or herself this question: Is it unseemly and wrong to bet on kids? I think so. If enacted, there will be no ambiguity about whether it is legal or illegal to bet on college sports. As part of a broader strategy to resensitize the public to the problems associated with college sports gambling, this will make a difference. We should not wait for another point-shaving scandal in order to act. There will be another point-shaving case that will come down. Given the amount of money--over $1 billion bet each year on college sports--there will be another point-shaving case that will occur. 
   Mr. President, if the minority, if the Democrat side, chooses to continue to hold up legislation on appropriations bills, I think this would be a good time to go take up this bill. I think it would be appropriate. I think it would be a good time to take it up. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I guess we are reading different bills here. The bill that we have is a 5-year bill. It sunsets in 5 years. It is scored at $89 billion. At the end of 5 years, it sunsets. We don't know what happens at the end of that. It is only on the 15-percent tax bracket. It doubles the standard deduction over a period of years from $26,250 per individual to $52,500. I hardly see how that is wealthy. It is 5 percent of the on-budget surplus, not Social Security. It does not steal money from other priority programs. I guess I am confused. I guess he is talking about a different bill than I will vote on this morning. 
   My final point is, this will pass with a large margin. It will pass with over 60 votes. Then it is up to the President of the United States and the Vice President--President Clinton and Vice President Gore--whether this tax cut will reach our working families across America. It will be up to them. I call on them to sign this bill and not penalize our people across this country for the simple act of being married. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, the Senate just passed the Marriage Penalty Tax Relief Reconciliation Act by 60 votes. Sixty percent of the Senate voted in favor of eliminating the marriage penalty tax. Now it is up to the President and the Vice President--President Clinton and AL GORE--whether or not we will continue to tax marriage in America. This relief is available now to more than 50 million Americans. The President and the Vice President decide whether this is going to become law. All that remains for this legislation to become law is the President's signature. He is the one who can decide. He is the one who will decide, along with the Vice President, whether or not the marriage penalty will be eliminated. It is on their desk. It is up to the President. He is the one who decides. 
   He said he is for it. He said it during the State of the Union message. Now he will have a chance to go ahead and act and sign the bill. I say to the President yet again: Sign this into law. 
   I congratulate the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator ROTH, who has done wonderful work, yeoman work on getting this bill passed. I congratulate the Senator from Texas, Mrs. HUTCHISON, who has waged a crusade for several years, seeing this was wrong in the Tax Code, and has fought diligently to get this done. I thank the Senator from Missouri, Mr. ASHCROFT, for his work in pushing this over a period of time. Now we are close to getting it done. We are almost there. It is time to be able to do it. We have the wherewithal. It is time. The President and the Vice President will decide whether or not this becomes law. 
   I want to cite what is in the bill so that people know what is there. I know we have been through this a number of times, but just to make sure people are clear what we are doing, we are doubling the standard deduction; we eliminate the penalty there. The current standard deduction is $4,400 for singles. For couples it is $7,350. We just double it. We make it $8,800 for married couples. It seems only fair that for two people you should have a standard deduction that would be double what it is for one person.  
   In the 15-percent tax bracket, for a married couple filing, we double the income amount. Currently, a single taxpayer, hits the top of the 15-percent bracket when they make over $26,250. If it is a couple, they hit the top when they earn $43,850. We say that is not fair. If it is two people, it should be double what it is for one, so we move it up to $52,500. 
   Those are the two main features of this bill. That is the big end of the bill. It is taking a standard deduction from $4,400 for a single and that is now $7,350 for a married couple and saying we will make it $8,800. We are saying on the 15-percent bracket, which is the one we hit here, we are saying right now that if you are a couple, that you hit the top of that bracket at $43,850, even though it is $26,250 for a single person. We are saying if you are a married couple, we will move it up to $52,500. That is the guts of the bill. 
   Then on the earned-income tax credit, we increase the phaseout by $2,000 for a married couple so that low-income individuals don't hit that same marriage penalty. 
   Those are the three main features. That is what was passed. That is what 60 Senators and 63 percent of the House voted for. That is now what is in front of the President. 
   Some people say it costs too much--$89 billion. This is a 5-year tax bill. It sunsets after 5 years--$89 billion. It is 5 percent of the on-budget surplus. Setting the Social Security surplus aside, just leaving what is still the on-budget surplus, it is only 5 percent. That is all it is. Some people say we should be using it for debt reduction. This year, we will pay down the national debt--the debt, not the deficit--we will pay down the national debt about $200 billion. We will buy down the national debt this year by $200 billion, probably the most in the history of the United States. I haven't looked up the actual number, but it is probably the most in real terms, $200 billion of debt buy-down. 
   The simple point here is there are no excuses remaining for the President not to sign this into law. There is no excuse on debt reduction. There is no excuse that it is too expensive. There is no excuse that it is just for the wealthy. All of those are false statements. There is just no substance to them. There is no excuse for him to deny 25 million American families this tax cut. I wouldn't even call it a tax cut. I think the Senator from Texas has it right. It is a tax correction. 
   Should we tax marriage more than we are taxing single people, when we are having so much trouble with the family in the country? We ought to give them a bonus to encourage family values. 
   This is a big day for this body. This is a major piece of legislation. It has cleared Congress. It has cleared through the House; it has cleared through the Senate. It now sits on the desk of the President; for the President and Vice President of the United States to decide. They can be heroes. They can sign this bill into law or they can say, no, we are going to veto this piece of legislation. 
   I hope they will say, no, we don't want to send a signal to the married people of America that we think they ought to be taxed. 
   Democrats offered an alternative. It was a fine alternative, but it created a homemaker penalty that if you had one wage earner, but a second spouse who decided to stay home to take care of older parents and children, it actually taxed them more. So you had a homemaker penalty that was put into the Democratic alternative. It had a number of positive things about it, but the last thing we want to do is to say to people: Well, we really don't value somebody who stays at home to take care of family members, young or old, or other friends. 
   I think we ought to say this is a critical thing. We don't want to send the signal that we are going to tax in that situation. That is why we have worked out over the years all the problems in this bill. 
   I don't know what the President will come up with in vetoing it, but it has been a great bipartisan majority that has passed this bill; sixty votes, a number of our Democratic colleagues joining us on this bill that has now passed. It just awaits the signature of the person who sits in the Presidency of the United States. I hope he and Vice President AL GORE will decide: They have met most of the charges in the concerns we had and we are going to sign it into law.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I thank the chairman of the Finance Committee for putting forward this legislation. This is the marriage penalty tax. It has been before this body. We passed it with 61 votes in favor of it, and 9 Democrats voted in favor of this bill. Almost the entire Republican side voted for this bill. Now we have a conference report in front of us. 
   I hope people will look at this and look at what is in the conference report. That is why I wanted to take some time to go through it. It is a 5-year package, $89 billion. I don't want people saying it is $250 billion or anything; it is an $89 billion package. It only hits the 15-percent tax bracket. There has been concern about the 28-percent bracket being hit. It doesn't include the 28-percent bracket. The House side has a 15-percent bracket in dealing with the marriage penalty but not the 28-percent bracket. So we went with the House side and said: OK, we will pull out the 28-percent bracket. So it is just that 15-percent bracket. It is phased in faster than the Senate bill that passed. It does continue to contain the earned-income tax provisions within it so that married couples who are currently being hit by a marriage penalty associated with the earned-income tax credit are no longer impacted by that. 
   This is an overall excellent bill that meets virtually everybody's suggestions that they were making about this bill. I hope we can get 100 percent support within the Senate for this bill. 
   It eliminates the marriage penalty built into the standard deduction effective back to the beginning of this year. It backs it up to the beginning of the year 2000. It widens the 15-percent bracket gradually so that joint filing is two times that of singles. It starts at the beginning of this year, and is fully effective by the year 2004. 
   In other words, we are taking that 15-percent bracket for two-wage earners, or spouses with combined incomes, or even only one spouse, and we are doubling the standard deduction. We are doing it up until 2004. 
   It increases the top phaseout amount of the earned-income tax credit--the provision I was talking about earlier--for joint filers by $2,000 effective to the beginning of this year; again, the beginning of the year 2000. It sunsets the tax relief provisions in accordance with the Byrd rule at the end of 2004. I want to make sure to point out that provision to people as well. This is a 5-year marriage penalty elimination for the 15-percent tax bracket and earned-income tax credit. 
   That is basically what the package is. I think it should contain more. I think we ought to have the 28-percent bracket as well on combined incomes. We couldn't get agreement to that in the House. We did on the 15-percent bracket. 
   I direct most of my statement tonight to the administration. This is going to pass. It is going to pass strong. We have had a lot of calls and contacts in our office from people saying: Of course you shouldn't tax marriage. Let's do away with this penalty. That is what we are simply pleading to the President. 
   After tomorrow morning when this passes with at least 61 votes, this will be on the administration's desk. It is up to the President and Vice President to determine whether they are going to sign this tax cut. Are we going to sign this tax correction and send to the American people, or are we going to veto it? 
   The President has been saying: OK. Send me prescription drugs and I will sign the marriage penalty. In the State of the Union Message, he said: Let's deal with the marriage penalty tax, and let's eliminate it. He didn't say then that you have to send this to me at the same time. He asked for a hundred things in the State of the Union Message. He didn't say they have to be linked together. I think he is hiding behind that issue rather than saying whether he is for or against eliminating the marriage penalty within the Tax Code. 
   I call on the President to sign this for the American people. After tomorrow morning, the President and the Vice President and this administration are all that stands in the way of the American people being able to receive this correction within the Tax Code so people who are married don't pay more taxes than people who are single. 
   It simply makes equitable a situation for most people impacted by the marriage penalty; not all. It would be better if it dealt with everybody. It is a simple statement that we should not be taxing marriage. We have said that repeatedly. For most people impacted by the marriage penalty, this bill will deal with that situation. We will not be taxing people just for being married. Plus, I think it is just the right 
   message to send across to the American public saying we think marriage is a valuable institution; it shouldn't be taxed. We think it is at the center of family values. Let's all say we are for it and that we shouldn't be taxing it. 
   Also, it gets around that iron rule in government that if you want less of something, tax it; if you want more of something, subsidize it. I don't think we want to tell the American public we want less marriage, and therefore we are taxing them. 
   This is the time for us to accomplish this. 
   I say in conclusion that this is going to pass, and it will pass large tomorrow morning. At least nine Democrats voted for it the last time. The only thing that stands in the way of this tax relief--this tax sanity, that we shouldn't be taxing marriage and the American public--is the President of the United States. Please, Mr. President, sign this bill. 
   This is good tax policy. This Congress is doing a number of things. We are getting them to the President. It is up to the President whether he will sign them into law. 
   I note the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to recognize and celebrate the life of PAUL COVERDELL, as many of my colleagues have today, a beautiful, warm-hearted, deep-souled man who was constantly encouraging and engaging people. I know he is hearing these comments. I wish I would have said them to him physically as well, but we know he is here, as we celebrate a life well lived. 
   It is a very sad day for us in the Senate. I caught the comments of Senator GRAMM earlier wherein he said that instead of staring at the death, we should stare at the life; instead of staring at our loss, we should stare at our gain from having known PAUL COVERDELL. That is a very appropriate way for us to look at and think about it. 
   PAUL touched so many of us in the Senate in many wonderful ways. One of the things he did for my family that I most remember was sending us a book by a Georgian author. The title of the book was ``Lights Along the Way.'' It was a collection of vignettes of people of faith, acts they had performed--many of them very obscure, some of them well known--to help people along the way. For example, one person had adopted 10 children, and the light this person had been along the way; some of the things Abraham Lincoln had done, a clear light along the way. My daughter and I would frequently read one, maybe two of these stories at night before going to bed. They were uplifting,  happy, light, joyous stories of lives well lived, of somebody being a light along the way. 
   That is exactly what PAUL COVERDELL was, a light along the way. If you saw him during the day, it was never a confrontational meeting. It was always a happy meeting. Even though you may disagree about something, he was always trying to 
   be helpful. He was a peacemaker. As you would pass through your day, he was one of those lights along the way. That is why our grief is so great. When you lose part of that light, it makes it very difficult. He clearly was that. He was one of those people who talked about the scripture of God working through an individual and that it was God working in him to be that light along the way. 
   I think PAUL was truly that, a beautiful, deeply-caring man. He cared for his country, cared for his friends. He cared for people who were not his friends. I never saw him give a harsh or a cross word to anybody. I never saw him hardly give a frown to anybody, let alone a harsh word. It is those sorts of vignettes of PAUL's life that I remember, that stick out in my mind, his being such a light along the way. 
   I hope he is a light we don't forget. I hope he is a light we learn from. Light cleanses. Light shows us the way. Light points to where we ought to be and where we ought to go. Many times, it is a point of light in the distance that we seek, towards which we aim, whether it is a lighthouse or a distant shining light. 
   That is what PAUL is to us now, one of those lights we seek and aim towards, hoping that in some way, at some time in our life, we will be able to draw closer, move towards it, be purer, be a greater light; that when we enter a room, people will react as they did when PAUL entered a room. You can enter a room and there are shadows that come out, frowns, or you can enter a room and people start to smile and be happy, even though they are not exactly sure why you are there. PAUL was one of those where the room started to light up rather than get darker when he entered. 
   I hope his is a light we will always remember. As we mourn today, we celebrate that light among us, a light for us to aim towards. He was a great man. 
   I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

    Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the ground-breaking and encouraging work being performed by the Healthy Culture Initiative, a non-profit group with which I am honored to be associated. The Healthy Culture Initiative (HCI) is an organization committed to strengthening and improving the health of America's culture by recognizing and replicating the many innovative, local initiatives aimed at solving community challenges. 
   The Healthy Culture Initiative recognizes that there are many challenges we face as a nation--over the last thirty years, we have seen huge increases in family breakdown, out-of-wedlock births, single parent families, teen suicide, drug abuse, violence, and civic disengagement. But for every problem in America, there is already a solution--a solution that is in place in neighborhoods across America. Indeed, many of the most effective solutions to the complex social problems of crime, drug abuse, family breakdown, teen suicide, illegitimacy, and poverty arise from the committed efforts of a small group of individuals working within their own community. 
   The Healthy Culture Initiative seeks to recognize these exciting efforts, and encourage their replication. HCI has four primary objectives: 
   First, through a series of Success Summits to be held in cities across America, the Healthy Culture Initiative will recognize, and help replicate, community-based solutions to pressing social challenges. 
   Second, the Healthy Culture Initiative will jump-start important civic dialogue about ways that ordinary people, working alone or in small groups, can help strengthen families, schools, neighborhoods, and ultimately, our Nation. 
   Third, HCI will measure the success of new initiatives. In conjunction with the Gallup organization, the Healthy Culture Initiative will work to quantify the actual results of each new initiative launched, so that resources and attention can be concentrated on the most effective efforts. 
   And finally, HCI will develop a network of information resources, including web links and educational materials, to assist community activists in initiating new programs in their neighborhoods. 
   I can personally attest to the exciting work undertaken by the Healthy Culture Initiative, in that I and Senator JOE LIEBERMAN, currently serve as honorary co-chairs. I am excited by the caliber and quality of individuals who are leading this initiative--including Don Clifton, President and CEO of the Gallup Corporation; Charles Krulak, former Commandant of the United States Marine Corps, Executive Director Cindy Cobb; Don Eberly, CEO of the  National Fatherhood Initiative, Curt Smith of the Hudson Institute, Jay Speigel of the Reserve Officers Association, and many others. 
   The plans of the Healthy Culture Initiative are ambitious and wide-ranging. It is my hope that by celebrating the many exciting success stories taking place in our communities across America, we can encourage their replication--and build a healthier culture, and a stronger America.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Finance Committee, Chairman ROTH, who has done an outstanding job of getting this bill to this point. We are going to get this to the President. The President is going to have the opportunity to sign it and provide relief to over 20 million American couples. 
   The Senator from Massachusetts argued earlier that we haven't done anything for the vast majority of Americans this week. I disagree heartily with that. But he can certainly join us on this one. 
   We have over 20 million American couples, 40 million people--if you count family members affected by this issue, it is far more than that--who are going to be affected right now by this tax. 
   My comments are not long. They are simple and to the point. 
   There is an iron rule of government: If you want less of something, tax it; if you want more of something, subsidize it. We are taxing marriage, and we are getting less of it. That is hurting our families, and it is hurting our children. 
   We are taxing marriage to the tune of about $1,400 per couple per year. The tax is applied to 21 million American couples. We have seen a decline in the number of marriages from 1960 to 1996--about 40 percent during that period of time. I am not saying that is all associated with the marriage penalty. It is not. But, clearly, we are sending a signal across the country that we are for family values, but not really. We are going to go ahead and tax the very fundamental institution in which families do the most, and do their best. We are going to tax the fundamental institution around which families are built; that is the marriage. We are going to tax it significantly--$1,400 per married couple across America. 
   When you tax things, you get less of it. You can see what is taking place in the number of couples who are affected in this country. 
   In Kansas, we have nearly 260,000 married couples affected by the marriage penalty. You can see it in States as large as Texas with 1.75 million. You can see it in States such as New York with 1.5 million; States such as Massachusetts where 600,000 couples are taxed by this. 
   I certainly don't consider it spending money when you allow people to keep a little bit more of their own money, particularly when you have such an unfair tax as the one on marriage. It is one of those institutions that we should not be taxing, and yet we are. 
   The Senator from Texas and the Senator from Delaware hit the fundamentals of the bill--expanding the tax brackets in the 15- and 28-percent bracket, doubling the standard deduction to be able to take care of this, and the EITC credit as well--because the marriage penalty occurs in about 66 different places in the Tax Code. We are taking care of the biggest areas. But there are still some other areas we are trying to take care of as well. 
   I want to directly hit something that has been raised by some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, that we are somehow providing too much benefit to married couples. One of the Democrat proposals pushed around would actually put in place a homemaker penalty, where you would tax a couple if one decides to stay at home and take care of the family. One of the Democrat proposals would make families with one earner and one stay-at-home spouse pay higher taxes than families with the same household income and two earners; thus, putting in place a stay-at-home spouse penalty; a homemaker penalty. 
   Why would we discriminate against families who would decide to make the very difficult choice of one working outside of the home, one staying at home to take care of older members of the family, and younger members of the family to do other things around the community? Why would we want to penalize that type of situation and create that stay-at-home spouse penalty? I don't understand why that would be something we would want to do. Yet it is being bandied about that that is one of the amendments supported by our colleagues on the other side of the aisle. 
   I want to note, too, that the fundamentals of this are pretty simple and pretty stark as well. I have another chart to point that out. You can look at this as a typical couple getting married. They wanted to get married. We encourage this. This is a good thing, building families. It is a good thing for family values. 
   We have a first-year teacher making $27,000 of annual income. We have a rookie police officer with $29,698 of annual income. Individually we can see what they would pay in taxes: $3,030 for her; $3,434 for him. Yet if you put them together in a joint return, if you encourage them to get married and say we want you to build a family, we want you to build it within this construction of a marriage, this sacred union between man and woman, they say, OK, but our tax bill to do this--look, they are not making lots of money here: $27,500 for a first-year teacher, $29,000 for a rookie cop--at the Federal level is an additional $638.44. 
   Some say that is not a lot of money; they ought to pay it. Look at what they are making. They need to have this money if they are going to be able to do anything as a young couple, to start building a home, build some equity, and start a family. That is why this tax strikes so many people and why public opinion polls across the country say this is one tax people want removed. 
   Then we get letters. We get all sorts of letters. The Senator from Texas read some letters she received. I receive them. A number of Senators do. 
   This one is from Mark in Salina, KS, writing to urge us to reduce the marriage penalty. He says:  
   Two single people that choose to get married must not pay more tax than two people who choose not to do so. That is a penalty for getting married. Correcting this problem is not ``cutting taxes.'' It is merely restoring them back to the way they were before the couple joined in marriage. Thus it is not a tax cut. It is the correction of the penalty for getting married. Please do the right thing.  
   The right thing clearly is passing this bill. The right thing for the President to do is sign this bill into law. 
   I have this letter from Thomas, from Hilliard, OH:  
   No person who legitimately supports family values could be against this bill. The marriage penalty is but another example of how in the past 40 years the Federal Government has enacted policies that have broken down the fundamental institutions that were the strength of this country from the start.  
   This gentleman has hit on a couple of things. One, it is not a fair tax in the first place; it is something we ought to do away with. He even looks deeper and says, Is the Federal Government really trying to harm one of our fundamental institutions, as a country? Is that really the signal the Federal Government is sending me? Is that what they want to do? Yet a lot of people looking at the Government today actually believe that is the case, that the Government is trying to break down some of these fundamental institutions in our country around which we build our values and on which we build our Nation. 
   Here is another one from Jerry Fishbein, Pennsylvania. He 
   writes: 
   My wife and I have actually discussed the possibility of obtaining a divorce--something neither of us wants or believes in, especially myself.......simply because my family cannot afford to pay the price [of the marriage penalty tax.]  
   We have had much debate on this issue. I am not going to keep that going on the floor. I think this is a clear choice. We should pass the marriage penalty elimination. We should not put in place a homemaker penalty within this bill. We should provide this relief to over 20 million American couples. 
   The President of the United States and his administration should sign this bill into law. We will pass this in the Senate. If it is passed in the House, the only thing that stands in the way of this bill is the President of the United States and his administration. I ask them, do they really want to send a signal to the American population that they don't value marriage; That they think it should be taxed so we get less of it? Is that really the signal they want to send? 
   I hope they will not and that the President will sign this into law.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I am delighted to hail today the passage of the Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Act. This legislation is the product of more than three year's worth of negotiations between the governors, cities, State tax and local tax authorities, and the wireless industry. 
   The legislation represents an historic agreement between State and local governments and the wireless industry to bring sanity to the manner in which wireless telecommunications services are taxed. 
   For as long as we have had wireless telecommunications in this country, we have had a taxation system that is incredibly complex for carriers and costly for consumers. Today, there are several different methodologies that determine whether a taxing jurisdiction may tax a wireless call.  
   If a call originates at a cell site located in a jurisdiction, it may impose a tax. If a call originates at a switch in the jurisdiction, a tax may be imposed. If the billing address is in the jurisdiction, a tax can be imposed. 
   As a result, many different taxing authorities can tax the same wireless call. The farther you travel during a call, the greater the number of taxes that can be imposed upon it. 
   This system is simply not sustainable as wireless calls represent an increasingly portion of the total number of calls made throughout the United States. To reduce the cost of making wireless calls, Senator DORGAN and I introduced S. 1755, the Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Act. The bill we pass today that we received from the House is substantively identical to our bill. While the current bill amends title 4 rather than title 47 and represents the drafting style of the House rather than the Senate, the legislation uses our language to accomplish our mutual goal. 
   The legislation would create a nationwide, uniform system for the taxation of wireless calls. The only jurisdictions that would have the authority to tax mobile calls would be the taxing authorities of the customer's place of primary use, which would essentially be the customer's home or office. 
   By creating this uniform system, Congress would be greatly simplifying the taxation and billing of wireless calls. The wireless industry would not have to keep track of multiple taxing laws for each wireless transaction. State and local taxing authorities would be relieved of burdensome audit and oversight responsibilities without losing the authority to tax wireless calls. And, most importantly, consumers would see reduced wireless rates and fewer billing headaches. 
   The Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Act is a win-win-win. It's a win for industry, a win for government, and a win for consumers. I thank Senator DORGAN for working with me in crafting our bill. And I would like to commend the House for sending the Senate the bill before us. And, most of all, I thank the groups outside of Congress for coming together and reaching agreement on this important issue. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous, consent that Senator DORGAN and I be permitted to enter into a colloquy.

H.R. 4391 reflects the drafting style of the House, whereas S. 1755 reflects the drafting style of the Senate. H.R. 4391 deleted the findings incorporated in section 2 of S. 1755. H.R. 4391 also changed the order in which the definitions appear in S. 1755. There are no substantive differences between S. 1755 and H.R. 4391. Therefore, H.R. 4391 and S. 1755 are substantively identical.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, in May 2000, a delegation from Georgia attended a five-day seminar in western Sicily to help further a culture of lawfulness in Georgia. The delegation consisted of government officials as well as senior educators, representatives from the Orthodox Church, and the media. The program was organized by two non-governmental organizations--the National Strategy Information Center in Washington, D.C. and the Sicilian Renaissance Institute in Palermo, Sicily--with financial assistance from the City of Palermo and the U.S. Department of State. The seminar featured presentations on key aspects of the Sicilian Renaissance as well as one-on-one meetings between Georgians and their Sicilian counterparts to discuss specific programs that could be implemented in Georgia. The focus was on how in recent decades cultural change in Palermo and other parts of Sicily helped reduce crime and corruption, the lessons from the Sicilian experience that may have applicability to Georgia, and how the Sicilian experience can be modified or replicated in Georgia. The consensus of the Georgian delegation was that the achievements of the Sicilians were remarkable and that many of the practices that have been effective in Sicily are applicable to the prevention of crime and corruption in Georgia. The delegation is now developing culture of lawfulness programs with specific products, and methods of evaluation. Additional sectors of society such as the police, social workers, NGO's will become involved as progress is made. 
   Mr. President, this program is one that attempts to go to the root of one of the major problems left over from decades of communist rule: corruption. The National Strategy Information Center should be commended and encouraged in these types of programs. This is exactly the kind of program we should be encouraging not just in Georgia but in the other Silk Road countries as well.

The portion of the bill I have is a bill that I, along with Senator DASCHLE, have introduced, with 32 other cosponsors, called the Conservation Reserve Program Tax Fairness Act. What it would do is keep conservation reserve program payments from being subject to self-employment tax. 
   Unfortunately, a circuit court in this country determined that these CRP payments are subject to that. This removes that. That is in the bill. That is why I support my colleague from Iowa and urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

Ocular Albinism is an x-linked genetic disorder affecting 1 in 50,000 American children, mostly males. Affected patients show photophobia, nystagmus, strabimus, a loss of three dimensional vision and a severe reduction in visual acuity, due to the abnormal development of the retina and optic pathways. There are five diseases relating to Ocular Albinism including Fundus Hypopigmentations, Macular Hypoplasia, Iris Transillumination, Visual Pathway Misrouting and Nystagmus

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to engage in a brief, but important colloquy with the distinguished chairman of the Labor-HHs subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee, Senator SPECTER. I appreciate his willingness to engage in this colloquy, and his commitment to ensuring that the federal government does the best possible job in gathering vital information on family structure and function. 
   It has been said that the family is the cornerstone of civilization. Certainly, the evidence we have suggests that family structure is one of the most fundamental indicators of child health and well-being. Strong families are positively linked to child physical, emotional and psychological health, social adjustment, academic competence, and positive behavior. In fact, the more we study family structure and function, the more information we glean about children's health risks, and challenges to their well-being and development. 
   Unfortunately, there is vital data that is not currently being gathered relating to family structure and function. This is not merely my opinion, but the statement of the Federal Inter-Agency Forum on Child and Family Statistics, which declares that important information on child living arrangements, family structure, and family interaction, is falling through the cracks, and recommends expanded and enhanced data-gathering in these areas. Without such data, we are at a disadvantage in determining the root causes of both youth well-being, and youth challenges, and addressing them effectively. 
   It is therefore vital that we encourage the National Center of Health Statistics, the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Administration for Children and Families, Maternal and Child Health Bureau, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, and Bureau of Labor Statistics to enhance research in this area. According to the Inter-Agency Forum on Child and Family Statistics, of which all these agencies are a member of, regularly collected data are needed that describe children's living arrangements, and interactions with parents and guardians, including non-residential parents. In addition, regularly-collected data are needed on how many children live with biological parents, step-parents, and adoptive parents, or with no parent or guardian.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, if the majority leader will be willing to yield for a moment, I appreciate his offering this unanimous consent request. I note that we have considered a number of items on various bills--whether it has been items on prescription drugs or different items that have come forward. 
   This is one that has cleared through the committee by a strong vote of 13-2 with wide bipartisan support. The bill itself has broad bipartisan support across the country. It is an important issue. We are having a lot of difficulty with regard to our student athletes being involved in gambling themselves and referees in sporting events being involved in gambling. The NCAA and many of the sporting groups are saying this is a problem. 
   Bigger than all of that, the lead gateway for college students getting into addictive gambling is through sports wagering. What we are trying to deal with is the one place in the country where this remains a problem and where it remains legal. 
   I think we need to have a bill up and a vote. 
   I ask my colleague from Nevada--he has been so persistent on a number of different issues to bring up to the floor--when can we get this one up so we can have a set timeframe for debate? If the Senator from Nevada would like to have a long period of time, that is fine. I am willing to go as short as an hour equally divided. But can we get some idea of when we could do this?

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I draw quick attention of the body to the amendment I hope to bring up sometime during the session--or on a freestanding bill--banning gambling on college athletics. There is currently only one State in the Union where you can bet on college sports. That is in Nevada. It is called the ``Vegas Exception.'' That has led to a lot of problems of gambling on college athletics and on college campuses. 
   Also, one of the aspects I want to point out briefly--and why I want to bring this up yet this session of Congress because of the impact it is having on our young people--is the expansion into gambling and getting addicted. 
   We are finding that one of the leading gateways for young people to get into gambling is through sports gambling--betting on sporting events. That is one of the top two ways of getting young people involved. They are among the most susceptible to becoming addicted to gambling. 
   There is a study by the Harvard Medical School on addiction. It reported that college students are three times as likely to develop a severe gambling problem as compared with other adults. It shows that the leading gateway for college students becoming addicted is through sports betting. 
   There is only one place in the country where it is legal. That is in Nevada. It is the ``Vegas Exception.'' That provides this atmosphere where it is legal or thought to be legal in many places, and we are seeing this problem grow. 
   The NCAA is strongly supportive of this amendment. They want to get at this issue of gambling that is expanding exponentially across the country, and the problems they are having they want to be able to deal with so people will know there is a fair game that is going on. They want to deal with it now. 
   Some Members are opposed to this amendment. I simply stand here to say I am prepared to bring this amendment up at any time with limited debate--1 hour of debate equally divided between each side--and I am willing to go late into the night, as it is obvious now at this hour--to talk about this issue, get an up-or-down vote on it, and simply move forward. If the body agrees, let the body work its will. If the body disagrees, so be it. Let's move on. 
   This is an important issue to our young people, to our colleges, and to college athletics. These games should remain honest and not be influenced by gambling. We are even hearing of some referees now who are betting on games. It is causing people to question whether these are legitimate sporting events or fixed events on the point spread. 
   I simply continue to state to my colleagues that this is an important amendment on which I want to get a vote in this session of Congress. I am prepared to have limited debate at any point in time or bring the matter up as a freestanding bill so we are able to address it. I don't want to hold up other bills. I want to be able to get a vote on this particular item. We can do so in a limited time fashion. It is important that we get this addressed now.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of my colleague from Wisconsin. I agree, innocent lives should not be killed. We should be looking at every possible degree of evidence we possibly can. 
   I wonder if we could also consider all the young, innocent lives that are killed at the same time, and somehow put together a blue ribbon commission to determine when life begins, and say we are not going to allow that to take place anymore, either. 
   I was just calculating. Across the country, we have every year about 1.2 million abortions that take place. So today there have been over 3,000 abortions. I agree that innocent life should not be killed and we should do everything we possibly can to review that evidence, look at DNA evidence, anything we can. We should remove any sort of barriers to time limits on tests for DNA evidence. That is an important and good thing we should do. 
   But can't we also consider at the same time, when does that innocent life begin? I think those are valid points that we should both pause and consider at this time.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, the reason for me to speak this evening is to comment about an amendment that Senator MCCAIN and myself, along with two other Members have as well, that is pending on the DOD authorization bill. I am not raising the amendment tonight, but I want to talk about it because it has been one of some controversy. I want to put forward the issues of why I am so concerned about this issue. It is an amendment that Senator MCCAIN, myself, and two other Members sponsored, Senator EDWARDS and Senator VOINOVICH. It is about college gambling--specifically, legalized gambling in America on college athletics, college sports. 
   We have currently in the country, banned everywhere in America betting on college sports, except one State--in Nevada it is allowed. 
   There is legalized betting on college sports. If someone wants to bet on a University of Missouri football game, if they want to bet on a University of Kansas basketball game, there is a legal scoreboard, there is a game spread on it, and there is money laid on the table. It is all legal. 
   The handle is about $1 billion in Nevada each year betting on schools such as the University of Kansas, Kansas State University football, the Final Four. It takes place every year. That has been growing substantially at the level of the handle, and it is going to keep on growing. 
   The problem is it is tarnishing our amateur athletics. It is giving a black eye to college sports. We are getting more and more young people hooked into gambling because one of the key gateways to starting gambling is sports betting. A high number of young people start betting on college sports. Our athletes are being sucked into it, and we have seen more cases of point shaving in the decade of the nineties by college athletes than the entire record of the NCAA before that. 
   The famous case about Northwestern University that broke during the Final Four 2 years ago was a point shaving case. We had at a press conference Kevin Pendergast, a former Notre Dame placekicker, the mastermind who orchestrated the shaving case. He stated he would never have been able to pull off this scheme without the ability to legally lay a large amount of money on the Las Vegas sports books. 
   He said: If I do not have that, I have to pull off two shams. I have to get the athletes to shave the case, and I have to sham some bookie as well. This way, if I can get the athletes to line up and not lose the game--the point is not to lose the game, just do not make the spread. If it is a 10-point spread, just do not make it. It is easy to do. A player does not have to miss a shot. Unfortunately, we have been learning a lot about it. Where they usually do it is on defense. Let your man beat you: He got by me, coach; I didn't mean to. 
   You do not stand at the foul line and look at the shot and say: I am throwing a brick up there, when you do not normally. This is getting pretty sophisticated now. The player lets his opponent slip by, he jukes you one way, off you go: He scored on me, coach; I didn't mean for it to happen. 
   The points were not made, the money is shaved, and away we go. 
   Not only is it our athletes, but it is also our referees. This really should upset some people. Listen to this. I watch games and a lot of times I do not think the refs get it right. I would not want to have their job, but I get pretty irritated, particularly when it is my team and the call goes against it. 
   A study conducted by the University of Michigan found that 84 percent of college referees said they had participated in some form of gambling since beginning their careers as referees. Nearly 40 percent also admitted placing bets on sporting events and 20 percent said they gambled on the NCAA basketball tournament. 
   It gets worse. Two referees said they were aware of the spread on a game, and it affected the way they officiated the contest. Some were asked to fix games they were officiating, and others were aware of referees who ``did not call the game fairly because of gambling reasons.'' 
   Several weeks ago, newspaper articles from Las Vegas and Chicago detailed how illegal and legal gambling are sometimes 
   connected. Even our referees are being pulled into this gambling situation. 
   This legislation by the four sponsors was a recommendation of the National Gambling Impact Study Commission that met for 2 years on the impact of gambling. They said this seedy influence should not be allowed to persist in college sports and on our athletes. 
   The Commerce Committee held hearings on this. I said at least provide a State opt-out; allow a way for the University of Kansas, Kansas State University, Wichita State University to get off the board so they can petition you so you do not bet on them. 
   Currently, no one can bet on the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. It is illegal in Nevada to bet on a Nevada college team. They said it might be unseemly or it might appear to be too much influence, to which I thought: All right. That sounds like a legitimate reason to me. Allow me to get the University of Kansas and Kansas State University off. 
   They said: No, we are not going to do that. We will not allow your legislatures to petition; we will not allow your Governors to petition or your  presidents to petition; we are going to leave them on the book because if you want out, there will probably be others who will want out as well. We do not want to let you out of this. This is a $1 billion handle for us, and we get a lot of business. 
   The problem is, it has given a black eye to college sports. Listen to what some of the coaches are saying about this.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, one of the key coaches was Coach Calhoun from the University of Connecticut, U. Conn. He stated, while this legislation does not solve the problem, ``it is a good starting point.'' That is exactly what the legislation is, a beginning that will send a clear message to our communities and, more importantly, to our kids that gambling on student athletics is wrong and threatens the integrity of college sports. 
   We are asking for a simple amendment on this authorization bill. We would agree to an hour of debate equally divided between both sides. I am willing to start tonight. I am willing to go through the night. I am willing to go tomorrow, Saturday to bring this issue before this body. It is an important matter, and it needs to come before this body. We seek an up-or-down vote on it. 
   Some people have raised questions about it. This is the time and place to do it. We are ready. It is time to do it. It was voted through the Commerce Committee with only two dissenting votes. Let's bring it up. That is why Senator MCCAIN and I are pressing so aggressively to get this amendment considered on the DOD authorization. We will do it in a limited amount of time, whenever, an up-or-down vote. Let's just press this issue through and see what the will of the body is.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, this amendment would allow the United States to provide non military education and anti corruption assistance to countries, and their governments, that are not on the terrorism list, and that are denied U.S. assistance or are under U.S. sanctions. Let me just reiterate that this amendment is not applicable to countries on the terrorism list or which are major producers or traffickers in illegal drugs. 
   This provision is specifically intended to enable the U.S. Government to conduct a broad range of rule of law programs, as well as other programs (e.g. setting up elementary schools, high school exchanges, health education, economic reform measures; tax reform, tariff regulation, developing rational and transparent budgeting procedures, privatization, or drafting a commercial code, etc.), so long as there is some component of the program that includes educating or providing information to persons. 
   Mr. President, the United States has been working for a long time to try to find ways to help the most vulnerable populations around the world. Allowing the United States to continue to provide assistance in education and anti corruption training is something which ultimately is in our own interests. 
   In many parts of the world, we are up against elements like the Wahhabis, the Saudis, the Iranians and the likes of Bin Laden and others, who are pouring money into the poorest regions of the world to set up schools which are dedicated to teaching children anti-Western attitudes, as well as how to carry weapons. 
   In many countries, because of the dire poverty, such schools are the only game in town. And the single common element which allows these schools to flourish is poverty and ignorance. There is no other option for many people. The poverty and the lack of education leads to radicalism, and violence, often directed first against women, and a host of problems which every one on this floor can list. 
   The growth of this radicalism comes back and haunts us and affect American lives and American security. The popularity of Bin Laden for example, and the anti-Western fervor which is rampant in the Middle East and South Asia can too often lead to terrorism and attempts to destabilize developing countries that are trying to remain secular and pro-west. Ultimately, this is a threat to U.S. security. 
   This lack of education also leads to tragic global phenomena like the trafficking in women and children: Education would substantially increase awareness regarding the insidious practice of international sex slavery. This involves forcing women and children into prostitution against their will, who are held in slavery-like conditions, having been transported into a strange country. 
   There is a general sentiment in the Congress these days that sanctions have gone too far, that they don't work and that we should remove all of them. I do not share this view, I believe sanctions have a role to play and are appropriate in certain situations. But denying ourselves the opportunity to provide education in a variety of fields in certain parts of the world is counterproductive. We are only hurting ourselves. 
   Instead of being able to implement education programs which would help bring a secular alternative to the lack of education, or the types of schools I mentioned earlier, we find our hands are tied when assistance is denied to a country or when general sanctions are imposed on a country--including sanctions on countries that for one reason or another default on their loans. Yes, we should be able to take political action against countries that are doing bad things; but we should not be put in a situation where programs in education or in anti corruption training is involved. We shouldn't be mandating sanctions in an area, like education, which are of long term assistance to the United States. 
   We sit and complain about such things as corruption or lack of environmental awareness, or lack of democracy, or child labor, or trafficking in women and children. Education could help make a dent in such things, from helping to set up elementary schools, having exchanges at higher school levels, to such things as providing information to people in such areas as economic reform, equitable distribution of wealth, growing their economies, implementation of tax reform and tariff regulation, development of rational and transparent budgeting procedures, development of rule of law and democratic institutions, and privatizing or drafting a commercial code. 
   And yet we occasionally find ourselves in the position of having to deny assistance in the very area which would help fix these problems. 
   That is why I am introducing this amendment today. Denying U.S. assistance to a country is a right we should preserve, but we shouldn't be cutting our ability to influence countries at such a basic level as education and we certainly should do what we can to combat anti-corruption. 
   The most effective way to overcome the anti democratic threats and the lure of terrorism is to go to the root of the problem and to encourage the development of civil society.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank the Chair. I thank my colleague from Arkansas for leading this debate against this amendment. I rise in opposition to the Murray amendment. 
   On February 10, 1996, the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1996 was signed into law by President Clinton with a provision to prevent DOD medical treatment facilities from being used to perform abortions except where the life of the mother is endangered or in cases of rape or incest. That is the public law. 
   This provision reversed a Clinton administration policy instituted on January 22, 1993, permitting abortions to be performed at military facilities. Previously, from 1988 to 1993, the performance of abortions was not permitted at military hospitals except when the life of the mother was in danger. 
   That is a bit of the history around this issue. 
   The Murray amendment which would repeal the pro-life provision attempts to turn taxpayer-funded DOD medical treatment facilities into abortion clinics. Fortunately, the Senate refused to let the issue of abortion adversely affect our armed services and rejected this amendment last year by a vote of 51-49, and we should reject it again this year. 
   It is shameful that we would hold America's armed services hostage to abortion policies. Using the coercive power of government to force American taxpayers--American taxpayers, that is who we are talking about here--to fund health care facilities where abortions are performed would be a horrible precedent and would put many Americans in a difficult position--using my taxpayer money to fund abortions. 
   When the 1993 policy permitting abortions in military facilities was first promulgated, military physicians as well as nurses and support personnel refused to perform or assist in elective abortions. In response, the administration sought to hire civilians to do abortions. 
   Therefore, if the Murray amendment were adopted, not only would taxpayer-funded facilities be used to support abortion on demand but resources would be used to search for, hire, and transport new personnel simply so abortions could be performed. 
   In fact, according to CRS, a 1994 memorandum from the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs says this:  
   Direct[ed] the Military Health Services System provide other means of access if providing prepaid abortion services at a facility was not feasible.  
   One argument used by supporters of abortion in military hospitals is that women in countries where abortion is not permitted will have nowhere else to turn to obtain an abortion. However, DOD policy requires military doctors to obey the abortion laws of the countries where they are providing services, so they still could not perform abortions in those locations. Military treatment centers which are dedicated to healing and nurturing life--healing and nurturing life, that is what this is about; in other words, what we should be about--should not be forced to facilitate the taking of the most innocent of all human life, that of the unborn. 
   As I speak of this, I ask forgiveness for our country, for the Nation, for the killing of this most innocent of life, the unborn. 
   I urge my colleagues to table the Murray amendment and free America's military from abortion politics and from performing these abortions at taxpayer-funded facilities. If passed, this amendment will effectively kill the DOD authorization bill, and on that ground as well, I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment. 
   I think we must get down to the very basics on this, as happens so often when it comes to these sorts of issues, and that is: Should we use taxpayer-funded facilities to perform abortions, making them abortion clinics? Is that something our citizens would want us to do, whether they were pro-life or pro-choice? I think the vast majority would say, no, we don't want it to take place in our facilities and this is a bad precedent for us to set. 
   I thank my colleague from Arkansas for leading this difficult and very important debate.  
   I yield back the time reserved for our side on this issue.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I wanted to spend some time discussing what this amendment is about. I think at the outset, the best way to capture it is to compare it to what is taking place in the news today. This is an amendment about lifting economic sanctions on India. The administration has the authority--we provided it last year and the year before--for them to lift the economic sanctions this country has against India. Those sanctions were automatically put in place after India tested nuclear weapons. We have been providing them the authority and flexibility to be able to deal with India broadly. The administration was provided that waiver authority last year and it has chosen not to use it. So currently this country, the United States of America, has economic sanctions against India, another democracy in the world. 
   In today's newspaper, the administration is stating they will lift economic sanctions against North Korea. This is the country that has the most  weapons proliferation taking place anywhere in the world, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. It is a country on the terrorist list. It is on the big 7 terrorist list of state sponsors of terrorism. This is the country that has a number of different violations, a country where we have been at war. 
   There have been some different things taking place in North Korea. I am not saying I am opposed to the administration doing this. I am just saying it is quite odd, and very striking, that at the time the administration is proposing to lift economic sanctions, they continue to insist on economic sanctions against India, the second most populous nation in the world, soon to be the most populous nation in the world; a nation we trade with, a nation that is a democracy, a nation that has a free press, a nation that I think, in the future, stands to be a very strong strategic critical ally of the United States. That is India. They will be a partner of ours, working to hold stability in south Asia. Not that they don't have problems, not that we don't have issues associated with that, but this is a democracy with a free press, with capital markets, that has a number of similar aspirations to those of the United States. At the same time we are lifting economic sanctions against North Korea, this administration is going to leave them on India. 
   My amendment is simple. It would suspend economic sanctions against India--suspend them. While we provided the administration with the waiver authority so they could do it, they have chosen not to. By this amendment, we, the Congress, would be lifting these economic sanctions against India. 
   I want to say as well what this amendment does not do. My amendment does not suspend any military or dual-use technology assistance to India. The President has national security waiver authority for military-related sanctions, but we are not dealing with military-related sanctions. He has authority to waive the prohibition on sales of defense articles, but we are not doing that here. We are not dealing with defense services, foreign military financing, or dual-use technologies. 
   If the administration really wants to get to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty with India and say we want to force you to sign the CTBT, wouldn't it be better to use the military set of sanctions rather than economic sanctions that the administration is currently using? Plus, if you think about this for a moment, is it likely we are going to force India, by 
   economic sanctions, to sign CTBT? They are a democracy. How will their people react if their leaders are seen as capitulating to U.S. economic pressure to sign something their leaders are saying they needed to do? Is that a way we are actually going to be able to force India to do this? I think not. 
   Plus, this is a much bigger country with much broader issues than simply the U.S. issue of CTBT. We have a broad array of issues with India. We need to grow this relationship rapidly. To hold the entire relationship hostage to one issue is bad foreign policy on our part. It is hurting us. I think it will hurt India and hurt our ability to shape things in that part of the world. 
   I was hopeful that during the President's recent trip to India, he would use that chance to remove the economic sanctions on India. He was there for a number of days and had the opportunity to do that. It would help set up the atmosphere for a more aggressive, broad-based relationship with India. This was a way to leapfrog this relationship forward. This trip did improve relations with India, but he could have done so much more that he failed to do. A number of us were terribly disappointed that he did not make more use of the broad waiver authority he now has. He used it very sparingly. This was waiver authority that I fought last year to give him. 
   There should be no more economic sanctions on India, period. The United States should not do that. Yet the Clinton-Gore administration continues to hold up international financial institution loans which are destined for infrastructure projects which would help sustain the economic activities in rural areas where the bulk of India's poor population lives. More than a third of India's population lives in poverty today. U.S. opposition to development loans to India impedes the growth of vital infrastructure, employment, and living standards in the poorest parts of India. That is not the way to improve U.S.-India relations. These loans are being held up by the administration until India signs the CTBT. 
   The President of the United States has more appropriate carrots, as I mentioned at the outset, particularly in the noneconomic area, and particularly those associated with military functions, which could be used rather than these sanctions which hit the poorest people in India. Nuclear proliferation is a vitally important issue, but it should not be the only issue on which we deal with a country such as India, the largest democracy in the world. 
   This is all the more outrageous in view of the news I mentioned about lifting the economic sanctions on North Korea, a country which is run by one of the world's most notorious dictators, a country on the state sponsorship of terrorism list, as I mentioned, a country developing nuclear weapons and which is a direct threat to the United States and our east Asian allies. 
   Think about this for a moment. We are considering right now putting up a missile defense system, putting it in Alaska, and part of the reason is because of what we are fearing from North Korea. Yet we are going to lift economic sanctions there, but we are not going to do it against India? The contrast here is outrageous.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. The U.S. has real, legitimate political and economic security interests with India. We need to engage India on all levels as soon as possible. In fact, seizing the opportunity we have to build greater ties should be one of our main foreign policy goals. That is one that is not taking place. We are, after all, the two most populous democratic nations in the world. Our relationship should be based on shared values and institutions, economic collaboration including enhanced trade and investment, and the goal of regional stability across Asia. 
   I ask the President and other Members to take into consideration how we treat India versus China as well. In China, we are on a very aggressive relationship economically. We will be considering later in this body normalizing permanent trade relations with China. We are saying we need to be engaged with them on a number of different issues. With India we then say no, we are going to put economic sanctions against you, whereas with China we are trying to open up. And China is the one that has missiles pointed this way, that threatens Taiwan, that has weapons proliferation. Religious persecution itself takes place on that continent. I myself have visited with Buddhists who have fled out of Tibet into Katmandu, 
   a number of them walking over the Himalayas in the wintertime to get to freedom. Yet look at how we treat China. We are going to do everything favorable for China, but for India we are going to put on economic sanctions. The contrast is stark. 
   Again, as a major foreign policy objective, we should be looking to India over the next several years to build up this strategic relationship in some respects as an offset to China and what China is doing in South Asia and what China is aspiring to around the world. 
   I do not think anybody is sanguine about where China is heading today. We are going to need partners, and India is a key one for us to look at. It is tough for us to convince them of that if we are going to leave economic sanctions on them. One of the ways to reduce our dependency on China economically is to lift economic sanctions on India and try to build up that relationship even more. 
   These are the key reasons that I put forward this amendment. The differences are so stark as to how we treat China and North Korea versus India. Ask yourself why. I fail to see the reasons for this policy of seeking to reward China, a country that has openly and continually challenged United States interests and values, while at the same time ignoring and punishing India. 
   As the example of North Korea which I mentioned earlier, the inequity of this situation is striking. Why reward a country that is aggressively working against everything for which we stand and, at the same time, punish and blackmail a country with which we share basic values and interests? 
   We should be engaging India as the strategic partner it can become. To do so, we should not be maintaining economic sanctions which serve only to impede the development of this relationship. Maintaining economic sanctions on India which affect the poorest parts of the country is not the way to go about this. 
   The Prime Minister of India, I understand, will be in Washington this fall. I believe it is incumbent upon us to lift these sanctions, and if the administration will not do it, which they have shown to date they will not, then we should.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, while we are in this morning business period, I want to take a few minutes to advise the body about a bill that has cleared through the House and we have held two hearings on in the Foreign Relations Committee and one I hope we are going to be able to clear through here and pass into law during this session. 
   It is a bill dealing with one of the darker sides of the globalization of the world's economy that has occurred around us. Globalization of the world's economy has been, by and large, a very good thing, a positive thing for growth and opportunity, but it also has a seamier side to it. One of the seamier issues that is coming to light now is the international trafficking of primarily young girls in the sex trade, or as its known, international sex trafficking. 
   One is astounded by the level at which this is occurring today around the world. By our own Government's numbers, approximately 600,000 primarily young girls are trafficked from one country to the next for the business of prostitution. 
   There are about 50,000 girls who are, against their will, trafficked into the United States each year into this terrible sort of activity. 
   In January of this year, I was in Nepal and visited a home where girls who have returned from this terrible 
   trafficking of human individuals live. What I saw there was a ghastly sight. There were young girls, 16, 17, 18 years of age, most of whom had been tricked out of their villages in Nepal and promised a job at a carpet factory or a job as a housekeeper in Katmandu--sometimes in Bombay, India these girls took the job offered, not having any other economic opportunities available to them. Once taking the job and moving out of their villages and away from their families they were forced into a brothel. They were locked in a room, beaten, starved, and submitted to the sex trade, at times being subjected to as many as 30 clients a night. 
   I saw them after they had escaped. Or in this case, there was a nongovernmental organization, private sector group that was actually organized to try to return the young girls to Nepal. Once they were freed and got back to Nepal, most of these girls returned only to die. Two-thirds of them come back with such things as AIDS or tuberculosis. They are coming back to die. 
   It is a disgusting, terrible thing that is taking place. We held two hearings in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. We have had witnesses before the committee who had been forced into this trade, tricked into it, deceived into it, or thought they were going to do something else, and were ultimately trafficked into different places around the world. 
   Dr. Laura Lederer of Johns Hopkins University has spent several years tracking this flow. The committee heard from women from Eastern Europe and Europe who had been trafficked into Israel, people who had been trafficked throughout Asia and then  into the United States from Mexico. Most of the trafficking into the United States occurs from Asia. 
   They described the conditions surrounding their being bought and sold. After they are forced into one brothel, if the brothel owner wants somebody else, they will sell this person to another brothel. They told us $7,000, $8,000 will exchange hands for the sale of human flesh from one place to another--all against this person's will. They hated the conditions that they were in, and yet they found themselves unable to escape. 
   This bill that I mention has passed the House of Representatives. It is a bipartisan bill that Congressmen CHRIS SMITH and SAM GEJDENSON have pushed to get passed through the House of Representatives. 
   Senator WELLSTONE and I have the Senate version of this bill. While ours is a different bill, there are a lot of similarities with the House bill--which is at the desk. We are seeking to get it passed, we hope by unanimous consent, by this body because the issue is so terrible, so disgusting, and awful. We need to put some focus on this and have some remedies to it. 
   Increasingly, you are seeing international organized crime groups getting involved in the trafficking of human flesh. Apparently, they believe this is a business they can be successful at, that unlike drugs, it does not involve as many criminal activities because much of this has not been criminalized. They are saying it is a situation where they can resell their ``property.'' Unlike drugs they sell once, they can sell human flesh multiple times. 
   It is just a ghastly, terrible thing that is taking place. Organized crime is increasing its activity in this arena, trafficking. We need to step up and address it. 
   The bill we have put forward would allow the prosecution of people who traffic in human flesh and increase the criminal penalties for doing such. It would provide visas for people who are trafficked into this country, so they can stay and provide evidence, testifying against those who have trafficked them into this country. 
   This bill would provide some help to the countries they come from by providing educational assistance to work with those governments, to work with people that are in-country to work against this sort of activity, and to provide more information to people that sex trafficking is going on on an expanded, global scale. Nearly some 600,000 people a year are trafficked in human flesh. Much of this happens in the United States, 50,000 people are trafficked into the United States on an annual basis. 
   I will happily provide to any offices interested in this issue the hearing record Senator WELLSTONE and I have compiled on this bill, so Members can look into this issue. If they seek to make modifications to improve the bill, our office will be open to work with any office so we can reach unanimous consent on this important issue. It is something we need to and can address. The Administration wants this addressed as well and is working with us to make that happen. The focus on this issue is increasing. In fact, you may have seen one of the recent news reports about this hideous practice. 
   I am hopeful the time is coming where this body will address this, that it will not get held hostage to any other legislative matter that might be having problems. I am hopeful that we see this as clearly something we can address and that needs to be addressed. I will be bringing to the Senate individual stories of people who have been trafficked because they really tell the terrible plight. 
   One lady testified in our committee who was trafficked out of Mexico who thought she was going to get a job washing dishes at a restaurant in Florida. She agreed to having somebody take her across the border illegally. Once in the United States, she was their hostage, she was their slave, if we want to put it in those gross types of terms. They said: Instead of being a dishwasher, you will be a prostitute for us. We are going to move you around in trailers to use, and we will subject you to 30 clients a day and, after that is done, to the owners of this brothel as well. 
   This was the testimony of a witness who reported on activities occurring in this country within the past several years. It is occurring on a large scale. We need to address it; we need to deal with it.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, another issue I am hopeful of getting in front of the Senate this year is a bill to ban gambling on intercollegiate athletics. 
   Yesterday the House held a hearing in the Commerce Committee and a markup on a bill to ban gambling on intercollegiate athletics in the United States. There is only one State in which that can occur today. It is in Nevada. There is clearly a problem we need to address. We have had more points shaving scandals in collegiate sports in the decade of the 1990s than all prior decades combined. There is about $1 billion a year bet on our student athletes. It has been a big problem on our college campuses and is growing. We have one State where it is still legal. In all the rest of the States, this is illegal. In order to deal with the problem of collegiate gambling, we need to make the gambling on our kids illegal. Again, currently it is legal in only one State, and that is Nevada. 
   The NCAA is a strong supporter of banning gambling on college sports as are all the coaches. Yesterday, the House Judiciary Committee heard from Tubby Smith from the University of Kentucky and Lou Holtz, football coach. Both testified strongly in favor of this bill. They want to get this gambling influence contained at the collegiate level. 
   I am hopeful we will reach agreement to have a vote on this issue sometime before the legislative year expires.

    Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to recognize a significant minority enterprise in my home state of Kansas. The venture is Best Harvest Bakery, and its founders are two highly capable and energetic African-American businessmen, Bob Beavers, Jr. and Ed Honesty. Best Harvest is supplying hamburger buns to 560 McDonald's restaurants throughout the Midwest and will supply a new type of soft roll to the U.S. military. As minority suppliers to McDonald's, Bob and Ed join a growing force that last year provided over $3 billion in goods and services to the system. 
   Bob and Ed got their start as McDonald's employees and rose through the ranks to senior positions. Bob started as crew and attained the rank of senior vice president and a position on McDonald's board of directors. Ed joined the company right out of law school and became managing counsel for the Great Lakes Region. Last year, the two left their secure positions to become independent entrepreneurs and suppliers to the company. Bob and Ed chose to locate in Kansas City, Kansas because, as they said, it is ``the heart of the bread basket.'' I along with many others in my home state welcome them and Best Harvest's contribution to our thriving economy. 
   Mr. PRESIDENT, I ask that this article on Bob Beavers and Ed Honesty, published in the April 2000, issue of Franchise Times, be placed in the RECORD, and I encourage my colleagues to read the account of these two outstanding African-Americans and their evolving relationship with McDonald's, which has again demonstrated its commitment to diversity.  
   Former Execs Switch To Supply Side  
   Robert M. Beavers Jr. Started as a part-time McDonald's worker earning $1 an hour. At his girlfriend's suggestion, he took the job during his junior year at George Washington University, because it was close to where she lived. He became an intricate part of the franchisee's business and when it was sold, corporate asked him to come to Oak Brook. In his 36-year career with McDonald's, he climbed the ladder to a senior vice president position and was responsible for bringing hundreds of minority franchisees into the system. He was also the first African American on the hamburger giant's board of directors. 
   Edward Honesty Jr. joined McDonald's right out of law school. He worked his way up to managing counsel for the Great Lakes Region, helped start the Business Counsel Program and was a frequent attendee and speaker at the American Bar Association's Forum on Franchising and the International Franchise Association's Legal Symposium. 
   So why would two men who were at the top of their game decide to give up their expense accounts and their impressive titles to become suppliers? 
   In one word--entrepreneurship. 
   It was because of their contacts at McDonald's and the fact that they knew the system so well, they were able to put together a deal where everyone could rise to the top. 
   ``We look at the McDonald's system as a three-legged stool,'' Beavers said. Each leg--corporate, franchisees and suppliers--are necessary in order to keep the stool on its feet. ``No one has been all three,'' Beavers said. Until now. 
   Beavers is part of an investment group, including Berkshire Partners, that purchased Fresh Start Bakeries from the Campbell Soup Company in 1999. Fresh Start's 14 bakeries worldwide supply 24 percent of McDonald's restaurants in the U.S., 64 percent of the Latin America restaurants and 14 percent of those in Europe. Beavers will serve as a director of Fresh Start. In addition, Beavers and Honesty purchased a majority interest in the Kansas City bakery and formed a joint venture with Fresh Start. Honesty is president and chief operating officer and Beavers is chairman and CEO. 
   They chose buns because it's a core product that McDonald's uses in large quantities, and the Kansas City location because it's in ``the heart of the bread basket'' and close to the McDonald's restaurants they supply. 
   While McDonald's is their largest customer, they don't have a written contract. All arrangements with suppliers at McDonald's are by a handshake, Beavers said. That's the way Ray Kroc started doing business in 1955 and the way the company still does it, he said. ``We (suppliers) have to do our part, they (corporate) have to do their part. It makes for a powerful relationship,'' he said. 
   Structuring the deal with a handshake has served McDonald's well, Beavers said, and ``that's the spirit (in which) I want to grow our business.''

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, today the Senate has resolved to embark upon a unique partnership with Habitat for Humanity International. That is what I want to speak about this morning. In honor of National Homeownership Week, which concludes tomorrow, the Senate will resolve today to lend its support and its elbow grease to a project we call ``The House the Senate Built.'' 
   The idea of this project is to bring Members of the Senate, their staffs, local Habitat affiliates, volunteers, and sponsors together to build simple and decent, affordable housing for low-income families in all 50 States and the District of Columbia, and to do this by the end of 2001. 
   The project will begin with a ``model build'' right here in Washington, DC, slated to begin before National Homeownership Week in 2001. Following this event, Habitat for Humanity International will link Senators with local Habitat affiliates in their respective States. The Senators will then work with these local affiliates to build at least one Habitat house in their States during 2001. 
   So we are going to have 51 houses built by the Senate before the end of 2001. 
   For over 24 years, Habitat for Humanity International has been at the forefront of turning the American dream of owning a home into a reality. Founded by Millard Fuller in 1976, Habitat for Humanity is an ecumenical Christian housing organization to eliminate poverty housing, end homelessness worldwide, and make a decent shelter a matter of conscience and action. 
   Since its inception, Habitat has built over 80,000 homes that have housed over 400,000 people worldwide. This September, Habitat will build its 100,000th home, and they seek to build another 100,000 by 2005. So they started 24 years ago. By September they will have built their first 100,000. In the next 5 years, they hope and anticipate building their next 100,000 homes. 
   I have talked personally and visited a number of times with Millard Fuller. I have had him out to Kansas and hosted him there. He is quite a dynamic individual. He has a great heart and wants to see people around the world living in good housing. And he is getting there, one home at a time, but they are building up fast. 
   Habitat for Humanity relies solely on volunteer labor to build their homes. The remarkable success of Habitat is in large part attributed to the tireless efforts of its founder, Millard Fuller, to continually bring new building partners on board. 
   Over the years, Millard has enlisted the services of foreign Ambassadors, former Presidents--President Carter probably being the most noteworthy and most frequent builder--and even the House of Representatives has helped to aid in building homes at various sites across the country. This year, Millard Fuller has turned to the Senate to build some houses. 
   I ran into Millard as I was waiting to catch my flight back home at the airport in Kathmandu, Nepal, this past January. Sitting there in a small waiting room, thousands of miles away from home, Millard shared with me the vision he had for bringing the Senate together with Habitat for Humanity International. 
   He was in Nepal, building houses and announcing a program there, but at the same time he was also thinking, what could he do to build some through the Senate? That is where we discussed this program. 
   The ``House the Senate Built'' project that was born out of this vision  will undoubtedly be a successful one. We will build the houses. I think we will build a lot more than 51 houses. That is our target. Benjamin Franklin once wrote: ``Well done is better than well said.'' I think that may particularly apply to the Senate. We talk frequently about things. Here is a chance for us to do something about homeownership. 
   I think it is going to be a great project for us to be able to put people in homes. I can come to the floor today in the middle of National Homeownership Week and tell you that we should be committed to end homelessness across the country and eliminate poverty housing, but instead of telling you that, I would rather show you. I would rather pick up a hammer and demonstrate my commitment to affordable housing, nail by nail. 
   I am proud to come to the floor today and discuss this important initiative. This Senate is saying that words of support are not enough. Nothing less than the sweat of our brows will do in expressing how committed the Senate is in making the American dream of homeownership a true reality. 
   I thank the Chair and hope we are going to be able to adopt this resolution yet today. I believe it has been cleared.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, earlier this week, the Senate passed Concurrent Resolution 116, commending Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon. The resolution notes the original reason Israel was forced to occupy a narrow security strip in southern Lebanon--constant attacks on Israeli civilians from Lebanon-based terror groups. Israel had no designs on Lebanese territory; the Jerusalem government was forced to do the job that the central Lebanese authorities were unable or unwilling to perform. 
   Lebanon is in a sad situation. It is a nation torn by sectarian strife, occupied by tens of thousands of Syrian troops, and overrun with terrorists. In the final analysis, however, the government of Lebanon must be called to account. For more than two decades, the international community has bemoaned Lebanon's fate without demanding responsible leadership. That era is now over. 
   There are Christians and Muslins in southern Lebanon whose fate hangs in the balance. They have been under the protection of Israel for more than two decades. What will happen to them? Will they be subject to the whims of yet another Lebanese militia, a Hezbollah state within a state? Will Christians be forced to flee, as they have from the West Bank and from so many other states? Or will the Lebanese central government and the Lebanese Army, as required under United Nations Security Council resolutions, take control of southern Lebanon and ensure safety and security for all? 
   Will the Lebanese government allow the United Nations and UNIFIL to do its job and deployment throughout the South? Or will Lebanon remain a pawn in the hands of terrorists, a puppet state in the hands of Syria and Iran? This is the test. The President and the Congress have demanded that Lebanon secure its southern border and reintegrate southern Lebanese into the country. Hezbollah must be disarmed. The Syrian military must be evicted. The world is watching and the time is now. 
   The citizens of northern Israel--indeed all Israelis--deserve to live within secure borders in peace. If they cannot, it is the solemn obligation of the Israeli government to secure those borders and to hunt down those who violate it and eliminate them. For my part as a United States Senator, I intend to do all that I can to support Israel in that aim, and to ensure that the means and the political, diplomatic and material support are at hand for the Israeli government to do just that. 
   This month could be a turning point for Lebanon, for Syria and for Israel. Or it could be the beginning of a new cycle of conflict. I pray that the Lebanese and the Syrians will be smart enough to seize the opportunity for real peace in the Middle East.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that I think is going to be a significant issue for U.S. agriculture and the environment both. It's the Domestic Carbon Storage Incentive Act of 2000. I am putting forward a concept that is being talked about more and more, a concept called carbon farming, where we encourage the agriculture industry to farm in such a way that the plant life pulls CO  
   2 out of the air, fixes carbon in the ground, releases oxygen in an ever-increasing amount. There are farming techniques that can fix or sequester more carbon in the ground. What we are doing with this bill is encouraging more of that carbon sequestration, pulling more of the CO 
   2 out of the air thus reducing some of the greenhouse gases that are in the air, whether they are there by natural or man-made sources. It is a win for the environment and it is a win for agriculture, I think it is a very positive thing we can do in encouraging good agricultural stewardship and good environmentalism. 
   With this bill we are providing financial incentives to landowners who increase conservation practices which, as I describe, help pull carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and store it as carbon in the soil. This bill seeks to encourage the positive contributions to the environment made by the agriculture industry. I am joined in this bill by my friend, Senator KERREY of Nebraska and Senator MURKOWSKI of Alaska along with a number of others. 
   For some time now I have been looking at a way for a way to approach environmental issues from an incentive-based proactive stance. I think it is important we break away from the regulatory model we have been in on the environment. We have basically said all sticks on this: If you do this we are going to do this to you on environmental rules and issues. It has all been a regulatory approach. I think it is important we engage the markets and create an incentive approach, and that is what this bill does. I believe we are on the verge of seeing agriculture come into a whole new market with this type of approach, an environmental market where producers will benefit rather than be burdened by environmental concerns. 
   U.S. agriculture has long been appreciated for its ability to feed the world. As any good farmer knows, in order to grow good crops you must take care of the land, be a steward of the land. Farmers take this role very seriously. My family farms. My dad and my brother are both full-time farmers. But sometimes markets and economic stress make conservation very difficult to pursue. This bill would help offset some of the costs to expand conservation practices. 
   It is this sort of eco-agriculture that we should encourage and enhance to deal with environmental concerns, rather than resorting to governmental regulations and mandates to solve our problems. Farmers want to do the right thing. They have more reason than anybody else to preserve and protect the land, the land and the water and the air--but Government and markets do not always make that job very easy. 
   I applaud my colleague, Senator ROBERTS, for all the work he has done in this area. His bill that he has to enhance carbon sequestration research has called needed attention to a very important area, the research work that we need to do about what practices fix the most carbon into the ground and what ones are the most helpful to the atmosphere. These two approaches, working together, the research on how we can do it better and 
   more of it, along with more incentives to put that research into practice, I think are a good tandem. 
   Why do we do this? Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas believed to contribute to global warming. While there is debate over the role which human activity plays in speeding up the warming process, there is broad consensus that there are increased carbon levels in the atmosphere today. Until now, the only real approach seriously considered to address climate change was an international treaty which calls for emission limits on carbon dioxide, which would mean limiting the amount that comes from your car, your business and your farm. 
   The Kyoto treaty also favored exempting developing nations from emissions limits, putting the U.S. economy at a distinct disadvantage. Approaching the issue of climate change in this fashion would be very costly and would not respond to the global nature of this problem because they are exempting several countries already. 
   Instead, the approach I am putting forward encourages offsetting greenhouse gases through improved land management and conservation. As a result, these practices will also lead to better water quality, less runoff pollution, better wildlife habitat, and an additional revenue source for farmers. It truly is one of those win-win propositions for the environment and for agriculture. 
   Specifically, my bill will allow landowners to submit plans detailing practices they would be willing to undertake to store additional carbon in the soil. These plans would then compete for entrance into the program, with the best plans achieving funding. Verification of this program would be similar to current conservation programs, such as the Environmental Quality Incentives Program where farmers need only comply with the practices they set forth in the contract. The program is limited to 5 million acres and is not a setaside. Rather, this bill encourages conservation practices such as no-till farming, buffer strips, and biomass production, to name a few, which are known to enhance the soil's ability to store carbon. 
   Under this program, contracts will be for a minimum of 10 years and USDA will be required, in conjunction with other agencies and land grant universities, to finalize criteria for measuring the carbon-storing ability of various conservation practices. This objective will be greatly enhanced by the 
   organizations such as Kansas State University in my home State, which have conducted significant research already on ways that various carbon-storing practices occur in agriculture. 
   Agriculture can play a substantial role in protecting the environment if we put these incentives forward. One might ask, is there benefit to carbon storage? Are we talking about significant numbers? Listen to some of these numbers. The total carbon sequestration and fossil fuel offset potential of U.S. croplands is currently estimated at 154 million metric tons of carbon per year, or 133 percent of the total greenhouse gas emissions by all these activities. In other words, even current agricultural croplands have the ability to store carbon in the soil. Imagine how much more this process can be enhanced if a focused effort is made. 
   Early estimates indicate that the potential for a carbon market for U.S. agriculture could reach $5 billion per year for the next 30 to 40 years. Carbon markets are already emerging in the private sector with farmers selling their carbon-storing practices to utilities. There is a Consortium for Agriculture Soils Mitigation of Greenhouse Gases that is marketing this already. 
   Farmers are already beginning to look toward carbon sequestration or carbon farming practices as a potential new market. Between 1998 and 1999, Iowa farmers grew and harvested 4,000 tons of switchgrass for use by a utility. These farmers not only benefit from the sale of the biomass commodity itself but are able to sell the additional benefit they are providing in growing the switchgrass, which is carbon sequestration. This bill will allow all farmers to progress toward verification  and potential sale of carbon benefits to third parties. 
   The estimated amount of carbon stored in world soils is more than twice the carbon living in vegetation or in the atmosphere. Approximately 50 percent of the soil organic carbon has been lost from the soil over a period of 50 to 100 years of cultivation. This loss represents the potential for storage of carbon in the soil. 
   In the tall grass prairie located in Kansas, Kansas State University researchers have demonstrated an increase of approximately 2 tons of carbon per acre through increased conservation practices--2 tons additional carbon pulled out of the air and put into the ground per acre. That demonstrates the potential in rangeland soils, and there are already a number of agricultural practices which enhance carbon sequestration. 
   Obviously, carbon sequestration has a lot to offer as an environmental and agricultural policy. It is something that can provide a win-win situation for the environment and agriculture as we look forward to an era of another income source and a good way the environment and agriculture can work together. 
   Mr. President, I introduce the bill on behalf of myself, Mr. KERREY, Mr. MURKOWSKI, and a number of other cosponsors.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, today, May 9, is the 200th anniversary of the birth of a famous American who remains probably the most controversial figure in U.S. history. On May 9, 1800, John Brown was born. It is his birth and his life and the institution of slavery that I will speak about this evening for a few minutes. 
   I grew up in eastern Kansas. As a child, I played on the ground where John Brown stayed most often while he was in Osawatomie, KS. He was known as Osawatomie Brown for his fighting during the early phases of what led to be the Civil War. He stayed at the Adaire cabin. His brother-in-law was a minister in Osawatomie. It was on property which my grandparents owned that the cabin was later moved, to the park where the Battle of Osawatomie took place. That park was dedicated by Teddy Roosevelt. Such was the importance of what took place there in the epic struggle in this country to end the institution of slavery. 
   John Brown, the renowned abolitionist, was hanged for his attempt to incite a slave rebellion at Harper's Ferry, VA. Yet even though everyone objects to his tactics, his death has become ``the symbol of every element opposed to slavery.'' His contemporary, Frederick Douglass, the great African American abolitionist, acknowledged that ``John Brown began the war that ended American slavery and made this a free Republic.'' 
   This 200th anniversary is a reminder of the heartache wrought by slavery in America. It is a humble tribute to the suffering of millions of African Americans who lived and died under dehumanizing bondage. John Brown is a part of that story. 
   He was born in Litchfield County, CT, on May 9, 1800, and 
   absorbed a deep hatred of the pervasive institution of chattel slavery early in his life. Once, while herding his father's cattle to market a long distance, he watched as a slave boy his age, whom Brown had befriended, was violently beaten with an iron shovel. He was acquainted with the common forms of punishment wherein ``slaves were stripped of their clothing, faced against a tree or wall, tied down or made to hang from a beam, their legs roped together with a rail or board between them, and severely beaten.'' Such things surely motivated his increasing disdain. He internalized a passage from the Bible, Hebrews 13:3, which says:  
   Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; and them which suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body.  
   The English Parliamentarian, William Wilberforce, and other people of courage, had ended slavery in Great Britain by 1807. Yet in John Brown's America, slavery thrived and grew as the American cotton trade boomed from 1815 until 1860, aggressively capturing the European market. By 1860, there were 4 million slaves in America. No one knows the total number of slaves from the time of the first settlers in 1619 to the end of the Civil War in 1865, but the number is staggering--in the several millions. 
   Particularly during the 17th and 18th centuries, multitudes of people had been abducted from Africa to America. Their month-long passage epitomized the degradation to follow:  
   Segregated by gender, the blacks were chained together and packed so tightly that they often were forced to lie on their sides in spoon fashion. Clearances and ships' holds often were only two to four feet high. In bad weather or because of some perceived threat, they had to remain below, chained to one another, lying in their own filth. ``The floor of the rooms,'' one 18th-century ship observer wrote, ``was so covered with blood and mucus which had proceeded from them in consequence of dysentery, that it resembled a slaughter house.'' Slave ships were smelled before they were seen, as they entered the harbor in heinous conditions.  
   It is said that slavery contemporary to this time was the largest manifestation of human bondage in the history of mankind. I ask, how could this great nation, birthed in freedom, systematically and shamelessly reap great fortunes, in part, on the backs of abducted, brutalized people? How could human beings be branded like cattle, bought and sold at will in the middle of a busy market place, ripped from their families, raped with impunity resulting in children who were then also enslaved, lashed with bullwhips, murdered without consequence, worked to death, their very humanity mocked in every possible way? One American commenting on our slave trade overseas remarked, ``We are a byword among the nations.'' It was in this evil time that John Brown began to champion political and social equality for African-Americans, as did a growing number of abolitionist societies which mushroomed in the 1830's. 
   In 1850, the Fugitive Slave Act was passed by Congress whereby harboring people escaping from slavery, even to the free states, became a Federal crime. This crime carried a penalty of up to 6 months of incarceration and a $1,000 fine, which was a substantial sum considering that the average daily wage was $1.50. Moreover, the act provided that Federal agents would not be charged in tracking escapees, even in the North, forcing slaves back to their masters. Consider that American taxes were paying for this wretched service of slave catching, in a country whose revolution was synonymous worldwide with a renowned liberty. 
   In protest, John Brown, like many abolitionists of his day, provided assistance to fugitive slaves seeking freedom in the northern United States and Canada. Also, fugitive slaves lived with him and his family, despite the threatened penalties. At one point, he moved his family to North Elba, NY, to live with a community of escaped and redeemed slaves, to teach reading and faming. 
   Another blow occurred in 1854 when the Kansas and Nebraska Act was passed by Congress, repealing earlier legislation which had outlawed slavery in the territory from which Kansas was created. This new act allowed residents to vote on whether or not slavery would be adopted by the new state, making it an option for the first time. 
   so Kansas and Nebraska could be slave States. 
   It was the common thinking of the time that actually what would happen was Nebraska would become a free State and Kansas a slave State; that Iowans would pour over into Nebraska, making it a free State; Missourians would pour over into Kansas, and Kansas would become a slave State; thus, the balance would be maintained. 
   In response, John Brown and family members moved to Kansas in 1855 to oppose the expansion of slavery into the western territories, as did a flood of Free Soilers, as free state advocates were called, from the East. The free state epicenter was the city of Lawrence, which attracted many Eastern anti-slavery people and became a target for destruction by the Border Ruffians. 
   During this time, pro-slavery forces terrorized Kansan free state settlers with beatings, shootings, looting, and ballot stuffing. An English traveler observed that ``murder and cold-blooded assassination were of almost daily occurrence.......Murderers, if only they have murdered in behalf of slavery, have gone unpunished; whilst hundreds have been made to suffer for no other crime than the suspicion of entertaining free-state sentiments.'' Numerous Kansas conflicts included the Wakarusa War, the sacking of Lawrence, and the battles of Black Jack, Osawatomie, and the Spurs. In this brutal period, Brown became a national symbol of ``Bleeding Kansas'' and the free state struggle. During his 3 years of activity in the Kansas Territory, he orchestrated offensives against the Border Ruffians, and helped to liberate dozens of enslaved African-Americans by force from Missouri farms. Sadly, he participated, tacitly or overtly, in the killing of 5 men at Pottawatomie Creek in a shameful incident which  still haunts his legacy today. These were dangerous times generating extreme responses from both sides. 
   During the presidential elections of 1856, the conflict crescendoed, and the central debate was slavery in Kansas. That year, the new Republican party ``emerged with a single plank in its platform: Stop the bloody struggle in Kansas; stop the spread of slavery in the territories.'' Finally, Kansas was birthed a free state in 1861. Her motto, Ad Astra Per Aspera--To the Stars Through Difficulty, is an historic truth, reflecting a people whose freedom had been won through unusual hardship and conflict. This is the extraordinary heritage of Kansas, and it is linked with John Brown. 
   His actions in Kansas, followed by his attempt to incite a slave insurrection at Harper's Ferry, Virginia on October 16, 1859 forced a renewed examination of the institution of slavery and strengthened the resolve of the North to resist further expansion. President Abraham Lincoln, condemned the tactics of John Brown at the time of his death as we all do now and did not object to his execution on December 2, 1859 for treason against the state. Nevertheless, Lincoln told an Atchison, Kansas audience that Brown had ``shown great courage, rare unselfishness'' and ``agreed with us in thinking slavery wrong.'' On that December day of his execution, his words rang prophetically true, foretelling the coming Civil War, when he stated, ``I, John Brown, am now quite certain that the crimes of this guilty land will never be purged away but with blood. I had, as I now think, vainly flattered myself that without very much bloodshed it might be done.'' 
   Those were his words on the way to the gallows. 
   In this fight for which he had sacrificed everything, John Brown's excesses were as extreme as his hatred of slavery. His willingness to shed blood is wrong, should not be romanticized, nor justified, no matter the cruelty of the circumstances. Yet we should remember the sacrifices that he, and others like him, both black and white, made to procure the freedom of an entire people. A contemporary, Franklin Sanborn, summarized this best: ``We saw this lonely and obscure old man choosing poverty before wealth, renouncing the ties of affection, throwing away his ease, his reputation, and his life for the sake of a despised race and for zeal in the defense of his country's ancient liberties.'' 
   Therefore, let us remember this 200th anniversary of John Brown and the crooked path we walked as a nation towards freedom for all.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about our vision for the future, our vision for the future of education and why that is important for the future. We have to provide a high-quality education to the students of the United States in order for them to be able to compete, for them to be able to grow, for them to be able to prosper into our future. I think it is critical at this juncture that we in this country talk about what that vision is of our future, that vision of education in our future. 
   We are talking about a different model. We are talking about a different way to go. We are talking about more innovation. We are talking about more individual decisionmaking. We are talking about a system which will allow students in that individual classroom, and teachers and local boards of education and States, to make more decisions about their future than they have had the freedom to make, using education dollars, at any time in the past. 
   This is a model we followed previously. I think the correct model to look at is welfare reform that this Congress, in 1995 and 1996, debated and passed. It was major welfare reform legislation in that we went from a federalized system of one-size-fits-all rules and regulations to a State system. We set up some parameters and guidelines at the outset. We said our objective was to get people to work and have the freedom of the workforce and not continue to be strapped down in a system that did not allow individuals to blossom. It was a system that confined people, in many cases, to failure. 
   We said we were going to let the States innovate. We were going to let the States work to help people more instead of having this one-size-fits-all system. It has been a brilliant success in welfare reform. Welfare rolls are down 50 percent. People are working and receiving a check in the mail, and they are happy about it; they are in charge of their future rather than thanking the Federal Government for a small subsistence payment to mire them in poverty all of their lives. 
   It was innovation, it was opportunities, it was local decisionmaking, and it has been wildly successful. We want to replicate that model in education--local decisionmaking, innovation, individual opportunities, and I think this is going to be wildly successful if we are given the opportunity from our colleagues on the other side of the aisle in the Democratic Party to allow us to move forward with this model of education reform. 
   I hope we do not get hung up as we did last week on the marriage tax penalty saying, to pass marriage tax penalty, we want to deal with germane amendments, and then we were stopped by a number of nongermane amendments on topics that were not relevant at all to the marriage tax penalty. It appears we are starting down the same track. 
   We want to do something significant in education reform. We can do it. We have the time, we have the floor, and we have the opportunity. Or are we going to be stopped by things that simply do not pertain to education at all? 
   The Democratic Party is going to have to decide whether we move forward with an education bill or this is just another chance to block major legislation and complain about a Congress that does not do anything when there are those on their side of the aisle who seek to stop us from doing anything. 
   In a vision of the future, I imagine a future in which a human being actually steps onto another planet in our solar system, and I imagine that the coming generations will look forward and say: We do not fear cancer as a major threat to health. In fact, the odds may be pretty good we both have a pretty accurate vision of opportunities in the future. 
   Indeed, at this point in our Nation's history, in the wee hours of a new millennium, we have tremendous potential to accomplish things that until now have been unimaginable--eliminating cancer as a major health risk in the country or going to other planets. 
   However, for the future to become how we envision it today, our Nation's children must receive a first-class education. Over the next couple of weeks, we will have a chance to address our visions for the future in providing that first-rate education for our children. 
   When I say visions for education, I use the plural for a reason. When Senators from both sides of the aisle close their eyes and envision the future of American education, they often see very different results. One vision about which we have heard quite a bit in the past few weeks is the vision of the status quo. Some want to move into the new century using the old model which spends education funds through specific categories that the Department of Education sees fit. They will continue to hold school districts accountable primarily for filling out their paperwork correctly and on time. 
   In one sense, this model is very successful. This model has been successful at creating programs. Currently, ESEA is comprised of over 60 different programs, each one specifically tailored to address a problem or problems with public education that Washington perceives. With 46 million students in approximately 87,000 public schools, it is pretty impressive that we can figure out their needs so well from here--one place. 
   The status quo model has also been extremely successful at holding States, school districts, and schools accountable for filling out paperwork. While the Government provides only 7 
   percent of local school funding, it demands 50 percent of all school paperwork. Those are pretty bad odds. In fact, some State education agencies devote 45 percent of their staff to administering the funds they receive from the Federal Government. Quite wasteful. 
   This paperwork burden demands 49 million hours each year, or the equivalent of 25,000 employees working full time on paper rather than kids. Indeed, fewer than 50 percent of the personnel employed by public schools are teachers today. 
   Unfortunately, with all of its success over the past 30 years, the status quo model has been a failure in one very important aspect, and that is student performance. Many of the status quo programs have been specifically targeted toward low-income students. Yet in the fourth grade, 77 percent of the children in urban high-poverty schools are below basic on the National Assessment of Educational Progress test.  
   Problems with student performance are not confined to urban districts. These problems have touched the lives of literally millions of Americans. Since 1983, over 10 million students have reached the 12th grade without having learned to read. Over 20 million have reached their senior year unable to do basic math. 
   The bill before us has in it a different vision for American education. This new vision is the vision of innovation versus the vision of status quo. Under this model of innovation, instead of relying on Washington to assess the problems facing 46 million students, we rely on the parents, teachers, and principals who know the children's names. Instead of counting on the bureaucrats at the Department of Education to figure out the needs of 87,000 public schools, we leave it up to the school board members and State education officials who can tell you about the neighborhood where the school is located. 
   Under this model, we count on these people to identify the problems facing our students and schools and to be innovative in finding a solution to fix these problems. 
   This model has already started to work in places such as my State of Kansas. Over the past 3 years in Kansas, we have seen Federal education funds increase by over $21 million. However, when one talks to the people who deal with the Federal education funds, they want to talk about the success of consolidated planning, which Kansas implemented under an Ed-Flex waiver. 
   Consolidated planning was a modest step which helped eliminate some unnecessary bureaucracy and helped the State use Federal funds more efficiently. More than that, it gave Kansans a taste of what can be accomplished with a little innovation. I want to give Kansas and the rest of the Nation more room, an incentive to be innovative. That is why I support the bill before us today. 
   Under the leadership of the Senator from Vermont and other colleagues such as Senator GREGG, our committee was able to produce a piece of legislation that takes very important steps toward the innovator model, the first being the Straight A's proposal about which several of my colleagues have already spoken. 
   In conclusion, we have had a taste of this in education, and it has worked. We like the taste of it, and we like what it produces. We experienced it in welfare reform, and we have seen enormous success. 
   Let's move forward with this innovation. Let's allow this opportunity to blossom so our kids not only can envision but fulfill the dreams of going to other planets and of curing cancer, but they need a quality education to fulfill those dreams. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to address a number of issues that have been raised recently on the marriage tax penalty elimination bill. We will be voting at noon on a cloture motion. We have the opportunity at noon to vote on whether or not to proceed to this issue. We have the opportunity then, as well, to consider any relevant amendments. 
   That needs to be made perfectly clear. Amendments are in order after the cloture motion. The only issue is whether or not they pertain to or are germane to marriage tax penalty relief. All of those will be open and debatable. If there is a Democratic alternative they think is better on the marriage tax penalty, that is relevant, we can deal with that. We will debate it. We can vote on it, if we can finally get to cloture on this issue. 
   We need to be very clear that there is no blockage on amendments relevant to the marriage tax penalty. All relevant ones will be and can be considered after the cloture vote so we can move forward with this issue. What would not be relevant is nongermane issues, issues outside of the point of the marriage tax penalty. 
   There have been raised on the floor this morning several inaccuracies I wish to clear up. There is a statement going around that somehow 60 percent of the tax relief in this bill doesn't deal with the marriage tax penalty. I disagree with that. One hundred percent of the relief proposed in this bill goes to married couples. I don't know who they are claiming the 60 percent goes to, but 100 percent of this relief goes to married couples. I will make it very clear: It isn't 60 percent of this going to businesses or 60 percent of it going to farmers or 60 percent of it going to some other category; 
   100 percent goes to married couples. That is indisputable. I want to talk about the nature of the bill so people can get that fresh in their minds. We talked about it 2 weeks ago, but some time has passed. I will talk about what our bill does. 
   Our bill eliminates the marriage tax penalty in the standard deduction. Here are the nuts and bolts. The standard deduction this year for a single taxpayer is $4,400. However, for a married couple filing jointly, the standard deduction is $7,350. It should be $8,800, if it is fair. What we are doing is making it fair. Let's make it $8,800. 
   Second, our bill widens the 15-percent tax bracket. Under current law, the 15-percent bracket for a single taxpayer ends at an income threshold of $26,250. But for married couples, the bracket is not double; it ends at $43,850. It should end, if it were fair, at $52,500. That is what our bill does. It moves it for the double filing couple to $52,500. That is  fair. That is something that should be in the Tax Code and should be allowed. 
   Third, our bill applies that same principle of doubling that income bracket on the 15-percent bracket, and we provide that into the 28-percent bracket as well. 
   Fourth, our bill increases the phaseout range for the earned-income tax credit; that is, on the EITC, there is a marriage tax penalty there. With the earned-income tax credit, you don't double the benefits for a married couple. Clearly, we should. Low-income families with children can incur a significant penalty, and they do, because of the current limits on the EITC. If both spouses work, phaseout of the EITC on the basis of combined income can lead to the loss of some or all of the EITC benefits to which they would be entitled as singles. Our bill works to begin fixing this problem. The Senate Finance Committee proposal that comes out would do that. 
   Finally, our bill would permanently extend the provision that allows the personal nonrefundable credits to offset both the regular tax and the minimum tax. It is important that American families receive the full benefit of the tax cuts they were promised. This important change will allow America's families to maintain the $500 per child tax credit, HOPE scholarship, adoption credit, and many others. 
   So those are the nuts and bolts of the bill. That is where the tax is occurring. That is where we would alleviate the marriage tax penalty. That is it. That is what the bill is about. So the notion that it doesn't go to married couples is erroneous. It benefits a lot of people. Currently, the marriage tax penalty is on about 25 million American married couples. I have shown this chart previously. In Kansas, we have over 259,000 couples paying a marriage tax penalty. On average, as the Senator from Wyoming noted, it is about $1,400 per couple. 
   We have, I think, a lot of unfairness in the Tax Code. Typically, we try to benefit things that we think are helpful in the Tax Code and tax things that we think are harmful. If that is the typical analysis, then in this situation we must believe that marriage is harmful because we are taxing it. But the record is far different on that. Marriage is a good thing. It is a central value-creating institution for the American family. Anybody for family values ought to be for marriage. It is around that central unit that the family builds the values it shares with the children, and then later with the grandchildren and great grandchildren; that emanates from that central unit. 
   This is a very good thing, a very positive thing. 
   The institution of marriage has been under attack in recent years. The number of people getting married has gone down substantially. A University of Rutgers study points this out. I want to quote it so that people have that information:  
   According to a recent study, marriage is in a state of decline from 1960 to 1996. The annual number of marriages per thousand adult women declined by almost 43 percent.  
   I guess our policy is getting through. By taxing something we apparently want less of, we are succeeding. That is, in my estimation, bad public policy. If you look at the situation around which children do the best overall, it is in that stable environment, with two parents in a long-lasting relationship of marriage. That is where children do best. That is not to say that a number of single parents don't struggle heroically to raise good children. They do. But, overall, the statistics are that they do best in a two-parent household. 
   As a matter of fact, the statistics are that in a single-parent household--and many struggle greatly to raise good children, and they do a good job, but the overall statistics are very troubling in single-parent households where children are twice as likely to be involved in a crime, twice as likely to drop out of school, twice as likely to be abused, and twice as likely to abuse alcohol or drugs. 
   This is just not a good situation. That is not to say that many single parents don't struggle heroically to do a good job. Still, we as public policymakers should not tax marriage so that we have less of it. We should be providing relief to married couples. 
   I want to address this issue some have raised of a marriage bonus built into this package. I think you could justify, on public policy grounds, actually doing that, but I don't think it is here. I think you can justify that as well. Our bill provides marriage tax penalty relief to working American families by doubling the lowest two tax brackets and standard deductions, and also in the EITC bracket. Our bill also treats all married couples the same, whether both spouses work outside the home or just one. That seems to be fair as well. 
   The Democrat alternative does not treat all married couples the same. In fact, by giving preferences only to dual-earner families through choice of filing, that creates a homemaker penalty. For a spouse that decides to stay home and do the hard work of taking care of children, parents, or others, they create a penalty in that situation. The other alternative--the Democrats' alternative--would make families with one earner and one who stays at home to take care of children or elderly parents pay higher taxes than families with the same household income as two-earner families. Why should we discriminate against one-earner families? Why would we want a Tax Code that penalizes families because one of the spouses chooses the hard work of the household over the role of the breadwinner? Believe me, it is hard work. I don't think it is a situation that we would want to enshrine within our Tax Code because, again, what we do by taxing it is penalizing them and saying we want less of it. 
   Do we want to send the message across the country that we want less parents involved in raising their children? Clearly, the signal we are getting across America reflects that we want more parents involved and more parental involvement with children. We need more time involved with the family, not less. So we don't want to enshrine in the Tax Code a situation where we are actually saying we don't want more parents involved and having more time with their children. We should be sending the opposite signal across this Nation. The alternative the Democrats have put forth says we don't think we should have as much parental involvement. I think that is a bad way to go. 
   This is a simple bill. We are trying to address what the President says he wants. He wants to deal with the marriage tax penalty. We are trying to address that. We are trying to send him a bill that deals with the marriage tax penalty. Let's take all relevant amendments on the marriage tax penalty. We will take those, come what may, and get this voted out and get it on over to the President. The House has passed it. We are here and we are ready to vote on it. We will have the cloture motion vote at noon. I urge my colleagues, let's get on to this issue and go ahead and present it. 
   Mr. President, the Senator from Texas had 30 minutes reserved for this issue. I don't know if the Senator from Oklahoma wants to speak on that time. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Oklahoma on the time of the Senator from Texas.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I will use 5 minutes of that and reserve 5 minutes of that time for the Senator from Texas. 
   Mr. President, I want to note a couple of things as we wrap this debate up, have a chance to vote on the marriage tax penalty in America, send that bill to conference, and ultimately to the President. 
   There is a fundamental principle that I talked about previously which exists and has worked repeatedly in this country. If you tax something, you will get less of it. If you subsidize it, you will get more of it. We have been taxing marriage, and we are getting less of it. 
   The Rutgers study that I cited shows a 43-percent decline in marriage in the period between 1960 and 1996. At the same time, fewer adults are getting married. Far more young Americans are cohabitating. During that same period of time, cohabitation went up 1,000 percent. We subsidize that side of it. We tax getting married. 
   When marriage as an institution breaks down, the children suffer.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   I thank the distinguished Democratic leader. 
   When the institution of marriage breaks down and we tax it, we cause it to break down further. The children do suffer. 
   A number of single parents struggle heroically and do a good job of raising their children. But the best institution to raise those children in and to build family values that we have all talked about is the institution of marriage. That is the best place; the values emanate from that. 
   The past few decades have seen a huge decrease in that institution, as the study I have just cited from Rutgers points out. We are taxing marriage across the country. So we are getting what we are paying for--fewer marriages. That is happening. We are taxing over 259,000 of them in the State of Kansas. That is not good for the children. 
   The past few decades have seen the problems befall our children because of that overall situation, the well-being of children in virtually all areas of life--physiologically, psychologically, health-wise, sociologically, academic achievement, and the likelihood of suffering physically. 
   They are better off in that stable, two-parent family--not to say that a number of single parents don't do a very good job. They do. Overall, statistically, they are still better off in that two-parent, stable family.  
   As a couple, Gary and Karla Gipson, wrote to me and stated:  
   If they are really interested in putting children first, then why do we in this country penalize the institution of marriage where kids do best? When parents are truly committed to each other through their marriage vows, their children's outcomes are enhanced.  
   That is supported by studies. It is supported by, frankly, common sense. The marriage tax penalty to an extent is a penalty that our children have to bear. It is a penalty on children. That is unacceptable. Newlyweds face enough challenge without paying punitive damages in the form of the marriage tax. 
   The last thing the Federal Government should do is penalize the institution that is the foundation of a civil society. 
   I am hopeful, as this bill is considered on the floor, we will be able to have a reasoned debate and we will be able to work across the aisle in a bipartisan fashion to achieve marriage penalty relief for millions of Americans who are adversely affected by this provision of our Tax Code. We can have that debate on the issue. 
   There is more to do. The marriage penalty is embedded many places, and we could continue, and should continue, to work on that. But, overall, if we are truly interested in the health of our children, if we are truly interested in trying to instill and support family values across this country, if we truly do support that, I do not know how you get around the situation of saying, by taxing marriage, we are going to get less of it, and that is a bad thing for our children. 
   Let's look at this for what it does to the children. Let's provide that support and help to that married couple. Let's provide the support and help, whether it is a two-wage-earner or a single-earner family where one chooses to do the hard work of taking care of the children or an aging parent or a relative. Why would we penalize that situation? 
   For that reason, I urge my colleagues to support the cloture motion and let's get on to this bill. 
   I reserve the remainder of the 5 minutes to the Senator from Texas.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank the Chair and the Senator from Iowa. 
   Mr. President, I say to all my colleagues, this is the vote on marriage tax penalty relief. If you support marriage tax penalty relief, vote for cloture so we can consider this bill. We can send a clean bill to the President. If you are not for marriage tax penalty relief, do not vote for cloture. 
   This is the vote on whether or not we are going to grant marriage tax penalty relief to nearly 25 million American couples. That is what this vote is all about now. It is not about a whole bunch of extraneous amendments. It is about the marriage tax penalty. 
   If you ran on this issue, this is your chance to vote to say: I am for eliminating the marriage tax penalty. If you ran on it, this is the time to stand up and say: I am for eliminating the marriage tax penalty. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to vote for cloture to go to the bill. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation entitled the International Anti-Trafficking Act of 2000 which combats the insidious practice of trafficking of persons worldwide. 
   As we begin the 21st Century, the degrading institution of slavery continues throughout the world. Sex trafficking is a modern day form of slavery, and it is the largest manifestation of slavery in the world today. 
   Every year, approximately 1 million women and children are forced into the sex trade against their will, internationally. They are usually transported across international borders so as to ``shake'' local authorities, leaving the victims defenseless in a foreign country, virtually held hostage in a strange land. It is estimated that at least 50,000 women and children are brought into the United States annually, for this purpose. The numbers are staggering, and growing rapidly. Some report that over 30 million women and children have been enslaved in this manner since the 1970's. I believe this is one of the most shocking and rampant human rights abuses worldwide. 
   One of two methods, fraud or force, is used to obtain victims. The most common method, ``fraud,'' is used with villagers in under-developed areas. Typically the ``buyer'' promises the parents that he is taking their young daughter to the city to become a nanny or domestic servant, giving the parents a few hundred dollars as a ``down payment'' for the future money she will earn for the family. Then the girl is transported across international borders, deposited in a brothel and forced into the trade, until she is no longer useful (becoming sick with AIDS). She is held against her will under the rationale that she must ``work off'' her debt which was paid to the parents, which typically takes several years. The second method used for obtaining victims is ``force'' which is used in the cities, where a girl is physically abducted, beaten, and held against her will, sometimes in chains. The routes are specific and definable, and include Burma to Thailand, Eastern Europe to the Middle East, and Nepal to India, among numerous other routes, through which victims of this practice are channeled. 
   Presently, no comprehensive legislation has been adopted, yet, which holistically challenges the practice of trafficking and assists the victims. I am introducing this legislation, the International Anti-Trafficking Act of 2000, today as a companion to the legislation introduced by Congressman CHRIS SMITH and Congressman SAM GEJDENSON, known as the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (H.R. 3244). Senator WELLSTONE has also introduced legislation which closely mirrors the Smith-Gejdenson bill. Our primary difference is the methods for enforcement. Unless the President implements one of the broad waivers granted to him in this legislation, non-humanitarian, non-trade foreign assistance (listed under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961) to countries will be suspended if countries fail to meet the minimum standard to stop the flow of traffickers in their own countries. Please note that there is an extremely broad national interest waiver provision granted to the President which allows him to exempt any and all programs, as well as an additional waiver which allows the President to guard against any adverse effect on vulnerable victims of trafficking, including women and children. 
   This bill presents a comprehensive scheme to ``penalize the full range of offenses'' involved in elaborate trafficking networks. It also provides a doorway of freedom for those who are presently enslaved throughout the world and promotes their recovery in civil society. Some of the provisions include: establishment of an Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking, enhanced reporting by the State Department on this practice, protection and assistance for victims of trafficking, changes in immigration status allowing victims to stay to testify in prosecutions, strengthens prosecution and punishment of traffickers, among other provisions. 
   In short, we believe it's time to challenge this evil slavery practice known as trafficking, and I believe this legislation is a first step to gaining freedom for those who are presently bound.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation awarding the Congressional Gold Medal to Pope John Paul II. 
   Mr. President, Pope John Paul II is the most recognized person in the world, having personally visited tens of millions, in almost every continent and country. He has been one of the greatest pastoral leaders of this century, fearlessly guiding the Catholic Church into the new millennium. Due to his tremendous faith and leadership he was elected bishop at a very early age, and elected to the papacy on October 16, 1978, at the age of 58. 
   Though many people see the Pope as an important statesman, diplomat, and political figure, Pope John Paul II is much more than that. As spiritual leader to the world's 1 billion Catholics, the Pope has commenced a great dialog with modern culture, one that transcends the boundaries of political or economic ideology. 
   As have his predecessors of happy memory, he stands boldly as an ever vigilant sign of contradiction to a culture that is darkened by the clouds of death. In the face of this mounting storm, he has tirelessly proclaimed the need for a culture of life. 
   In what is now one of the Pope's most famous encyclicals, and the one which he regards to be the most significant of this pontificate, Evangelium Vitae (the Gospel of Life), the argues powerfully for an increased respect for all human life:  
   Thirty years later, taking up the words of the Council and with the same forcefulness I repeat that condemnation in the name of the whole Church, certain that I am interpreting the genuine sentiment of every upright conscience: ``Whatever is opposed to life itself, such as any type of murder, genocide, abortion, euthanasia, or willful self-destruction, whatever violates the integrity of the human person, such as mutilation, torments inflicted on body or mind, attempts to coerce the will itself; whatever insults human dignity, such as subhuman living conditions, arbitrary imprisonment, deportation, slavery, prostitution, the selling of women and children; as well as disgraceful working conditions, where people are treated as mere instruments of gain rather than as free and responsible persons; all these things and others like them are infamies indeed. They poison human society, and they do more harm to those who practice them than to those who  suffer from the injury. Moreover, they are a supreme dishonor to the Creator.''  
   That is from the Pope's Evangelium. 
   Mr. President, the urgency of this message--the Pope's message--becomes more acute by the day; particularly at the beginning of the new millennium. 
   The Pope, having witnessed first-hand the brutal inhumanity of Nazi and Communist regimes, understands, in a way few of us can appreciate, the true dignity of each and every human being. He is a crusader against the offenses against human dignity that have transpired in the 20th century. More than any other single person this century, Pope John Paul II has worked to protect the rights of each individual. 
   As well, John Paul II has addressed almost every major question posed by the modern mind at the turn of the millennium. 
   As noted by the biographer of the Pope, George Weigel, the Pope has provided answers to the questions and desires facing today's world: The human yearning for the sacred, the meaning of freedom, the quest for a new world order, the nature of good and evil, the moral challenge of prosperity, and the imperative of human solidarity in the emerging global civilization. Through his teaching, the Pope has brought the timeless principles of truth contained in the gospel into active 
   conversation with contemporary life and thought. The Pope has started a peaceful dialogue between ideas of the modern world and the age-old truths contained in the Gospel message. 
   One of the gospel messages emphasized by the Pope is the need for forgiveness and reconciliation with God, and with our sisters and brothers. A week before his historic personal pilgrimage to the Holy Land the Pope asked forgiveness from God on behalf of Christians who were inactive, or who were not active enough in opposing the forces of evil that have ravaged humanity during the past century. 
   This apology preceded his recent personal pilgrimage to the Holy Land; a pilgrimage in which the Pope opened up yet another dialog--this time with the people of the Middle East--a region ripped apart by centuries old conflict, bitterness, and war. Again, in the Holy Land, he empathized with those who suffered under the tyranny of the Nazi regime. The Pope highlighted during his trip, and he has on other occasions, his deep compassion for those who suffered under the brutality of Hitler's Germany and their genocidal war. 
   In the midst of the conflict in the Holy Land, the Pope again shone through as a beacon of light and peace as he proclaimed yet again to the people of the Middle East and the World, the universal calls to holiness. 
   As the New York Times so eloquently noted after the Pope's visit to Jerusalem's Yad Vashem:  
   John Paul has done more than any modern pope to end the estrangement between Catholics and Jews. He was the first pope to pray in a synagogue, the first to acknowledge the failure of individual Catholics to deter the Holocaust and the first to call anti-Semitism a sin ``against God and man.'' 
   There is a valedictory quality to the Pope's actions and travels as the church approaches its third millennium. He seems determined to trace the birth of Christianity in this epochal year, to right the wrongs of the church and to bring a spirit of conciliation to the Middle East. Not long ago he went to Egypt and visited Mount Sinai, where Moses received God's law. This week he stood atop Mount Nebo in Jordan and looked across the Promised Land. He prayed in silence near the places where Jesus was born and baptized. Most people as infirm as John Paul would not dare make such strenuous trips. But he seems to be a man on a mission, and the world is better for it.  
   That was from the New York Times. 
   He is indeed a man on a mission. His message was peacefully conveyed in the Middle East to peoples with whom he has obvious deep religious differences. His serenity in the midst of such turmoil, as well as his obvious love for all people should be a model for us all as we encounter people in our daily life with whom we radically disagree, or with whom we have had a difficult relationship. 
   His epoch journey to the Holy Land will be remembered by history. And, I have no doubt that his presence there will leave a lasting impression, and I hope that it will work to bring about true peace as well. 
   His trip to the Middle East is just one particular example. The Pope's dialog with the modern era has taken him across the world, and has brought the Church into active conversation with people that many in the modern world have chosen to either forget or to ignore. It is a dialog that is ultimately a challenge to the people of the United States as well. 
   For example, his trip to Cuba initiated a dialog between politically opposed forces both here in America and in Cuba. 
   Also, Pope John Paul II's recent call to forgive the debt incurred by Third World countries during the past century, was and is, a challenge to the industrialized nations of the world to join hands in an effort to begin lifting the forgotten people of heavily indebted countries into the next millennium by providing some of the economic relief that they need. This is the challenge presented to those in industrialized countries, to remember and to help those who are less fortunate. 
   The legislation I just introduced has been cosponsored by 66 of my Senate colleagues, and I am hopeful that we can pass this legislation quickly in order to honor so great a man who has done such great things.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Iowa, Mr. GRASSLEY, for his leadership on this issue and for yielding me time to speak on this bill. 
   I, too, want to comment on the Marriage Penalty Act and the marriage tax penalty elimination, and some of the comments of the Senator from Montana. I wish he was still on the floor. 
   He says we have differences of opinion: The Democrats have a marriage tax penalty bill; the Republicans have one. He thinks theirs is better. Great. Let's have a debate on those two. Let's vote. I do not know when we have had as much clarity of differences between a Democratic bill and a Republican bill, where both parties have said we want to pass a bill on any issue this year, than the bill we have before us. 
   I am pleading with the members of the Democratic Party: Let's have a vote. Let's have a great debate. We will debate your bill for 2 hours, ours for 2 hours, vote on both of these, and let's get this moving forward. 
   If they want to pass a marriage tax penalty elimination bill, we have the time; we have the place; we have the floor; we can have this vote now. If they do not want to, and really all this is about is: Well, we do, but we are going to block this with eight or nine irrelevant amendments; we are really not that interested in doing this, then that should be said as well. They should be out here saying, no, this really isn't a high priority for the Democratic Party to pass, rather than saying, OK, we have a bill, you have a bill, and let's vote. 
   It is time we vote up or down, and we have the time before we go into a recess. 
   The other thing I would like to point out is the President sent us his budget for the fiscal year 2001. I have a copy of the budget the President submitted to us. In his budget, he inserted his support for eliminating the marriage tax penalty. In the President's budget, on the EITC, on page 57, entitled, ``Supporting Working Families,'' he says at the bottom of this page:  
   In this budget, the President builds upon these policies that are central to his agenda of work, responsibility, and family.  
   He says:  
   The budget expands the EITC to provide marriage penalty relief to two earner couples........  
   That is what our bill does. We have a chance to get that particular provision that he is calling for in the budget to the President. 
   Going back now in his budget to the tables of his proposals and his 10-year estimates on it--this is on page 409--he provides for, and it states:  
   Provide marriage penalty relief and increase standard deduction.  
   He does a much smaller one than we have put forward. I think he also even has a smaller one than Senator MOYNIHAN's proposal that came forward in the Finance Committee. But the President has said all along: Let's eliminate the marriage tax penalty. Let's do this. 
   It is in his budget. 
   He has asked us not to send him these gargantuan bills that have 20 different items in them. He asked us to send him one like we did on the Social Security earnings limit test. We passed that bill and sent it to the President. He signed it into law. He appreciated being able to have that degree of clarity and that degree of focus on a particular issue. 
   We have another one. We are having the debate on it. It is the time and the place for us to consider and vote on this now. We need to consider the proposals that the other party has, and to consider our proposals. Let's move this topic forward. 
   The President has said he wants it. I hope the President gets involved in this debate and urges the Senate and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to vote on this issue and to get it to him--if he wants it. He said he did in his budget. If he truly wants this marriage tax penalty relief, let's have a vote, and let's get it to the President. We can do this now. 
   I am fearful. What I am sensing is that we are just getting a lot of delay tactics and no real interest in passing the marriage penalty tax relief. Clearly, there is not an interest to pass it before April 15. 
   People have the right to do those sorts of tactics, if they want to. But I do not think they should hide and say they just have a different bill, when the true desire here is to not have any bill go through at all. 
   This affects a lot of people. We have been over and over this lots of times. It affects 25 million Americans. In Kansas, 259,000-plus people are affected by  this marriage tax penalty that we have in place. The Senator from Montana has 89,000 people who are affected. 
   I am looking forward to the chance and the time when we get to actually vote on these issues. Frankly, I think we have had 
   enough discussion about the Democratic proposal and the Republican proposal. We know what is in these proposals now. We know the costs of these proposals. We are ready to pass this. It is time to vote. I really do not understand too much what is holding this up from moving forward. 
   My colleagues and I have had a number of people contacting our offices saying that this is a penalty they want to see done away with. 
   They have contacted us numerous times. I have worked with the Members of the House of Representatives who have passed this bill already. They have sent to me letters from a number of people from across the country with their specific examples of how they are penalized by the marriage tax penalty. 
   This is a letter from Steve in Smyrna, TN. He says:  
   My wife and I got married on January 1, 1997. We were going to have a Christmas wedding last year, but after talking to my accountant we saw that instead of both of us getting money back on our taxes, we were going to have to pay in. So we postponed it. Now, for getting married, we have to have more taken out of our checks to just break even and not get a refund. We got penalized for getting married.  
   Then he concludes:  
   And that just isn't right.  
   I agree. I presume the Senator from Montana agrees. I presume most of the people on the other side of the aisle agree as well. Let's vote then and get a proposal out of here so we can actually deal with this. 
   Here is one from Wayne in Dayton, OH:  
   Penalizing for marriage flies in the face of common sense. This is a classic example of government policy not supporting that which it wishes to promote. In our particular situation, my girl friend and I would incur an annual penalty of $2,000 or approximately $167 per month. Though not huge, this is enough to pay our monthly phone, cable, water, and home insurance bills combined.  
   I think that is pretty huge when you are talking about that size of a marriage penalty. 
   This one is from Marietta, GA. Bobby and Susan wrote this one:  
   We always file as married filing separately because that saves us about $500 a year over filing married, filing jointly. When we figured our 1996 tax return, just out of curiosity, we figured what our tax would be if we were just living together instead of married. Imagine our disgust when we discovered that, if we just lived together instead of being married, we would have saved an additional $1,000. So much for the much vaunted ``family values'' of our government. Our government is sending a very bad message to young adults by penalizing marriage this way.  
   This is from Thomas in Hilliard, OH.  
   No person who legitimately supports family values could be against this bill. The marriage penalty is but another example of how in the past 40 years the federal government has enacted policies that have broken down the fundamental institutions that were the strength of this country from the start.  
   This one is from David in Guilford, IN:  
   This is one of the most unfair laws that is on the books. I have been married for more than 23 years and would really like to see this injustice changed so my sons will not have to face this additional tax. Please keep up the great work.  
   He goes on. 
   We have a number of different letters. I do not think it really bears going into much longer because what I hear everybody saying is: We are for eliminating the marriage tax penalty. The American public is for doing that. It is the time to do that. We now just have procedural roadblocks to getting it done. 
   That is the bottom line of where we are today. We could vote on this today. We could vote on the Democratic alternative. We could vote on the Republican alternative. We could have up-or-down votes on this today and get this through this body, get it to conference, and on down to the President, and see if he really meant it when he said in his budget that he wanted to do this, the EITC, the marriage tax penalty elimination, to see if he really wants to eliminate the marriage tax penalty. We could see if the President really meant that. 
   I invite the President to get involved in this debate so we can pass this through. 
   I have worked with the administration on a number of bills. I would hope they would start engaging us here saying: Yes, we want to do this and pass this on through. 
   Let's not stall it. Let's get this thing moving forward so we can send this message out across the country. 
   With that, Mr. President, I see several other Members on the floor. It is time to get this moving forward. 
   I just call on my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and say let's not play on this thing. Let's say we are going to pass it. Let's take the votes, and let's move forward. 
   I yield back to my colleague from Iowa. 
   Mr. President, if I have a minute or 2 more--I don't want to take up the time from my colleague of Iowa.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I appreciate the leadership on both sides and their discussion on us moving forward and dealing with the marriage penalty tax. I am glad we are finally coming together, but I would note the Senator from South Dakota has put forward, on behalf of the Democrat side, 10 amendments on this issue. Many of these are not directly relevant to what we are trying to get done. With all due respect to him putting these forward, and I appreciate them working with us some, we have a pretty direct issue in front of us. It is the marriage tax penalty. 
   To tie with it a discussion on prescription drugs, to tie with it discussions on Medicare, on Social Security priorities, on a college tuition tax credit, on conservation reserve programs, on the natural disaster assistance program, really just goes contrary, completely, to us ultimately trying to get this bill through. 
   What we have before us is a marriage tax penalty. We have two alternatives put forward by the Democrat Party. That is good. I think we can have good, direct, clear votes on that, and then we can press forward. 
   With all due respect to the Democratic leader, to call this a risky tax strategy, I think what is at risk if we do not deal with the marriage tax penalty is the institution of marriage in this country. What has happened is there is the fall-off in the number of people getting married, and then we tax them on top of that. That is risky. 
   They have said a number of times that 52 percent does not deal with the marriage tax penalty. It is all directly applicable to the marriage tax penalty.  
   The Democratic proposal actually enshrines in law a new homemaker penalty; that is, when one of the spouses decides to stay at home and take care of the children. The Democrat proposal makes families with one wage earner and one stay-at-home spouse pay higher taxes than a family with two wage earners earning the same income. Why discriminate against one-wage-earner families? That is a direct connection to the marriage tax penalty. That is a marriage tax penalty taking place with the one-wage-earner family. 
   Why do we want a Tax Code that penalizes families because one spouse chooses to work hard at home and one chooses to work hard outside the home? I do not see why we would want to do that. 
   There are a lot of things I like about the Democratic alternative, as far as doing away with the marriage tax penalty in a number of other places in the Tax Code. This notion of penalizing a single-wage-earner family is really not something we should be pressing. 
   More to the point, it makes the entire issue of the marriage tax penalty, all 100 percent of the tax cut, relevant to marriage. They are saying 52 percent of it is not relevant to the family. It is directly relevant to that one-wage-earner family. In many of those cases, they are saying it is not. 
   The other point, and I do not think it needs to be belabored: If we are ready to pass marriage tax penalty relief and both sides agree we need to pass marriage tax penalty relief, why would we take up a series of additional amendments on Medicaid, prescription drugs, Social Security, college tuition tax credit, Conservation Reserve Program, natural disaster assistance? Those are not relevant to the issue. We have a chance to do this particular issue, agree or disagree. 
   If the Democrats think this is too rich, let's vote on their bill; let's have a vote on it. We have the chance now to do that, to hone in on that. I am fearful that what I am seeing is more a block to dealing with the marriage tax penalty.

   Why do we want to tie in 10 other topics? We should not. I hope the Democratic leader and our side can get together and agree on a set of alternatives that are relevant. Let's have a series of votes up or down so we can deal with this marriage tax penalty relief bill. It is time to do that. We have the wherewithal to do it. I hope we will deal with this now.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank my distinguished colleague from Texas. 
   My question simply deals with an issue I have been raising now for 3 weeks on this floor, saying that when we get to the time of being able to actually pass marriage tax penalty relief--and we are there, and it is on the floor--let us not have a bunch of extraneous amendments that are irrelevant to the issue, that do not pertain to the issue of the marriage tax penalty. For 3 weeks I have been coming to the floor saying, 
   let's not get to that point in time or let's not have the great Democratic Party saying, we are for marriage penalty relief, and then block us with other nongermane amendments. 
   My simple question to the Senator from Texas is, it appears from what she is describing now, we are actually at that point where we could pass marriage tax penalty relief before April 15, and we are being blocked by nongermane amendments of the Democratic Party. Is that the correct situation we are actually in now?

   Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank my colleague from Texas. I appreciate her leadership and the work she has done on this particular issue. 
   I guess what is troubling to me about the issues that are being raised now on the floor is that we actually have a chance to get this done. It is not a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. This isn't a policy statement by any of the various parties. This is an actual chance for us to pass the bill. 
   The bill has cleared through the House. We could pass it in the Senate. We could get it to the President. The President has said he wants to be able to have a smaller tax cut. Here is one that would deal with the marital tax penalty. 
   We are getting it blocked. It seems to me the President ought to step in now and call on the Democrat Members of the Senate to say, no, let's let this bill clear on through. This is similar to the disaster relief issue. I remember a couple years ago--my colleague might--we had a supplemental bill come through and people wanted to have some budget constraints in that bill. There was an emergency need for that supplemental, some disaster relief; some flooding was taking place. The Democratic Party said: We have to have this supplemental for this emergency relief and really hammered on a lot of people about that issue until we passed it so that people could get disaster relief.  And we should have given that disaster relief. 
   Here you have virtually the same situation. We have a chance to actually do it--no more sense of the Senate; no more talking about it; no more just saying we ought to do it. With this bill we do it. We are actually being blocked by a parliamentary maneuver on the Democrat side of the aisle. 
   I hope the President will enter into this debate and call on Democrat colleagues of ours to say, no, let's have a vote. Let's debate the different sides of this issue of marriage tax penalty relief. There are different policy ways to handle it. Let's have that good debate, but don't tie it up with endless amendments or with what is taking place now, where we are virtually shutting the floor down because we can't get agreement. This is too important to play that sort of politics. 
   I hope my Democrat colleagues are actually for eliminating the marriage tax penalty. Let us have a spirited debate about their different ideas. I appreciate my colleague from Texas carrying this issue forward. We have to deal with this now. Ahead of the April 15 deadline would be the time to do it. This is the point in time to do it. People filling out their forms are seeing the marriage tax penalty they are paying. Let's tell them hope is on the way; we will be able to get this dealt with. 
   I appreciate my colleague doing this. I hope we can get the President involved in calling some of our Democrat colleagues to say, let's pass a bill and let's look at this issue on the merits. I know my colleague from Texas will continue to press that issue on the floor and everywhere else she can.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the issue of the marriage penalty. And to speak in support of the pending amendment to the budget resolution offered by myself and by my colleagues, Senator KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON, and Senator JOHN ASHCROFT. 
   I have addressed this issue often, and I think Senators are familiar with it. This is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. 
   Our sense-of-the-Senate is simple. It simply states that the Congress should pass marriage penalty tax elimination legislation that begins a phase-out of this penalty in 2001. That the marriage penalty tax legislation considered does not discriminate against stay at home spouses and that the Congress should consider this legislation before April 15, 2000. 
   In our resolution, we note that the marriage penalty tax affects nearly half of married couples in America. 
   I have a chart behind me that enumerates some of those States hit by the marriage penalty tax. You can see Kansas with 259,904; in Oregon, 329,289 couples. That is times two-plus frequently because they will have children. 
   We just heard from the Senator from Nevada--146,142 in that category. 
   You can see this is a broad-based tax, a broad-based penalty. This penalty needs to be eliminated. It is time we do it. We have the chance to do that now in this body within the next couple of weeks. I hope it doesn't get hijacked by partisanship. I hope that can be avoided so we can move on. 
   I applaud the chairman of the Finance Committee, Chairman ROTH, for his important work on this legislation. Last week, they considered and passed a bill providing important marriage penalty tax relief to millions of the families suffering under this. They only provide this relief in some narrow areas because the marriage penalty is throughout the Tax Code in about 66 different places. We do not get it all. We do get at key ones. 
   First, the standard deduction. We get 59 in that area of the marriage penalty. This year, for single taxpayers it is $4,400. However, for a married couple filing jointly, the standard deduction is only $7,350. Our bill is simple, clear, and fair: doubling the standard deduction, making it $8,800 for married couples filing jointly. This change begins for filers in 2001. 
   Second, our bill widens the 15-percent tax bracket. Under current law, the 15-percent bracket for a single taxpayer ended at an income threshold of $26,250; for married couples, it is $43,850, less than double. If our bill were fully phased in this year, the 15-percent bracket would extend upward to an income of $52,500. In other words, it doubles the 15-percent bracket. Whether single, or married and filing together, taxpayers get the same total amount that fits under the 15-percent bracket. Again, it seems fair and equitable to do it that way.  
   Third, our bill applies the same principle of bracket widening to the 28-percent bracket as I enumerated and listed in the 15-percent bracket. 
   Fourth, our bill increases the phaseout range for the earned-income tax credit. This is another way that most people do not realize that the marriage penalty is impacting couples. The low-income families with children can incur a significant marriage penalty because of current limits on the earned-income tax credit. If both spouses work, the phaseout of the EITC on the basis of their combined income can and does lead to the loss of some or all of the EITC benefits to which they would be entitled as singles. Our bill works to begin fixing this problem, as well. Our bill helps families at all income levels. 
   Finally, our bill permanently extends the provision that allows the personal nonrefundable credits to offset both the regular tax and the minimum tax. 
   That is the nuts and bolts. I think the best way to talk about the marriage penalty is from people who contact my office and write in, the people I meet with who talk about the marriage tax penalty. They are fed up with it. They don't see it as fair; it doesn't make sense. They wonder why on Earth their Government penalizes them for the privilege of being married; Isn't it tough enough without this? 
   Listen to some of the letters I have received. They are clear in asking: Why am I being penalized for being married?

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the issue of the marriage penalty and progress that has been made today on getting this important tax relief out across the country. 
   First, I applaud Chairman ROTH for his work on this important issue. Just today, the Senate Finance Committee considered an important bill to provide marriage penalty relief. This bill would provide relief to millions of American families--around 25 million--suffering under the burden of a marriage penalty. 
   The proposal considered by the Senate Finance Committee passed today. We are now another step closer to getting this to the floor, which I believe will take place sometime during the week of April 11, to be able to consider providing this important tax relief to the American public. I am delighted that that bill cleared through the Senate Finance Committee today. 
   The Senate Finance Committee used the House-passed version as a base, upon which it built an even broader and more inclusive bill. Our bill restores fairness and equity to a Tax Code that has come to penalize the institution of marriage in over 66 different ways. That is pretty imaginative, to find that many ways, but it is in there. 
   First, our bill eliminates the marriage penalty in the standard deduction. I want to give the numbers. The standard deduction this year for a single taxpayer is $4,400. However, for a married couple filing jointly, the standard deduction is only $7,350--not even twice the amount for single filers. 
   Our bill does a simple, clear, and just thing. Our bill doubles the standard deduction by making it $8,800. This change in the tax law would take place beginning in 2001, by immediately doubling the standard deduction for joint filers. Our bill is fair. That is the fair thing to do. It is the right thing to do. 
   Second, our bill widens the 15-percent tax bracket. Under current law, the 15-percent tax bracket for a single taxpayer ends at an income threshold of $26,250. I know these are a lot of numbers, but it is important to show the specifics of the Tax Code and where it penalizes marriage and how we are fixing it. 
   For a married couple, their bracket is less than double this threshold of $26,250. In fact, the threshold is $43,850 for a married couple filing jointly--another penalty. 
   If our bill were fully phased in this year, it would mean that the 15-percent bracket would extend upward to an income amount of $52,500. So for a married couple filing jointly, instead of having a $43,850 threshold level, it goes up to $52,500. It doubles what it is for a single filer. 
   This is real marriage penalty relief and elimination. It is relief because even income earners above the current upper income threshold for the 15-percent bracket--these are the upper income levels of the 15-percent bracket--will be able to fall down through  the brackets and thus lower their total tax liability. It is elimination because it doubles the bracket, thus eliminating the marriage penalty in the 15-percent bracket. Again, what we are after is to make everything equal. If you have two single filers or if you have a married couple both filing, they should pay the same amount in taxes. That is what we are trying to get at with this marriage penalty elimination. 
   It will benefit those people hit by this marriage penalty. It is going to lower the taxes for America's families. That is important. It is also equitable. 
   Third, our bill applies the same principle of bracket widening to the 28-percent bracket as well. We are just talking about the 15-percent bracket, doubling that $26,250 to $52,500 instead of the current level of $43,850 for a married couple. That is the 15-percent bracket, the upper end of it. We would also do it for the 28-percent bracket, the 28-percent bracket as applied to singles earning between $26,250 to $63,550. That $63,550 is the upper level of the 28-percent bracket. 
   As in the 15-percent bracket, this amount is not double for joint filers for married couples. You don't get a doubling amount. You actually get cut back from that. Under our marriage penalty relief bill, it is double. That level at which you can stay in the 28-percent bracket as a married couple filing joint would be exactly double what you were as a single person. So again, we just make it equitable and fair. If it is two people filing singly or if it is a couple filing jointly, it will be the same taxable event. That is fair. That is equitable. 
   Fourth, our bill increases the phaseout range for the earned-income tax credit. This is an important feature. Particularly for low-income families with children, they can incur a significant marriage penalty because of current limits on the earned-income tax credit. If both spouses work, the phaseout of the EITC on the basis of their combined income can lead to the loss of some or all of the EITC benefits to which they would be entitled as singles. In other words, if you have two people filing singly, they would be entitled to a certain amount of earned-income tax credit. But if you combine their incomes, you don't get the same amount of earned-income tax credit for the couple as you do for two singles. Our bill fixes that problem as well. 
   The Senate Finance Committee proposal increases the beginning and ending points of the phaseout range by $2,500. This change will be effective December 31, 2000. This will mean families who currently are ineligible for the credit but within the $2,500 of eligibility will be able to receive the refundable EITC. This will reduce the marriage penalty EITC. 
   As I mentioned, the marriage penalty is 66 places in the Tax Code. We are getting at some of the most pernicious areas. For the earned-income tax credit, if you are a two-wage earner family and you should have both been able to qualify for the EITC, once you get married you should have the same amount of EITC available to your family. This particularly applies to lower income families. It is an important thing that we are doing. We fix this in our bill. 
   Our bill helps families at all income levels: low income, 
   middle income, on up. 
   Finally, our bill would permanently extend the provision that allows the personal nonrefundable credits to offset both the regular tax and the minimum tax. It is important that America's families receive the full benefit of the tax cuts they were promised. This important change will allow America's families to maintain the $500-per-child tax credit, the Hope scholarship, the adoption credit, and many others that they would not be able to unless we change this particular area of the marriage penalty that applies as well. 
   Our bill provides fairness and equity. It provides hard-working American families with the tax relief they deserve. 
   Those are some of the specifics of the bill. I think this is an excellent bill in fixing some of these key areas of the marriage penalty. I think we have outlined previously the reasons for doing it. It is not fair to tax people because they get married and make them pay a penalty for the price of being married. 
   More important, marriage is important. We should send a positive signal that this is a good thing. Stable families are important. Our approach also recognizes that every spouse has a great contribution that they make. At the same time our approach reduces and eliminates the marriage penalty for many filers, it sends an important signal to all of America that we recognize the institution of marriage and we intend to promote it as a fundamental building block of our society. 
   I am hopeful this bill is going to be considered on the floor with a reasoned debate and not be too burdened down with amendments that are not germane and that we will be able to provide this marriage penalty relief to the millions of Americans, around 25 million married couples, who are currently adversely affected by the Tax Code. 
   There is more to do. The marriage penalty is in 66 different places. We only get at a few of them, but we get at some important ones. Today's is an important step by the Finance Committee to report this bill out. I think it is a clear and an important step towards our ultimate goal of getting this through the Senate, the conference between the House and the Senate, and to the President where I urge his signature. We must pass this important bill. 
   I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, what I want to spend some time on this morning is a very important matter that is coming up before the Senate shortly--a taxation issue the House has already passed. It is a tax a number of us have been working to get rid of for years. We are within sight of getting that done now, but we do have to get it done. People in this body could still block it from happening. I want to make sure we get it through, and that is the elimination of the marriage penalty tax. 
   I have spoken about it on the floor a lot of times, perhaps too many. But we are so close to finally getting this done for the 21 million American couples who pay this tax that we really just have to see it through. What I am most fearful of is, once we get the bill out of the Finance Committee--they are working on it now, to eliminate this marriage penalty tax--it will come through the Finance Committee, it will be a good bill, it will do much to eliminate the marriage penalty tax--not all of it but much of it--but we will get it up on the floor and someone will say, ``No, I don't want to get it through,'' or, ``Yes, I agree with you, but it has to have this rider dealing with pharmaceuticals for Medicare patients,'' or dealing with minimum wage or dealing with some other issue that is extraneous to this important signal we send to America. 
   I want us to get this bill through this Congress. It has cleared the House. The House has done its job. It is now in the Finance Committee in the Senate. We will soon have it here on the floor. Let's take it up, let's pass it, let's give it to the President, and do it before April 15 so the President 
   can have that, so we can give some notion of relief to working couples across this country. 
   Senator ASHCROFT and I and Senator HUTCHISON of Texas have been working on this issue for some time. This past week, while we were not in session, Senator ASHCROFT and I held a press conference in Kansas City. We had four couples from Kansas who are currently paying the marriage penalty tax. They think it is ridiculous. They think it is a bad signal we send. One gentleman there, one husband, stated he and his wife did not get married for 2 years because of the marriage penalty tax. They were in college at the time. They knew they wanted to get married, but they thought, they could not afford to do this because they would have to pay roughly, in their case, about $600 more a year in taxes if they got married. They were in college and they said: We can't afford it; $600 is important; we cannot afford to do this. So they didn't. But they were not happy they were forced by their Tax Code not to get married. 
   You would think, actually, we would be giving them $600 to get married. This is a positive institution. It is something that is important for the country. It is a clear signal of support for family values, which we all say we are for. We ought to at least send that positive signal, but we don't. Those are four families, each of them who could use the average of $1,400 a year that most couples pay in a marriage penalty. 
   Those are only four, though, in Kansas. I want to show with this chart, we  actually have 259,000 couples who are paying this marriage penalty tax. What we are talking about eliminating is this portion of it, the marriage penalty that actually exists about 66 different places in the Tax Code. So we are going to have a lot of other places we need to ferret this out. 
   At the end of the day, I hope we sunset this Tax Code, reform the whole thing, go to a flatter, simpler, fairer system. But that is for another time. 
   I want to point out, for Members or others who are watching, how pervasive this marriage penalty tax is in their States. You can go down any of the States here: In Wyoming, where the Presiding Officer is from, 45,336 couples pay a marriage penalty, a tax on being married. That is in Wyoming. You can go anyplace. In Connecticut, 347,306 couples pay that; in Washington DC, 27,117. Go to the big population States, there are more there: New York, 1.5 million; California, 2.752 million couples paying a marriage penalty tax. It is all across the board, all across the country, that couples, for the privilege of being married, pay this tax. 
   People know about it. Now we are seeing public opinion polls that show people know they are paying a tax for the privilege of being married. As my colleagues can see, this is not an issue that just affects a few people in a few States; it affects America's working families. It simply must be corrected this year. 
   I say to my colleagues, do not hook any riders to this bill that will kill it and then say you are for eliminating the marriage penalty tax. If you hook riders to this bill that will kill it, you are against eliminating the marriage penalty tax. 
   Further, I point out to people, the marriage penalty tax affects America's children. I have many letters from people which demonstrate that. In fact, Gary and Charla Gipson commented in a letter they wrote on this subject:  
   If we are really interested in ``putting children first,'' then why would this country penalize the very situation (marriage) where kids do best? When parents are truly committed to each other, through their marriage vows, their children's outcomes are enhanced.  
   I do not want to take the full length of time to talk about this bill today because we have talked about it enough in the past. But I do want to make sure people understand that this does affect two-wage earner couples making between $20,000 and $75,000 a year. 
   Clearly, we need to make the elimination of the marriage penalty tax a priority to help all of these families, not just a few. The House bill does much of this. I think we can put forward an even 
   better bill in the Senate that takes away more of the marriage penalty tax than even the House version does. 
   America's families deserve this break. I would like to be able to tell my families back in Kansas that, yes, this Congress does stand for family values. One of the things we are doing to help support these families is eliminating the marriage penalty tax. It is a good and positive and right signal that we can send at a time we are having so much trouble with families. 
   I just came from a Commerce Committee hearing where we were talking about and had testimony regarding the impact of interactive violent video games on children. There the concern was the increased level of overall violence in this society, and even the interactive nature of it in video games and its negative impact on children. 
   Constantly, people in that hearing were saying: I hope parents know what video games their children are playing. We hope the parents are working with their children and communicating on this issue. In each case, they were talking about the role and the need and the importance of parents and their active participation. 
   What better signal can we send than to say we believe that is true and we are not going to penalize you for being married parents. We are not going to penalize you for being in that situation. We are going to remove this marriage penalty tax and let you keep an average of $1,400 per year. We have a chance to pass this legislation. We have the time to do it. This is the appointed hour for us. 
   I also want to send a signal to the President that I think we are going to get this bill through this Senate. We have gotten it through the House. I am calling on the President to sign this bill, sign the marriage penalty tax elimination bill, and not to obfuscate the issue or say that it is about something else or it is too expensive. If it is too expensive for Government, imagine how expensive it is for these 21 million American couples who are out there paying this extra tax. 
   Is it really too expensive for us to invest a little bit of money in these working families to encourage them, to support them, to say they have the most important task in America; that is, raising our next generation? We should be saying to them: You deserve a break today. You deserve to be able to have this support coming to you from this Government instead of being taxed. You should be supported. 
   If anything, we should subsidize the family situation rather than tax it. 
   Mr. President, please sign this bill when it gets to you so we can do away with this onerous burden. 
   There may be other colleagues who will come to the floor later to talk about this issue but at this time that is the extent of my comments on this particular topic. 
   I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to address the body on the Social Security Earnings Test Elimination Act. 
   This is a good time. We are finally going to do something good for America's senior citizens. Americans should be free to work if they choose. With passage of this bill, we will help elderly Americans stay in the workforce longer. It should be their choice, not the Government's coercion, that determines whether they stay in that workforce a longer period of time. 
   They have spent a lifetime paying into the Social Security trust fund. It is simply not fair to deprive them of their Social Security benefits simply because they choose to stay in the workforce longer or choose to begin working again after retirement. That is common sense to me, and that is why this bill has so much appeal. 
   Particularly at a time when the cost of living is increasing, it is important to allow our seniors who choose to work or those who are forced to work because of rising prices to do so without being penalized. 
   I will talk about a particular individual in Kansas whom I had the privilege of meeting a month ago. His name is Ron Frampton, from Kingman, KS. He has farmed with his family most of his life. I met him when I was touring the Mize Manufacturing Company, a small manufacturer in Kingman, KS. Mr. Frampton came up to me as I was walking through the production line and asked me if we were going to eliminate the Social Security earnings test. I said I thought we were going to get the bill through. He said: Good; I need it. 
   Then he related to me his situation. He had worked on a family farm, was born on the farm and worked there all his life. 
   Then in the 1980s, when we had a hard financial downturn for agriculture, he got caught in that downturn. His savings for his entire family were wrapped up in this farm. That is where he plowed all of his income, all of his savings, back into the farm. When the economy moved against him in the 1980s, he lost the farm and, thus, a big part of his life, a big part of his family, a big part of his sense of being. He also lost his retirement security that he had outside of Social Security. His retirement savings were that farm. 
   Now he has to work. He doesn't have the savings on which he had counted. He has to be able to work, and he needs the Social Security income as well. This bill helps Ron Frampton and his family in Kingman, KS. It addresses that need. It says if he needs to work, he wants to work, let him work, and don't penalize him for doing it. 
   This bill allows people older than 65 and younger than 70 to earn income without losing their Social Security benefits. That is as it should be. It is an important bipartisan measure that passed overwhelmingly in the House and, I expect, will pass overwhelmingly in the Senate. It sends an important and positive signal to America's retired workers who have spent their lives working to make this country better. We need this for America's seniors. 
   I am delighted we are going to pass this bill for all the seniors in the country but particularly for Mr. Frampton and for his family.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, there is a lot of information swirling about concerning the Middle East Peace Process, specifically the so called ``Syrian track.'' Facts and figures are being bandied about freely and there is little to indicate which are fact and which are fiction. Therefore I rise today to lay down a marker for the coming year and to express the hope that the administration will consult with Congress on a continual basis as this process picks up again. 
   Last year, Congress and the American people were presented with a bill for the Middle East peace process that was in excess of $1 billion--that is $1 billion more than the $5 billion plus we already spend in the Middle East. And this extra bill was compiled without any congressional input. It was approved, but this is no way to do business. 
   The peace process is ongoing, but the President and the Department of State should consider themselves on notice from this moment on: This Congress will not rubber stamp another Wye Plantation Accord, we will not cough up another check without consultation and due consideration; we will not be left out of our Constitutionally assigned role. 
   I am a strong believer in the Middle East peace process. The Governments of Egypt, Jordan and Israel have shown enormous character and courage in making peace, and they deserve our support. The nations of Egypt and Jordan, like Israel, need economic and military security in a bad neighborhood. They have made real sacrifices to do the right thing, and they have the backing of the United States. 
   However, ultimately, peace is not something that can be bought. Both Israel and its Arab partners, be they the Palestinians, the Lebanese or the Syrians, must make peace on their own terms without regard to sweeteners or inducements from the United States. The US has always played a historical role in promoting peace, but ultimately, peace only works when it is in the interests of the parties directly involved. Should we help? I believe we can. Should that help be the sole basis of an agreement? Unreservedly, no. 
   All of us who follow foreign policy issues are well aware that in this, the last year of the Clinton Administration, the President would like to preside over an historic peace between Israel and its remaining enemies in the Arab world. Perhaps we shouldn't blame President Clinton too much for yearning for a place in the history books. But President Clinton and his entire foreign policy team need to remember a few important points: 1: Congress has the power of the purse; 2: We are not the Syrian parliament: We will not rubber stamp any agreement with any price tag; 3: Notwithstanding rumors to the contrary, we are interested and wish to be kept apprised of important developments in American diplomacy. In other words, Mr. President, come and talk to us. Keep us in the loop. 
   I have read in the newspapers that Israel is looking at the security implications of returning the Golan Heights and is also considering requesting a security package from the United States which will be very costly. There are ongoing discussions between Israel and the Defense Department on this matter. But Congress has not been briefed. Syria too, has visions of sugar plum fairies dancing into Damascus with billions in aid; and I am sure the Lebanese will not be too far behind. 
   There will be many reasons to support a peace in the Middle East, but much will depend upon exactly what commitments will be expected of the United States. The President must not again make the mistake of signing IOUs which, this time, the Congress may have no intention of covering. We are willing partners in peace, but we will not accept the presentation of another fait accompli. Mr. President, we look forward to hearing from you--often.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to address an issue I have raised several times on the floor. I am hopeful that this year, this body, will get a chance to deal with the marriage penalty tax elimination. 
   Mr. President, Senators KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON, JOHN ASHCROFT, and I have been pushing for some period of time for the elimination of the marriage penalty tax; and it is truly that--a penalty tax on marriage. This body will have a chance to address this issue shortly. The Finance Committee of the Senate will consider this issue in the near future. They will be marking up the bill to eliminate one area of the Internal Revenue Code where the marriage penalty tax occurs. It will then come before this body, I am told, I believe the leader wants it scheduled before April 15. 
   There will be Members who will try to block this bill, with issues that are extraneous to the marriage penalty. They will be able to add things to it, or filibuster the marriage penalty tax elimination. I hope they think about what they would be doing in stopping the elimination of the marriage penalty tax. Before they take actions to block this important issue, I hope they just pause and say maybe I will try to amend my issue onto another bill; this one is too important. I don't think we need to be blocking it. 
   Just in looking at the marriage penalty tax, I hope people recognize the extent of its involvement and intrusion on married couples across the country. I have a chart up here to which I will refer a number of times. It shows the number of married couples affected by the marriage penalty tax across the United States. This is it. The chart represents married couples, and we don't know how many children are in these families who are also effected. We are talking about 25 million American families who are affected across the country by this penalty. In Kansas, we have 259,904 couples who are penalized by this marriage penalty tax. 
   Again, for those who haven't been following the debate, all our proposal would do is level the playing field. It would say that if you are married, a two-wage-earner family, you will pay the same in taxes as if you were two independent people living together; we are not going to punish you, or fine you, or penalize you for being married. 
   The average tax these 25 million American couples pay additionally for the privilege of being married is $1,480. That is a lot of money. That is a lot of money to a lot of people. I hope we cut the tax and send that back to the married couples across this country and say we are not going to penalize you anymore. That is what we are seeking for this body to pass. 
   The House of Representatives has already done good work in this area. The House of Representatives has passed a bill to provide marriage tax penalty relief for America's families in the 15-percent marginal tax bracket and to eliminate the marriage penalty in the standard deduction. 
   I think the House bill is a good starting point for our discussion of the marriage penalty reduction and elimination. Doubling the standard deduction, increasing the width of the 15-percent bracket, and fixing the earned-income tax credit where the marriage penalty exists will eliminate or reduce the marriage penalty for all families. It still doesn't get rid of it. The Marriage Penalty appears in over 60 different places in the Tax Code. 
   Down the road I hope we can get to a discussion of sunsetting the entire Tax Code and going to a flatter, fairer, and simpler system. I know the Presiding Officer has led the charge on doing precisely that. It is clearly something we need to do for the country, for the economy, and for the people, so many of whom, labor under this Tax Code in fear they are going to be found to have done something wrong when they are trying to be good, law-abiding citizens. But that is a debate for another day. 
   Right now we are trying to get at one issue. The National Center for Policy Analysis says the highest proportion of marriage penalties occurred when the higher-earning spouse made between $20,000 and $75,000. Clearly, we need to make marriage penalty elimination a priority for all families, not only a few. 
   Consider that--making between $20,000 and $75,000. You are looking at a two-wage-earner family, probably with a child, or two or three children, who can't afford to be penalized by this $1,480. They are currently being penalized under the Tax Code. 
   We see the numbers up here. We know the full extent of this. 
   I want to read--because I think these are so touching and important--statements of people who are impacted by this. We continue to collect these statements and letters from people because now people are calculating their marriage penalty tax. I hope in the next week or so to have a chart saying: OK. As you are watching this on TV, figure your marriage penalty. Have this as one spouse's income; there is another spouse's income; and here is where it meets. That is your marriage penalty, the tax you pay. The average is $1,480. Some pay more, some less; letting people know this is what they are penalized and this is the tax they are paying. 
   Listen to some of the stories from people around the country. This is Christopher from Fairfield, OH. This family said: 
   One of the biggest shocks my wife and I had when deciding to get married was how much more we would have to give to the government because we decided to be married rather than live together. It does not make sense that I was allowed to keep a larger portion of my pay on a Friday and less of it on a Monday with the only difference being that I was married that weekend.  
   That is to the point. 
   This is from Andrew and Connie from Alexandria, VA.  
   We grew up together and began dating when we were 18. After dating for three years we decided that the next natural step in our lives together would be to get married. I cannot tell you the joy this has brought us. I must tell you that the tax penalty that was inflicted on us has been the only real source of pain that our marriage has suffered.  
   I wish all marriages could be like that--that the only source of pain is the Tax Code. Is that a pain we should inflict on them? Is that something we should do to this married couple? They say: We are getting along pretty good. The only real pain is the Federal Tax Code and the tax penalty we are paying. 
   I don't think that is a good signal to send. 
   This is Andrew from Greenville, NC, who writes:  
   It is unfortunate that the government makes a policy against the noble and sacred institution of marriage. I also feel it is unfortunate that it seems to hit young struggling couples the hardest.  
   That is probably the biggest point. If you have a combined income with the top wage earner making between $20,000 and $75,000--these are young married couples; they are struggling with a lot of issues, struggling with financial issues--and you lob on top of that a tax penalty, that really hits them, and particularly a lot of couples during the early years with young children. 
   This is Thomas from Hilliard, OH, who says:  
   No person who legitimately supports family values could be against this bill. The marriage penalty is but another example of how in the past 40 years the federal government has enacted policies that have broken down the fundamental institutions that were the strength of this country from the start.   
   This is Sean from Jefferson City, MO:  
   I think the marriage penalty is a major cause of the breakdown of the family here in the U.S. ..... [Ending it] would do a lot to cut down on the incidence of cohabitation by unmarried couples and give more children two-parent families where there is a real commitment between the parents.  
   I don't know if I would go as far as what he said--that this has been the major cause of the breakdown of the family in the United States. I don't think that is the case. But it is the wrong signal for us to send. We send signals all the time across the country of what we think is good and what we think is wrong. 
   Welfare reform: When we went through that fight--it was a very important fight--we decreased the welfare rolls in the country by 50 percent. We sent a signal that we think it is good to work. That is a good signal. 
   We should eliminate the marriage penalty tax. That is a statement about what we think is good. People are married and they shouldn't be taxed and penalized for that. 
   According to a recent Rutgers University study, the institution of marriage is already having problems in the United States and is in a state of decline. From 1960 to 1996, the annual number of marriages per thousand adult women declined by almost 43 percent. That impacts and hurts a lot of children. Not that single parents don't struggle heroically to raise children; they do many times very successfully. But that family can have a bonded relationship. Studies are showing again and again that the most important place we can put that child is in a loving relationship between two married people. 
   I am going to continue to come down to the floor regularly raising this issue because this body will have a chance to vote on this issue in dealing with the marriage penalty tax. I believe there are Members on both sides of the aisle of goodwill who want to see this marriage penalty tax eliminated. I don't think the penalty makes much sense to many Americans at all. 
   I hope as we start to engage this debate, in this body, that Members on both sides of the aisle will stand up and say: Yes, this is an important issue. We are not going to load it down with a lot of amendments. We are not going to load it down with a lot of extraneous issues. It passed the House. If it passes this body, we can get it to the President for his signature. It is an important signal to send across the country, and we are not going to block it. 
   There are a lot of ways in this body that you can block something--that you can put it forward and say you are for it but you are blocking it. I hope this would be one that we could say we are going to pass for the 25 million American married couples. 
   For those in South Dakota, 75,114 are penalized, and for those in Nevada 146,142 are penalized--I see my colleagues from South Dakota and Nevada--I hope they can say to them: We shouldn't be penalizing you. 
   We have the wherewithal to change this, and let's change it. 
   Thank you very much, Mr. President. I hope we will have a vote on a true marriage penalty tax bill before April 15 comes and goes. There will be other of my colleagues on the floor later on to address this issue as well. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to address a couple of items that are going to be coming before this body and the importance of our addressing them. One is the marriage tax that is so embedded in our Tax Code, and the other is lifting the Social Security earnings limit. Both of these issues need to be taken care of this Congress. It is in the power of this Congress, particularly this body, the Senate, to deal with both of these items, and it is time we do it. I am going to be speaking out often about this until we get these measures passed. They make sense. It is time we do it. The American people want us to do it. The House has passed both of these bills, and it is time we do so as well. 
   Our Tax Code is riddled with provisions that penalize America's families. If that is not clear to date, it should be, and it will become increasingly clear as we discuss both of these issues, the marriage penalty and the Social Security earnings limit. In fact, our Tax Code regarding marriage penalizes marriage in over 60 different ways, according to the American Association of Certified Public Accountants. That is a body of which the Presiding Officer has been a part in the past. 
   This is unacceptable. As my colleagues already know, one of the most egregious marriage penalties occurs in the marginal tax rate bracket and in the standard deduction. I want to go through this because everybody hears about the marriage penalty tax, and it occurs in over 60 places. The bill that passed the House and is currently being considered in the Finance Committee addresses it in several places, but not all 60, but they are in several of the most important places. 
   I want to particularly talk about the marginal tax rate 
   bracket and the  standard deduction. In fact, last year 43 percent of married taxpayers, roughly 22 million couples, paid an average of $1,489 more in Federal income taxes than they would have paid had they remained single. The Government should not use the coercive power of the Tax Code to erode the foundation of our society--the family. We must quit subsidizing and encouraging people not to get married and penalizing marriage. 
   The House passed a bill to provide marriage tax penalty relief for America's families in the 15-percent marginal rate bracket and to eliminate the marriage penalty in the standard deduction. The House-passed bill provides a good starting point for our discussions on marriage penalty deduction and elimination. It does not do everything, but it is a good starting point and key area with which to go. 
   Doubling the standard deduction, increasing the width of the 15-percent bracket, and fixing the earned-income tax credit will eliminate or reduce the marriage penalty for all filers. 
   According to the National Center for Policy Analysis, the highest proportion of marriage penalties occurred when the higher-earning spouse made between $20,000 and $75,000 per year. Clearly, we need to make the marriage penalty elimination a priority for all families, not just a few. We must continually work to make our Tax Code better, to make it fairer for America's families. I am hopeful we will be able to correct this gross inequity in our Tax Code this year. 
   I want to go through some examples of people in Kansas who have written to my office about the impact of the marriage penalty. People know it is there, and they do not like it. 
   First, we can pass this bill in this body this year and get it to the President. We have to have an agreement between the Republicans and the Democrats as to whether or not we are going to agree to pass this bill. I am calling on my Democratic colleagues to agree with us and pass sensible marriage penalty relief. They have it in their power to block us from doing this as well, but I hope they will come forward and say: We do not want this pernicious tax to be on our married families. We are all for family values, and the central unit of that family is the married couple. We do not want to see placed on America's families this average of $1,480 per family, on 22 million working couples who are making between the $20,000 and $75,000 limit. We do not want to see that tax placed on them. We do not want people saying: I cannot afford to get married because of the Federal Tax Code. People are saying just that now. 
   I want my colleagues to listen as I share some letters I have received from Kansas constituents about this very issue. 
   When I go home every weekend and talk with people, the marriage penalty tax comes up regularly. 
   Listen to this letter:

   Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank Senator COVERDELL and add my voice in support of the amendment by Senator MACK and Senator HATCH. 
   The marriage penalty appears in the Tax Code 66 different places. That is a situation where we have a married couple who do not get the same advantages as two people filing individually. Here is another case where the marriage penalty occurs, and here is another case where we are trying to pull it out of the Tax Code. That is why I add my voice of support to this amendment by Senator HATCH and by Senator MACK to eliminate this portion of the marriage penalty that appears in the education IRAs. 
   Annually, there are about 22 million married couples who pay a penalty of some sort or another in the Tax Code, for being married. They pay an average of $1,480 more in Federal income taxes than they would if they were single living together. I think it is a bad signal that we send across the country. It is a bad signal in the Tax Code. It is one we ought to ferret out wherever we possibly can. 
   This is a good place for us to address this particular issue. Our Tax Code is riddled with provisions that penalize America's families. The House has passed a bill to provide marriage tax penalty relief that is separate and distinct from this particular area of the marriage penalty. What they would do is provide marginal rate brackets that are fair for the families. They would eliminate the marriage penalty that exists in the standard deduction as well. However, even with those changes, which I am hopeful we can pass this year, we still will have more to do to ensure married people are not discriminated against in our Tax Code. 
   In fact, our Tax Code penalizes marriage in over 60 
   different ways, according to the American Association of Certified Public Accountants. This is unacceptable. We must continually work to make our Tax Code better, to make it fairer for America's families. 
   This amendment being offered by my colleagues, Senator MACK and Senator HATCH, takes an important step in our Tax Code to end a bias against marriage. I am hopeful we will pass this amendment on a strong bipartisan basis. We will pass more substantive marriage tax penalty relief later this year. 
   As my colleagues have already described, the Hatch-Mack amendment eliminates the marriage penalty and the reduction in contributions to education and individual retirement accounts. This important provision will remove one of the marriage tax penalties that exists in our Tax Code. I believe we must pass this important amendment. 
   I thank my colleagues who are introducing the amendment for allowing me this time to speak on the bill and yield the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, earlier today the Senate voted on H.R. 1883, the Iran Nonproliferation Act of 2000. That bill will shortly be voted on by the House and sent to the President. I hope he will sign it because it is an important signal that the United States will not tolerate the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering them. We will not tolerate trafficking in missiles and the technology with which to build them. I believe that is an important signal for us to send. 
   I also think it is important we recognize what took place this week in Iran. This threat occurred, but in the midst of this, 80 percent of the people in Iran turned out to vote. They are not interested in the entrenched policies of Ayatollah Khomeini and his harsh legacy. Reformers dominated in the polls. Despite the best efforts of the hardline clerical institutions to disqualify and intimidate popular candidates, the Iranian people had the courage of their convictions. They want economic liberalization, they want freedom of the press, and they want personal liberty. 
   We in the United States obviously share those convictions and are obviously heartened by what took place at the polls this week in Iran. It should be noted and applauded, and this resolution does just that. 
   We say to the Iranian people: Congratulations. Thank you. This is a good step in moving forward. At the same time, we want to say we will not tolerate weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering these weapons. We want to send those clear signals. 
   There is another thing which is going on in Iran. Earlier today, I had a press conference with several other people about three men--Sirus Zabihi-Moghaddam, Hedayat Kashefi-Najafabadi, and Manuchehr Khulusi--three Baha'is who are on death row in prison facing imminent execution for the simple reason of practicing their faith. That is it. They are on death row facing imminent death for daring to practice their faith. 
   This cannot be tolerated. There are nearly 300,000 Baha'is in Iran. It is the largest religious minority in the country. They have suffered continuous persecution for their peaceful beliefs. I remind the Iranian people who have voted for freedom this week that this is part of it. This is also something they have signed on to. 
   Nearly 50 years ago, the General Assembly of the United Nations--of which Iran is a member--adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Since that time, this Universal Declaration has become the bedrock document for human rights. However, the Iranian Government continues to be an egregious violator. 
   I wish to read one portion of this document. Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states:  
   Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance.  
   This hour, I call on the Government of Iran--from whom the people of Iran, by their clear vote this week, are seeking change--to ensure the safety of these three individuals. 
   This hour, I call for the release of these individuals--Sirus Zabihi-Moghaddam, Hedayat Kashefi-Najafabadi, and Manuchehr Khulusi--whose only crime was a sincere expression of their faith, which is a universal fundamental right. 
   Most importantly, I call upon the Government of Iran to provide freedom of religion to its people--who are yearning for change, as witnessed by the vote this week--including their peaceful yet brutalized Baha'is community. I ask for their freedom to express their faith as they see fit. 
   Our resolution is in addition to the bill that passed earlier today. It congratulates the Iranian people and says: Let's take other steps forward. No weapons of mass destruction. But, also, let's recognize religious freedom, as in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which the Iranian Government has signed on to.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the Iran Nonproliferation Act. I note, as many do, the encouraging election results that happened this past week within Iran. I say encouraging because perhaps that country is moving towards a more open policy, a better policy of engagement with the rest of the world and the United States. 
   I want to point out some facts and some reasons that this act should be passed. Iran remains a danger to the United States and to our friends in the Middle East, particularly to Israel. It is a fact. 
   Iran continues as the largest state supporter of international terrorism, the bankroller of munitions supplied to Hezbollah in Lebanon and to Islamic Jihad and Hamas. It is still opposed to the Israeli peace process and to peace under any circumstances with Israel. 
   Those are all the facts, and they remain the facts, in spite of the fact that a so-called moderate President Khatami has been in power in Iran for 2 1/2 years. I know some would say he does not have full control, and he doesn't, nor will he after these elections. This will remain the factual situation even after this election. 
   I don't think the United States should act on hope but on fact. The recent Hezbollah attacks on Israeli soldiers could not have happened without Iranian approval. Those attacks, made possible by the continued funneling of arms from Iran to Hezbollah, were undertaken primarily to derail the peace process. After all, Israel has already committed itself to withdraw from Lebanon by July. 
   Even more worrisome is Iran's effort to acquire weapons of mass destruction and the missiles to be able to deliver them. The administration has already sanctioned 10 Russian entities for providing dangerous technologies to Iran but readily admits that the flow continues. Thousands of Russian scientists and technicians are at work in Iran helping these efforts. This remains the fact today. 
   Iran has already flight-tested a missile capable of reaching Israel and is working on longer range missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads. Fact. 
   Under the guise of peaceful nuclear energy development, Iran is spending billions to develop a nuclear infrastructure. Iran, a country rich in both oil and natural gas, needs to develop nuclear energy about as much as Alaska needs artificial snowmaking machines. 
   The picture gets worse. CIA Director Tenet, in testimony before the Armed Services Committee earlier this month, forecast the possibility that Iran might become a supplier in its own right of missile technology as it develops its own indigenous production capability. Fact. 
   Those are the facts. Iran is getting this dangerous technology from North Korea and China, but its primary source remains Russia. Russian entities have assisted Iran in the development of a missile capable of hitting Israel. They are also the main technology sources for a longer range missile, the Kosar, that could hit the heart of Europe with nuclear warheads. Fact. 
   The Russian Government has also signed peaceful nuclear cooperation agreements with Iran to build nuclear power reactors. Iran is reportedly using this legal cooperation to make clandestine efforts to procure nuclear material and to 
   develop the ability to produce weapons-grade nuclear material on its own. 
   The administration sought to get the Russian Government to stop this flow, and the Russians have taken some steps. They have passed legislation to create an export control regime, for example, but they have done little to enforce it. Not one Russian has been convicted of passing dangerous technology to Iran. Not a single Russian has been convicted under this law. 
   That is why we must keep the heat on. This legislation requires the President to report to Congress, in a classified form if he deems it necessary, credible information on any entity anywhere in the world that is providing Iran with dangerous technology. It then authorizes him to sanction those entities. If he chose not to, he would then report to Congress on his rationale for not sanctioning. So, in the first instance, this legislation captures China, North Korea, and any others who are providing Iran the wherewithal to obtain weapons of mass destruction and the missiles to deliver them. 
   It goes a step further. Over the past few years, the Russians have been unable to meet their limited financial obligations to the creation of the international space station, so we have been helping them out, paying part of their funding in addition to our own, considerably larger, space station obligations. As it happens, the recipient of this money, the Russian Space Agency, their NASA, is also the Russian governmental entity with jurisdiction over any entity in Russia dealing with missile technology. 
   Therefore, this legislation requires the President to certify three things before we can continue to pay the Russian share of the space station: That it is Russian policy to stop proliferation to Iran, that they are taking the steps necessary to prevent the proliferation, and that no entity under the jurisdiction of the Russian space station is cooperating with the Iranian missile program. 
   If we are going to pay Russian obligations, then we have the right to suggest they must do everything they can to stop the proliferation to Iran--something that threatens not only America and our friends but, ultimately, Russia as well. It cannot be in Russia's interests to have a nuclear-armed Iran sitting on its borders. 
   Some may say, with the recent elections in Iran in which the moderates appear to have done very well, indeed this is not the time to push this legislation. Unfortunately, as I pointed out earlier, even under the reportedly moderate President Khatami over the last 2 1/2 years, Iranian support for terrorism and its weapons technology acquisition have not diminished. Those facts remain. 
   Hard-liners remain in charge of Iranian security and foreign policy; they will after this election, as well. It may be that at some point in the future Iranian moderates may seek a different course. They have not to date. But for now, they have neither the ability nor necessarily the interest. They appear much more interested in reforming Iranian domestic policy than in all of these problems they are creating internationally. That means we cannot let down our guard. We must do everything we can to stop the flow of technology, to raise the cost of developing weapons of mass destruction, and to delay the time at which Iran could have such a capability. 
   This is the purpose of this legislation and why I strongly urge its adoption. While the timing of this legislation may not seem the best, perhaps it is the absolute right time. We need to make clear to the Iranian people, particularly their leadership on foreign policy and these terrorist items, that this is unacceptable behavior for them and for the rest of the world to have to tolerate. The development of these  weapons, the sponsorship of terrorism, the development of the missile capacity that could so threaten its neighbors and much of Europe is not responsible behavior. This is something we cannot tolerate, and we are sending that clear message at this time. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

    Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to recognize an outstanding elementary school principal from Hays, Kansas. Alan Park, through dedication and hard work, has created an excellent after school program that has profoundly changed the lives of many young children in a positive way. The ``Serve Our Children'' program at Washington Elementary School has connected economically disadvantaged students with vital community services. The beneficial results are numerous: free child care, extensive leadership development opportunities, and many tutorial programs. Not only has Mr. Park integrated the use of computers within the school, he has helped pass a district bond to create a new addition to the school. 
   Mr. President, I am proud to recognize the outstanding accomplishments of this elementary school principal.  Mr. Park is an exemplary role model for young people in Kansas as well as our nation. I congratulate Mr. Alan Park for all he has done for Washington Elementary School and the community of Hays, Kansas.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, thank you. 
   Mr. President, I am delighted to join my colleague from Texas, Senator HUTCHISON, in this effort yet again. We are going to keep pushing this ball up the hill until we get it over. I think this is the year we will get that done--to finally do away with this marriage penalty that impacts nearly 21 million American families in a very adverse and a terrible way--and an awful signal it sends to the married couples: Well, if you are going to get married, that is fine, but we are going to tax you for it. 
   I think if there is one thing we ought to try to figure out, it is how not to tax the institution of marriage, which is in so much trouble. And there is so much pressure in this country already. The last thing it needs is more pressure by the taxation system, the Tax Code. 
   This is the year for us to be able to get this done. 
   I hope at the end of the day we can put together the marriage penalty and the estate tax, which is another family tax--particularly in my State with family farmers and small businesses--and pass a family tax cut bill of those two items, send it through, pass it by the House, and put it on the President's desk and ask him: Mr. President, please sign this on behalf of the working families of this country to be able to maintain these businesses, farms, and these marriages--that all of us ought to be strongly supporting and working with. 
   It is interesting that the marriage penalty currently affects almost 50 percent of America's families. Fifty percent of America's families are impacted negatively by the marriage penalty today. On average--this is an old figure. People have heard this one but it is true, and it is so stark--they pay an additional $1,400 in taxes. You have 50 percent of married couples in America impacted by this tax and on average paying $1,400 a year more for the pleasure and the privilege in America to be married. It is a terrible signal and bad policy. This is the year to do away with it. 
   It is critically important that during this second session of the 106th Congress we take the steps finally to eliminate the marriage penalty and alleviate its impact on our working families in this country. 
   I applaud the work of Chairman ARCHER over in the House in advance of his proposal to double the standard deduction and widen the 15-percent bracket and to adjust the earned-income tax credit in order to alleviate the impact of the marriage penalty for America's working families. 
   His proposal is an important first step in our effort to rid our Tax Code of this onerous penalty to our families. 
   The Congressional Budget Office has announced that the expected on-budget surplus--I want to make this clear; it is the on-budget surplus; it is not Social Security--for this fiscal year is $233 billion. Clearly, we have the funds available on budget to do this tax cut and to start it this year. We need to begin by making an investment in America's families. Using the on-budget surplus to rid the Tax Code of this unfair tax is one way to make such an investment. We clearly have the funds to do this for both the marriage penalty and the estate tax, starting this year and phasing that out over a period of 5 years.  
   The Government should not use the coercive power of the Tax Code to erode the foundation of our society--working families. We should quit incentivizing that erosion resulting from this taxation. Normally in the Tax Code we try to encourage work; we try to encourage families; we try to encourage good things. Yet these are two areas where we are discouraging two of our greatest things. One is the creation of families--good, strong, healthy families that are absolutely critical for vibrant societies. The second is working families, so they do not have what they labor for stolen from them by the taxation system upon death, so they can pass it on to their heirs, so they can hold the farm together. 
   Some years ago I was an extension specialist for Kansas State University, and I worked with farm couples who were facing two facts of life at that point in time. One I was hoping we could get rid of. One was that they were all going to die. The second was they were very fearful they would have to break the farm up, rather than being able to pass it on to a son or daughter to farm as an intact unit; they were going to have to break it up to pay a portion of the estate taxes. 
   These were good, hard-working people who worked all of their lives. Because they were frugal and saved and poured the money back into the farm, bought farmland, bought equipment, didn't go out and live luxuriously and take lots of vacations--they stayed there and worked and saved, all of which are laudable things for which we should be applauding them--here were people I was working with, couple after couple, saying: We just really want to have our son be able to farm, or our daughter and son-in-law be able to farm, but if we break this farm up they are not going to be able to have an economical-size unit. They are going to have to work in town and subsidize the farm because farming is a very capital intensive operation; it takes a lot of capital and there is very little return on the investment. We are afraid we will have to break the farm up to pay the estate taxes, so our son or daughter will not be able to farm. 
   They worked hard and saved and we are going to tax them so they have to break up the farm. 
   I worked with a whole bunch of other family farmers who said they would organize around this estate tax. They would go and work setting up a trust, a limited partnership, starting a gifting program here. So we have organized five different units to be able to break the assets up so they could get it to the next generation with a minimal amount of tax. 
   That is a very uneconomical thing to do. Lawyers make money; accountants make money doing that. For farming, it is a bad thing to do because you are breaking your economical unit up 
   into five and trying to figure it out, focusing so much on avoiding taxes rather than the profitability of the farm. It is ridiculous but it is the policy of the United States. 
   We now have people basically paying as much to get around paying estate taxes as they pay in estate taxes. But that is only the apparent, on-the-surface costs. It says nothing about the economic cost--what happens to that farm and small business by focusing so much time on tax reduction rather than how do I run this business. How do I try to remain profitable when we have wheat prices the way they are today? Instead, I am focusing on how do I hold my capital together. 
   It is a very counterproductive tax. We have the opportunity, the resources, the wherewithal, and the will this year to do two things: eliminate the marriage penalty and eliminate the estate tax. We should put them together as a family tax cut package and get it done. It sends good signals to our families; they need a good signal. Marriage in America has enough difficulty without the penalty from the Federal Government. 
   I wish to give you a statistic from Rutgers University, a study they did about marriage being in the state of decline it is today. From 1960 to 1996, the annual number of marriages per 1,000 adult women declined by almost 43 percent, a precipitous falloff in the number of people getting married in a period of about 36 years. At the same time that fewer adults are getting married, far more young adults are cohabiting. In fact, between 1960 and 1998, virtually the same period, the number of unwed cohabiting couples increased by 1,000 percent. We gave them a tax subsidy for doing that. We taxed the married people. Is that the proper signal for Government to send? 
   When marriage as an institution breaks down, children suffer. The past few decades have seen a huge increase in out-of-wedlock births--we are at nearly 30 percent of our population born to single mothers--and divorce, the combination of which has substantially undermined the well-being of children in virtually all areas of life: physical and psychological health, socialization, academic achievement, and even in the likelihood of suffering physical abuse. 
   That is not to say some single parents do not struggle heroically to raise children. They do, and many get it done. It is simply to say it is far more difficult, and the numbers are bearing that out for us as a society that this is a very difficult thing to do, and has an enormous social cost in the aggregate associated with it. 
   Study after study has shown that children do best when they grow up in a stable home, raised by two parents who are committed to each other through marriage. It should not take studies to tell us that. That is basic common sense and the experience we have. Newlyweds face enough challenges without paying punitive damages in the form of a marriage tax. Think of that. It really is basically punitive damages. If you get married, we are going to sock you with punitive damages in the amount of $1,400 a year. The last thing the Federal Government should do is penalize the institution that is the foundation of a civil society. We must eliminate the marriage penalty. 
   The surging surplus is a result of nonpayroll tax receipts. In other words, the surplus is really a tax overpayment to the Government--personal income and capital gains taxes. We must give the American people the growth rebate they deserve and 
   return this overpayment in the form of the marriage penalty elimination and the estate tax elimination. We can. We should start now. I believe we must do it for a healthy society, for a healthy married society, for a healthy family society, for a healthy economical society, for small businesses and family farms. To rid the American people of the marriage tax penalty and the estate tax is something we can and we should do this year. 
   I am delighted Senator HUTCHISON from Texas continues this fight; that Senator ASHCROFT from Missouri has been one of the leaders in this fight. You can start to taste victory. It is going to be a tough fight. Clearly, there is not an excuse not to do it this year. We are starting early. We have the resources. The American people want us to do this. We need to send this signal to a society which is asking us: Where are the values in society? Where is the morality? 
   We need to rebuild the civil society. These are enormously positive messages and notes we can send by doing this. 
   With that, I call on my colleagues, all, to vote for these proposals. Do it together in a family tax cut and eliminate these two taxes. 
   I yield the floor to my good friend and colleague from the State of Missouri. He has been a leader for many years on rebuilding civil society. Here is one more area and effort he is leading, in working for the elimination of this marriage penalty. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill along with Senators LEAHY, COCHRAN, JEFFORDS, HELMS, DURBIN, LUGAR, EDWARDS, VOINOVICH, MCCAIN, and FEINSTEIN, which seeks to protect the integrity of high school and college sports and reduce the unseemly influences that gambling has on our student athletes. 
   I think you can tell by the coalition of people putting in this bill we are introducing today that this is a bipartisan issue that crosses virtually all ideological lines but is deeply concerned about the integrity of intercollegiate athletics and amateur sports. What we are seeking to do by this bill is to make it clear that it is illegal to wager on intercollegiate athletics, to wager on the Olympics. 
   The High School and College Gambling Prohibition Act is in direct response to recommendations made by the National Gambling Impact Study Commission (NGISC), which last year concluded a 2-year study on the impact of legalized gambling on our country. 
   The recommendation called for a ban on all legalized gambling on amateur sports and is supported by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), which represents more than 1,000 colleges and universities nationwide. This bipartisan bill will prohibit all legalized gambling on high school and college sports, as well as the Summer and Winter Olympic Games. 
   Gambling on college games and student athletes is not only inappropriate, it can be disastrous. There have been more point-shaving scandals on our colleges and universities in the 1990's than in every other decade before it combined. 
   There have been 10 such cases in the 1990s. Those are the ones who were caught. How many went on that we don't know about? These scandals are a result of an increasing amount of gambling that is taking place on amateur sports. We now have annually around $1 billion a year bet legally on amateur athletic games. That may sound like a lot, and it is. It is a lot to influence those games, but for the overall gambling industry it is a small percentage. It is less than a half of 1 percent. So to the industry that is small. To amateur athletics it is big, and it is leading to a burgeoning problem that we are having of point shaving cases amongst college athletics. 
   The scandal also points to another problem, and this gambling increase actually points to another problem. 
   A recent Gallup poll found that betting on college sports was twice as prevalent among teenagers (18%) as adults (9%). The American Academy of Pediatrics estimates that there are more than a million compulsive teenage gamblers, whose first experience with gambling is on sports. The National Gambling Impact Study Commission warned that sports gambling ``can serve as gateway behavior for adolescent gamblers, and can devastate individuals and careers.'' 
   Critics have claimed this is a State issue, not a Federal one. Certainly, I am listening to that debate and am a person who is a strong supporter of States rights and believe strongly in devolution of authority from the Federal Government to the State government. But this argument just doesn't hold water. 
   Congress already determined that it is a federal issue with the passage of Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) in 1992. In addition, while Nevada is the only state where legal gambling on collegiate and Olympic sporting events occurs, Nevada's gaming regulations prohibit gambling on any of Nevada's own teams because of the potential to jeopardize the integrity of those sporting events. 
   Let me give you the truth of the situation. You can go to Nevada and you cannot bet on UNLV in the basketball game. But you can bet on the University of Kansas basketball team and game. The reason the Nevada Legislature, I understand, took issue with betting on Nevada teams is by saying, well, it creates an unseemly situation and the potential for abuse. If the potential is there in Nevada, it is there across the rest of the country. That is what the NCAA is citing, and that is why this is their top legislative issue. They are saying this is important because it is starting to influence more and more sporting events and that we are afraid that may happen in the future. 
   The NCAA used to be headquartered in Kansas. Until recently, it was headquartered in my State. 
   We all consider ourselves to be advocates of state's rights, but in our eyes that means a state's authority to determine how best to govern within that state's own boundaries--not the authority to set laws that allow a state to impose its policies on every other state while exempting itself. Gambling on college sports, both legal and illegal, threatens the integrity of the game--and that threat extends beyond any one state's border. 
   This legislation will have minimal economic impact on the Nevada casino industry. The NCAA has reported that sports betting makes up less than 1% of the total revenue by casinos in Las Vegas. The National Gambling Impact Study Commission Report recognized that sports wagering does not ``contribute to local economies or produce many jobs or create other economic sectors.'' 
   This is not an economic issue. It is not even a gambling issue. This is about the integrity of amateur athletics. It is about the integrity of the Olympics and whether or not there are going to continue to be more and more of these point-shaving cases involved because of the amount of money involved in the gambling and the ability to impact some of the athletes who are involved. 
   I want to make one other point too; that is, we are not talking about office pools or ``March Madness'' and people having an office pool that looks at the NCAA Final Four. Those activities we are not talking about at all. They go on. But we are not addressing that issue in this bill. What we are talking about is the legalized sports betting that takes place in casinos in Nevada  and how those large-scale bets impact on intercollegiate athletics across this country. 
   Senator LEAHY was on the floor earlier. And I, along with Senator DURBIN and TIM ROEMER from the House of Representatives had a press conference earlier today with the NCAA. At that press conference, we had the gentleman who orchestrated the northwest football point-shaving scheme problem that they had during the decade of the 1990s. He said if it wasn't for the ability to place the $20,000 legal bet in Nevada, he wouldn't have had the system in place to be able to organize and put the money out there to organize this scheme. He had a powerful statement of his personal contrition and how he feels about having been a part of that. He blames only himself. But he said the system was there--and the temptation clearly is. We are trying to move collegiate athletics into a legal area. 
   This nation's college and university system is one of our greatest assets. We offer the world the model for post-secondary education. Gambling on the outcome of college sporting events tarnishes the integrity of sports and diminishes respect and regard for our colleges and universities. This bill removes the ambiguity that surrounds gambling on college sports. It sends the clear and unmistakable message that it is illegal. We should not gamble with the integrity of our colleges, or the future of our college athletes. Our young athletes deserve legal protection from the seedy influences of the gambling industry, and fans deserve to know that athletic competitions are honest and fair. This legislation ensures that it will be so. I welcome your support. 
   I welcome anybody in this body and the House of Representatives to support us in this effort. It is important. I fear if we don't pass something like this, you are going to see more and more of these point-shaving scandals come about, as you see more and more athletes having the pressure they are facing with the potential for dollars occurring. 
   In the decade of the 1990s--I want to repeat this one fact because I think it is so important--there were 10 illegal point-shaving cases the NCAA caught and prosecuted. Those were the ones caught. During the decade of the 1980s, there were two; in the 1970s, one; and in the prior fifties and forties, one each. So we had won, one, two in the 1980s, and then 10 in the 1990s that we know about. How many more were there? Or worse still, how many more will there be in this decade of 2000 to 2010? Let's stop that. Let's send that clear message, that signal. Let's help our student athletes. Let's protect the integrity of the sport. 
   I introduce this bill, and I welcome any cosponsors.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I join my distinguished colleagues from Vermont, Senator LEAHY and Senator JEFFORDS, among others, to introduce this bill entitled The Refugee Protection Act of 1999, which restores fairness to our treatment of refugees who arrive at our shores seeking freedom from persecution and oppression. This bill should dramatically reduce incidences where refugees are wrongly returned to their countries to face imprisonment, torture, and even death. 
   It was about 400 years when the refugee Pilgrims arrived in this new land seeking religious liberty. Defined by such events since the earliest days of the Republic, America has provided asylum to those fleeing tyranny and seeking liberty. George Washington urged his fellow citizens ``to render this country more and more a safe and propitious asylum for the unfortunates of other countries.'' In his 1801 First Annual Message, President Thomas Jefferson asked, ``Shall oppressed humanity find no asylum on this globe?'' 
   In 1996, Congress changed the procedures by which arriving asylum seekers ask for protection in the United States, which our legislation corrects. Previously, arriving asylum seekers presented their claims directly to an immigration judge at an evidentiary hearing. The applicant could present witnesses and documentation to support their claim. Decisions by the immigration judge were subject to administrative and judicial review. 
   The new 1996 law did away with these fundamental due process protections, and instead, granted lower level INS officers the power to make life and death decisions that previously were entrusted to professional immigration judges. This new, unfortunate system of ``expedited removal'' presently allows for the immediate deportation of individuals who arrive without valid travel documents, such as a passport and visa. It can even be used against an individual who has a facially valid visa that INS inspectors suspect was obtained under false pretenses. In short,  the process is so expedited and summary that it has resulted in the improper deportation of refugees fleeing persecution and torture. Simply put, our legislation restores the pre-1996 due process procedures, including a judicial review. 
   Last year, Congress addressed the problems of religious persecution which continues to be a serious problem worldwide. Enactment of the International Religious Freedom Act was the first time in the history of democracy that any country had adopted comprehensive, national legislation on religious liberty. That legislation ensures that religious liberty will be an important factor in our nation's foreign policy considerations. In the May 17, 1999 final report to the Secretary of State and to President of the United States, the Advisory Committee on Religious Freedom Abroad said:  
   Putting an end to such (religious) persecution cannot be accomplished without providing meaningful protection to the victims of religious persecution. We must upgrade domestic procedures that identify and protect refugees and asylum seekers fleeing religious persecution. We must strengthen our overseas refugee processing mechanisms to reach those in need of rescue......And, here at home we must eliminate processes such as ``expedited removal'' that can make victims of those fleeing religious persecution rather than providing access to protection.  
   Consistent with this commitment to protect international religious liberty, we must also ensure that persons fleeing religious persecution are not wrongly turned away at our shores because of unfair procedures. This will be accomplished through this Act. 
   The Refugee Protection Act returns fairness to the system by limiting expedited removal procedures only to emergency situations. An ``emergency'' must be declared as such by the Attorney General, and typically involves large numbers of immigrants arriving en masse, so as to overwhelm the INS review system. In the event that ``expedited removal'' is employed, the Act requires an immigration judge to review the summary deportation order. Also, it permits claims for asylum to be filed beyond the one-year deadline created by the 1996 legislation, if there is good cause for the delay or when consideration of the claims is clearly in the interest of justice. 
   Our refugee asylum system reflects both the best and the worst policies, throughout our history as a nation. In 1939, more than 900 Jews aboard the SS St. Louis, who were within sight of Miami, were rejected and forced to return to Europe where they were murdered in concentration camps. Yet when World War II ended, the United States led the effort to establish universally recognized fundamental rights. As a result of this advocacy, the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights on December 10, 1948 which recognized a right of asylum. 
   Over the next 30 years the United States provided refuge to numerous people fleeing communism, including to those involved in `underground' democracy movements in Hungary, Cuba, and Southeast Asia. Yet it was not until 1980 that Congress enacted a comprehensive asylum system using the criteria of the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. The Convention defines a refugee as someone with a ``well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.'' Under the procedures of this Refugee Act of 1980, requests for asylum were decided by an immigration judge, thus providing a fundamental due process protection. Notably, this judicial review was stripped in the 1996 legislation, and is a flaw which our legislation seeks to correct. 
   Fair procedures are critically important in making life or death decisions, as asylum cases can be. At a June 24, 1999 hearing of the Senate Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights, Ms. Lavinia Limon, Director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement at the Department of Health and Human Services, noted:  
   Once released, torture victims often attempt to flee to countries such as the United States to become invisible and safe, and to survive. But they retain the impact of torture: they are not able to speak of their experiences for fear officials will not believe them or understand them or will regard them as criminals. They often cannot express themselves effectively in asylum interviews because they cannot speak articulately of their experiences and they feel vulnerable to all officials. They have learned to fear government and the police and they do not trust any government officials and authorities to help them. They have been weakened and disabled psychologically from the torture. Many times the victims must flee alone, enduring long periods of separation from their families who might otherwise provide emotional support.  
   Today the need for proper asylum reviews is greater than ever. Worldwide, religious intolerance and ethnic strife turn religious leaders and ordinary citizens into desperate asylum seekers. According to Amnesty International, government-sanctioned torture is practiced in 125 countries. 
   This legislation helps those fleeing intolerable injustices in the name of religious freedom and democracy. Placing the decision squarely in the hands of an immigration judge does not impose an unreasonable or impossible burden on the government. Congress should enact the Refugee Protection Act because it restores the fundamental due process protections needed to ensure that legitimate asylum seekers are not wrongly turned away.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Third-Generation Wireless Internet Act of 1999, a bill to prevent the FCC from applying the current spectrum cap imposed upon commercial mobile wireless services to new spectrum auctions. 
   Mr. President, the popularity of wireless services has far exceeded expectations. More people purchase wireless phones every month, and the duration of calls is growing rapidly as per-minute rates decline. 
   Mr. President, while the popularity of wireless has increased, the Internet has become a mass-market phenomenon. Flat-rate Internet-usage plans have lured millions of Americans online. Broadband services have increased the Internet applications available to consumers and drastically reduced the amount of time necessary to access information online. 
   Now, we are witnessing the marriage of the wireless and Internet crazes. Wireless Internet access presents consumers with the opportunity to access the Internet anywhere and anytime. 
   With wireless access, consumers will no longer be dependent upon personal computers to reach the Internet. However, wireless Internet access will only  become a mass-market phenomenon when consumers can obtain wireless broadband services that provide the bandwidth necessary to download information from the Internet on a hand-held device at reasonable speeds. 
   Third-generation wireless services represent the first wave of truly broadband mobile services. Third-generation services should enable wireless users to achieve speeds of up to 384 kilobits per second. But, Mr. President, to ensure the rapid deployment of third-generation services, Congress needs to provide wireless carriers with the ability to purchase additional spectrum at future FCC auctions, which many carriers cannot do under the current FCC policy. 
   Manufacturers are hesitant to produce equipment for third-generation applications, and wireless carriers are unable to roll out third-generation services, because wireless carriers do not have enough spectrum to offer true third-generation services. Consumers have an opportunity to have wireless high-speed access to the Internet. But until there is regulatory certainty that carriers will be able to obtain the spectrum necessary to offer third-generation services, consumers will have to wait before they can have a mobile on-ramp to the information superhighway.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. I yield myself 10 minutes.  
   Mr. President, I think there are a number of things that need a response. Let me first set this in the context of being from Kansas. Kansas has in its constitution a provision allowing for the homestead to be protected. That homestead is defined in Kansas law as a home in town on 1 acre or in the country on 160 acres. It is based on original Federal law. That Federal law was the Homestead Act that settled much of the Midwest. The Federal Government said the Federal Government owned this land, but if you could go out there and work those 160 acres and stay there for 5 years, the 160 acres was yours. That was the homestead. 
   There is a sanctity about the issue of the homestead. That is why it was built into our State constitution. That is why it has been so protected in the past and why I rise in support of the Hutchison-Brownback amendment and its amendment to what Senator KOHL would do. I will support the Kohl amendment if the Hutchison-Brownback amendment passes but not otherwise. This is an important part of our State. 
   What is being attempted by Senator KOHL and others--and I have great respect for them and their desires for what they are putting forward--is to take a right away from States that they have had for over 100 years. Bankruptcy law is in the Federal Constitution, but for over 100 years they have allowed States to set that homestead provision and said they would allow the States to determine the homestead issue. 
    Now we would be taking that right that the States have had for over 100 years and federalizing it. That is wrong. It is contrary to the devolution of States' rights. It is contrary to the Homestead Act that the Federal Government set, and it is harmful to farmers. 
   I used to practice agricultural law. I taught agricultural law. I have written books on this subject. The homestead provision in my State and many others has helped save family farmers. 
   These are not cases that make the newspaper or that are quoted here on the floor. Those, unfortunately, have happened as well. But listen to some of these cases that have occurred in Kansas. 
   A farm couple--the husband is age 52, and the wife is age 66--are cattle ranchers in eastern Kansas. They have been farming the same ranch since 1965. In 1997, the husband was cleaning out a swine lagoon and received a staph infection in his eye. He lost nearly 80 percent of his vision and became legally blind. At this time, his wife was also forced to take her mother in for health care reasons. She had to stay with them. This brought on numerous hardships for the family. It forced them into chapter 12 bankruptcy in December 1997. It doesn't sound very glitzy or a high-profile, newspaper-type case at this point. 
   Under chapter 12, they were not required to sell the homestead and 160 acres because of that homestead provision. These were paid for. They had these paid for. They were entitled to them under Kansas statute and under the Kansas Constitution. If not for this exemption, this family would have been forced to sell everything and would have been forced out onto the street and from their farm for which they worked so hard. The wife's exact words describing the homestead exemption were ``a godsend.'' 
   After an extensive reorganization, they are rebuilding their cattle herd. They are still repaying debts from the bankruptcy according to the reorganization. They have currently applied for a loan from Farm Credit to purchase more cattle and are very optimistic about the future. 
   That doesn't sound like a case that would make the newspaper. 
   This is a very practical thing that has happened throughout the history of Kansas that I can cite for you at various times. Typically, when we have the prices of farm commodities dropping and dropping substantially, farmers are caught with too much credit and too low prices. They will get in the squeeze, and the only thing they can save is the homestead. I have read abstracts of land titles across the State of Kansas, where this has been used time and time again, and none of those make the newspaper. Yet it is a part of their being able to build back. In this case, and many others, it is a part of them being able to pay their creditors in the future. This isn't about them moving to Florida or to Texas to bilk this law. 
   Here is another case. I will read to you about a farming couple from eastern Kansas. He is now 71. The wife is 55. They declared chapter 12 bankruptcy. They had trouble with their bank because of low commodity prices and many other typical struggles of a family farm. This is a typical case. Their homestead-exempted property consists of 160 acres valued at approximately $800 an acre, including the house and buildings. With the exemption, they were able to retain all of 
    their property for use as equity to start farming again. 
   Listen to what happened. The situation 3 years later is that this couple is about to pay off all of their creditors under the chapter 12 plan within the next few months and are now able to continue profitably with their farming operation. It is a happy ending that would have sadly ended without this sort of homestead provision. 
   There is a lot of talk about fraud that has taken place. I want to point out something in addressing this issue. 
   Currently in bankruptcy law, if there is a fraudulent transaction of taking money that should go to a creditor and placing it in an exempt property, the court can come in and set that aside and get that money back. That is under current bankruptcy law. 
   Also, in the base bill there is a provision that if you purchase a home within 2 years of bankruptcy, that can be brought back into the creditor estate so that the creditors can get hold of that. 
   There is a lot already built into the bankruptcy law as it is currently practiced, and as it has been interpreted by the courts. I have practiced in front of bankruptcy courts. There is also built into this change that within 2 years of purchasing a homestead, you can come back and get those assets. 
   What about some of these high-profile cases? In many of those cases, I think you will find that the courts go after and later set aside the transaction as a fraudulent transaction. But particularly, let's look at the case of Burt Reynolds, who has become kind of a poster boy in this situation. 
   He has not filed under chapter 7 bankruptcy. He is not in chapter 7 where you have this homestead provision. He is in chapter 11, which is a reorganization in bankruptcy usually reserved for corporations. But there are also some higher income individuals who can qualify for chapter 11. 
   An amendment offered in the Judiciary Committee by Senator GRASSLEY would close this chapter 11 loophole for wealthy individuals. Fortunately, that much needed amendment was passed during the markup despite some opposition from the others. 
   Mr. President, my simple plea is on a couple of fronts. 
   No. 1, this is contrary to what this Congress has been committed to do, which is devolution of power and authority to States and local units of government. Here we have an area of law that has been devolved to the States for over 100 years, and we are going to grab it. And we are going to pull it up here back from the States that built it into their constitutions, such as Kansas and Texas. We are going to grab it. The Federal Government is going to say this is ours. We are taking it away. That is completely contrary to devolution. 
   No. 2, this is very harmful to family farmers, many of whom have used these homestead provisions during times of bad commodity prices--in my State, and in others--to protect that 160-acre homestead, which is, as I mentioned at the outset, the sacrosanct unit--the family farm, to be able to protect it. 
   No. 3, it is already taken care of if these are fraudulent transactions that are occurring, that can be set aside by the bankruptcy judge under current law. If they were planning to go into bankruptcy and move those assets, they can come within 2 years and still get that asset back. So this has taken care of it. 
   It is harmful to family farmers. It is against devolution. It is against States rights, and this is the wrong way for us to go. It is going to hurt a lot of family farmers who use this day in and day out and don't make the newspaper but are just simply trying to make a decent living and they get caught in a bad commodity cycle.  
   During the 1980s, I worked with a lot of family farmers who got caught in a bad commodity cycle and used this homestead provision. They did not make the newspaper. But today, many of them are still farming simply because of the possibility of doing this, and they worked extra hard to pay their creditors even over and above what was required in bankruptcy law because they felt this is the honorable thing to do. 
   There are abuses under bankruptcy law. I would like to be able to support this bill at the end of the day. But this is not the right way to go for us. It is harmful for us to do this to family farmers and to States. 
   I support strongly the Hutchison-Brownback amendment and hope that it can be added to the Kohl amendment so that we can press forward with this bankruptcy reform. Otherwise, this Senator will certainly have to oppose the amendment. 
   Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of our time. 
   Mr. President, may I inquire as to how much time remains on our side?

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I wanted to point out two things. No. 1, there is a recent study of U.S. bankruptcy filings by the Executive Office of the United States Trustees. The Trustees are the people who actually do the bankruptcies. They are the ones who handle the financial transactions. They concluded that the homestead abuse is--and this is their quote--``a rare phenomenon.'' That was a quote from the United States Trustees, Executive Office of the United States Trustees. 
   The second point I wanted to make is, my State of Kansas has a homestead provision under the State constitution that dates back to 1859. Kansans have  used this for a long time. However, in the U.S. bankruptcy code, many small family farmers would not qualify for what is defined as a family farmer because they or their spouse have earned off-farm income. Because of that, under this particular provision, in farming States such as mine with similar homestead provisions, they would be impacted because they would not be able to qualify there. I want to make the point, that adds doubly to the difficulty we have here. 
   I reserve the remainder of our time.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to address the pending amendment put forward by Senator ASHCROFT. 
   Both leaders were previously up and talking on the floor about moving the bill forward. I think the underlying Ashcroft amendment is actually a pretty good way to move things forward. 
   It is something about which most of the parties agree. It is about an ambassador position at the U.S. Trade Representative's Office. I think that is an important and worthy goal. I do not know of anybody here who actually opposes it. I know the chairman of the Finance Committee has spoken already in favor of it. Here is a way maybe we can start to move this train forward. 
   I want to address it from a couple of perspectives, if I could, because I think this is an important aspect for my colleagues to listen and learn a little bit about. 
   This is at the U.S. Trade Representative's Office, which is our lead trade negotiator. We are going into the Seattle Round, which the United States will be hosting, of the World Trade Organization. This is the premier set of trade talks. 
   Agriculture is the lead issue that is going to be discussed during this round of trade talks. We do not have a permanent ag negotiator at the U.S. Trade Representative's Office. So we are going into trade negotiations, which the United States is hosting, where the lead issue is agriculture and we do not have an ambassador with permanent status. 
   That amendment is something I think most people in this body would actually support, perhaps unanimously. I hope we can move this bill forward. 
   I am glad that we are having some discussions about how we might be able to move this bill forward. 
   Here is a pretty simple, commonsense amendment. Most of our States have some agriculture in them. Here would be a representative who could help us make that trade go forward. 
   This position within the U.S. Trade Representative's Office has been established on an interim basis. It was not put in on a permanent basis. It was thought: Let's try this for a little period of time. It has proven to be effective. 
   My State of Kansas is a major agricultural exporting State. I think we are sixth in the country as far as agricultural exports. It is a key part of our economy. Being able to export food products is an important part of what we do, as well. So to be able to have somebody with an ambassador status to be able to address these sorts of trade negotiating issues at the USTR is important to my State. It is very important. 
   It is particularly important now when we are having so much difficulty with farm prices. Almost all of that is due to our inability to crack into markets around the world. Whether it is dealing with China and some of their trade barriers, whether it is dealing with the Europeans and their trade subsidies, their export subsidies, whether it is dealing with tariffs globally, the United States faces high agricultural tariffs around the world. 
   The United States has some of the lowest agricultural tariffs. This trade ambassador would make this a central focus. It would be her or his job to make sure we keep focused on that particular issue. That is an important one. It is vitally important in this body. It is important across this country, and it is certainly important to my State. 
   I think it would be an important signal for us to send to the other countries around the world that will be convening in Seattle the latter part of November, the first part of December; that the United States values agriculture; that the signal we are sending is: We are going to beef up the status of the people who we have negotiating agricultural issues. We are going to do so on a permanent basis. 
   I think, to date, a lot of times other countries have doubted our resolve on some issues, maybe questioned our willingness to hang in there. And here  is the signal to send: No. This is important. We are going to stay in there. We are going to stick with this particular issue. 
   This is another way we can send that signal. This amendment makes this a clear priority for the United States; that we establish this on a permanent basis. 
   Agriculture is a lead export industry for the United States. Some have different figures, but either the top or the second leading export of the United States is agriculture and food products. One would think you would have somebody of an ambassadorial status who would be our lead negotiator and could speak with some authority and have not only the title but the status to be able to do so. This amendment is straightforward. This person will exist at the U.S. Trade Representative's Office and have a permanent ambassadorial rank. 
   It sends an important signal, not only to our trade opponents agriculturally around the world; it sends an important signal to our agricultural producers in this country. My parents, my brother who farms full time, we say to them, it is important we have somebody of status dealing with agricultural trade upon which you are so dependent for your livelihood. 
   I think many times farmers in this country, particularly after the passage of the Freedom to Farm Act, said Freedom to Farm won't work unless you have freedom to aggressively market. Freedom to market means we have to pound open doors around the world to let our farmers and producers have a fair shot. This helps send a signal to our farmers that we meant it. 
   We meant it when we said freedom to farm also means we are also going to push freedom to market. Freedom to market means you have to be able to get your foot in the door. Right now they can't get their foot in the door in a lot of places. We have sanctions on a number of countries around the world. We also have high tariffs on a number of places around the world. This sends a signal to our farmers, the agricultural industry, to our agricultural processors, and our agricultural exporters that we deem this to be an important topic as well. I think it is altogether appropriate for us to want that. 
   We do have people at the U.S. Trade Representative's Office who are very supportive of agriculture, but there are thousands of different issues to deal with of an export nature. They go across many different industries. It is impossible for the U.S. Trade Representative to constantly keep a strong focus on the lead export industry in the country. They have a lot of other matters with which to deal. This will help keep that focus there within the U.S. Trade Representative's Office as well and do so on a permanent basis. 
   I rise to speak on behalf of this particular industry, on behalf of this particular position. I think it sends the right signal to our opponents who are against us in agricultural trade. I think it sends the right signal to our allies who want to open up agricultural trade opportunities that we think it is important. I think it sends a good signal to our agricultural producers that we deem this as important and that freedom to farm, to work, has to have freedom to market on top of that. I think that works well. 
   Clearly, a majority of the body wants to pass this bill. A supermajority of this body wants to pass this bill. This is an important trade initiative the chairman and ranking member have put forward. This amendment could help us move forward because it is an amendment which is probably unanimously supported. So as a facilitating effort, to try to move the total package forward, I think this one is a good start. I submit to my colleagues and to the leadership it is a good possibility. 
   I commend the chairman of the Finance Committee for the excellent work he has done on agricultural trade issues, which is important to his State as well, supporting this particular amendment and putting together a very important trade bill. I hope to be a part of the process to make sure it moves forward. I hope those who seek to stop it can be heard, but let us have a clear vote on this particular issue so we can have the will of the body be done. 
   I congratulate the chairman and thank him for his efforts and work.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to speak regarding the late Senator John Chafee. I have a few comments I want to make. 
   I was privileged to be presiding whenever our colleagues spoke about Senator Chafee and what a great man he was. People have gone through his resume. It struck me as I was listening that it is rare for us to recognize giants when they are among us. It is generally only after they leave us that we recognize the giant of the individual. 
   Senator Chafee was such a giant. For all the things he has done and for which he has been recognized--his work for his country, his fighting for his country, his service in this body, his service in Rhode Island--he was truly a giant among us. Only now do we measure his true greatness because we have this void in that he is no longer with us. He was a great giant, he was a humble giant, he was a kind giant, a giant of a man, and a giant of a soul. 
   We can look at his desk and see the flowers--and they are beautiful flowers. As I look at Senator Chafee's desk, I see this giant oak tree. It is a soaring oak tree, and it has limbs that branch out everywhere. It has leaves that are providing shade and support and nurturing and housing for so many people. It glistens and reaches all the way across America. 
   That is the kind of person he really is. He is a giant of that stature and that nature. The other thing about him is, he doesn't even want to be noticed that he is there. He just wants to do that. He just wants to provide this great shade and this great tree and this great support for this country. He really doesn't even want to be noticed. 
   When you said, my, isn't that great; he just kind of said, no, I just wanted to do this. I just wanted to help the people in this country whom I love so much, these people who are here for whom I feel so strongly. I believe that I have been given much. To whom much is given, much is expected. I am just providing what I think I ought to. 
   That was the kind of humble man he was. 
   I have my own personal experience and memory, as all of us do, about working with him. I am a newer Member, so I didn't have the length of service others did. But I was working with him on a rails-to-trails bill that had a particular problem for Kansas. This was a program he deeply loved. Yet I was having a particular narrow problem. Normally, one would think--I am a new Member and this is a program he loves; I am having a problem with it--that he would kind of quickly shuffle me to the side, that that would have been the normal experience. Yet he was the kindest man about it. He said: I know you have a problem with this. Let's see if we can work it out. He could have easily said: I really don't have time for this. I have more important things to do. But my problem was his problem. He worked with me, and he worked with me in kindness and in gentleness to try to deal with the problem I had with which, in many respects, he disagreed. Yet that was the kind of man he was. There was a great kindness about him. 
   In my estimation, few have carried greatness so gently as John Chafee carried it. If pride is the first sin, humility is the first grace. And John was a truly humble man. John was a man of grace. We will all miss him dearly, as we see this giant that is no longer amongst us. We loved him. God loves him. Our prayers will be with him and his family. 
   I only hope his memory can stay with us as long and that we can recognize that giant who was amongst us and in many respects that giant tree which is still there.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I want to speak for a brief period. The reason I want to speak is to read into the RECORD a great speech that was given by a Nobel Laureate for Peace prize winner in 1979. It fits in with the culmination of what we discussed today, the partial-birth abortion ban. That vote has taken place and we have had extended discussion on that. I think this is actually a very fitting final conclusion to this debate. 
   Mr. President, this speech is titled ``The Gift of Peace.'' It was given by Mother Teresa, Nobel Laureate, on December 11, 1979. I think it relates to a lot of what we have talked about here today. I will read it. I think it puts a good summary on it. 
   Mother Teresa said: 
   As we have gathered here together to thank God for the Nobel Peace Prize, I think it will be beautiful that we pray the prayer of St. Francis of Assisi which always surprises me very much--we pray this prayer every day after Holy Communion, because it is very fitting for each one of us, and I always wonder that 4-500 years ago as St. Francis of Assisi composed this prayer that they had the same difficulties that we have today, as we compose this prayer that fits very nicely for us also. I think some of you already have got it--so we will pray together. 
   Let us thank God for the opportunity that we all have together today, for this gift of peace that reminds us that we have been created to live that peace, and Jesus became man to bring that good news to the poor. He being God became man in all things like us except sin, and he proclaimed very clearly that he had come to give the good news. The news was peace to all of good will and this is something that we all want--the peace of heart--and God loved the world so much that he gave his son--it was a giving--it is as much as if to say it hurt God to give, because he loved the world so much that he gave his son, and he gave him to Virgin Mary, and what did she do with him? 
   As soon as he came in her life--immediately she went in haste to give that good news, and as she came into the house of her cousin, the child--the unborn child--the  child in the womb of Elizabeth, lit with joy. He was that little unborn child, was the first messenger of peace. He recognized the Prince of Peace, he recognized that Christ has come to bring the good news for you and for me. And as if that was not enough--it was not enough to become a man--he died on the cross to show that greater love, and he died for you and for me and for that leper and for that man dying of hunger and that naked person lying in the street not only of Calcutta, but of Africa, and New York, and London, and Oslo--and insisted that we love one another as he loves each one of us. And we read that in the Gospel very clearly--love as I have loved you--as I love you--as the Father has loved me, I love you--and the harder the Father loved him, he gave him to us, and how much we love one another, we, too, must give each other until it hurts. It is not enough for us to say: I love God, but I do not love my neighbour. St. John says you are a liar if you say you love God and you don't love your neighbour. How can you love God whom you do not see, if you do not love your neighbour whom you see, whom you touch, with whom you live. And so this is very important for us to realize that love, to be true, has to hurt. It hurt Jesus to love us, it hurt him. And to make sure we remember his great love he made himself bread of life to satisfy our hunger for his love. Our hunger for God, because we have been created for that love. We have been created in his image. We have been created to love and be loved, and then he has become man to make it possible for us to love as he loved us. He makes himself the hungry one--the naked one--the homeless one--the sick one--the one in prison--the lonely one--the unwanted one--and he says: You did it to me. Hungry for our love, and this is the hunger of our poor people. This is the hunger that you and I must find, it may be in our own home. 
   I never forget an opportunity I had in visiting a home where they had all these old parents of sons and daughters who had just put them in an institution and forgotten maybe. And I went there, and I saw in that home they had everything, beautiful things, but everybody was looking toward the door. And I did not see a single one with their smile on their face. And I turned to the sister and I asked: How is that? How is it that the people they have everything here, why are they all looking toward the door, why are they not smiling? I am so used to see the smile on our people, even the dying ones smile, and she said: This is nearly every day, they are expecting, they are hoping that a son or daughter will come to visit them. They are hurt because they are forgotten, and see--this is where love comes. That poverty comes right there in our own home, even neglect to love. Maybe in our own family we have somebody who is feeling lonely, who is feeling sick, who is feeling worried, and these are difficult days for everybody. Are we there, are we there to receive them, is the mother there to receive the child? 
   I was surprised in the waste to see so many young boys and girls given into drugs, and I tried to find out why--why is it like that, and the answer was: Because there is no one in the family to receive them. Father and mother are so busy they have no time. Young parents are in some institution and the child takes back to the street and gets involved in something. We are talking of peace. These are things that break peace, but I feel the greatest destroyer of peace today is abortion, because it is a direct war, a direct killing--direct murder by the mother herself. And we read in the Scripture, for God says very clearly. Even if a mother could forget her child--I will not forget you--I have curved you in the palm of my hand. We are curved in the palm of His hand so close to Him that unborn child has been curved in the hand of God. And that is what strikes me most, the beginning of that sentence, that even if a mother could forget something impossible--but even if she could forget--I will not forget your. And today the greatest means--the greatest destroyer of peace is abortion. And we who are standing here--our parents wanted us. We would not be here if our parents would do that to us. Our children, we want them, we love them, but what of the millions. Many people are very, very concerned with the children in India, with the children of Africa where quite a number die, maybe of malnutrition, of hunger and so on, but millions are dying deliberately by the will of the mother. And this is what is the greatest destroyer of peace today. Because if a mother can kill her own child--what is left for me to kill you and you to kill me--there is nothing between. And this I appeal in India, I appeal everywhere: Let us bring the child back, and this year being the child's year: What have we done for the child? At the beginning of the year I told, I spoke everywhere and I said: Let us make this year that we make every single child born, and unborn, wanted. And today is the end of the year, have we really made the children wanted? I will give you something terrifying. We are fighting abortion by adoption, we have saved thousands of lives, we have sent words to all the clinics, to the hospitals, police stations--please don't destroy the child, we will take the child. So every hour of the day and night it is always somebody, we have quite a number of unwedded mothers--tell them come, we will take care of you, we will take the child from you, and we will get a home for the child. And we have a tremendous demand for families who have no children, that is the blessing of God for us. And also, we are doing another thing which is very beautiful--we are teaching our beggars, our leprosy patients, our slum dwellers, our people of the street, natural family planning. 
   And in Calcutta alone in six years--it is all in Calcutta--we have had 61,273 babies less from the families who would have had, but because they practice this natural way of abstaining, of self-control, out of love for each other. We teach them the temperature meter which is very beautiful, very simple, and our poor people understand. And you know what they have told me? Our family is healthy, our family is united, and we can have a baby whenever we want. So clear--these people in the street, those beggars--and I think that if our people can do like that how much more you and all the others who can know the ways and means without destroying the life that God has created in us. The poor people are very great people. They can teach us so many beautiful things. The other day one of them came to thank and said: You people who have evolved chastity you are the best people to teach us family planning. Because it is nothing more than self-control out of love for each other. And I think they said a beautiful sentence. And these are people who maybe have nothing to eat, maybe they have not a home where to live, but they are great people. The poor are very wonderful people. One evening we went out and we picked up four people from the street. And one of them was in a most terrible condition--and I told the sisters: You take care of the other three, I take of this one that looked worse. So I did for her all that my love can do. I put her in bed, and there was such a beautiful smile on her face. She took hold of my hand, as she said one word only: Thank you--and she died. 
   I could not help but examine my conscience before her, and I asked what would I say if I was in her place. And my answer was very simple. I would have tried to draw a little attention to myself, I would have said I am hungry, that I am dying, I am cold, I am in pain, or something, but she gave me much more--she gave me her grateful love. And she died with a smile on her face. As that man whom we picked up from the drain, half eaten with worms, and we brought him to the home. I have lived like an animal in the street, but I am going to die like an angel, loved and cared for. And it was so wonderful to see the greatness of that man who could speak like that, who could die like that without blaming anybody, without cursing anybody, without comparing anything. Like an angel--this is the greatness of our people. And that is why we believe what Jesus has said: I was hungry--I was naked--I was homeless--I was unwanted, unloved, uncared for--and you did it to me. I believe that we are not real social workers. We may be doing social work in the eyes of the people, but we are really contemplatives in the heart of the world. For we are touching the body of Christ 24 hours. We have 24 hours in this presence, and so you and I. You too try to bring that presence of God in your family, for the family that prays together stays together. And I think that we in our family we don't need bombs and guns, to destroy to bring peace--just get together, love one another, bring that peace, that joy, that strength of presence of each other in the home. And we will be able to overcome all the evil that is in the world. There is so much suffering, so much hatred, so much misery, and we with our prayer, with our sacrifice are beginning at home. Love begins at home, and it is not how much we do, but how much love we put in the action that we do. It is to God Almighty--how much we do it does not matter, because He is infinite, but how much love we put in that action. How much we do to Him in the person that we are serving. Some time ago in Calcutta we had great difficulty in getting sugar, and I don't know how the word got around to the children, and a little boy of four years old, Hindu boy, went home and told his parents: I will not eat sugar for three days, I will give my sugar to Mother Teresa for her children. After three days his father and mother brought him to our house. I had never met them before, and this little one could scarcely pronounce my name, but he knew exactly what he had come to do. He knew that he wanted to share his love. And this is why I have received such a lot of love from you all. From the time that I have come here I have simply been surrounded with love, and with real, real understanding love. It could feel as if everyone in India, everyone in Africa is somebody very special to you. And I felt quite at home I was telling Sister today. I feel in the Convent with the Sisters as if I am in Calcutta with my own Sisters. So completely at home here, right here. And so here I am talking with you--I want you to find the poor here, right in your own home first. And begin love there. Be that good news to your own people. And find out about your next-door neighbor--do you know who they are? I had the most extraordinary experience with a Hindu family who had eight children. A gentleman came to our house and said: Mother Teresa, there is a family with eight children, they had not eaten for so long--do something. So I took some rice and I went there immediately. And I saw the children--their eyes shining with hunger--I don't know if you have ever seen hunger. But I have seen it very often. And she took the rice, and divided the rice, and she went out. When she came back I asked her--where did you go, what did you do? And she gave me a very simple answer: They are hungry also. What struck me most was that she knew--and who are they, a Muslim family--and she knew. I didn't bring more rice that evening  because I wanted them to enjoy the joy of sharing. But there was those children, radiating joy, sharing the joy with their mother because she had the love to give. And you see this is where love begins--at home. And I want you--and I am very grateful for what I have received. It has been a tremendous experience and I go back to India--I will be back by next week, the 15th I hope--and I will be able to bring your love. 
   And I know well that you have not given from your abundance, but you have given until it hurts you. Today the little children they gave--I was so surprised--there is so much joy for the children that are hungry. That the children like themselves will need love and care and tenderness, like they get so much from their parents. So let us thank God that we have had this opportunity to come to know each other, and this knowledge of each other has brought us very close. And we will be able to help not only the children of India and Africa, but will be able to help the children of the whole world, because as you know our Sisters are all over the world. And with this Prize that I have received as a Prize of Peace, I am going to try to make the home for many people that have no home. Because I believe that love begins at home, and if we can create a home for the poor--I think that more and more love will spread. And we will be able through this understanding love to bring peace, be the good news to the poor. The poor in our own family first, in our country and in the world. To be able to do this, our Sisters, our lives have to be woven with prayer. They have to be woven with Christ to be able to understand, to be able to share. Because today there is so much suffering--and I feel that the passion of Christ is being relived all over again--are we there to share that passion, to share that suffering of people. Around the world, not only in the poor countries, but I found the poverty of the West so much more difficult to remove. When I pick up a person from the street, hungry, I give him a plate of rice, a piece of bread, I have satisfied. I have removed that hunger. But a person that is shut out, that feels unwanted, unloved, terrified, the person that has been thrown out from society--that poverty is so hurtable and so much, and I find that very difficult. Our Sisters are working amongst that kind of people in the West. So you must pray for us that we may be able to be that good news, but we cannot do that without you, you have to do that here in your country. You must come to know the poor, maybe our people here have material things, everything, but I think that if we all look into our own homes, how difficult we find it sometimes to smile at each other, and that the smile is the beginning of love. And so let us always meet each other with a smile, for the smile is the beginning of love, and once we begin to love each other naturally we want to do something. So you pray for our Sisters and for me and for our Brothers, and for our co-workers that are around the world. That we may remain faithful to the gift of God, to love Him and serve Him in the poor together with you. What we have done we would not have been able to do if you did not share with your prayers, with your gifts, this continual giving. But I don't want you to give me from your abundance, I want that you give me until it hurts. The other day I received 15 dollars from a man who has been on his back for twenty years, and the only part that he can move is his right hand. And the only companion that he enjoys is smoking. And he said to me: I do not smoke for one week, and I send you this money. It must have been a terrible sacrifice for him, but see how beautiful, how he shared, and with that money I bought bread and I gave to those who are hungry with a joy on both sides, he was giving and the poor were receiving. This is something that you and I--it is a gift of God to us to be able to share our love with others. And let it be as it was for Jesus. Let us love one another as he loved us. Let us love Him with undivided love. And the joy of loving Him and each other--let us give now--that Christmas is coming so close. Let us keep that joy of loving Jesus in our hearts. And share that joy with all that we come in touch with. And that radiating joy is real, for we have no reason not to be happy because we have Christ with us. Christ in our hearts, Christ in the poor that we meet, Christ in the smile that we give and the smile that we receive. Let us make that one point: That no child will be unwanted, and also that we meet each other always with a smile, especially when it is difficult to smile. 
   I never forget some time ago about 14 professors came from the United States from different universities. And they came to Calcutta to our house. Then we were talking about home for the dying in Calcutta, where we have picked up more than 36,000 people only from the streets of Calcutta, and out of that big number more than 18,000 have died a beautiful death. They have just gone home to God; and they came to our house and we talked of love, of compassion, and then one of them asked me: Say, Mother, please tell us something that we will remember, and I said to them: Smile at each other, make time for each other in your family. Smile at each other. And then another one asked me: Are you married, and I said: Yes, and I find it sometimes very difficult to smile at Jesus because he can be very demanding sometimes. This is really something true, and there is where love comes--when it is demanding, and yet we can give it to Him with joy. Just as I have said today, I have said that if I don't go to Heaven for anything else I will be going to Heaven for all the publicity because it has purified me and sacrificed me and made me really something ready to go to Heaven. I think that this is something, that we must live life beautifully, we have Jesus with us and He loves us. If we could only remember that God loves me, and I have an opportunity to love others as He loves me, not in big things, but in small things with great love, then Norway becomes a nest of love. And how beautiful it will be that from here a centre for peace of war has been given. That from here the joy of life of the unborn child comes out. If you become a burning light in the world of peace, then really the Nobel Peace Prize is a gift of the Norwegian people. God bless you!  
   I simply wanted to put Mother Teresa's speech here again as a reminder to us of one of the great people of the world of our time, one that we have had the pleasure of having in this body, and that at the face of all this, we are really talking about peace. We are talking about a caring peace. 
   I hope that we can move forward as a society, whether we want to do it by laws or not by laws. If we want to do it, we are persuading people's hearts. What we are talking about is the peace of that individual, and peace of mind, caring, caring through adoption. 
   I hope we can move our hearts--all of us, whether we disagree or agree on the legislation--forward to reach out to that child and to those children the way she did.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Thank you very much. I thank my colleague, Senator SANTORUM, for once again bringing this important issue in front of this body and to this floor. 
   Once again, I join Senator SANTORUM as an original cosponsor of this legislation to end partial-birth abortion in this country. Last year, the Senate failed to override the President's veto by three votes. President Clinton has twice vetoed similar measures in 1996 and 1997. We will continue, however, to raise this issue until the President signs this into law, or until this procedure is banned for forever. 
   I follow my colleague from Connecticut, who I rarely disagree with on matters of this nature. But this happens to be one of those which I do. I view this as an abhorrent procedure, as my colleague from Connecticut does as well. I also view it as a constitutional issue that we can raise, that we can deal with, and this body should deal with. 
   This goes to one of the most fundamental issues for us as a country, for us as a people, and that is when life begins and when it should be protected. These lives should be protected. 
   As I sat and listened to much of this discussion, I have to say I am sad as I listened to this discussion because it is so difficult, and it is such an awful thing--the birth of a child, and then it is killed by a blunt instrument. 
   I think some medical facts bear mentioning at this point in time. 
   Brain wave activity is detectable in human beings at 41 days after conception--just 41 days. A heartbeat is detectable 24 days after conception. 
   Consistently, State statutory or case law establishes a criteria of dead as the  irreversible cessation of brain wave activity or spontaneous cardiac arrest. 
   In short, these are lives of individuals that are ended by this process. It is death. These are heartbeats and brain waves. They are stopped. They are denied life by this abhorrent procedure. 
   I would like to share some thoughts with you from a writer, a Jewish writer, Sandi Merl, when he was asked about this procedure of partial-birth abortion. He said this:  
   When I think of Partial-Birth Abortion, I hear only the first two words--``partial birth.'' To me, this procedure is not abortion. It is pre-term delivery followed by an act of destruction leading to a painful death ..... This is infanticide, clearly and simply, and must be stopped ..... This is about leaving no fingerprints when committing a murder of convenience.  
   That is why I will once again vote to end partial-birth abortion when it comes to the Senate floor. It is a cruel and shameless procedure which robs us of our humanity with every operation performed. It is not true that the anesthesia kills the child before removal from the womb. Instead, it is the fact that the baby is actually alive and experiences extraordinary pain when undergoing the operation. 
   Nor is this brutality only reserved for the most extreme circumstances. According to the executive director of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers, the ``vast majority'' of partial-birth abortions are performed in the fifth and sixth months of pregnancy on healthy babies of healthy mothers. 
   The facts speak for themselves. Bluntly put, this involves the death of a child in a brutal fashion, and all of it legally condoned by the current President of the United States. 
   Our institutionalized indifference to this extraordinary suffering makes me wonder, what has happened to our collective conscience as a nation? Are we really so callous that we knowingly condone this form of death for our very weakest, which we would never force on any adult, no matter how bad the crime? Even murderers on death row are given more consideration when executed. Yet our babies are painfully killed while conscious. This extraordinary cruelty should cause us to bow our heads in shame. 
   In a Wall Street Journal article, Peggy Noonan rightly labeled events such as that at Columbine High School as evidence of a much deeper problem, one she identified as the ``culture of death.'' Quoting Pope John Paul II from his recent visit to Mexico City, he urged a rejection of this increasingly influential culture of death, instead embracing the dignity and principles of life for everyone. 
   It is obvious, especially after the Columbine tragedy, that a culture of death is playing in our land. Lately, the volume has been turned up very loudly. The words to this song include the extremes we know now by heart: Excessively high murder rates, the repeated rampages of violence by schoolchildren against schoolchildren, the unending tawdriness of television programming and other media, to name only a few cultural malfunctions. 
   As Noonan went on to observe:  
   No longer say, if you don't like it, change the channel. [People] now realize something they didn't realize ten years ago: There is no channel to change to.  
   Perhaps our increasingly violent culture has dulled our consciences and worn us down to this place where it no longer is politically expedient to protest the obscene suffering of infants. This explains why we continue to tolerate such a brutal practice as partial-birth abortion--what a dreadful name. I hope it isn't so. It is to this conscience that I appeal. I appeal to those who recognize the suffering and do not turn their heads, who take personal responsibility to correct this course of destruction, no matter the political consequences. 
   Please, please, open your hearts and listen. Hear that voice in there, the cries of thousands of little children, saying: Hear me, let me live. 
   Every once in a while, something happens which shakes us from our dullness. I want to share an event reported in the Washington Times that described an incident in April of this year in Cincinnati where a botched partial-birth abortion resulted in the birth of a little girl who lived for 3 hours. It is reported that the emergency room technician rocked and sang to her. After the inevitable death of the baby, the staff members grieved so badly that hours were spent in counseling and venting to get over the emotional trauma of the incident. One person observed that the real tragedy is that no laws were broken. 
   I hope we will continue to let ourselves be troubled by this event and by this practice and instead of turning a cold heart to it or saying, ``I'm tied into a certain political position I can't change.'' I hope we will prayerfully consider and at night go and search ourselves and ask: Is this something we want to continue in America? Is this something I want to be a part of allowing to continue in America? 
   People of great tradition serve in this body who seek to protect and to serve the poorest of the poor and the weakest of the weak in our culture and society. They serve so admirably, and they speak glowingly about the need to protect those who are weakest. Yet, is it not this child in the womb who is the weakest of all in our society and in our culture? And that child cries right now. If we will just for a moment listen, we will hear the cry of that child. Can't we just for a moment turn from our locked in, dug in 
   positions and say, OK, just for a moment I will listen, I will see if I can hear that small voice that is crying out to me: Just let me live. Let me have that God-given life that has been promised to me. Let me have that God-given life of which we speak so eloquently in our Declaration of Independence and our Constitution.  
   We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life. .....  
   Let's live. Let's stop this culture of death from going forward. Let's appeal to that inner voice that says let that life live. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, on behalf of myself and Senator DORGAN, the Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Act of 1999. This legislation is the product of more than a year's worth of negotiations between the Governors, cities, State tax and local tax authorities, and the wireless industry. 
   The legislation represents an historic agreement between State and local governments and the wireless industry to bring sanity to the manner in which wireless telecommunications services are taxed. 
   For as long as we have had wireless telecommunications in this country, we have had a taxation system that is incredibly complex for carriers and costly for consumers. Today, there are several different methodologies that determine whether a taxing jurisdiction may tax a wireless call. 
   If a call originates at a cell site located in a jurisdiction, it may impose a tax. If a call originates at a switch in the jurisdiction, a tax may be imposed. And if the billing address is in the jurisdiction, a tax can be imposed. 
   As a result, many different taxing authorities can tax the same wireless call. The farther you travel during a call, the greater the number of taxes that can be imposed upon it. 
   This system is simply not sustainable as wireless calls represent an increasing portion of the total number of calls made throughout the United States. To reduce the cost of making wireless calls, Senator DORGAN and I are introducing this legislation. 
   The legislation would create a nationwide, uniform system for the taxation of wireless calls. The only jurisdictions that would have the authority to tax mobile calls would be the taxing authorities of the customer's place of primary use, which would essentially be the customer's home or office. 
   By creating this uniform system, Congress would be greatly simplifying the taxation and billing of wireless calls. The wireless industry would not have to keep track of countless tax laws for each wireless transaction. State and local taxing authorities would be relieved of burdensome audit and oversight responsibilities without losing the authority to tax wireless calls. And, most importantly, consumers would see reduced wireless rates and fewer billing headaches. 
   The Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Act is a win-win-win. It's a win for industry, a win for government, and a win for consumers. I thank Senator DORGAN for working with me in crafting this bill. And, most of all, I thank government and industry for coming together and reaching agreement on this important issue.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to add my support to S. 1652, a bill to designate the Old Executive Office Building located at 17th and Pennsylvania, here in the District of Columbia, and the Dwight D. Eisenhower Executive Office Building. 
   I remind my colleagues of the many accomplishments and selfless contributions of our 34th President. His strong character and remarkable achievements have made him a role model for many young people worldwide. As a native of Kansas myself, it is an honor to commemorate this fellow Kansan by associating his name with a remarkable architectural landmark like the Old Executive Office Building. 
   Born 25 years after the end of the civil war, Dwight David Eisenhower was the third son of David and Ida Eisenhower. He spent his formative years sharing a crowded house with five brothers in Abilene, Kansas. He sought and received an appointment to West Point. In 1927 he entered Army War College here in Washington, DC. His early Army career saw rapid advancement through the ranks. Within 11 years, he was chief military aide to Gen. Douglass MacArthur and by the age of 40 served as Army Chief of Operations. While holding these positions, Eisenhower occupied several offices in the Old Executive Office Building and spent many hours walking the white marble tile corridors. 
   On June 6, 1944, he was Supreme Commander of the D-Day Normandy invasion. Through his actions and duties, his name became synonymous with heroism. Just 6 months later, he was promoted to U.S. Army's highest ranking, General of the Army. 
   After the war, Eisenhower's popularity with the American people soared. In 1948, he actually received the nomination for President from both political parties but declined the honor. Instead, he became the president of Columbia University in New York City. Fear of communist built-up and disappointment with the mismanagement of the Korean war, convinced Eisenhower that he had a duty to run, and in 1952 he received the Republican nomination for President. 
   Eisenhower's two terms as President of the United States saw many progressive and important accomplishments. After inauguration, he signed a truce that brought an armed peace along the border of South Korea and effectively ended the war. In 1956, he sponsored the first civil rights bill since Reconstruction. Eisenhower signed legislation creating the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and witnessed Alaska and Hawaii become States. His public works programs included the Saint Lawrence Seaway in 1954 and the Interstate Highway System in 1956, the largest construction project in history. Perhaps Eisenhower's greatest feat during his presidency was making and keeping the peace with communist countries. Eisenhower seldom boasted, but he once summed up one of the proudest accomplishments of his presidency in these words: ``The United States never lost a soldier or a foot of ground in my administration. We kept the peace. People asked how it happened--by God, it didn't just happen, I'll tell you that.'' 
   Dwight D. Eisenhower attributed his success and good fortune to ``..... a lifetime of continuous association with men and women ..... who ..... gave others inspiration and guidance.'' His parents, church, and community were first among them. The small town environment of Abilene, Kansas taught him ambition without arrogance and self-dependence with a concern for others. President Eisenhower never forgot where his strength or that of the Nation came from. In June of 1954, an amendment was made to add the words ``one Nation under God'' to the Pledge of Allegiance. Eisenhower remarked, ``In this way we are reaffirming the transcendence of religious faith in America's heritage of future; in this way we shall constantly strengthen those spiritual weapons which forever will be our country's most powerful resource in peace and war.'' 
   So, in renaming this most historic structure, we celebrate not only the accomplishments of President Eisenhower, but the strong, loving family and nurturing community of his youth which helped propel him to greatness. These are the values with which we attempt to equip our children and prepare great leaders for our future. 
   Many of the young people of our country have little or no idea who this great American was or what his leadership in both war and peace meant to the nation and the world. It is my hope that when Americans visit the Dwight D. Eisenhower Executive office Building, a curiosity about his heritage is evoked in children and adults alike, and people are inspired by his example. 
   I encourage all Senators to support this bipartisan legislation and honor our former President and wartime leader Dwight D. Eisenhower.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. I rise to thank Father Chad Hatfield of the All Saints Orthodox Church, Salina, KS, for his encouraging words. 
   Today, it is appropriate to honor this man of God by describing his service to the people of Kansas. 
   Father Hatfield has served faithfully in the ministry for over 20 years and is presently the senior pastor of an Eastern Orthodox congregation. Before settling in Kansas, he lived in several places including South Africa during far more difficult days. His duties included ministering as well as editing a South African theological journal. He became an ordained Orthodox priest in January 1994, after several years in the Episcopal Church. 
   He is a respected theologian, as well as a man of deep faith whose talent lies in pointing people to a relationship with God. He is known for his special events for those exploring Christian Orthodoxy, and many in his congregation are new converts because of his witness. 
   I hope my words capture his strength and wisdom. This is a man who has dedicated himself to the people of his parish, not because it was his job but because they are his flock. His is the work of opening Godly mysteries, while serving the needs of those in his community. He is a servant to those in trouble involving the persecuted church overseas, youth violence at home, reducing teen pregnancy, preserving marriages, and helping promote such projects as Faith Works of Kansas which links needy families with churches to help people get back on their feet. His is the work of a true shepherd, and it is work which surely will remain. 
   The Bible says in Psalm 119:105, ``Thy word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.'' Mr. President, I hope you join me in thanking Father Hatfield for his prayer and lighting our path for this day. 
   I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise in support of what my colleague from Missouri just spoke about. As he was speaking, I was thinking where I was when the embargo happened. In the late seventies, I was a farm broadcaster in Manhattan, KS, when President Carter put the embargo on the Soviet Union. My dad was farming, as he is today. We were both long in wheat. Wheat went down lock limit for 3 days in a row with that embargo. The markets did not recover when that big of a sale was taken out of the system. We lost a lot of money. 
   Senator ASHCROFT was talking about how much we lost as a nation and how much our farmers lost. I remember what we lost as a family in that embargo, not that it should be any deciding factor, but it galvanized in my mind what happens when we do these sorts of things. That is, we lose markets, we lose money, our farmers are penalized, punished--and the Soviet Union got cheaper grain out of the deal. It was bad for us all the way around. 
   One of my great disappointments with the Ag appropriations conference report is that we had a chance to end once and for all the use of food and medicine as a foreign policy tool. We did not take that chance, and we are poorer for it. We should have gotten this monkey off the back of U.S. farmers. 
   I rise to state my strong disappointment with this conference report, even though my colleague from Mississippi, who chairs this subcommittee, has done everything he possibly can. There is a lot of good in this appropriations conference report, but we missed a chance to lift these unilateral sanctions on food and medicine. 
   As you have already heard several times, the Ashcroft amendment was adopted overwhelmingly in this body by a vote of 70-28. It is important to keep mentioning that fact because it is astonishing to me that such a clear message from the Senate could be so easily ignored. 
   In a place as diverse as America and as compact as Congress, there are bound to be honest disagreements about any number of issues, including sanctions. These disagreements were given a thorough and extensive airing in the Senate, and the result was an overwhelming majority decided it was not an effective policy tool to use food and medicine in foreign policy. This is a conclusion that a vast majority of the American public has already recognized for some time and certainly the farming public has recognized this for a long period of time. 
   What has occurred with the Agriculture appropriations bill is an attempt to avoid this important policy issue. I am delighted we are going to bring it back up next week and discuss it, but it is an unfortunate tactic that has moved us to next week rather than now in deciding this critical policy issue for U.S. agriculture and for America's foreign policy. Compounding this wrong is the fact that U.S. agriculture is in the midst of an economic struggle, and sanctions serve to limit U.S. markets for no real policy effect. 
   Unilaterally using food and medicine as foreign policy weapons fails to take into account that the U.S. has competition in agriculture. If we do not  sell it, somebody else will, and that is what has taken place in the past. It is time we limit the possibility of this happening again in the future to the United States. 
   Even if the U.S. denies trade with another nation, other countries will, and do eagerly, sell these products. We know this for a fact. The only one who gets hurt in this process is truly the U.S. farmer, the farmers across Kansas who do not get to make these sales. 
   While it is difficult to calculate the actual gain that lifting sanctions would bring in the short term it is easy to see the long-term benefits of sanctions reform. These benefits include the increased sales to new markets because we tell that new market we will be a reliable supplier; we will not just step in willy-nilly on this; we will be reliable in our supplying. Perhaps even more profound, this policy serves to reassure all our trading 
   partners that the U.S. will continue and will always be that constant and reliable supplier of agricultural goods. This assurance is necessary in a competitive market. 
   Efforts to reinstate this important sanctions relief language or find a compromise have certainly been valiantly put forward by Senator ASHCROFT, Senator DORGAN, and a number of others, including the Chair. I commend my neighbors in this principled fight and their persistence on this issue. Still the few who oppose sanctions reform have blocked any progress. 
   Reluctantly, I will vote for this bill because farmers and producers are depending on the emergency aid funding contained in this bill. But I truly believe the future of U.S. agriculture depends on the long-term reforms such as this Senate-passed amendment lifting unilateral sanctions. I will continue to fight on this issue and insist that the will of the majority be followed. 
   In conclusion, we had a chance to once and for all remove the use of food and medicine as a foreign policy tool, and we missed it. We could do something good, something right, morally on the high ground, the right thing for U.S. farmers, the right thing for those consumers in places around the world who need and should have this good, high quality food product we have. We missed that opportunity. We are poorer for it, and so is the rest of the world. We will have this fight again next week. I hope we can still move this bill this session of Congress. I lament we did not do it on this piece of legislation. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
   Mr. KOHL addressed the Chair.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I yield myself up to 10 minutes to speak on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. 
   Mr. President, there have been a number of arguments put forward against and for the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. We have heard, most recently, arguments for ratification of the treaty. I join my colleague from Maryland in noting that I think there would be a wide basis of support saying we should not bring it up at this time. But neither should we bring it up next year. I know a number of my colleagues on this side of the aisle would say it would be a good thing if we could agree not to go ahead and go forward with a vote now, but not to do that during this session of Congress, either the rest of this year or next year, so we won't constantly be going back and visiting this issue during this Congress. We have it on the floor and it is time to discuss it. I think people can agree that we won't hear it again this Congress, and we can move forward with that discussion and have this debate and not proceed to a vote if people think that would do more harm than good. 
   I want to address a number of arguments put forward by the President and by others on this Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. I note the President stated in his weekly radio address that every President since Eisenhower--a Kansan--has supported this treaty. The reality of this is actually that no previous administration, either Republican or Democrat, has ever supported the zero-yield test ban now in this treaty before the Senate. Eisenhower insisted that nuclear tests with a seismic magnitude of less than 4.75 be permitted. Kennedy terminated a 3-year moratorium on nuclear tests, declaring that ``never again'' would the United States make such a mistake. He then embarked upon the most aggressive series of nuclear tests in the history of the weapons program. Carter, Reagan, and Bush all opposed a zero-yield test ban while in office. Even the present administration initially opposed a permanent zero-yield test ban before signing onto the CTBT. 
   It has been claimed that the CTBT hasn't been given enough Senate floor time. The unanimous-consent agreement provides for 22 hours of debate on the CTBT. By contrast, the START treaty had 9.5 hours; START II had 6 hours; the Chemical Weapons Convention had 18 hours. We are going to put a lot of time in on this. The White House insisted for 2 years that the Senate vote on the CTBT, using terms such as ``now,'' ``immediately,'' ``right away.'' Now when we are ready to vote, they don't seem to be willing to enter into that debate and vote. 
   Another thing the President said in his news conference in Canada was this was being ``politically motivated.'' I reject that, Mr. President. You do not consider items such as this with any consideration for political motivation. This is nuclear testing we are talking about. This is a critical issue to the world--to my four children. That is something you don't interject any bit of politics into. I reject that notion altogether. 
   There are a couple of other arguments bantered about quite a bit--one that I have taken most note of because it causes me the most pause to think is what would other countries think if we voted down the treaty? Would that cause more proliferation? I cannot read the minds of the leaders in China, Russia, 
   Pakistan, or India, but there are people with a great deal of wisdom and experience who did hazard a guess in that area and have put forward thoughtful statements. One was put forward by former Secretaries of Defense Weinberger, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Laird, Carlucci, and Schlesinger. All of them signed this quote:  
   We also do not believe the CTBT will do much to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.  
   Now, you have six former Secretaries of Defense saying that.  
   The motivation of rogue nations like North Korea and Iraq to acquire nuclear weapons will not be affected by whether the U.S. tests. Similarly, the possession of nuclear weapons by nations like India, Pakistan, and Israel depends on the security environment in their region, not by whether or not the U.S. tests. If confidence in the U.S. nuclear deterrent were to decline, countries that have relied on our protection could well feel compelled to seek nuclear capabilities of their own. Thus, ironically, the CTBT might cause additional nations to seek nuclear weapons.  
   That was a quote from the six former Defense Secretaries--Weinberger, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Laird, Carlucci, and Schlesinger. 
   This is a quote from General Vessey, former Chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff:  
   Supporters of the CTBT argue that it reduces the chances for nuclear proliferation. I applaud efforts to reduce the proliferation of nuclear weapons, but I do not believe that the test ban will reduce the ability of rogue states to acquire nuclear weapons in sufficient quantities to upset regional security in various parts of the world. ``Gun-type'' nuclear weapons can be built with assurance they'll work without testing. The Indian and  Pakistani ``tests'' apparently show that there is adequate knowledge available to build implosion type weapons with reasonable assurance that they will work. The India/Pakistan explosions have been called ``tests,'' but I believe it to be more accurate to call them ``demonstrations,'' more for political purposes than for scientific testing.  
   A letter signed by John Deutch, Henry Kissinger, and Brent Scowcroft says:  
   Supporters of the CTBT claim that it will make a major contribution to limiting the spread of nuclear weapons.  
   It is the same argument we hear time and time again, which I wish to be true because I want this to be a nuclear-free world. They say:  
   This cannot be true if key countries of proliferation concern do not agree to accede to the treaty. To date, several of these countries, including India, Pakistan, North Korea, Iran, Iraq, and Syria, have not signed and ratified the treaty. Many of these countries may never join the CTBT regime, and ratification by the United States, early or late, is unlikely to have any impact on their decisions in this regard. For example, no serious person should believe that rogue nations like Iran or Iraq will give up efforts to acquire nuclear weapons if only the U.S. signs the CTBT.  
   If you think about that, they are not going to respond to what we do. 
   This is a letter from Edward Teller to Senator HELMS. He says this in the letter, dated February 4, 1998:  
   The point I must make is that, in the long run, knowledge and ability to produce nuclear weapons will be widely available. To believe that, in the long run, proliferation of nuclear weapons is avoidable is wishful thinking and dangerous. It is the more dangerous because it is a point of view that the public is eager to accept. Thus, politicians are tempted to gain popularity by supporting false hopes.  
   This is a former Assistant Director, ACDA, Fred Eimer. He says this:  
   In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, the proposed treaty will put our nuclear deterrent at risk without significant arms control or nonproliferation benefits. Other nations will be able to conduct militarily significant nuclear tests well below the verification threshold of the Treaty's monitoring system, and our own unilateral capability.  
   I make these statements simply because this is a big issue. It is an important issue, and a lot of people have thought a great deal about it. I think it to be an inappropriate time to enter into such a treaty that would so limit the United States, given all the great concerns and testing and things going on around the world. 
   I want to give some final quotes of former Directors of the National Weapons Laboratories. They also oppose the CTBT. 
   Roger Batzel, Director Emeritus, sent this letter on October 5:  
   I urge you to oppose the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. No previous administration, either Democrat or Republican, ever supported the unverifiable, zero yield, indefinite duration CTBT now before the Senate. The reason for this is simple. Under a long-duration test ban, confidence in the nuclear stockpile will erode for a variety of reasons. I don't think it can be put forward any clearer than that. This is a key part of our deterrence. We simply cannot go ahead and enter into this treaty at this time at our own great loss and our own great peril.  
   I note again for my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that a number of us are very willing and interested that this not go forward for a vote. We don't want it to go forward for a vote in this session of Congress, either this year or next year. 
   The notion that it would be pulled down now, then somehow come back next year during the middle of a Presidential election, and be used as some sort of political tool at that time seems to many of us to be far more frightening, with what might happen in the political debate, with the atmosphere and the use of this treaty in its discussions for political purposes. 
   That is why we continue to support not voting on this now. Let's also agree that we will not do it during this session of Congress. 
   I have used up my allotted period of time. I yield the floor.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from Pennsylvania accommodating our desires tonight. The reason we offer this amendment is to discuss it briefly and then withdraw it as being subject to a point of order on this particular bill. 
   I rise to explain the amendment. 
   What this amendment regards is the establishment of a 1-year, actually less than 1-year, Senate task force to study the state of American society. There has been a lot of discussion going on about this. I want to spend a little bit of time discussing what this is and what it isn't because I think both are important. 
   We are proposing this task force, Senator LIEBERMAN, Senator MOYNIHAN, and myself, the Presiding Officer, a number of others, because we believe there is a deep and pressing need to examine in a manner that is bipartisan, intellectual, rigorous, dispassionate, and publicly accessible, the cultural and social health of our society. 
   It is a simple and undeniable fact that our families and children, schools, and communities have been subjected to seismic shifts over the last 30 years. These changes have had consequences--consequences which deeply impact the public, including the formation of public policy, which deserve a public forum in which to study and address them. 
   First, if we take a quick look at what is happening across America, in the last 2 years, we have seen one school shooting after another: Conyers, GA; Littleton, CO; Richmond, VA; Paducah, KY; Springfield, OR; Edinboro, PA; Pearl, MS; and Jonesboro, AR. Unfortunately, the list goes tragically on. We just wonder where next. 
   There are other warning signs. The number and percentages of the children who live in broken homes continues to increase, regrettably. Reports of domestic abuse and child abuse are at shocking levels. 
   One of our colleagues and cosponsors of this bill, Senator 
   MOYNIHAN, once coined a memorable phrase. He talked about our society in terms of ``defining deviancy down.'' What he meant--and, Senator MOYNIHAN, correct me, if I am incorrect--is that when behavior that was once considered deviant or outrageous becomes more ordinary and commonplace, societies tend to redefine deviancy. 
   This is such a classic and clear example. For example, in 1929, four gangsters killed seven unarmed bootleggers. The slaughter was considered so horrific that the event was dubbed the ``St. Valentine's Day Massacre.'' Remember that one? It was 1929; seven unarmed bootleggers were slaughtered. It was so horrifying it got its own name, shows, everything, and made news around the world. It so shocked and horrified the Nation that it has become a well-known historical event. It is even in most encyclopedias--seven people, 1929. 
   In sharp contrast, let's look to just 2 weeks ago, when a gunman strode into a church in Fort Worth, TX, puffing a cigarette, and slaughtered six defenseless people, including several children, before turning the gun on himself--just as many people, one less, killed in that Fort Worth church as in the St. Valentine's Day Massacre. Yet that story, so far from making it into an encyclopedia, didn't even get a headline in the Washington Post. Why? Why is it that we no longer consider outrageous what is truly outrageous? Perhaps it has become too commonplace. It has become common on our streets and airwaves. It is both the reality in which many live, and it makes up the entertainment into which many escape. 
   Over the past 30 years, there are many ways we have made progress as a country and as a people. Our economy has grown tremendously. Technological advances have been unprecedented. New doors of opportunity have been opened to people previously denied access. The opportunities available to women and minorities have increased, and they need to increase even further. But in the midst of unprecedented prosperity, there is a widespread belief that we live in a mean society where families are breaking down, children are more prone to crime, violence, alienation, drug use and suicide, and our civic fabric is fraying. In fact, not only does the United States lead the world in material wealth, it also leads the industrialized world in rates of murder, violent juvenile crime, abortion, divorce, cocaine consumption, pornography production, and consumption of pornography. These facts have not been lost on the American people--far from it. Poll after poll shows they recognize it. 
   I draw the attention of the body to some of the polls that have recently come out. Here is one: What poses the greatest threat to the United States? You can look through here: recession at 30-plus percent; decline of moral values, much higher; military, don't know. That was October 30 of last year. 
   Here is one from May 3 of this year: Where does the country face the most serious problems today? Moral values area, 56 percent; next closest, environment at 12 percent. Fifty-six percent of the public considering that. That was by a different research group than did the last one. 
   Here is one done by the Princeton Survey Research Group, July 22 of this year: What priority should be given to dealing with the moral breakdown of the United States? Fifty-five percent say top priority should be given. 
   My only point in showing these polls is that this is something the American public considers important, indeed, vital 
   for us to be considering. We need to address it in this body. This is not to say that all societal changes have been negative. Far from it.  
   As I noted earlier, there are many causes for hope, even celebration. But there are causes for concern taking place as well. Even where our challenges remain stark, I am personally optimistic. I believe for every problem in America, there is a solution already in place, usually by an individual or family or community with the heart to make it happen. 
   I hope this task force will encourage the replication of those solutions, but first and foremost, my hope is that by working together we can begin to better understand where we are as a society and where we are headed. 
   Senator MOYNIHAN, again, made a point that I think is true: You can't change a problem until you can figure out how to measure it. You need to be able to measure to know when you are making progress on what is happening. That is the stage at which we find ourselves. We know something is happening in our society, but we don't know yet how to accurately measure it. We are still struggling with asking the right questions. 
   My hope and intention is that this task force would begin the important and necessary work of measuring these issues and asking the right questions. 
   I want to talk about some of the specifics of the task force, what it is and what it isn't. 
   There have been a lot of rumors spreading around about this. First, this task force will conduct the important business of investigating and analyzing and examining the state of our culture the causes and consequences of our societal difficulties, and possible solutions. It will hold hearings on such topics as civic participation, the state of the family structure, the impact of popular culture on young people, the causes of youth violence, and innovative and effective initiatives that have reduced various social problems that we have. 
   It will look at these issues in a holistic and a broad manner and--let me emphasize this--a bipartisan manner. It will not hold legislative jurisdiction. It will not report out or mark up legislation. It will not intrude on people's personal lives or seek to impose a set of values on anyone. It aims to achieve a better description of what is going on in our society, not a prescription of morals. It seeks to inform and investigate, rather than to legislate. 
   I know there were concerns among some of my colleagues about provisions regarding subpoena power. Let me assure all of them, those have been taken out. This endeavor will be a task force of concerned Members working together to get a better sense of the condition of our society. The task force is bipartisan in purpose, process, and structure, as bipartisan as possible. It is composed of eight members: four Republicans, four Democrats. You can't get much more bipartisan than that. 
   Together, I hope we can take a good look at what is going on in our society, at the state of the cultural environment in which we currently reside. While these are not legislative issues, they are important public issues with profound consequences, both in terms of public policy and in our daily lives. 
   This is an important task. I look forward to the counsel and support of my colleagues in getting to this important work. We have tried to bend over backwards to work in a bipartisan way 
   to get this moving forward. We are still working to get this pulled together. I hope my colleagues will continue to talk with us about this, about how we can do this and how we can work together to address this very important problem.

    Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, today I am pleased to stand with concerned colleagues, both Republicans and Democrats, as well as concerned citizens, including Christians, Jews, Muslims, and Sikhs among many other faiths. We come together in support of a simple proposition. America is distinguished internationally as a land of religious freedom. It should be a place where no person is forced to choose between keeping their faith and keeping their job. That is why I am joining  with Senators KERRY, HUTCHINSON, LIEBERMAN and MIKULSKI in introducing the Workplace Religious Freedom Act. 
   This legislation provides a skilled reconciling of religion in the workplace. It recognizes that work and religion can be reconciled without undue hardship. Americans continue to be a religious people, with a deep personal faith commitment. With this commitment comes personal religious standards which govern personal activity. For example, some Americans don't work on Saturdays, while others don't work on Sundays. Not because they're lazy or frivolous, but because their faith convictions call for a Sabbath day, requiring a day to be set aside as holy. 
   Similarly, some Americans need to wear a skullcap to work, or a head covering, or a turban. As a nation whose great strength rests in diversity, surely we can protect such diverse yet simple and unobtrusive expressions of personal faith. Surely we're still generous enough, and God-respecting enough as a nation, to support others in the genuine expressions of their faith. I am particularly anxious for the religious minorities, for the Muslims and the Jews and the others who are very small in number but great in conviction. In our increasingly secular society, many remain among us who still hold by ancient, heart-felt principles governed by a deep personal belief. I submit to you they deserve the decency of respect which includes our protection in preserving their peaceful religious expressions. This is a core principle which cannot be compromised, because it speaks to the essence of who we are as a people committed to preserving freedom. 
   In this land of religious freedom, one would hope that employers would spontaneously accommodate the religious needs of their employees whenever reasonable. That is, after all, what we do here in Congress. For example, we don't conduct votes or hearings on certain holidays so that Members and staff can observe their religious holy days. While most private employers also extend this simple but important decency to their workers, others unfortunately do not. 
   Historically, title VII of the Civil Rights Act was meant to address conflicts between religion and work. On its face it requires employers to ``reasonably accommodate'' the religious needs of their employees as long as this does not impose an ``undue hardship'' on the employer. The problem is that our federal courts have essentially read these lines out of the law by ruling that any hardship is an undue hardship. This is not right, nor does it hold with the spirit of this great nation which 
   was founded as a refuge for religious freedom. 
   Thus, a Maryland trucking company can try to force a devout Christian truck driver to take a Sunday shift. A local sheriff's department in Nevada can tell a Seventh Day Adventist that she must work a Saturday shift if she wants to continue with them. 
   The Workplace Religious Freedom Act will re-establish the principle that employers must reasonably accommodate the religious needs of employees such as these. This legislation is carefully crafted and strikes an appropriate balance between religious accommodation, while ensuring that an undue burden is not forced upon American businesses. It is flexible and case-oriented on an individual basis. Thus, a smaller business with less resources and personnel would not be asked to accommodate religious employees in exactly the same fashion as would a large manufacturing concern. 
   I am proud of the fact that this is a bi-partisan effort, I am proud that this legislation is supported by such a broad spectrum of groups ranging from the Christian Legal Society and the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations, to the Family Research Council, the National Council of Churches, the North American Council for Muslim Women, and the American Jewish Committee. 
   America is a great nation because we honor the free exercise of belief, which includes the very precious, fundamental freedom of religion. This liberty, known as the ``first freedom,'' is worthy of our continued vigilance. it properly demands support from all quarters, both the public and private sectors. It properly finds it here in this legislation which re-establishes the right balance between the competing concerns of business and faith.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I was able to listen to the comments that the Senator from Missouri made regarding the efforts, that have been now stalled, to lift sanctions against agricultural producers and agricultural exports from America. It is very disconcerting that this is happening at this point in time in our Nation's history. 
   My family farms. My dad is a full-time farmer, my brother is a full-time farmer, and prices for agricultural products are at rock bottom levels. Compound that with bad weather conditions for some places in America, and farmers believe they are getting a one-two punch. To stack on top of the two punches they are already taking an outdated sanctions policy, which was voted down in the Senate, is beyond unfair. We should not use food and medicine as a political weapon--now we find that these sanctions are not going to be lifted. On top of low prices, on top of bad weather, a farmer is going to say: Is everybody against me? Isn't my own Government going to help me out? 
   We have been telling people for a long period of time, that for Freedom to Farm to work, you have to have freedom to market. We were moving in that direction. It was aggressively going forward in that direction, and all of a sudden out comes a conference report that pulls something that was passed, as the Senator from Missouri noted, by a large percentage of people in this body. A farmer has to wonder what is going on here. 
   I ask people who are part of this process, what is going on? Let's look at getting this back in. It passed with large and overwhelming support in this body. It is clearly something that the people across the country want. It is clearly something that the agricultural community needs. It is the right thing to do. Let's do it. Let's not let it be taken out in some deal that involves a handful of Members. 
   Plus, as people have previously noted for some period of time, unilateral agricultural trade sanctions are generally ineffective. They are effective in punishing our farmers, but they are not effective in accomplishing sound foreign policy. 
   At a time when we are already suffering low agricultural prices, sanctions add to this burden. This is truly adding insult to injury. 
   Unilateral sanctions by major agricultural producing countries such as the U.S. tend to encourage production in other competitor countries. So, on top of hurting our prices here, hurting our markets here, it probably, and usually does, have the effect of stimulating production in other countries. Often the tyrants, which the U.S. intends to punish actually benefit financially from these sorts of embargoes. 
   My only point in making these comments in addition to those of my colleague from Missouri is simply to say there is ample ground and reason for us to lift these agricultural sanctions. There is not a moral foundation or basis for us to use food and medicine as a political weapon. It is wrong for our farmers. It is wrong, period, to do that. Yet we are seeing that continuing to take place. Now, after we passed something out of this body, with overwhelming support, we find it pulled out. That is very disconcerting to this Member, and it should be and is, I am sure, very disconcerting to the agricultural community across this Nation. 
   Please, please, let's reopen this issue and get that agenda item back in so we can offer hope and fulfill our promise to farmers. I am not standing here saying it is going to solve our farm crisis or going to solve the problems we have marketing all our products around the world, but clearly here is a positive step we can take and should take. It is a big agenda item in rural America. People in rural America know these sanctions exist, they know they are harmful, and they want them lifted. Now is the time to do this. I am very disappointed this provision, according to my colleague from Missouri, has been taken out. I call on all Members of this body, let's look at this and let's get this issue back in so we can lift these sanctions from the backs of our farmers. 
   I hope a number of my colleagues will become aware of what is taking place here. This is a very important issue to many of our States. It is certainly an important issue to Kansas. I think we need to revisit this, if it has been taken out, so we can get it back in. We must lift these agricultural sanctions and we must do it now. 
   I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise in support of this amendment put forward by Senator KERRY, Senator CHAFEE, and myself and a number of other Senators. Also, I want to thank Senator BOND and Senator MIKULSKI for accepting it. 
   I think this is a great statement and a great amendment for us to push forward. It provides funding for the Montreal Protocol with the multilateral fund. The fund sponsors technical assistance to 110 developing nations to reduce the ozone-depleting substances. It is supported by 120 industrialized nations. I think it is an important way for the world to combat pollution cooperatively. 
   It will help phase out ozone-depleting substances in developing countries. GAO's 1997 report says this was a good working solution. It was working well. 
   The amendment is fiscally responsible as well. It provides $12 million for the fund, offset with a tiny reduction--less than .02 of a percent--in EPA's discretionary spending. 
   Today's world is an international, interactive relationship, particularly on the environment. Here is a very commonsense, practical approach for us to be able to work cooperatively with other nations. Twelve million dollars is economically responsible, budget-wise, coming out of the EPA discretionary fund. 
   This is a good way to work forward. 
   I thank my colleagues for their leadership. I think this is an excellent way for us to work toward international environmental cooperation. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Hutchison amendment to continue the moratorium on the Minerals Management Service rule. I thank her for the courageous work she has been doing on this issue. I want to speak to this from the standpoint of a State that has a number of small, independent oil producers. That is what we have in Kansas. 
   I want to address a couple issues: No. 1, the perspective of the small, independent oil producers. I guess the dominant debate has been about big oil. I want to talk about small, independent oil producers such as we have. 
   The second issue is we not become more dependent on foreign oil. We get 60 percent, actually more than 60 percent, from foreign sources, and we do not want to drive more of that production overseas. 
   A third issue is a matter of priority to this body, and that is that we not let our duty to legislate be overtaken by a nonlegislative body. I appreciate the Senator from Texas bringing these issues to the forefront so we could debate them and talk about them on the Senate floor and, hopefully, get some sanity in this system. 
   Our oil producers are just recovering from some of the lowest prices in 30 years. That has cost the oil and gas industry more than 67,000 American jobs, a number of those in Kansas, and saw the closure of more than 200,000 oil and gas wells. That is the recent situation. 
   A hike in the royalty rates will make a bad situation worse and could cause more domestic oil production to go overseas. At a time when we already are getting so much of it from overseas, to increase our dependency even more is a really ridiculous idea. 
   It is up to Congress and not Federal agencies to establish public policies is my second point. The MMS clearly exceeded its authority by proposing to raise royalty rates without congressional authorization. No congressional committee or affected industry groups were notified before the final version of the rule was announced. The MMS has also tried to get around the congressional moratorium by changing Federal lease forms and taking other measures that are similar to the prohibited rule. These reckless actions have led me to believe that this agency is out of control, and it has led a number of our small, independent producers in Kansas not to trust this agency, or the sort of template they are setting up in the industry that is going to cost them more and cost more jobs and cost more oil production in this country and in Kansas. 
   I do believe the current royalty rate valuations are fundamentally flawed and should be changed. 
   The regulations proposed by the MMS will increase the amount of the royalties to be paid by assessing royalties on downstream values particularly, without full consideration of the costs on that small independent producer in Kansas who is just now digging out of some of the lowest prices in 30 years, all the jobs they have lost, and all the wells that have been plugged. And we are saying at this point in time: We really do not care for you; we want to just shove these additional costs on you and hurt you more, even though you are just now starting to climb out of the worst situation in 30 years. 
   Goodness, we ought to think a little bit down the road ourselves and say: Is it wise that we do this on the small independent producer struggling to make a living, who wants to help support the United States and our energy needs of this country, and we do this now? I do not think that is wise at all. 
   Finally, my point is, it is the responsibility of Congress to make policy decisions, not the MMS. Royalty rates are our responsibility. We, the Senate, have been elected by our constituents to make these difficult decisions, and we should not have our authority preempted by Federal bureaucrats. Some people may not like that conclusion, but that is the way it is. We are the policymakers. We are the people who should set these rates, not a Federal bureaucracy that is not elected, that is a nonlegislative body. That is what is taking place. 
   In the short time I have, I thank my colleague from Texas for the great work she is doing on defending freedom, defending small independent oil and gas producers, defending us from becoming more dependent on foreign oil, and also defending the Senate's right to establish public policy, and not a nonlegislative body. 
   I hope as well that people who are debating and tying notions of other considerations into this issue will step back and think for a second. Everybody I know in this body acts with integrity and honor, and that should not be attacked on some sort of unsubstantiated basis. People here do act with honor and with integrity. 
   There are differences of opinion on this issue. Mine, from the perspective of Kansas, is that we need to be setting this, and not the MMS. 
   Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Texas.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to explain why I voted ``no'' on the Treasury Postal Appropriations conference report. 
   First, I am concerned that the contraceptive mandate included in the Treasury/Postal Appropriations bill is a precedent setting attempt to mandate coverage of abortifacients that have been approved--or will be approved in the future--by the Federal Food and Drug Administration. 
   Second, I am concerned that this mandate constitutes an attempt to eventually force providers who have either a moral or religious objection to abortion services to provide those services, or lose the ability to provide health care within the Federal Employee Health Benefit Plan. The FEHBP mandate does not have adequate conscience clause protection for sponsors of health plans and individual providers who are opposed to providing such drugs and devices. Conscience clause protection for individual providers needs to be clarified to protect any health care provider, including but not limited to physicians, nurses and physician assistants who object to providing these drugs or devices on the basis of religious beliefs or moral convictions. 
   Third, this misnamed ``contraceptive'' mandate is being used to help ``mainstream'' abortifacient drugs to which many health professionals, pharmacies, and patients have serious objections. It reduces federal employees' freedom to choose the health benefits they want; ignores health plans' potential moral objections; and increases pressure on health professionals to ignore their own conscientious convictions. All of this, ironically, is done in the name of ``freedom of choice. 
   Fourth, I do not believe that the federal government should issue healthcare mandates. Mandating the FEHBP providers cover contraceptives as part of their health plan constitutes the first time in the history of the FEHBP that Congress has issued a mandate on a coverage. 
   Fifth, I am also concerned that this may be the first step by some in Congress to issue a similar mandate on private insurers. Such a mandate on private insurers will drive up costs and lead to uninsurance at the margins. 
   Therefore, because of the inclusion of this provision in the conference report I voted ``no.''

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I would like to talk about the business that is before the Senate because I think this is critically important. There were a number of allegations made in the last speech that I think deserve to be refuted, but what is presently before us, what has taken place, is something that needs to be addressed before the American public. 
   I rise in support of the resolution condemning the President's actions in granting clemency to 16 terrorists. I want to be clear what I am talking about: 16 terrorists who were members of the Armed Forces of National Liberation, FALN. The President's condition for releasing these men was that  they would be willing to say they would not use violence anymore. This is a standard that I think would easily be met by almost everyone in prison in America today. The condition is a sham. The FBI, the Justice Department, and the Bureau of Prisons all recommended strongly that these terrorists not be released. Yet the President went ahead and released these terrorists. 
   The sad part about this is this administration claims to understand that terrorism is one of the greatest threats facing America. And it is. We see that threat towards the United States being posed and acted upon in many places around the world. It is only because of our own abilities that we have been able to stop some of this. Yet some of it has still gotten through. 
   This act of the administration of releasing these terrorists will have the effect of encouraging terrorism. They are repeatedly telling us they are bringing terrorists to justice and that is a high priority. How is this act of releasing terrorists compatible with fighting terrorism? By his actions, the President is sending a message that, in fact, he does not take terrorism seriously, that it is OK to kill and maim American people. After all, the President may pardon you even when there is no petition of clemency before him. 
   This encourages terrorism. We should be very clear about that. At a time when terrorism is a great threat to our peace and prosperity, at a time when terrorism has touched everywhere in this Nation, at a time when Americans face terrorist threats all around the world, the last thing we should do is grant clemency to convicted terrorists. I believe Congress should be standing up to tell the President, as well as the Nation, that we strongly condemn pardoning terrorists who have killed and shown no remorse whatsoever. Whatever the reason the President took this action, it is clear the pardon was not based on the merits, and by carrying through with this he severely damaged our leadership in the world fight against terrorism. 
   The FALN carried out more violence than any other terrorist group in the United States. They pose a direct threat to the safety of American citizens on American soil everywhere. Yes, these convicted terrorists have spent some time in jail, but the acts these people committed were the most heinous and should not seem less so simply because of the passage of time. A fair court system found them guilty and punished them accordingly. Nothing they have done or said since then can justify their unsolicited release. 
   Making concessions to terrorists is wrong and it is very harmful to us as a country and as a people. In so doing, the President has made a mockery of all the administration's tough talk about terrorism and the need to combat it worldwide. This is an action that should be roundly condemned. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator HUTCHISON's amendment to continue the moratorium on the Minerals Management Service (MMS) oil royalty valuation rule. I am concerned that the MMS proposed rules for determining federal royalty payments will increase compliance costs for small, independent oil producers. These producers have just begun to recover from some of the lowest oil prices in 30 years, which cost the oil and gas industry more than 67,000 American jobs and saw the closure of more than 200,000 oil and gas wells. A hike in the royalty rates will make a bad situation worse and could cause more domestic oil production to be replaced by foreign imports. 
   It is up to Congress and not federal agencies to establish public policy. The MMS clearly exceeded its authority by proposing to raise royalty rates without congressional authorization. No congressional committee or affected industry groups were notified before the final version of the rule was announced. The MMS has also tried to get around the congressional moratorium by changing federal lease forms and taking other measures that are similar to the prohibited rule. These reckless actions have led me to believe that this is an agency out of control. 
   I am also very concerned about the appearance of a quid pro quo with respect to payments that were made by the Project on Government Oversight (POGO) to officials at the Departments of Interior and Energy who were involved with the royalty rate valuation issue. I agree with Senator HUTCHISON that the Interior Department should not proceed with this rule until this matter has been resolved by the Justice Department. 
   I do believe that the current royalty rate valuations are fundamentally flawed and should be changed. But the regulations proposed by the MMS would increase the amount of royalties to be paid by assessing royalties on downstream values without full consideration of costs. In a period of low oil prices, the government should be considering royalty rate reductions, not an increase. 
   It is the responsibility of Congress to make policy decisions affecting royalty rates and the responsibility of the MMS to implement those policies. We, the United States Senate, have been elected by our constituents in order to make these difficult decisions and should not have our authority preempted by federal bureaucrats. I urge my colleagues to support the Hutchison royalty rate moratorium amendment and I yield the floor.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate immediately proceed to executive session to consider the following nomination on the executive calendar: No. 176, the nomination of Judge Carlos Murguia to be U.S. district judge for the district of Kansas. 
   I take this opportunity to inform my fellow Members a little bit about Judge Murguia. I went to school with Judge Murguia. I am delighted to see him join the bench in Kansas. I want to speak today for a few minutes and tell my colleagues about Judge Murguia, whose nomination to the Federal Judiciary I understand will be agreed to before the close of business today. 
   The Federal Judiciary is a truly high honor and responsibility. Those nominated to serve must be men and women of the highest professional and personal qualifications. I am privileged and pleased today to commend to the Senate Judge Carlos Murguia of Kansas City, KS. A native of Kansas City, Carlos Murguia is part of a remarkable family. Every one of his four siblings have earned a law degree from the University of Kansas. One sister works as deputy director of legislative affairs at the White House. Another sister is an assistant U.S. attorney in Arizona. 
   Judge Murguia has served as a Wyandotte County District judge since September of 1990. He is a graduate of the University of Kansas School of Journalism and a graduate of my alma mater, the University of Kansas School of Law. 
   Judge Murguia took an unusual career path upon graduating from that institution of legal scholarship that has turned out so many outstanding attorneys. He chose to use his newly minted legal skills to help others in a generally lower-income area of Kansas city. He chose to help 
   others in this area who ordinarily would not have access to legal representation in situations others often take for granted. 
   Judge Murguia took his first step into the Judiciary while still in private practice, serving first as a part-time small claims judge for the Wyandotte County district court. Later in 1990, Kansas Republican Governor Mike Hayden appointed Mr. Murguia Wyandotte County District Judge, filling the reminder of a term of a judge who died in office. He was elected to his own 4-year terms in both 1992 and 1996. Judge Murguia served Wyandotte County with distinction in this office for 10 years. 
   Madam President, I am confident that Judge Murguia will bring to the Federal bench the skills and knowledge of an outstanding jurist of personal integrity and with the dedication of a man who took his law degree to help his fellow citizens. 
   On a personal note, when you see the demeanor of Judge Murguia and you are around his presence, you recognize and see the beauty of this person, the beauty of his soul, the beauty of the smile that goes on his face when he sees justice being done for others. And that smile mourns when he sees anyone treated unjustly. He lives in his heart for justice. I think he is probably one of the best embodiments of that frequently cited passage in Micah that reads, ``what does the Lord require of you but to do justice and to love mercy and to walk humbly with thy God''. 
   Judge Murguia fulfills that passage in Micah. For all these reasons, I am especially pleased to wholeheartedly commend to the Senate Judge Carlos Murguia nomination to the Federal district court.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank the chairman, the Senator from Delaware, for his excellent work on crafting this compromise package and putting it together. I think it is a substantial bill of support for the American public. We need to give this money back to the American public for overpaying their taxes. 
   I rise in strong support of the conference report being considered today. This important bill provides broad-based tax relief to America's families and returns their tax overpayment to them in the form of a tax reduction. It is important that Congress return this money to the American people and allow them to do with it what they see fit. 
   I am particularly pleased to join in this effort on the elimination of the marriage penalty. The Senator from Texas, Mrs. HUTCHISON, has led this effort, along with Senator ASHCROFT. This bill does important work on eliminating the marriage penalty tax and reducing that pernicious impact on our society. The American people need to get this rebate. I think we can do more and better with it than the Government can. 
   The conference report before us takes important steps, as I stated, toward eliminating the marriage penalty. It doubles the standard deduction, as well as widening the tax brackets, which does much to alleviate that terrible impact that the marriage penalty has on America's families. It impacts nearly 21 million American couples in this country. 
   Doubling the standard deduction helps families. Our families certainly need help. I am, therefore, pleased that the 
   conferees kept this provision, and I am hopeful that the President will sign the conference report and provide America's families with this important tax relief which they clearly deserve and clearly need. 
   Congress has drafted a tax bill. Now it will be up to the President. This session, Congress utilized its opportunity to provide for comprehensive tax relief. It has done that. Now the President must make use of this unique opportunity to help eliminate the marriage penalty. 
   It affects so many couples in our country--21 million--by forcing them to pay, on average, an additional $1,400 in taxes a year. The Government should not use the coercive power of the Tax Code to erode the foundation of our society. 
   We should support the sacred institution and the sacred bonds of marriage. Marriage in America certainly is in enough trouble the way it is, and it doesn't need to be penalized by the Government. According to a recent report out of Rutgers University, marriage is already in a state of decline. From 1960 to 1996, the annual number of marriages per 1,000 adult women declined by almost 43 percent. 
   Now, when marriage as an institution breaks down, children do suffer. The past few decades have seen a huge increase in out-of-wedlock births and divorce, the combination of which has substantially had an overall impact on the well-being of our children in many ways. It has affected every family in this country. People struggle, and they try to help to support the family and the children as much as they can. But this institution of marriage has had great difficulty. In my own family, there has been difficulty as well. The Government should not tax marriage and further penalize it. There is a clear maxim of Government that if you want less of something, tax it; if you want more of something, subsidize it. Well, we don't want less of marriage. We should not tax it. 
   Study after study has shown that children do best when they can grow up in a stable home environment, with two loving, caring parents who are committed to each other through marriage. Newlyweds face enough challenges without paying punitive damages in the form of a marriage tax. The last thing the Government should do is penalize the institution that is foundational in this civil society. 
   This year we change that. The new budget estimates, from both the Office of Management and Budget and CBO, show higher-than-expected surplus revenue, even after accounting for Social Security. Of course, for some, this is no surprise. We have known all along that growth does work. It helps and it works. Of course, the surging surplus is as a result of nonpayroll tax receipts. It is really a tax overpayment to the Government in personal income and capital gains tax. We must give the American people the growth rebate they deserve and return the overpayment. I believe we can, and must, start--and start now--to rid the American people of the marriage tax penalty. I look forward to working with the Chairman, as well as other colleagues, to make sure we get this job done. 
   In closing, this is a day we should celebrate. We are able to do something that sends a strong signal of support to families across this country, which is critically important to do. Yes, this has an impact overall, but I think it is a very positive impact to send that sort of signal to our struggling young families across this country. I think we clearly should do that. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I stated my support for my distinguished colleague from Virginia who chairs the Armed Services Committee. He did a wonderful job with that. This is such an important topic, even though we tend to think of the world as a stable place where we don't have to worry about it. I am glad he is worried about it and is so focused on it. 
   That is what I would like to draw the body's attention to right now, a situation that was reported this week in the reporting organizations of Reuters, the Associated Press, and the New York Times. This is a very troubling situation. It is in a part of the world that has experienced a great deal of trouble, but nonetheless, I want to point it out to this body. 
   On July 23, 22 bombs were reported dropped on two villages in Sudan--Lainya and Kaaya--resulting in internal hemorrhaging, miscarriages, animals dying among the villages. Several days later, after the bombs had fallen on this one village, United Nations relief workers with World Food Programme visited the town of Lainya and  immediately fell ill with strange symptoms. They were consequently evacuated to Kampala, Uganda, for testing even as they continued to physically suffer. 
   This, in turn, precipitated the beginning of a United Nations investigation into the use of chemical weapons, as reported this week by those three news organizations, chemical weapons that the chairman of the Armed Services Committee was just noting, that the biggest threat we are facing in the future is weapons of mass destruction. We are seeing here this week, reported in the newspaper, what has taken place in the Sudan, 
   the symptoms of chemical weapons being reported. 
   We can't at this time jump to conclusions that they were actually used, but the evidence points clearly to the use of chemical weapons by the organization, by the government in Khartoum against its own civilian population in the southern part of that country. 
   This is also a government in Khartoum that is sponsoring terrorists around the world, where Osama bin Laden stayed and was hosted by them up until 1997 in Khartoum. They are trying to expand in three adjacent countries, saying we want to take our view of how the world should be organized into these countries and we are willing to do it by any means. We are even willing to use any means against our own people, against our own people. 
   They have killed in their own country 2 million people. They have pushed out and dislocated an additional 4 million people. Last year alone, they forced into starvation 100,000 people by denying our food aid to go where these people were located. They said: You cannot fly your relief planes to feed these poor people. Now they continue to bomb their civilian population, even with, if the evidence this week is proved true, chemical weapons. 
   I think this is so horrifying. I wanted to draw the attention of the Senate to what has been reported by these three news organizations this week and to call on the nation of Sudan to stop bombing its own civilian population, to refuse to do that, to call upon the U.N. to, with as much speed and haste as possible, conduct a full investigation of what has been reported this week as having happened to the civilian population, and call on U.S. authorities to investigate this as fully as we can to see what actually took place. If true, this is truly horrifying, that weapons of mass destruction such as these chemical weapons would be used against their own civilian population. I think it is just absolutely unconscionable, virtually unbelievable. 
   This is also a government that continues to allow slavery to be conducted on in its country. There have actually been thousands of people purchased back from their slave masters. As we approach the new millennium, one would think that at least the institution of slavery would be gone from the world. It is not. One would think the use of chemical weapons would be gone from the world today, but it is not. 
   These things must be investigated to the fullest extent, and if chemical weapons were, indeed, used, the Government of Sudan must be brought in front of the international bodies, the international court of shame, and put in that pariah nation category. They currently, of course, are one of the seven terrorist nations in the entire world that the U.S. Government lists as a terrorist nation. But the possible use of chemical weapons, as reported this week, takes this to an unbelievable level against its own population. That is why, even though this is a late hour, I draw this to the attention of this body. 
   Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas. I am delighted to join her in this amendment that it appears will garner overwhelming support. I hope that sends a strong signal across this country that today is a day to celebrate. We should be celebrating the institution of marriage and support that institution rather than tax it. 
   For many years now we have taxed it. Clearly, if there is a policy in Government that stands it is if you want less of something, tax it; if you want more of something, subsidize it. We have been taxing marriage, and marriage has fallen off in this country 43 percent over the last 30 years. That is a terrible situation for an institution that is so central. 
   I note to my colleagues, we all frequently talk about family values. Thomas, from Hilliard, OH, writes in about this point on the marriage penalty and the notion of family values:  
   No person who legitimately supports family values could be against this bill. The marriage penalty is but another example of how in the past 40 years the federal government has enacted policies that have broken down the fundamental institutions that were the strength of this country from the start.  
   I could not have put it better. I am delighted it appears that this amendment is going to be agreed to. I hope we can get it to the President's desk and that the President will be supportive of eliminating the marriage penalty tax. I hope as well we could go further in the future and enact income splitting, that we could provide for a couple to split their income. This would be even more supportive of this fundamental institution in our culture, in our Nation, of marriage. I hope we can take that step on into the future. 
   I am delighted to have the chairman's support in this. I urge all my colleagues in the name of family values, vote for this amendment. 
   I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Texas.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank the Senator from Texas. She has been the leader on this issue. I am delighted to be working with her on such an important issue. I also thank the chairman of the committee for recognizing the importance of eliminating the marriage penalty. We moved this up; this is the highest priority. 
   I want to tell Members why I think it is the highest priority in the words of people who have been interviewed and who have paid the marriage penalties. In the Wichita Eagle on Sunday, Kyle and Lynn Schudy stated they rediscovered the cost of true love this April, April 15. Their total cost of true love came to $1,823. That is how much the extra income tax was for this Prairie Village couple in their early thirties. That is what they paid last year because they are married and filed jointly instead of single and living together. They found that was the cost of true love. 
   I don't know that we can make a much better case for eliminating the marriage penalty than the voices across America who have stated what they are paying in this marriage penalty. 
   Listen to this from Tennessee:  
   My wife and I got married on January 1, 1997. We were going to have a Christmas wedding last year but after talking to my accountant, who saw that instead of both of us getting money back on our taxes we would have to pay in. So we postponed it. Now after getting married we have to have more taken out of our checks just to break even and not get a refund. We got penalized for getting married and that is not right.  
   I don't know that it can be any clearer than what some of these families have said. 
   From Maryland, Mark Patterson:  
   My wife and I decided to have a family and get married. All we were concerned about was the love we had for each other.  
   That sounds like a pretty good start.  
   After 8 years of marriage and two children we found all we worry about now is how to come up with enough money to put a roof over our head, eat and have good day care for our children. I am sick about the huge chunks of money taken out of every pay check by Uncle Sam just because we are married.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Some would draw that conclusion. 
   Clearly, we are taxing marriage. We are taxing the fundamental institution around which we build values. That is not right, as the people in the letters from across America state. 
   Here is another letter from Ohio:  
   No person who legitimately supports family values could be against this bill of eliminating the marriage penalty. The marriage penalty is but another example of how in the past 40 years the Federal Government has enacted policies that have broken down the fundamental institutions that were the strength of this country from the start.  
   A woman writes:  
   My boy friend, Darryl and I have been living together for quite some time. We would very much like to get married. We both work at Ford Electronics in Crothersville, IN, and make less than $10 an hour, but work over time when available and Darryl does farming on the side. I cannot tell you how disgusted we both are over this tax issue. If we get married not only would I forfeit my $900 refund check, we would be writing a check for $2,800. 
   This was figured by an accountant at H&R Block at New Castle. There is nothing right about this after we continually hear the government preach to us about family values. Nothing new about the hypocrites in Washington. Why not do away with the current tax system?  
   These are voices from across America. 
   This is from Houston, TX:  
   If we are really interested in putting children first, why would this country penalize  the very situation [marriage] where kids do best? When parents are truly committed to each other through their marriage vows, their children's outcomes are enhanced.  
   Yet we tax it and penalize it to the average of $1,400 per married couple of the 21 million American married couples who pay this tax. 
   I am sure this evolved and nobody maliciously said we will tax married couples. The fact remains, we tax marriage, and it must stop. We have the chance now to actually do that. 
   Another point I want to make about this: The institution of marriage in America is in serious trouble.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. It says:  
   Americans are less likely to marry than ever before, according to a new study, and fewer people who do marry report being ``very happy'' in their marriages. 
   This report, released yesterday by Rutger University's National Marriage Project and touted as a benchmark compilation of statistics and surveys, found that the nation's marriage rate has dipped by 43 percent in the past four decades.......  
   We have a chart of the result from the Rutger study. In 1960, per 1,000 women age 15 and over, between 85 and 90 percent per year were getting married, and now it is below 50 percent, a 43-percent fall-off in people getting married. 
   The writers of the study stated this about the institution of marriage, the foundational unit upon which we build family values and pass them on to the next generation:  
   Key social indicators suggest a substantial weakening of the institution of marriage.  
   This is serious. I daresay that probably in this next Presidential campaign, ``family values'' may be the two words said most often as we worry, fret, and are concerned about what is happening to our children and our society and in this culture. 
   Can anybody in this room, in this august body, therefore say it is OK to tax the fundamental institution that helps most in building family values, that we tax the U.S. institution of marriage, that we make 21 million American couples annually pay on average to the tune of $1,400 just for the privilege of being married when we are so worried about the values in the country? How can we vote against this? 
   I am delighted the chairman has put this in the bill. I am happy we are trying, and I hope we will be successful, in moving this up earlier, so once and for all we can stop taxing the institution of marriage. We have to stop doing that. 
   When marriage as an institution breaks down, children suffer. The past few decades have seen a huge increase in out-of-wedlock births and divorce, a combination which has substantially undermined the well-being of children in virtually all areas, all places of life. 
   Some people can struggle heroically and help build up the families, and certainly nobody is here to castigate others. We are saying this is a tax that is wrong. It is wrong for virtually every reason. It taxes a fundamental family-value-building institution. It penalizes people whom we should be rewarding. Study after study has shown children do best when they grow up in a stable home, raised by two parents who are committed to each other. 
   Newlyweds face enough challenges without paying punitive damages in the form of the marriage tax. The last thing the Federal Government should do is penalize the institution that is the foundational unit of passing on to the next generation morals and family values, and yet we do it. We have done it for a number of years. 
   We must give the people back a tax cut. I will support the overall effort to give back in tax cuts the nearly $800 billion. I think we should do that. But clearly our top priority in this effort must be eliminating this bad--this worst tax that we have, worst for its effect on the institution of marriage. We must give the American people the growth rebate they deserve and return this overpayment. The first tax we must cut is this marriage penalty tax. It is going to be expensive. It is important. It is expensive to couples who pay this tax all the time, on average $1,400 per year per couple. 
   With that, I have a number of other things to share, but I think it is simply time we do away with this tax. I am delighted to join the Senator from Texas and the Senator from Missouri in their efforts, in our efforts to do this. I applaud the chairman for building this into the tax cut. I am hopeful we can do this earlier. I would like us to even do income splitting. We are not going to be able to do it today. With that, I yield back to the Senator from Texas.

    Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I will ask to include in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD two letters recognizing the efforts of the Channel One Network in educating school-age children in the dangers of drug use. 
   These letters were originally included in the transcript of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions hearing on July 13 regarding Drug Free Schools. 
   The first is from Richard Bonnette, President of the Partnership for a Drug Free America. Mr. Bonnette thanks Channel One for supporting the mission of Partnership for a Drug-Free America by changing millions of young people's attitudes about drugs. 
   In the second letter, I join Mr. Bonnette's praise of Channel One's airing of $25 million worth of pro bono anti-drug public service announcements over the last ten years as part of its news broadcasts to school-aged children. 
   I am pleased to join Mr. Bonnette in congratulating Channel One on their efforts.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I want to add my comments in support of this amendment that Senator HARKIN has put forward. I think it is a good way of doing it. Here is a program that puts money directly back to the States for law enforcement; lets them decide. We take this out of travel and office supplies over the rest of the bill. I think it is much better we spend the money back in Iowa, in Kansas, in our various States, rather than on travel and printing here in Washington. That is a good trade. That is a good way to go. That is why I supported this amendment, and I am glad to hear the managers are willing to accept it.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise in support of the resolution submitted by Senator SHELBY commemorating the 30th anniversary of the first lunar landing, an event that will be remembered as one of the most important events of our country and century. Americans remember the landing on the lunar surface not only with a sense of historical significance, but also with one of honor and pride in the accomplishment of the crew of Apollo 11 and the men and women of NASA who made it possible. 
   This mission was conducted during a tumultuous time in our country's history. Sending a man to the moon forced us to marshal our country's vast talent and technological resources and to drive our creative energies to the breaking point. Apollo proved that necessity is the mother of invention. The Apollo mission required us to make quantum leaps in propulsion systems, airframe materials, electronics, and other scientific areas in an impossible amount of time. 
   I congratulate Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, the late Michael Collins, and NASA for their courage to lead our country to the new world of space. While our accomplishments in space have continued, space still offers us a vast and unexplored frontier. America has been, and should remain a world leader in space research, technology, and exploration. It is on this 30th anniversary of the first lunar landing that America should renew its support for our space program and challenge ourselves once again as we begin a new century.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, the chairman of the Finance Committee will be coming out with his mark on tax cuts, and this is a critically important issue. It is an important one for the country. It is important, now that we are looking forward to having some surplus, that we say to the American people: You have been overpaying your taxes, and we want to give some of that back to you. This is over and above Social Security, the amount of the payroll tax that is going to Social Security. So we are setting aside the Social Security trust funds--a lockbox is what we call it, a lockbox for the Social Security surplus--and with the remainder talking about tax cuts, serious tax cuts. 
   One issue we want to discuss this morning is doing away with the marriage penalty. It seems extraordinary to me that we would have a tax policy in this country that actually penalizes people for getting married. With all the problems we have with families in our society, it seems, if anything, we would want to do just the opposite--we would want to give people a benefit for being married rather than taxing them for being married. And yet the way the code has evolved, today 21 million American married couples pay an average of $1,400 more in taxes just for the privilege of being married. 
   I think that is wrong. The Government should not use the coercive power of the Tax Code to erode one of the foundational units of our society, that of marriage. We should stop the taxation. We should put a stop to the marriage penalty tax. This year we can change that. 
   I am encouraged that the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator ROTH, and his committee have put forward efforts to alleviate the marriage penalty. We have a unique opportunity to put that issue behind us. 
   I want to draw Senators' attention to another issue under the marriage penalty area which has not been talked about that much. That is the earned-income tax credit bias against married couples. A significant share of the marriage penalty occurs to low-income  couples. It is caused by the loss of the earned-income tax credit when individuals' incomes are combined. 
   What happens is, you have two-wage-earner families that, if they were not married, if they were single and filing separately, would qualify for the earned-income tax credit. But if they get married and they earn over this mark, they get penalized again for being married. 
   Estimates by the CBO indicate that what we can do is double, for two-wage-earner families, the amount of income that can be received and still qualify for the earned-income tax credit. Virtually all the benefits of this adjustment in the earned-income tax credit would go to couples with incomes below $50,000. There are nearly 3.7 million couples in America today that do not receive the earned-income tax credit that would, if we double the amount that they can make, still qualify for the earned-income tax credit. 
   I point this out because people struggle mightily to raise families, and the notion that we would tax and then tax again low-income families, keeping them from receiving a benefit because they are married, makes absolutely no policy sense at all. 
   I don't see how on Earth anybody can argue this is a good idea or this is the right thing to do. I am hopeful the chairman of the Finance Committee has focused on this. We can do this. I hope the President will be willing to work with Members of Congress in both the House and the Senate in crafting a tax package we can all agree with, so the American people can stop overpaying their taxes--which they are currently doing. 
   The CBO is now projecting an onbudget surplus of $14 billion in fiscal year 2000, with the surplus growing to $996 billion over the 10-year period beginning in fiscal year 2000. We have this opportunity to eliminate the marriage penalty tax and to do away with paying the marriage penalty tax on upper-income levels and for those not being given the earned-income tax credit on the lower-income level. 
   Of course, the surging surplus I was discussing is as a result of payroll tax receipts. I continue to emphasize that. 
   The majority side wants to put a lockbox around any Social Security surplus and have that maintained only for Social Security. We can do these things. We need to work across the aisle. We need to work with the President. I hope he will be willing to work with Members as we move forward in dealing with the marriage penalty tax, which is a terrible signal to send across society, to send to people across America. We will be working with the chairman of the Finance Committee. I hope this is one tax that can find its death in this round of tax cuts. We will hopefully be going to reconciliation and discussing tax cuts this month. It is a very important topic we will discuss. 
   I encourage people paying a marriage penalty tax to contact Members regarding how the marriage penalty tax has directly impacted your lives. I have had any number of couples write saying: We wanted to get married but we found out we were going to pay this huge tax for getting married and we could not afford to do that; this is money we wanted to use for a downpayment of a house or to get a car that would work. 
   They were not able to do it because of the pernicious fiscal effect of the marriage penalty tax. It is a terrible signal we are sending across our society. 
   Senator HUTCHISON from Texas has been a leader on this issue of dealing with the marriage penalty tax. She has come to the floor, as well, to discuss what we can do. Now is the time to eliminate this marriage penalty tax. 
   I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to address the underlying second-degree amendment and to talk about the overall amendment itself and the area of the world with which we are dealing. 
   This amendment is an issue that has been heard in front of the Foreign Affairs Committee, both this Congress and last, and has passed this time by a voice vote of the Foreign Affairs Committee. It passed by a majority vote in the last Congress. It deals with an important region of the world, and it deals with a difficult policy issue for the Senate and for our Government to consider. 
   The underlying bill itself is called the Silk Roads Strategy Act. It deals with eight countries, and it provides an overarching policy towards these countries in the south Caucasus and central Asia. Specifically the countries are Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. 
   I realize those are not common names of countries that people across the United States perhaps banter around, but I think they do know and recall with some knowledge the Silk Road, the old Silk Road made legendary many years ago, discovered and traversed by Marco Polo and many others who traveled throughout the region of central Asia. 
   It was really at that point in time the bridge; the Eurasian bridge was developed and brought commerce from Asia to Europe and from Europe to Asia. We are seeking to reinitiate this Silk Road, a new Silk Road that would have an economic corridor along with a freedom corridor in central Asia and the south Caucasus. 
   You can see this region of the world. I wish this map were a little clearer. I hope Members can see where this region of the world is caught. These are all countries in the former Soviet Union. They are in the south of the former Soviet Union; they are recently independent nations. They had some independence before, but these are just recently coming out from underneath the rubble of the fall of the Soviet empire. 
   They are caught between world global forces that seek to have them under their control. The Russians continue the desire to have an unusual influence, would be the best way to put it. The Iranians sit right here and seek to have a greater influence in the region. They seek to dominate most of these nations that have a Muslim-based population. They seek, the Iranians, to radicalize and put governments in place that are militant fundamentalist governments. China then, off to this side of the region--what we are seeking to do is to create an area of democracy, an area of free enterprise, an area of independence free from these world powers that seek to dominate them, in a group of nations that seek to be united with the West, again, in a Eurasian corridor of commerce and freedom. That is the new Silk Road Strategy Act. That is what this bill is about. 
   Lest we forget and just look at it as a geographic area, as important as this region is, I hope we will look at the people in this region. We are talking about nearly 72 million people involved in these countries of the Silk Road. You can look at them: the Armenian  population of 3.4 million; the Azeri population of 7.8 million; on down, Uzbekistan being the biggest with over 23 million people yearning to be free, yearning to be associated with the West, yearning not to go back under Russian dominance or to be put under Iranian dominance or Chinese dominance, but yearning to be free and associated with the West. That is what this bill is about. 
   This is a sanctions lifting bill. It lifts a particular sanction, sanction section 907 that has a set of provisions limiting any sort of assistance, any sort of work of the United States with Azerbaijan, which is also a key country for this corridor, and it doesn't lift the sanctions. It merely provides a national interest waiver. So this doesn't lift it. The President still has to say it is in the national interest of the United States to waive this sanction, and then he has the authority. 
   So it simply provides that authority to the administration, which is in line with the Freedom Support Act, which we originally passed to support these newly independent countries that came about from the Soviet empire falling. This act authorizes assistance for all these countries, specific economic assistance, development of infrastructure assistance, border control assistance, as well as assistance in strengthening democracy, tolerance in the development of civil society. 
   Authority in this bill to provide assistance for these countries of the south Caucasus and central Asia is in addition to the authority to provide such assistance under the Freedom Support Act, but it does not provide any new resources. It simply allows us to offer these resources and assistance to these countries bilaterally and multilaterally. We can provide assistance programs to the entire region, working it in a package and saying to these countries: You are better off if you will work together and bond together to be able to stand before the forces that are seeking to dominate you once again. 
   Mr. President, I think the window of opportunity for the United States to effect positive change in this region will only be open for a short period of time. I think that is the very critical part of this bill and why we need to have this debate and pass this issue now. 
   The window is short. I want to show you some of the activity that is taking place in this region. I mentioned the militant fundamentalists' efforts taking place to seek domination of most of these countries that have a Muslim-based population. 
   This is a chart of Iranian worldwide export of terrorism and fundamentalism that we are putting up here. I want to highlight this region that we are talking about. Of the eight countries we are talking about, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan have Iranians operating in this region. Afghanistan is operating here, seeking to put these countries under militant fundamentalist control. They are doing this today. 
   As recently as 2 months ago, the President of Uzbekistan had an assassination attempt that was put forward by militant fundamentalists who seek to have him removed. He provides mostly a secular Muslim government. They said we want him out and we want a militant fundamentalist government in here, and we are going to do what we can, including trying to assassinate him. They are trying to destabilize the Fergana Valley in this area. My point is, look at this map. It looks similar to the map I just put up here, the countries of the Silk Road. The Iranians are funding this effort. They are going into the camps here and funding the populations in this area. They are doing this today. Members can check this. This is happening. 
   If we want to let these countries slip off and go into the militant fundamentalist camps so we have more places to fight terrorism and more countries we have to fight against that are willing to spawn hatred against the West, let's fail this bill, and with all due respect to the Senator from Kentucky, let's pass his amendment. We have a disagreement about this particular amendment, section 907. I think it is critical and important that we pass and eliminate this bilateral sanction that we have against Azerbaijan, which is much of the gateway for the flow of democracy and freedom throughout this region. Time is of the essence. 
   In my view, the single best way to consolidate our goals in the region is to promote regional cooperation and policies that will strengthen the sovereignty of each nation. Each of these countries has its own individual needs. However, many of the problems in the region overlap and are shared, and a number of common solutions and approaches can apply. That is why we have put together this overarching Silk Road strategy. This region has generally taken a back seat to U.S. foreign policy. We have generally deferred to Russia and to Iranian policy and said we are going to let these drift along. The problem with the drift is that people are going to feel the power vacuum. It is being fueled by the Iranians and pushed by the Russians and other outside influences that don't seek for them to have their freedom. 
   We have eight countries, as I noted earlier, most of which have secular Muslim governments, that are fighting to stave off the Iranian-style Islamic extremism, which are looking westward, and at great risk to themselves, they have considerable economic ties with the West--and I want to note as well, with Israel. 
   Many of these countries in this region have historic and ancient Jewish populations existing there as well; living, surviving, thriving, but if you put in these anti-Western militant fundamentalist, those populations, Jewish populations are going to be run out and these countries are not going to be having good relationships with Israel. 
   These countries are recovering from 70 years of Soviet domination. They need our help in all spheres, including human rights. No one is suggesting that these are Jeffersonian democracies yet. There is a lot of pessimistic talk about the 
   prospects for democracy in this region. All of these countries have human rights violations. 
   At any given point in time, some of the human rights violations may seem worse than others. Here is our choice. Do we engage and try to make what difference we can? Or do we ignore and let the region drift without us, becoming either violently anti-Western, anti-American, or become, once again, an extension of Russia, China, or Iran? It is a pretty clear, simple choice. They seek our support. 
   Now, on the point of human rights--because I think a lot of people will say there are human rights violations in this region and we really ought to watch out for that and we should not support these areas. Again, I point out that this is a waiver authority to the President. He still has to certify and it will have the same standards as other human rights issues. Recently, we had the Israeli Minister for Trade and Industry, Natan Sharansky, a well-known international figure on human rights, here in Washington, together with the Foreign Minister of Uzbekistan. Mr. Sharansky's reason for being here was to make one point, which I thank him for making. 
   He said:  
   Look at the human rights situation and weigh this against the importance of the threat that is facing us. It is very important to engage and continue to encourage a positive process and the way to do this is to strengthen the role we are playing in the region.  
   He supported and endorsed this Silk Road Strategy Act in the region. 
   I want to look particularly at the second-degree amendment that my colleague from Kentucky put forward. I have immense respect for the chairman of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee. He did excellent work on the overall bill, but we have a difference of opinion on section 907. I want to go specifically at this issue. 
   My overall amendment would provide a Silk Road Strategy Act for the entire region, providing a waiver authority in section 907. The second-degree amendment leaves the rest of the language but does not provide the national interest waiver on section 907. That is a key part of this bill, and that is why I oppose the second-degree amendment of my good colleague from Kentucky and my colleague from Michigan, Senator ABRAHAM, as well. We have a dispute on this. I want to go right at that issue of section 907. 
   With the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Congress, in the fall of 1992, adopted the Freedom Support Act. This was designed to provide financial and technical assistance to the newly independent states, those of the former Soviet Union. I want to put that map  back up here, if we could, so people can have that in mind. It was to aid them on a path toward democratic and market reforms. Because of the then ongoing conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia over the enclave Nagorno-Karabakh, Armenian supporters were successful in including language in section 907 singling out Azerbaijan--the only former Soviet republic so treated--for sanctions. I will put up here a map of that region so you can see specifically what this area looks like. This is the Armenia and Azerbaijan area and the Nagorno-Karabakh region, which was in dispute, and this was in 1992, mid-1993, and late 1993. 
   In 1992, at that point in time, we passed the Freedom Support Act and Armenian supporters got narrow, bilateral sanctions against Azerbaijan put in place, saying we think Azerbaijan is treating Armenia wrong, blockading it. Therefore, we want section 907, which removes the United States from providing any assistance to Azerbaijan. Bilateral sanctions, some of which have been lifted--the chairman of the committee has lifted portions of these, but not all have been lifted. We provide waiver authority for the lifting of these bilateral sanctions. That was 1992. The only former Soviet republic so treated was Azerbaijan. The 907 sanction prohibited the ability of the U.S. Government to provide direct bilateral assistance to Azerbaijan until the President determined that demonstrable steps had been taken in ceasing hostilities and lifting the embargo against Armenia. A cease-fire has been in place for the past 7 years since that time period. 
   Peace negotiations under the auspices of the OSCE group are ongoing. 
   To me, it makes no sense whatsoever to continue these 907 sanctions. Proponents of retaining 907 argue that the restrictions should remain in place until the Azerbaijan embargo against Armenia is lifted. In point of fact, however, it is Armenia's ongoing occupation of Nagorno-Karabakh and the surrounding territory. Armenia currently occupies about 20 percent of Azerbaijan in violation of international law. Both the OSCE and the U.N. have condemned this occupation. 
   This is the region on the map they are occupying against the OSCE and U.N. ruling. They both have said this is an international law violation, that Armenia is occupying 20 percent of Azerbaijan. This functionally prevents the opening of the borders between the two countries. 
   In an attempt to end the stalemate, the OSCE advanced a proposal calling for Armenia to withdraw from the occupied land in exchange for the reciprocal opening of rail and pipeline facilities by Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan has accepted the proposal. Armenia has rejected it. This would be pulling back from a 20 percent of lands, and then opening up the rail and pipe corridors. Azerbaijan accepted it. Armenia has not. 
   The imposition of 907, I think, was a bad idea in 1993. It was adopted over the strong objections of the Bush administration, and its repeal is strongly supported by the Clinton administration. 
   For the United States to continue unilateral imposition of sanctions against Azerbaijan--that is what we have--does not make sense from either a geostrategic-political point of view or an economic point of view. 
   This is much of the corridor for the Eurasian bridge that is going through Azerbaijan. 
   The energy potential of the Caspian is one facet of Azerbaijan's strategic significance to the West. The broader issue of the timing and development of the Iranian transit corridor and the sovereignty of the individual republics of the South Caucasus is also at stake. 
   This provision--I might note, as well, the Silk Road strategy--is strongly supported by all the countries in the region outside of the Armenians. I think it would be a great benefit to Armenia as well. 
   Continuing 907 is an impediment to the improved truce between the United States and Azerbaijan and the entire region. It undermines the ability of American companies to secure their substantial investments in the region, and prevents the U.S. Government from being a truly honest broker in the peace negotiations. 
   Repealing of section 907 would allow for commercial and technical assistance to aid in the development of infrastructure, trade, pipeline projects, and to further development of democracy so they don't fall into the hands of the Iranians or the Russians. 
   Further, with the ongoing political turmoil in Moscow, removal of 907 would allow Azerbaijan to participate in a partnership for peace and broader security programs, as well as market reform and democracy-building initiatives necessary to promote political stability in this potentially volatile region. 
   Some may suggest this is not the time to do this on 907. I don't know of a better time other than 907 having not been put on in the first place. It doesn't lift the sanction. It provides a waiver authority for the President to do it. 
   Some may say, well, this is at a particularly susceptible time in the peace process. I don't think that is accurate. The last real peace initiative was in 1997, calling for Armenia's withdrawal from the occupied territories in exchange for normalization of trade with Azerbaijan. This was rejected by Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh. 
   Unlike other provisions of the Freedom Assistant Act, I want 
   to point out that section 907 does not provide for a national interest waiver. What we are doing here is making section 907 be in line with the rest of the Freedom Assistance Act in providing a national interest waiver. 
   The final point I want to make before yielding the floor for a discussion is, again, I point out my deep respect for my colleagues from Kentucky and Michigan who are opposed to the overall national interest waiver on section 907. We just have a differing point of view on this. 
   But the issue is, we are talking about a region of the world--a Eurasian corridor--that has had historical roots in the old Silk Road. They know how to relate with one another, and they are in a tough neighborhood. They have the Russians bearing down on them with undue economic and other influence, and the President of Georgia has had several assassination attempts where the assassin fled to Russia. 
   Georgia wants this bill very much. They have undue influence from the Iranians, who are providing aid to many of these terrorist groups operating in the region and fomenting discontent because they know they are inherently weak at this time. The Chinese have a certain amount of influence, but it is really between the Russians and the Iranians. And they seek to be connected with us. 
   If you pull 907 out of this and its interest waiver, and you say, OK, we are going to do everything but 907, as the amendment provides, you block this part of the key corridor of providing economic trade, developmental assistance, and, through much of the region, its commerce and its activity will flow through Baku and Azerbaijan. This is a critical part of it. That is why, with all due respect, I oppose the second-degree amendment, ask my colleagues to vote against that and to support the underlying amendment without amendment, and pass this critical issue that we really need for U.S. foreign policy. 
   I thank my colleague. 
   I thank the President. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I hope we can get a time agreement so we know when we will actually vote on this particular issue. 
   Reasonable people may differ, and will differ, on what the U.S. policy should be. Azerbaijan--section 907--is the only country from the former Soviet Union that we have unilateral sanctions against. 
   We are not lifting those sanctions by this amendment. We are allowing a national interest waiver to the President which is the same as the rest of the Freedom Support Act. In that sense, we will put Azerbaijan--which is at the gateway to much of the Eurasian platform as far as connecting the countries together--on an equal footing with all of the countries that came from the rubble of the former Soviet Union. 
   We seek peace in this region. It is important that we have a settlement in this region. This particular set of unilateral sanctions on Azerbaijan has been the United States policy since 1992. It has not led to peace since 1992. 
   We are seeking to create an abundance of activity, on a multilateral basis, of all the countries in the region, causing them to work together, to lift each other up economically, democratically, and regarding human rights, as an area, an entire region, that is developing on those principles of a free democracy--free, independent status, and human rights. 
   To pull this one out--it is a key corridor--the concept of the countries working together falls apart. It will not happen. It will not happen if we do that. That has been the U.S. policy since 1992. It has not led to peace yet between Armenia and Azerbaijan. I don't think it will now. If we get these countries to work together, to say, together we can support each other, we can grow economically in other ways, I think we create the atmosphere for peace to take place. Everybody has an interest in peace occurring. 
   We are talking about a large set of resources in this area. They do have the economic wherewithal to be able to grow and grow together. But we have to have them all. You can't pull one of them out and say it will not happen. 
   I think the proposal I put forward leads to peace and peaceful opportunities in the region. That is why I support it. I am happy to talk further  about this at a later date if we get a time agreement. With all due respect, I disagree with my colleagues from Kentucky and Michigan. I think we have the national interest waiver on section 907. 
   At the proper time, I will want a recorded vote on this so we can have a determination by this body of U.S. policy here. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, while we are waiting for other Senators to come up with amendments, I want to draw attention to an amendment I intend to offer if it is not accepted overall. It is an amendment entitled ``Humanitarian Assistance for the Sudanese Opposition Groups.'' 
   This is a very simple amendment that would allow us to give food aid to the southern Sudanese resistance and also the northern Sudanese resistance efforts, food aid only. This is not other forms of aid. It is certainly not military aid. But it is food aid to the Sudanese resistance movement. 
   The language says, and I will provide the amendment:  
   The President is authorized to provide humanitarian assistance, including food, to the National Democratic Alliance [That is an overall alliance of the groups in opposition to the government in Khartoum] and the Sudanese People's Liberation Movement, operating outside of the Operation Lifeline Sudan structure.  
   That is the simple amendment we put forward. 
   I recently led a congressional delegation. Congressman DON PAYNE from New Jersey, Congressman TOM TANCREDO from Colorado, and I went to Sudan and traveled to southern Sudan and met with the embattled groups that have been fighting against the Khartoum government, which is a government that was not freely elected. They stood for election in 1988. They were defeated, got about 18 percent of the vote, and then took over the government in a coup in 1989 and have since then been operating a terrorist regime in Sudan. It is terrorist internally in Sudan and terrorist externally from Sudan. 
   They have killed, according to the IS Committee on Refugees, internally in Sudan, in the last 10 years, 1.9 million people in a genocide and ethnic cleansing the likes of which the world has not seen in recent times. This is the worst humanitarian situation in the world. That is according to the director of USAID, Mr. Atwood, who testified on the issue, on the Sudan--the worst in the world--nearly 2 million killed, over 4 million internally displaced. That is the internal terrorism of this government. 
   This is a government--and this is incredible--that actually allows slavery to exist. That is documented. The Baltimore Sun did a series of articles documenting this. Christian Solidarity International has bought back the freedom of over 6,000 slaves of northern people empowered by the Government to go south, kill the men in the village, take the women and children hostages, and make them slaves. 
   This is a picture taken by one of my staff members at Christmas this past year when she was in Sudan. This little boy is probably 11 or 12 years old. He is holding his arm out in this picture. It actually has on it his slave brand--branded slave. 
   What the Government in Khartoum does is, they allow people from the north to go down as raiders into these communities, and part of what they get paid for is the slaves they can take. This is a closer picture of the little boy's arm showing the brand mark. They are taken and made to be herders, they are taken into sexual concubinage. The slave trade exists in the world today at the hands of the Government in Khartoum. It is absolutely unfathomable that this continues to occur. That is on top of the genocide and the ethnic cleansing that is taking place. 
   This is a picture of the civilian bombing that takes place within the country all the time. I was in Yei. The hospital in Yei has been bombed three times in the last year. They are taking old Soviet cargo planes, Antonovs, and they roll bombs out the back. They are indiscriminate. They are not militarily significant, but it kills a lot of people. It terrifies the people on the ground. 
   This is a picture of the hospital that has been bombed. 
   This photograph is, again, a civilian target. It has a big red X on the top of it, and that is part of the bombing that takes place. 
   This picture shows people who are watching for the bombers. 
   I put up a quick chart of the atrocities of the Government in the north. Remember, this amendment we are going to offer simply allows humanitarian aid to the resistance movement. It does not provide arms of any nature, but it does provide food aid to the resistance movement in Sudan. 
   This is what the Government in Khartoum has done. If people are going back and forth saying we are taking sides if we provide humanitarian aid to the resistance, I point out, the Government in Sudan is a terrorist regime as determined by the United States State Department. It is state-sponsored terrorism. They have housed Osama bin Laden since 1997. He stayed in Khartoum. 
   Most of the terrorist groups operating in the world have a base of operation in Khartoum. The Government in Sudan is supporting terrorist movements in three adjacent countries--Congo, Eritrea, and Uganda. They are seeking to expand this militant fundamentalism. 
   I pointed this out earlier: 
   Dead, 1.9 million people. It is the worst humanitarian situation in the world. 
   An internally displaced population of 4.3 million. 
   Last year, they let famine alone kill 100,000 people. Mr. President, this is the most incredible thing. Food sat in the country, and the Government in Khartoum would not let us fly relief planes into the area where they needed it, and the people died. They died at the hands of the Khartoum Government because they would not let our planes deliver the food aid. 
   Enslavement takes place, civilian bombings, forced religious conversions, terrorist threats throughout the region. This is the Government in Khartoum. This is the Government of  Sudan. If Members are hesitant to support food aid to the resistance movement, this is against whom they are fighting. This is arguably one of the, if not the worst regimes in the world for the treatment of its own people and attempts to export a militant fundamentalism and spread it throughout Africa. They housed the terrorist who tried to kill President Mubarak of Egypt. I mentioned the Government in Sudan housed Osama bin Laden. 
   This is a simple amendment. Rather than calling it up at the present time, I am making my colleagues aware, if it is not agreed to, I will be calling this amendment up and asking for a vote on this amendment. It is food aid to the opposition groups. It is not military aid. It is against the Government that supports the institutions of slavery, and it has the worst humanitarian situation in the world. Mr. President, 100,000 were killed last year. This is the least we can do. 
   I see other Members in the Chamber. I do not want to take additional time for this. I yield the floor.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I wanted to address the body on several of the discussion points that were raised today regarding an amendment I filed. I inquire first of the President, what is the pending business? 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>106-brownback-ks-2-19990630</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BROWNBACK. Then I will not have to ask the pending business be set aside. We are still on that. 
   I wanted to address several of the issues my colleagues have raised, that the negotiations between Armenia and Azerbaijan that are taking place in the so-called Minsk Group are at a very delicate time period and the repeal of section 907, as addressed in the McConnell-Abraham amendment, would upset the delicate negotiations at this point in time. 
   Frankly, it is just not true that these negotiations are at a delicate point in time now and this amendment would do that. The present conflict has been going on since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and a cease-fire has been in effect since 1994. The U.S. Government is one of the peace group cochairs, along with Russia and France, and they all--the U.S. Government, the Clinton administration--favor repeal or waiver of section 907. 
   The amendment I put forward prevents our Government from being an honest broker in the peace process. We have letters from Secretary Albright and the administration on this. 
   Russia is involved, and not in a helpful way. Their handiwork in retaining influences in the Caucasus is only slightly less obvious than their efforts to help out in Kosovo--in some situations where they were not helpful at all. Russian military troops are still based in Armenia and were providing military support and munitions supplies to Armenia during the war with Azerbaijan.  
   The argument in support of the status quo has nothing to do with the sensitivities of the ongoing peace talks. The last real peace initiative where there was a real push was in 1997, calling for Armenia's withdrawal from the occupied territories in exchange for normalization of trade with Azerbaijan. This was rejected by Armenia. 
   The continued status quo in Armenia's favor is nothing less than the Armenian Government's attempt to influence U.S. foreign policy and preserve an undue advantage. It really is that simple. Azerbaijan is the only country in the former Soviet Union that has unilateral sanctions from the United States. Again, we do not lift them; we just provide waiver authority for section 907. 
   So those arguments being raised by my colleagues are simply not accurate. Also, they talk about the issue of the blockade: Somehow Azerbaijan is blockading Armenia. I want to show a map on this point so people can get a look, again, at the region and what this so-called blockade is about. 
   Here is Azerbaijan. Here is Armenia. Here is the area in dispute. Armenia is occupying 20 percent of the landmass of Azerbaijan. The United Nations has condemned this action by Armenia. OSCE, the group much involved in negotiation, condemns the action by Armenia. 
   You can see Armenia has outlets they can use through Iran or through Georgia, which is up here. So there is 
   not a blockade on Armenia. What the so-called blockade is, and has been for a long period of time, is a mutual border closing caused by Armenia's continued illegal occupation of Azerbaijan. 
   I hope my colleagues will look at the map, look at the situation, read the U.N. resolutions, the OSCE resolutions about Armenia occupying 20 percent of Azerbaijan, and quickly and clearly conclude that this blockade is really a mutual border closing caused by Armenia and its illegal occupation of Azerbaijan. That, plus the difficulties caused by Armenia's mining of some of the overland routes through the buffer zone surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh, are probably some of the most serious logistical obstacles in the blockade. 
   So I point these out to my colleagues, those who are saying this is a sensitive time. We had a cease-fire for 5 years. It is not that the government is involved in trying to negotiate a true peace and wants 907 to be repealed so the United States can be an honest broker in this peace process and not one-sided on it. The Clinton administration, and Bush administration prior to that, opposed section 907. And the blockade is really not a blockade at all. 
   Mr. President, I ask at this time to set aside the pending amendment, Senator MCCONNELL's amendment, so I can call up an amendment. 
   I will call up amendment No. 1170. This is an amendment I talked about previously on Sudan. I would like to have that considered. I ask unanimous consent that we set aside the pending amendment so I can call up amendment No. 1170.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, this is an amendment we have been negotiating back and forth. I indicated briefly that we wanted to bring it up if we could not get a negotiated agreement. We are proceeding later on in the day. I know the people in charge of the bill want to move this amendment, so I called this amendment up to get it as the pending business so people can discuss it. 
   I have discussed this earlier. I do not seek to take up an extraordinary amount of time to discuss it. It would make available international disaster assistance, humanitarian assistance, and development assistance in the opposition-controlled areas of the Sudan. 
   I recently led a congressional delegation to the region. The government in Khartoum is a terrorist regime. That is according to the U.S. State Department. They have in their country the worst humanitarian situation in the world. That is according to Brian Atwood, head of USAID--the worst in the world. There were nearly 2 million people killed in 10 years, over 4 million internally displaced. This is through forced, manmade famine and starvation. This is by bombing, indiscriminate civilian bombing by the government in Khartoum. 
   It is exporting terrorism. It has housed Osama bin Laden until 1997. They house a number of terrorist groups in Khartoum. They are supporting terrorism and spreading throughout the region a sort of militant terrorism--in the Congo, Eritrea, Uganda, and other places. They seem to seek to be the African edge of the militant terrorism. The people attempting to kill President Mubarak in Egypt were given housing and aid and abetting in Sudan by this government. This is a bad regime. This amendment simply seeks to provide humanitarian assistance to those opposition-controlled areas and the opposition groups. 
   Here, again, is the list of items the government in Khartoum, the Sudan Government, is doing today. I have talked about these. Most recently, last year, 100,000 people, according to the U.S. Committee on Refugees, were killed by a man-induced famine, induced by the Khartoum government. They would not let our disaster relief planes fly into the region. They said no. 
   It is time we allowed aid to go to the resistance groups that are fighting just for dignity and for their own lives. This is a simple amendment. It is a modification to the one we previously called up. I do not know of any objection to this, and as soon as the manager of the amendment can perhaps come to the floor, I would simply like to ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment and have us vote on it 
   because I think it is a worthwhile amendment. While that is being taken care of, I ask unanimous consent that Senator HELMS be added as a cosponsor to this amendment.

Actually now it is not just southern, it is all over the country. 
   We can move the vote to a later point, but I ask for the yeas and nays on amendment No. 1170.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I realize I have spoken on this a couple of times, but I have heard arguments put forward that I want to clarify my response to so it is in the RECORD. 
   No. 1 is that the administration, the U.S. administration, the U.S. Government, is part of the Minsk Group. It is part of the group trying to negotiate a peace between Azerbaijan and Armenia. The Clinton administration, they support my amendment. They supported it in committee this year. They supported it last year in the Congress. They think this is a good idea. This is the administration that is negotiating, part of the three outside members--France, Russia, and the United States--part of the overall Minsk Group, along with Azerbaijan and Armenia, that is negotiating this peace. 
   So if this is ill timed, maybe we ought to tell the administration that, because they support my amendment.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. People can look at that. As far as this being a sensitive time in the negotiations, I support peace in the region, but this battle, this fight between the sides, has been going on since 1992. We have had a ceasefire for the last 5 years. There has not been significant movement in the peace process or a significant proposal since 1997. If the administration thought it was such a sensitive time, I think they would be here saying don't offer this amendment rather than supporting my position. 
   So I hope my colleagues will look at all these issues and determine the administration is probably right. This is something we should do. We should put everybody on an equal footing so we can work with all the people in this region, and I think that would be an important thing to do.  
   With that, I will be happy to yield for a question from my colleague.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I have noted in my opening statement, and I have noted later, the human rights issues that exist throughout the region. There is no doubt that they exist. I think the same standards should be applied to Azerbaijan as apply to the other countries in the region. And those do stay in place. 
   This is talk of a major shift in U.S. foreign policy. I, again, remind people that we are simply providing the President with waiver authority. If he determines that human rights abuses are such that any of the sanctions should not be lifted, they will not be lifted. The administration is given that authority. We do not lift those sanctions. The President maintains that. 
   I also note, in the human rights area--because this is an area of key concern, as it should be an area of key concern to everybody--we recently had a coffee for the Israeli Minister of Trade and Industry, Natan Sharansky. That name should be familiar to some Members. He is one of the leading human rights voices in the world. This is a person who understands the connection between the U.S. position and human rights problems. 
   He was here specifically to support the Silk Road Strategy Act of the bill. He said this:  
   Look at the human rights situation and weigh this against the importance of the threat that is facing us. It is very important to engage and to continue to encourage a positive process and the way to do this is to strengthen the role we are playing in the region.  
   Strengthen the U.S. role played in the region. Sharansky is clearly a person who understands the importance of tying legislation to human rights. He is a clear beneficiary of that having been done in the past. This is one of the clearest voices in the world. That is not to deny that human rights abuses have occurred. But we are not lifting the standards of human rights. We are not saying that Azerbaijan has a lower standard than everybody else. We are saying everybody has the same standard. And we provide the President the national waiver authority. This does not shift U.S. policy if the President determines it is not in our national interest, which is the same standard we put to all countries. 
   I plead with my colleagues to look seriously at this because while we can get down here in the weeds of some particular issues, we are talking about a region of the world that the Iranians are aggressively playing in now. All these Silk Road countries that I am talking about, the Iranians are there. They are providing aid, they are providing hate, and they are trying to overturn these governments. They can say that the authors of the amendment are saying: OK, let's just pull this 907 provision out. The rest is fine. 
   Azerbaijan is a key part of this Eurasian connection of connecting this region together for democracy, for a growing competitive economy that can stand against the threat of the Iranians and the militant fundamentalists expanding in this region that is taking place now. 
   The notion that we have not looked at this enough--I bet we have had nearly 10 hearings in the Foreign Relations  Committee between this Congress and last Congress on this issue. It passed the Foreign Relations Committee last Congress and this Congress. We have looked at it and looked at it. I wish we studied most issues as much as we have studied this one. We have. This one has been around. People have looked at it. This 907 provision has been in place for a number of years and it has not helped Armenia. 
   My final point here is, I am seeking, by this, to help all the countries in this region and U.S. policy. I am seeking, by this, to help Armenia as well. I realize that the people that are in opposition on this would not see that as such. But has our past policy helped Armenia? Has that been of any help? 
   I talked with the Foreign Minister 3 or 4 months ago, and he talked about how terrible the situation was in Armenia. And I agree, it probably is. But that is suffering under the law we put in place. Let's try something that can lift the whole region up and build stakeholders who can say: We ought to cooperate and work together. 
   Let's try something that can work instead of this failed policy that is a unilateral sanction. Let's provide to the President the authority to be able to do that, to move that peace process forward. This is the time to do that. I hope we can get to a vote here quickly. 
   I inquire of my colleague from Kentucky, I know he would like to move this bill, it would seem to me that probably we have had sufficient time. If there is a chance to move forward and vote, I think we are probably getting to that point.

I hope we would look at the people who live in this area of the world which is affected by this Silk Road Strategy Act. It is interrelated. It does all tie together to create this Eurasian corridor. 
   If you pull Azerbaijan out of it and you say, okay, we will work with everybody but not with them, the corridor and its work towards lifting all of their economies in their countries doesn't work, we are talking a total of nearly 72 million people in this region. If you look at a map of it, you need to work on this together. They have a lot of pressure on them from various areas. 
   You really need to have this all hooked in together. We need to replace 907 with a national interest waiver that the President can put, and then have a coherent U.S. policy so that we meet our interests in the region. It is clearly to have this engaged, not fall in the hands of the Iranians or back to the Russians, so we can build and grow with them and not force them to become militant fundamentalist countries. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment that has been cleared, I understand, by both sides. I would like to submit into the RECORD a clarification regarding the distribution of humanitarian assistance, including food, directly to the National Democratic Alliance participants operating outside of the Operation Lifeline Sudan structure. Namely, the intent and expectation of the Senate through this language is for the Sudanese People's Liberation Movement to be a recipient as a leading member participant in the National Democratic Alliance.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I thank our distinguished colleague from Minnesota for all his work in this field. 
   As long as I have been in this body--I have not been in it that long; I am in my third year--I have known that Senator GRAMS has been really working on the issue of tax cuts. He has pushed forward. He has prodded people on it. He has done a beautiful job of getting us to the point of people saying let's have a tax cut, a serious tax cut, not one where we just issue a bunch of press releases and the press releases cost more than the tax cut 
   but a real tax cut that stimulates the economy and helps people. 
   I am delighted the President is now apparently willing to work with the Congress in order to provide the American people with the tax cut they need and deserve. Part of the reason the President is now willing to consider a tax cut is the strength of the American economy, which is precisely one of the reasons we should consider a tax cut at this time. We are at this point of a budget surplus because of some fiscal discipline in Washington but mostly because of the strength of our economy. We need to keep that economy going and growing strong. That is the key to having budget surpluses in the future--a strong economy. We can help with tax cuts. 
   The bottom line, as has been mentioned before, is that growth works. When we have growth, we have more resources to pay down the debt, to do the programs needed for the American public, and now to cut taxes. 
   If we are going to continue to experience a growing economy, we need to take steps to enhance and sustain our current record of economic expansion in order to pave the way for the next century. We need another ``American century.'' Providing the American people with broad-based progrowth tax relief is one of the ways to help achieve it. 
   In America there is an emerging class of investors who are more aware of what tax policy means for individuals and for the ability of our economy to perform. This class of investors is citizens who have been able to take part in the American dream through 401(k) programs and expanded IRAs that have been offered as part of a retirement package or encouraged through our Tax Code. They are not wealthy--- not yet anyway--but they are increasingly concerned about our Tax Code and what it means to them. 
   We need to work with the family farmers, cab drivers, construction workers, and small businessmen to allow them to participate in this free market system and have it continue its expansion. They know the best thing Congress can do in order to spur growth is to cut taxes. 
   There are a variety of options for cutting America's taxes. We can use a budget surplus after accounting for Social Security. We need the Social Security surplus for Social Security, and we need to lock it down, lock it out--create a lockbox for it. 
   With the budget surplus over and above Social Security, we could widen the 15-percent tax bracket in order to help ``flatten" the tax structure and provide the American people with tax relief. An expansion of the 15-percent tax bracket has another desirous effect of alleviating the impact of the marriage penalty. Currently, nearly 21 million families are forced to carry an average of $1,400 more a year in taxes simply for being married. We must bring this institutionalized discrimination against the family to an end. Now is the time to do that. 
   We could also take steps to encourage savings and investment by cutting the capital gains tax rate, which could stimulate the economy and give back further revenues to the Federal Government. Americans need a higher rate of national savings to continue to grow into the next century. Cutting capital gains tax rates will help. We can look at the possibility of further reductions in the death tax area. I think we need to do this, particularly for small businesses and family farmers who frequently spend a lot of time reorganizing their business, creating trusts and other corporations to get around paying death taxes that would have the impact of killing their business, or of killing their farm, and not allowing them to pass it on to the next generation. We need to do those things. 
   I congratulate the Senator from Minnesota for his work on this tax-cutting agenda and getting the President to agree that we can and should do a tax cut. For the President to say he isn't opposed to a tax cut is a positive step. Now it is time for the President to deal with the Congress in providing real tax relief to the American public. It stimulates the economy, it keeps us growing, and it supports the American public. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to address the Senate on an issue regarding an amendment which we have recently passed on this floor: U.S. policy toward India and Pakistan. I want to address the Senate on that issue. 
   We passed an amendment on a defense appropriations bill that would allow the President to waive certain sanctions we have against India and Pakistan and also suspend economic sanctions we have against India and Pakistan. That passed this body and has gone over to the House. This is something the House is going to be considering, and it is important U.S. policy in a number of regards. 
   Our relationship toward India has been one where we have been willing to sanction them rapidly and readily, in spite of the fact that they are a democracy and we share a number of institutional values and we have worked together sometimes in the past. But it seems as if we are very willing to sanction them. Yet, at the same time, we are willing to go toward China and say: China, you may steal our weapons technology, you may have human rights abuses, you may be shipping weapons of mass destruction to countries that are opposed to our interests; you have forced-abortion policies in place. Yet we are going to overlook all of those things because we want to have a good, open relationship with you, a good trade relationship. But, India, you tested here and you broke into these areas, so we are going to put economic sanctions on you, put these other sanctions on you, and we are going to hit you hard. It is the same with Pakistan. 
   I think we have the wrong policies in place, and I don't understand it. I want to draw that to the attention of my colleagues because it appears as if we are putting these on with different balances, that we are saying in the case of China we are going to overlook the problems, overlook the situation, all these abuses, and with India we are going to smack you no matter what you do. They have a democracy, a vibrant democracy and a free press. The same with Pakistan, as far as their issues go, but we are willing to hit them so hard. 
   So I don't understand why we are doing that, why the Clinton Presidency looks at the two countries differently, and lets China get away with virtually anything, if you look at the record that has built up over a period of time. Toward India, we say we are going to smack you. 
   Senator ROBERTS and I have put forward an amendment that has passed this body and is going to the House. It  would suspend these sanctions, the economic sanctions, toward India and Pakistan. 
   I think it is high time that the United States aggressively build its relationship with India and aggressively build its relationship with Pakistan. We need to do this. We need to have a broad-based relationship and not one that just has very narrow sanctions associated with it. For instance, as well, the administration is pushing that to lift these sanctions on India, they are telling the Indian Government, basically, they have to agree to CTBT, the Conventional Test Ban Treaty, in spite of the fact that the Senate may never pick this up. They are saying unless they agree to this, we are not going to lift these sanctions. It is a very narrow discussion point that they have with India, instead of having this broad-based discussion about how can we expand trade relationships, expand diplomatic relationships, and work together on issues of key concern. 
   We should be asking: How can we expand relationships in the broad set of fields that we have? Instead, it is they have to agree to the CTBT, or we are not going to lift these economic sanctions on them, period. That is too narrow of a relationship for us to build with a great nation. India will be the largest nation in the world in the next 10 years, population-wise. It has an extraordinarily large middle class. It has a number of people in a very poor situation, as well, but it has a large middle class. 
   Look also at Pakistan. It is in the amendment where we suspend economic sanctions for 5 years and have a waiver on others. Pakistan sits in a difficult spot, right next to Afghanistan. They have had a lot of problems with Afghanistan. Pakistan seeks to be a friend of the United States. It is partly, obviously, an Islamic country and has been a key ally of ours in defeating the Soviet Union in Afghanistan. After Afghanistan, the Soviets backed off and we pulled out altogether. We not only sanctioned them under the Glenn amendment, we also had the Pressler amendment that basically removed our relationship with Pakistan, an Islamic country that seeks to be our friend, and we just nail them. 
   It makes no sense to me why we do these sorts of things, and why the President, the Clinton administration, seeks to sanction a country that seeks to work with us, and closely with 
   us, while with China we have had all this theft of technology, shipment of weapons of mass destruction, all the human rights abuses, and we are willing to look the other way. 
   I think we ought to have trade relationships with China. I think it is important that we have a broad-based relationship with China. But at the same time we need to be expanding our relationships with India and Pakistan. These are countries--particularly in India's case--that share a lot of our traditions. I think it is wrong for us to have a double standard, particularly against a country that should be a very valuable future partner. 
   I chair the Foreign Relations subcommittee that deals with both India and Pakistan, and it has been beyond me to understand the difference in U.S. policy toward these giant Asian countries. I think it is wrong of the administration to have this different policy. I think we really need to be much more aggressive and engaged and be a vibrant, broad-based partner with India. I think it can be a good future relationship. It is something we can use as an offset toward China, in some respects, and our large dependency on China. I think it can be a future growth market for States such as mine and many others that have agricultural and aircraft products that we export. I think it can be a growing, vibrant market for us, one that shares a lot of our relationships and views and needs. 
   I wanted to bring to the attention of my colleagues what is really happening in foreign policy. We also had a hearing yesterday on the issue of Iraq. I wanted to mention this tangentially because I think it is appropriate. We had people testifying from the Iraqi National Congress--a representative of the INC, Mr. Chalabi--and we had other witnesses testifying that Saddam Hussein is probably at his weakest point since the United States was engaged with Iraq. They are having daily reports of insurrection in the southern part of Iraq, and the northern part of the country is no longer in the control of Saddam Hussein. 
   There are other factions that are controlling much of this Kurdish region. Yet the United States, in the Iraq liberation, provided $97 million of drawdown authority and support for the opposition movement, and all we are giving the opposition movement is file cabinets and fax machines. Why aren't we really supporting this opposition movement that seeks to meet inside Iraq to set up more of a civil society in the region that Saddam doesn't control? Why aren't we really supporting these guys? 
   I asked the administration witness yesterday--Under Secretary Beth Jones, a bright and good person--Do you think Saddam Hussein is going to outlast another U.S. President? Is he going to outlast President Clinton? 
   She says: I really don't know. 
   I said we know how to aggressively push and prosecute these issues in Kosovo. Why is it that we can't do this in Iraq? Why can't we support the opposition groups and give them lethal and nonlethal assistance that we can find truly necessary? Why can't we help them have a meeting of the Iraqi National Congress inside Iraq where they want to meet? It would send a powerful statement across the world that the INC, a potential opposition government, is meeting within Iraq. 
   Yet the administration is not willing to step forward and 
   is saying they are not so sure about whether or not we should do this. We are willing to give the opposition file cabinets and fax machines, but we won't give them training and lethal technology or the ability to fight. This is an extraordinary situation. It is one on which the Congress needs to speak out more. 
   We need to aggressively move forward now on Saddam Hussein. We need to do that by supporting the opposition. This isn't about sending in U.S. troops. This is about supporting an opposition that wants to fight with Saddam Hussein, that wants to put the parts together to have a democratic Iraq, that wants to be an ally--not just that but wants the Iraqi people to be proud of and pleased with their government, instead of constantly harassed and killed by their leadership. 
   Why on earth are we not pushing this and stepping forward and being more aggressive? I fail to get adequate answers from the Clinton administration on why. We know how to push forward aggressively on Kosovo. Why can't we deal in such a manner with Iraq? We know how to build a relationship with China. Why can't we build relationships with India and Pakistan? I really don't understand what is taking place. I ask these questions, and we are going to continue to hold hearings on these issues. We need to move forward in building a better relationship with India and Pakistan and dealing with the situation in Iraq. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the Y2K Act. I commend Senator MCCAIN for the leadership he has provided the Senate on an issue that is of critical importance to small businesses across this country. I do not know if we have highlighted enough the cost of the Y2K problem on small business. That is what I would like to briefly address. I also thank the Chamber of Commerce for the effort they have made to bring this problem to the attention of the Congress and to the public. 
   I support protecting businesses from unnecessary and frivolous litigation that will arise from the Y2K problem. While businesses are hard at work trying to fix potential problems arising from the Year 2000, others are trying to exploit it through excessive and expensive litigation. It has been reported in that the cost of litigation in the U.S. arising from this problem will range from $200 billion to $1 trillion. It is just incredible. The Senate Commerce Committee has reported that up to 48 lawsuits relating to the Y2K problem have already been filed. What has been described as a ``tremendous new business opportunity'' for lawyers is done at the expense of the private business sector, in particularly small businesses. Small businesses are most at risk from Y2K failures because many have not begun to realize the potential problem and they do not have the capital to remedy any Y2K difficulties. 
   This bill goes a long way toward preventing litigation from the Y2K problem by establishing punitive damage caps, alternative dispute resolution, and proportional liability. While this bill will limit the amount of frivolous litigation, it will not prevent those who are blatantly negligible in becoming Y2K compliant or have caused personal injuries as a result of their noncompliance from escaping their responsibilities. They will still be held responsible. 
   Although I believe S. 96 will prevent and limit any litigation arising from the Y2K problem, I am still concerned that the greatest beneficiaries of the Year 2000 computer problem will be the trial lawyers. I am disheartened that there is no provision in this bill that places a reasonable cap on attorneys' fees. An attorney fees' cap will help prevent excessive litigation against small businesses by creating a financial disincentive for trial lawyers. Unlike the big corporations who have millions to spend on solving the Y2K problem and defending themselves in any Y2K civil action, the small businesses do not have the financial resources and are therefore the primary targets of any potential Y2K litigation. A reasonable and fair attorney fees' cap will decrease the amount of excessive and frivolous litigation arising from the Y2K problem. But without a reasonable cap, I am concerned that the Y2K problem could become a boondoggle for the trial lawyers at the expense of small businesses. However, in the interest of passing this legislation, I will not be offering an attorney's fee amendment at this time. I do hope that the Senate will be able to consider and debate this issue in the future. 
   That having been said, I ask that the Senate move quickly to pass this legislation and protect small businesses from potential Y2K litigation. 
   Thank you very much, Mr. President.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, 189 Americans were killed in the bombing of Pan Am 103. Their families have known no peace for more than a decade. While it is true that Libya has labored under mild United Nations sanctions for much of that time, it is also true that the perpetrators of this hideous act of terrorism have lived a life of freedom with their families. 
   For reasons best known to himself, Colonel Qadhafi has decided to turn over the two suspects in the Pan Am 103 bombing to a Scottish court constituted in The Hague. In return, the U.N. sanctions against Libya have been suspended. 
   This measure, a sense of the Congress, highlights some of the inadequacies of the current arrangement. For example, Libya has only fulfilled one of four requirements set forth in the relevant Security Council resolutions. Qadhafi has yet to reassure us he will fully cooperate with the investigation and trial; he has yet to renounce his support for international terrorism; and he has failed to pay compensation to the victims' families. 
   I have little confidence that no matter what the outcome of this trial, Qadhafi will not change his stripes. He is a dictator and a criminal. Indeed, the London Sunday Times of May 23, 1999, reported that British intelligence has information clearly linking Qadhafi himself to the bombing. 
   This amendment states the sense of Congress that the President should use all means, including our veto in the Security Council, to preclude the lifting of sanctions on Libya until all conditions are fulfilled. I would go further. Until we know just who ordered this bombing, and until that person is duly punished, Libya must remain a pariah state, isolated not only by the United States but by all the decent nations of the world. 
   I urge colleagues to support this amendment, and commend Senator KENNEDY for his many efforts of the Pan Am 103 victims and families. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, today we had this time reserved to discuss an amendment that I was planning to offer dealing with the lifting of economic sanctions on India and Pakistan. I did so in the belief, actually in the hope, that the bilateral relationship between India and Pakistan had improved in the wake of the Lahore summit. The summit seemed to imply that. 
    Unfortunately, I was wrong. 
   According to Indian news agencies Indian helicopter gun ships, backed by MiG-17 fighter aircraft from India's air force bombed the troubled state of Kashmir, marking the most serious escalation of tensions on the Indo-Pakistani border in the last several years. As a result, I have reconsidered the wisdom of offering my amendment on India and Pakistan at this time. 
   It is important that I note here today that I strongly believe in the long term importance of easing economic sanctions on both of these nations. I also believe that the United States ignores at its peril these two vital countries. That reality is highlighted all the more by yesterday's release of the Cox report on China which, if nothing else, has clearly shown that China is a serious threat in South Asia--not to speak of a threat to our fundamental values around the world--and that we need to broaden our relationship with India in the South Asian subcontinent. 
   I hope to revisit this issue in the near future. Let me emphasize that I will not feel comfortable doing so until there is a serious de-escalation of tension on the subcontinent. 
   I just wanted to point this out and to enter into the RECORD an Associated  Press story about India launching airstrikes into Kashmir against infiltrators. I think we have a lot to learn yet about what specifically took place. Those details are sketchy and not coming in at the present time.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I want to simply note again that we held a hearing yesterday on what is taking place in India and on military and political issues. The United States needs to broaden its relationship with India. We have a broad-based relationship with China which has been strained and stressed. China is an authoritarian country. India is a democracy. There are a number of places that we are sanctioning India where we don't sanction China at all. Yet these are comparable-sized countries. One has a democratic tradition, the other an authoritarian. There are a number of problems in China that we aren't experiencing with India. 
   We need to broaden this relationship with India and with Pakistan. It is just that at the present time, given what has just taken place in the escalating of tension in this subcontinent by Indian military forces, I don't feel comfortable offering this amendment. 
   I look forward to working in good faith with all of my colleagues to address the United States-South Asian relationship. I note to Members of the Senate that we will be holding hearings in the Foreign Relations Committee to look further into what we need to do in building this stronger relationship.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, further reserving the right to object, I want to note my support for what Senator ENZI is stating, and that I am concerned that what we have in the underlying bill is not paid for and we ought to have appropriate offsets to this supplemental. It is an important supplemental bill, but I am reserving the right to object and I am saying that we should pay for this. It should be offset with other cuts in nondefense discretionary and domestic spending. 
   We have a $15 billion supplemental appropriations bill. We are asking in the nondefense areas that there be offsets to that. This is not a major thing for us to do. I think it is fully appropriate that we move forward and have offsets taking place in this supplemental bill. There is important spending taking place in the supplemental that I think is appropriate. There is some for my home State and the disaster we had. But 
   let's pay for it. That is why I am reserving the right to object.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I regret that due to family business which took me out of the country, I was unable to cast several recorded votes during yesterday's session. While my vote would not have altered the outcome of any of the motions, I would like to express how I would have voted had I been able: 
   On vote No. 120, a Cloture Motion regarding the motion to proceed to consideration of S. 96, Y2K liability legislation. I would have voted ``AYE.'' It is high time we move to consideration of this important legislation. The turn of the millennium is fast approaching and we must work to protect our citizens and businesses against harmful litigation that benefits no one. 
   On vote No. 121, amendment numbered 351 to S. 254 offered by Senator ALLARD regarding memorials in public schools, I would have voted ``AYE.'' This amendment will allow students and faculty members to grieve for classmates and colleagues killed on school property in a way that makes them most comfortable. 
   On vote No. 122, an amendment numbered 352 to S. 254 offered by Senators KOHL and HATCH regarding mandatory safety locks on guns, I would have voted ``AYE.'' This amendment was an example of the importance of bipartisan compromise. The Kohl-Hatch amendment requires all handguns sold or transferred by a licensed dealer to be sold with a locking device. In addition, this amendment provides important liability protections for gun owners who use these safety devices. 
   On vote No. 13, an amendment numbered 353 to S. 254 offered by Senators HATCH and FEINSTEIN I would have voted ``AYE.'' This important amendment increased penalties for participating in a crime as a gang member; makes it illegal to travel or use the mail for gang business; makes it illegal to transfer firearms to children to commit a crime; makes it illegal to clone pagers; prohibits the distribution of certain information relating to explosives or destructive devices; makes it illegal to wear body armor in the commission of a crime and donates surplus body armor to local Law enforcement agencies; and strengthens penalties for Eco-terrorism. 
   On vote No. 124, an amendment to S. 254 offered by Senator BYRD I would have voted ``AYE.'' This amendment allows states to enforce their own alcoholic beverage control laws by allowing state prosecutors to bring an injunction in Federal Court if interstate shippers violate State laws.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, yesterday, Israel marked 32 years since Jerusalem was united under Israeli control in the 1967 Mideast war. I rise today to strongly urge the President of the United States not to employ the waiver provision in the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995, but rather to fulfill the intent of that law by moving our embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Israel's capital city, Jerusalem. 
   The United States has diplomatic relations with 184 countries around the world. With only one of those countries--Israel--do we neither recognize the country's designated capital nor have our embassy located in the designated capital. That is as incredible as it is unacceptable. It is not only that Israel is one of our closet and most important allies. Nor is it only the obvious principle that every country has the right to designate its own capital. It is also that there is no other capital city anywhere whose history is more intimately associated than is Jerusalem's with the nation of Israel. 
   Jerusalem is the only city on earth that is the capital of the same country, inhabited by the same people who speak the same language and worship the same God as they did 3,000 years ago. No other city on earth can make that claim. Three thousand years ago, David, King of Israel, made Jerusalem his capital city and brought the Ark of the Covenant into its gates. Ever since, Jerusalem has been the cultural, spiritual, and religious center of the Jewish people. Twenty-five hundred years ago an anonymous Jewish psalmist living in forced exile wrote the following words: ``By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down and wept when we remembered Zion.......If I forget the O Jerusalem, may my right hand lose its cunning; may my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth if I do not remember thee, If I do not set Jerusalem above my chief joy.'' 
   Jerusalem has been a capital city of an independent country only three times in its history, and all three were under Jewish sovereignty: under the four hundred year rule of the House of Davids, under the restored Jewish commonwealth following the period of Babylonian exile (586-536 BC), and now under the reborn State of Israel. Jerusalem has been the capital of no other independent state, nor of any other people. It has had a continuous Jewish presence for three thousand years, and for the last hundred and fifty years, Jews have been the largest single part of its population. 
   In 1947, The United Nations General Assembly passed the Partition Resolution for Palestine to partition what is today Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza into what was supposed to become a Jewish state and a Palestinian Arab state. In the resolution, Jerusalem was to have been an international city under UN auspices. The Jewish community of Palestine accepted the partition  proposal but the Arab community, along with the rest of the Arab world, refused. Instead, Arab armies invaded the nascent Jewish state intent on destroying it--a de facto rendering the Partition Resolution null and void. 
   Nevertheless, the United States established its embassy in Tel Aviv, where it sits to this day. But Jerusalem is Israel's capital: it is the seat of its government, its parliament, its supreme court. The President and Prime Minister reside there. Our ambassador travels daily from Tel Aviv to meetings with Israeli government officials in Jerusalem. All major political parties in Israel agree, moreover, that Jerusalem will remain Israel's undivided capital. 
   The United States Congress also agrees. Congress overwhelmingly passed legislation in 1995 that contained an official statement of US policy on Jerusalem: that it should remain united and be recognized as Israel's capital, and that our embassy should be located there by the end of May, 1999. If the embassy were not located in Jerusalem by that date, 50 percent of the State Department's budget for buildings and maintenance abroad would be withheld unless the President issued a national security waiver. That is the waiver which the President now considers issuing. I strongly believe that he should not do so, that instead he should do what is right by recognizing that Jerusalem is Israel's capital. 
   There are those who timidly argue that to do what is right will damage the peace process. How can that be possible? Is it not more harmful to fuel unrealizable expectations by pretending that Jerusalem is not Israel's capital or that it might someday be redivided? Would it not be better simply to finally do what we should have done fifty years ago by recognizing the only city that could ever be. Israel's capital, the one city that has always been Israel's capital, the eternal city of Jerusalem? 
   President Clinton stated when he was running for office on June 30, 1992 the following: ``Whatever the outcome of the negotiations, ..... Jerusalem is still the capital of Israel, and must remain an undivided city accessible to all.'' He was right then, and he has the chance to do right now.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, today, I, along with Senator AKAKA, introduce the National Day of Reconciliation Bill. In this bill, the President will issue a yearly proclamation designating the day before Thanksgiving as a ``National Day of Reconciliation.'' On this day, it is our hope that every person in the U.S. should seek out those individuals who have been alienated and pursue forgiveness and reconciliation from them. Historically, Thanksgiving is a time when we put all of our differences aside and give thanks for all that we have achieved and shared. I cannot think of a better day in which to reconcile than the day before Thanksgiving. 
   When considering the need for this piece of legislation, I was reminded of times when our nation was at war with itself, and the very fabric of our Constitution was held together by a few threads. The Civil War placed our democracy and national sovereignty in great jeopardy. However, Abraham Lincoln, one of our nation's greatest leaders, knew the importance of ``binding'' our nation together after civil war had ravaged our nation. It was through his wisdom and ability to forgive that he helped heal our nation's wounds. Once again, there is the absence of peace in America. 
   We live in a society where there is too much alienation, from one another and from God. We, in too many cases, have allowed our focus to shift from one another to ourselves. Lincoln recognized the need to reconcile with one another. He also knew that reconciliation efforts would never be successful without looking first to the divine authority. 
   In his second Inaugural speech, Lincoln said, ``with malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds.*.*.*.to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.'' 
   The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was yet another one of our nation's great leaders who knew the importance of focusing on a higher moral power to achieve peaceful reconciliation. Dr. King, through wisdom and sacrificial love, reconciled an entire nation with individuals who, through discrimination, were alienated from sections of our society. Dr. King said, ``It is time for all people of conscience to call upon America to return to her true home of brotherhood and peaceful pursuits. * * * We must work unceasingly to lift this nation that we love to a higher destiny, to a new plateau of compassion, to a more noble expression of humaneness.'' Mr. President, we need to restore peace in our nation, we need to restore charity for one another, and we need to return our focus to a higher moral authority. 
   As we look at our culture today, we see images that influence not only our  actions but the actions of young people as well. Our culture glorifies conflict, greed, and violence. It is no wonder that we see atrocities that seem impossible to imagine. It is time for our country to reconcile, and the ``National Day of Reconciliation'' will remind us of this solemn obligation. 
   If Americans hope to ``bind up [our] nation's wounds,'' as Lincoln suggested, we must first make the commitment in the Congress. This bill makes that commitment by calling for a ``National Day of Recognition''--a day that recognizes the need to move from alienation to reconciliation. In a ``Letter From A Birmingham Jail,'' Dr. King expressed his hope for national reconciliation. I too hope ``that the dark clouds of [misconceptions] will soon pass away and the deep fog of misunderstanding will be lifted from our fear-drenched communities and in some not too distant tomorrow the radiant stars of love and brotherhood will shine over our great nation with all their scintillating beauty.'' I urge all of my colleagues to support this much needed measure and begin to foster reconciliation throughout our country in order for us to once again be ``one nation under God.''

    Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing legislation that will expand capacity and increase competition within the domestic transportation system. This legislation, which will allow foreign built ships to transport bulk commodities, forest products, and livestock between U.S. ports, will help to expand the overall capacity by allowing ship operators to expand their fleets through obtaining affordable ships. 
   Currently, Section 27 of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, commonly referred to as the Jones Act, requires that merchandise being transported on water between U.S. ports travel on U.S. built, U.S. flagged, and U.S. citizen owned vessels that are documented by the Coast Guard for such carriage. The bill I am introducing today, The Freedom to Transport Act of 1999, does not seek to repeal the Jones Act. Rather, it provides very targeted modification--to allow foreign built ships to carry bulk cargo in domestic trade. These ships would have to register in the United States and comply with all U.S. laws, including Jones Act ownership and crewing requirements. 
   The current law makes it infeasible for domestic coastwise shipments of agricultural commodities to occur on bulk shipping vessels. This is largely because the cost of purchasing a ship in the United States is as much as three times higher than it can be obtained on the world market. As a result, there has been little capital infusion into the domestic Jones Act fleet for many years. As a consequence, the cost of transport on bulk Jones Act vessels, if they are available at all, is prohibitively high. 
   Agriculture is a pillar to the Kansas economy, and an efficient transportation is critical to American agriculture. Laws that raise the cost of conducting business and impede efficient means for transporting product have a negative impact on farmers around the country, including Kansas. Moreover, the cost of transporting  goods is always a proportionately high cost of the delivered product for bulk commodities, but especially now as grain prices are at the lowest levels seen in years. Having means to the most cost-effective and efficient means for transporting product is now, more than ever, critical to American farmers. 
   If ocean transportation between U.S. ports were more efficient, more product might be delivered to its destination by ocean rather than by rail. For example, the poultry and pork producers in the grain deficit southeastern United States could bring in grain by ocean through the Great Lakes rather than by across the country by railroad. Since little of this type of trade currently occurs, this could have the effect of increasing the overall capacity of the domestic transportation 
   infrastructure. That would make more railcars available for transport in places like Kansas, particularly during the harvest season when there is often a shortage of available cars. Furthermore, more efficient coastwise transportation would bring down prices for trade to Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Alaska, which oftentimes find it less expensive to purchase products from other countries than to pay the inflated costs of shipping from the mainland U.S. 
   I am aware that the maritime industry has supported the Jones Act as a protection of domestic industry for many years, and resists any change to the current law. However, despite the ``protective'' nature of the Jones Act, it has protected very little. In the last 50 years the merchant marine has lost 40,000 jobs and over 60 shipyards have closed since 1987. In my view this legislation would not only benefit the customers of transportation services, but would also inject new life into an industry that has missed out on the unprecedented growth that the rest of the economy has enjoyed in the last generation. I want to work with the maritime industry to address their concerns and look forward to their eventual support of this legislation, which I envision will help them as much as it will help agricultural shippers. 
   I would like to point out that the legislation as introduced enjoys broad support not only in the agriculture industry, but also among many industries that ship bulk commodities--including oil, coal, clay, and steel. Additionally, those engaged in commerce with the non-contiguous U.S. are supportive, including the Puerto Rico Manufacturers Association, the Hawaii Shippers Council, and the Alaska Jones Act Reform Coalition. Finally, the National Taxpayers Union and Americans for Tax Reform support this as a measure that would save consumers over $14 billion annually. 
   A healthy maritime industry increases competitiveness, lowers costs, and improves service for customers of transportation. It creates jobs in the U.S. not only for the people who crew the ships, but for those who repair them, who own them, and who are employed by industries who buy transportation services. It is a win-win-win-win proposal. 
   I hope my colleagues will join me in reducing stifling government regulation and support this important bill.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, this is a discussion we have been having within the country and we now need to have in the Senate. We have four provisions in the amendment. They are, basically, things that we can address in the Senate about the culture of violence that has enveloped the country and has taken us to the point where so many people have so many fears of what has taken place, and we see some of this acted out. 
   This is not a panacea amendment. It will not solve all our problems, but I think it is a positive step in the right direction. It has bipartisan support, and I am hopeful we can get broad support throughout the Senate so that these amendments will become law. Let me go through each of them. 
   The amendment will provide, first, a limited antitrust exemption to the entertainment industry enabling the industry to develop and disseminate voluntary guidelines for television programming, movies, video games, Internet content and music. 
   What we are seeking is an antitrust exemption so that the industry can enter into its own voluntary code of conduct, the likes of which the television industry used to have and then left after there was some feeling that this was potentially an antitrust violation. 
   We want to give them an antitrust exemption so they can set a code of conduct, a floor below which they will not go in the race to the bottom for ever more violent, ever more explicit, ever more troubling content. We want to provide that for television, movies, video game producers, Internet content, and music. 
   These voluntary guidelines will be used to alleviate some of the negative impact of violent sexual content and other subjects inappropriate for children that are so pervasive throughout the television shows, movies, video games, Internet content, and music produced today by the industry. 
   This amendment does not--does not--require the entertainment industry to develop or disseminate such guidelines, nor does it provide the Federal Government with any additional authority to regulate TV programming, movies, video games, Internet content, or music. Members can support this and know what this amendment does not do. 
   The amendment does enable the entertainment industry to establish voluntary guidelines. 
   I believe this is an appropriate way for us to encourage the industry to reconsider their entertainment products with an eye toward their corporate responsibility. 
   My amendment would simply make clear that the entertainment industry would not be subject to antitrust scrutiny if its members create such guidelines. This amendment does not infringe upon the first amendment rights of the entertainment industry. It would provide us with the opportunity to give the industry the tools that are necessary to articulate what their standards are and to inform parents what they can expect from the industry. 
   Why do we need a code of conduct? I think there are several very important reasons why. 
   First, our popular culture exerts an enormous influence on our young children and on our entire society. What we see, hear, and experience helps shape how we think, how we feel, and how we act. This is particularly true for children. All too often, what kids see in movies or on television, what they hear in music, and what they experience in the games they play actually desensitizes them and debases rather than uplifts. 
   Given that entertainment companies wield such enormous power in this country, it is only right that parents and consumers should know what their standards are and how they will use their media. This code of conduct will call on entertainment executives to define those standards, what levels they would not sink below, and what ideals they intend to uphold. I think the public has a right to know that as well. 
   Second, establishing a code of conduct not only informs parents, it helps hold the entertainment industries accountable. Parents will have a written code by which to judge television, movies, music, and games and be empowered to demand that companies live up to their code. 
   Third, a code of conduct says that entertainment companies do bear some corporate responsibility for the impact of the entertainment that they peddle. For too long, entertainment executives have insisted--in the face of mountains of evidence to the contrary--that the violence and sexual activity they depict had no impact, and that therefore they had no responsibility. A code of conduct recognizes that these companies wield enormous power and must therefore bear a corporate responsibility to the public at large. 
   There are some who defend the extreme violence and sexual activity in some movies, television shows, or music lyrics by claiming they are merely reflections of the reality of life, that they hold a mirror to society. But it is not a mirror; it is a mirage. The world of television and movies is--thank goodness --far more violent, conflicted and sexually explicit than the life of the average American. There are far more Amish people in the United States than there are serial murderers. There are more pastors than prostitutes. But you would never know that from watching television. 
   Enabling the entertainment industry to develop and enter into a code of conduct is not a panacea. It will not, by itself, put an end to all objectionable content, but it will be an important first step in encouraging the industry to reconsider the influence--for good or ill--of its products, its internal standards, and its corporate responsibility. 
   It will provide parents and consumers with information, and enable them to hold entertainment companies responsible for their product, and it will further an important national 
   dialogue about what our duties to our children are and the role we play in determining whether we live in a culture that glorifies death, carnage and violence, or in a civil society. 
   We also have other provisions that are in this amendment beyond just the code of conduct, the voluntary code of conduct. This amendment would also require the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice to conduct a joint study of the marketing practices of the motion picture industry, recording industry, and video game industry. 
   The amendment requires the FTC and the DOJ examine the extent to which the entertainment industry targets--targets--the marketing of violent, sexually explicit or other material unsuitable to minors, including whether such content is advertised in media outlets in which minors comprise a substantial percentage of the audience. We want to know, are these entertainment companies actually marketing violence to minors? Are they lacing more violence in their products to get more sales to minors? 
   The effectiveness of voluntary industry ratings in limiting access of minors to content that is unsuitable is something else that we want studied as well. Further, we want to study the extent to which those who engage in the sale or rental of entertainment products abide by voluntary industry ratings or labeling systems. We want to know whether mechanisms or procedures are necessary to ensure the effective enforcement of voluntary ratings or labeling systems. 
   We need to know the extent to which the entertainment industry encourages the enforcement of their voluntary ratings and labeling systems. And we need to know whether any of the entertainment industry's marketing practices violate Federal law. 
   Recently, I held a hearing at which Senator LIEBERMAN and Senator HATCH testified regarding the marketing of violence to our children, and whether violence is used to market products. There is a strong suspicion that, indeed, it occurs. 
   I would like to draw the attention to the Senate to some of the advertisements of products to children. These are particularly of video games. 
   This one that I am showing you now is an advertisement in a magazine for a video game rated for teens. This is rated for teenagers. This is the advertisement: ``Deploy. Destroy. Then relax over a cold one.'' It sure is laced with violence and uses violence to market a product to teens. 
   Here is one, a popular video game, a video game called Carmageddon. I have shown this to the Senate before. Rigormotorist. It is about killing people in a car-driving video game. 
   There is another video game that we have shown to the Senate before. It is  rated for teens. You can see the symbol there: ``Destroying your enemies is not enough. You must devour their souls.'' Clear use of violence and other imagery with that as well. 
   There is in the amendment an NIH study. There have been literally hundreds of studies, some would estimate even more, conducted on the impact of television on our attitudes, thoughts, psychological well-being, behavior, development, level of aggression, and predisposition toward violence. The more we study it, the clearer the link we have of the consumption of violent entertainment and increased 
   aggression, fear, anger, emotional difficulties, even predisposition towards violence. 
   However, there have been very few studies done on the impact of music and video games on young people. We need to know more. The other point of this amendment is to study that connection. By some estimates, the average teen listens to music around 4 hours a day. Between 7th and 12th grades, teens will spend around 10,500 hours listening to music. Listen to that again. Between the 7th and 12th grades, they are going to listen, the average teen, to around 10,000 hours of music. That is more time than they will spend in school. 
   Similarly, the popularity of video games is rapidly increasing among young people. One study, conducted by Strategy Records Research, found that 64 percent of young people played these games on a regular basis. Clearly, young people spend a huge amount of time focused on these kinds of entertainment. 
   It stands to reason that music and games have some sort of impact on young people, just as it stands to reason that what we see, hear and experience has some impact on our thoughts and attitudes and, thus, our decisions and our behavior. Determining what this impact is, is clearly in the public interest. 
   This amendment, sponsored by myself, Senator HATCH, Senator LIEBERMAN, and Senator ABRAHAM, provides for a study to determine that impact. We need to know more, and we need to start now. 
   The first step towards addressing problems is to accurately define them. And for that, we need all the available information. This amendment is an important start in that direction. 
   I point out something that I hope is becoming more familiar to Members of the Senate and to the country, the violence that is in some of the music. We talked about video games. We have studied music and television. In music, here is a person who is pretty famous now, Marilyn Manson, with an album ``Anti-Christ Superstar.'' You can look at all the words pointing towards ``Tomorrow's turned up dead.'' ``You can kill yourself now.'' Glorification of suicide and violence. 
   Here is another record out of it. ``Anti-cop, Anti-fun.'' I am not going to read any of that. Here is another top record from Master P, ``Come and Get Some.'' 
   ``I got friends running out the blanking crack house.'' 
   You can go down through this and see the violent, in many cases, very hateful and misogynistic, some racist terminology. We need to know what is the impact on a young mind that is consuming, in many cases, on the average of 4 hours of this a day. That is the intent of this study to ask that those things be looked at. 
   We think the evidence is clearly growing. We need to do something about what has happened to our culture. We are asking in this set of amendments, one, for an antitrust exemption for a voluntary code of conduct, for enforcement of industry rating systems, for a study on the marketing of violence to children, and for an NIH study of violent entertainment, particularly video games and music, and its impact on children. 
   We have had terrible, unthinkable tragedies that have happened to our children in this country. We know there is a link between the violence and the action. Both the American Medical Association and the American Association of Pediatrics have warned against exposing children to violent entertainment. 
   One 1996 American Medical Association study conducted concluded this: ``The link between media violence and real life violence has been proven by science time and time again.'' 
   Another AMA study concluded that ``exposure to violence in entertainment increases aggressive behavior and contributes to Americans' sense that they live in a mean society.'' 
   Those are pretty clear points of view. 
   Mr. President, we need to do something. These are modest steps. They will not, in and of themselves, change the society or change the culture, but they are appropriate steps. They can continue our national debate. I think they can help focus us on moving away from this culture of violence, this culture of death, towards more of a culture of peace and a culture of life that clearly we need to provide to our children. 
   I note that there are a number of people who wish to speak on this amendment. I recognize first the chairman of the committee, who wanted to address this subject, Senator HATCH, and then Senator LIEBERMAN has been on the floor to speak as well. I yield to Senator HATCH on this amendment.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, if I could respond to my colleague, I appreciate her bringing this up. It would have been nice, maybe, to have caught it at a little earlier time. 
   The amendment itself is directed at a particular facet. I think we are going to have a number of different amendments that are going to affect the gun industry. 
   We do not have an amendment here on marketing for the knife industry either. There are other places, I suppose, we could look at marketing issues as well, and perhaps should. 
   This is particularly directed at a certain sector. I hope my colleague will bring this up at another time with another amendment. I am afraid I could not accept it at this point in time because I have too many cosponsors on this amendment and I would have to go around to those cosponsors and ask them. 
   I think the Senator brings up a good point. I think this is a fair item to look at. It has been studied. There have been several studies, I am informed, on this very point she is raising. It might be good to look at some of those. The things we are trying to study here have not been studied before. That is why we particularly look at that set of points, because we have not. It is tied into a particular industry area.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. I would note, I think we should look at these prior studies that have been done on this particular issue. I think it would be wise as well to look at those. I appreciate my colleague raising this. We have a series of amendments that are bipartisan. We have a series of cosponsors on this amendment. It is an area on which we have held a number of hearings. That is what we seek to have addressed here. 
   If she seeks to add it into another, or bring it up as a separate amendment, I think that would be a good thing to do. I am certainly not opposed. But on this, at this point in time, we have a number of cosponsors. I think we are up to eight cosponsors, bipartisan, on this. I would need to go to all of them and ask all of them to add this particular amendment. It is out of the flow of what we are trying to do with this amendment. We have announced this. I have been working with a number of people on a bipartisan basis. I think we need to stay with that at this time.

I just did not want to do that without having a chance for other people to look at it and have their point of view. I have no objection to this.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, as the vote nears on the amendment that I have proposed, along with the chairman and Senator LIEBERMAN and a  number of others--and I will be asking for a recorded vote--I thank them for their work on this issue. The chairman has done tireless work in trying to do things to clean up the culture, and also in this juvenile justice bill to address issues here which I think are critically important. Senator MCCAIN, with his leadership on the Commerce Committee, has elevated the issues, as well as Senator LIEBERMAN in his work, and Senator SESSIONS as well. 
   I also note the addition of Senator KENT CONRAD as an original cosponsor of this amendment, and I appreciate all of his support. 
   There has been much discussion today about the causes and cures of youth violence. As I have noted before, I do not believe my amendment--this amendment--is a panacea for all that ails us, but it is a modest and necessary first step towards encouraging a sense of corporate responsibility among some of the most powerful corporations in the world--corporations with incredible access to the minds of young people--and towards gaining a better understanding of the impact of cultural influences on youth violence. 
   I firmly believe that youth violence is not merely, or even primarily, a public policy problem; it is a cultural and a moral problem. 
   We live in a society, unfortunately, that glorifies violence. Popular culture is awash in violence. 
   It is glorified in gangsta rap songs, glamorized in movies with vigilante heroes, and simulated in numerous video games. Violence, carnage, destruction and death is presented not as a horror but as entertainment for our young people--young people whose minds, hearts, moral sense, manners, behavior, convictions, and conscience are still being developed. 
   Recently, the Pope denounced what he called a ``culture of death,'' a culture that rewards the producers of violent entertainment with lucrative contracts and critical acclaim, celebrates the casual cruelty and consequence-free violence depicted in movies and music, that markets the simulation of mass murder in games that were sold to children. His remarks should give us much to think about. This is not something we can fix with legislation, but it should be raised and discussed and seriously considered, not only on the floor of the Senate, but in homes, studios, and corporate boardrooms across America. 
   Nothing in this amendment curtails freedom of expression in any way. It does not restrict the entertainment industry in any way. Rather, it gives entertainment companies more freedom, enabling--not requiring but enabling--them to enter into a voluntary code of conduct. Such a code would spell out what the company standards are, what products they would be putting forward, and would set a line that the industry would say below this we will not go, and say that to the public. 
   This amendment also provides for further studies on the impact and marketing of violent entertainment. We need to know more, and we need to start now. The first step towards addressing problems is to accurately define them. 
   Mr. President, I say, in conclusion on this amendment, we are here today saying that it is time to address this. It is time for us to step forward and be serious about it. It is time for us to renew the culture in America. This amendment is a first step.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks concerning Senate Amendment 308 to S. 900, the Financial Services Modernization bill. Unfortunately, I was unable to vote on this amendment because I was out in Wichita with Vice President GORE and FEMA director James Lee Witt surveying the enormous damage that was caused by the tragic tornadoes that passed through Kansas on Monday. These fatal tornadoes that swept through the Wichita area on Monday caused 5 Kansans to lose their lives and injured more than 70 people. More than 500 homes have been damaged or destroyed, leaving many people homeless and without power. In the town of Haysville, 27 businesses have been wiped out, virtually eliminating the business district of this Wichita suburb. I am pleased that federal relief for the Wichita area is on the way and I will continue to assist federal, state, and local authorities as they help the people of Wichita recover from this natural disaster. 
   I support Senate Amendment 308 and would have voted for it if I had been present. This amendment was passed in the Senate by a vote of 95-2 and I believe that it will strengthen an already strong financial modernization bill. The Financing Corporation bonds (FICO) provision in the Financial Modernization bill would require Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF) institutions, or thrifts, to pay premiums at a rate five times higher than that paid by banks in the Bank Insurance Fund (BIF) for three more years before merging both funds. Under the Funds Act of 1996, these funds were supposed to merge on January 1, 2000 and all FDIC institutions were to pay an equal amount. This amendment would strike the FICO provisions in S. 900 and equalize the deposit insurance premiums of bank and thrift institutions. 
   I hope we now can move forward with the passage of the Financial Services Modernization bill. S. 900 would permit banking, securities, and insurance companies to exist within a single corporate structure. This could lead to greater competition and more innovative and consumer-responsive services. Competition would not only benefit consumers, but will help America's employers by making it easier and cheaper for them to raise the capital they need for growth. 
   I am especially pleased that S. 900 would modernize the Federal Home Loan Bank System (FHLB) by banks. Under S. 900, the FHLB System would be easily accessible as an important source of liquidity for community lenders and would enable community banks to post different types of collateral for various kinds of lending. 
   Community banks are finding it increasingly tough to meet deposit and withdrawal demands as customers shift their deposits into higher-yielding investments like mutual funds. With less liquidity, there isn't as much money available for lending as the community demands. A reduction in community lending will hurt the economies of these small communities. This bill will facilitate more small business, agriculture, rural development, and low-income community development lending in rural communities.

    Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize an outstanding educator from Kansas. Carol Strickland was selected as the Kansas Teacher of the Year for 1999. It is hard to overestimate the importance of caring and dedicated teachers such as Carol. Teachers invest their time, talent and knowledge into our nation's students, thereby shaping the minds of our future leaders. 
   It gives me great pleasure to acknowledge Carol's extraordinary work in education. I congratulate Carol and wish her continued success.

    Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the fifth grade class at Christ the King Catholic School in Wichita, Kansas. On May 6, 1999, these students will attend the Drug Resistance Education (D.A.R.E.) Program's graduation ceremony. 
   These students, under the guidance of Officer John Crane and their teacher Ms. Sylvia Eckberg, completed the D.A.R.E. program's 17 week course. At a time when our students are bombarded daily with temptations and harmful messages, it is refreshing to know that there are many students willing to serve as role models for others by leading drug free lives. 
   Unfortunately, there are many young people in our country addicted to illegal drugs. Programs such as the Safe and Drug Free School program and D.A.R.E. help to encourage students to stay off drugs. However, this is not enough. In order to win the battle over illegal drug use, it will take courageous students, such as this fifth grade class, to make the commitment to live drug free lives despite pressure from other individuals. 
   Therefore, I am proud to recognize the students of Ms. Eckberg's class at Christ the King Catholic School for their commitment to living drug free and serving as role models for young people in Kansas and throughout the nation.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, the State of Kansas was also hit by the same system that hit Oklahoma which caused so much tragedy and damage. I would like to speak for a few minutes on that. 
   We had a number of families that had homes destroyed. We had five people killed in Kansas, hundreds were injured, and thousands of people lost their homes and businesses. I know they are in the hearts and minds of all Americans today, and we will stand ready to assist in that in any way we can. 
   The devastation that these tornadoes left in their paths is just shocking. 
   I want to show you a picture of the aftermath. This was actually taken of the damage that took place in Moore, OK. You can just see the devastating power that is in one of these systems that can rise up so fast and cause so much destruction. In Wichita, the trail of destruction was 15 miles long and 5 
   miles wide. 
   As I mentioned previously, five Kansans lost their lives, and more than 70 people were injured from the fatal twisters. 
   More than 500 homes have been damaged or destroyed, leaving many people homeless. 
   I have the second picture that I wanted to show people, a view of what has taken place. This is an aerial view of the Lake Shore Trailer Park in South Wichita. You can see where the path of the tornado was, where it was the most intense going through with just absolute destruction in the wake of that path of where it went through. 
   More than 50,000 people have been left without power. 
   Sedgwick County, KS, where Wichita is located, has reported that over 1,100 structures were destroyed, and more than 7,100 structures were damaged. 
   In the town of Haysville, right next to Wichita, 27 businesses have been wiped out, and virtually eliminating the business district of this Wichita suburb. 
   The father of one of my staffers--the person who is actually my scheduler--is the principal of Chisolm Life Skills Center in Wichita. His entire school was demolished by this tornado. 
   We are very proud of the rapid response of people who have reached out to help us through this terrible tragedy--the State and local authorities in Kansas, the rescue personnel, the Kansas National Guard, FEMA, and citizens of the Wichita area. They have really reached out in that typical Midwestern tradition of helping others when they are having difficulty. 
   I am also pleased to report that the President has responded quickly to the situation in both Kansas and Oklahoma by ordering Federal relief to those counties hit by these devastating tornadoes. The American Red Cross and the Salvation Army have provided 800 numbers for those wishing to help victims of these disasters. 
   I have pictures of a couple of victims. This apartment complex was destroyed in the wake of the path of the tornado. This is a picture of Suzie Dooley and her daughter, Sarah, who is 13, and their family dog, Wilma, trying to gather themselves after losing their mobile home near 55th Street, South, in Wichita. Their faces show the destruction they have been through, but also the hope and thanks they are alive and were not injured in the process. 
   The Red Cross and Salvation Army are offering shelter for people in Wichita who need help. The Red Cross has an 800 number, 800-HELP-NOW, to contact to provide help. We can provide a local phone number. They are on the Internet at www.DisasterRelief.org. Funds can be sent to the American Red Cross in Wichita. The Salvation Army has an 800 number as well. 
   I know the nature of Kansans and Americans is to help one another in a time of need. I will work with Federal and State authorities to provide fast and effective relief to families and communities harmed by this natural disaster. 
   I know I speak for my Senate colleague, my fellow Senator from Kansas, Senator PAT ROBERTS, in saying we will continue to keep the victims and their families in our actions, thoughts, and prayers as we hope much of the rest of the country will in this very difficult time. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, thank you very much for allowing me to speak tonight. I recognize my distinguished colleague from Arizona for all he has done on this issue but, more than that, for what he has given to his country. He chairs the Commerce Committee, which I serve on with him, but I have enormous respect for what he has already given to his Nation, the sacrifice where he put his life on the line in a previous war. Actions speak louder than words, and he spoke with his actions many times. I am enormously proud to know and be associated with him in this body. 
   Mr. President, the situation in Kosovo is clearly a very serious one deserving of our deliberation and vigorous debate. To this point in time, though, the administration, for my satisfaction, has certainly not provided the Members of the full Senate body with the information needed to make an informed decision on this matter. Therefore, I will vote to table the resolution. 
   One month ago, I wrote to the President asking that he respond to certain fundamental questions regarding the objectives and the implementation of the NATO mission in Kosovo. To date, I have not received a response to those questions. 
   What is the objective, I put forward? They have been responding and defining some of that as we have gone along, but more specifically, how do we define success? Is there a coherent and achievable plan of action in place? What price would we pay for this in terms of potential loss of lives? What about the monetary cost? Is escalation in the true national interest of the United States? Those simple, basic questions that I have put forward have not been answered. 
   Not until we understand the objective of NATO and how that objective will be attained can we make an informed determination with respect to S.J. Res. 20. The administration must provide the answers to these questions, with clarity, with satisfaction, and to the satisfaction of all Members of the Senate. Until that happens, I cannot give my support to the administration in this broad, open resolution. 
   At such time that it is shown how granting the President the authority to use all necessary force and other means will bring us to a resolution more quickly, or at less expense or other means, then we would be able to consider this proposal in some context. 
   I note, Mr. President, that I fully support our troops. I appreciate the sacrifices that they are being asked to make to stop Milosevic and the atrocities he has perpetrated against the people of Kosovo. It was several weeks ago that I was in Wichita at the McConnell Air Base meeting with some of the troops and their families before they were shipping off. You could see in their eyes their willingness, their commitment to see this action on through. They asked a number of the same questions that I continue to ask of the President, that I continue not to get satisfactory answers. 
   Until those are answered, I cannot give my support to this type of authority. It is appreciation for these troops that makes it impossible for me to support this resolution, until we understand the full plan. Once we know it, then we can debate its merits and determine how best to support the President and our troops. Without that and in clarity of what that plan is, we are making a decision in a vacuum. The situation merits more attention than that. 
   Again, I note, as I did at the outset, my enormous respect for my colleague from Arizona who has put forward this resolution and his wisdom. His support of this makes me give much more pause to my statement. But these questions have not been answered to my satisfaction. While I respect that and I respect enormously the Senator from Arizona, I cannot in good conscience vote for this resolution at this time. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to address the body today on another aspect of our culture. I have spoken several times this week about different aspects of our culture in areas that I think need desperate reform, which certainly has been highlighted by what took place in Colorado. 
   Today, I want to speak of video games. I have examples to show people in this body and I hope around the country of what is being marketed to our children, what is being put out there, what they are receiving. 
   I have kids who are in this age range. My oldest daughter is 12, my son is 11, and my youngest daughter is 9. They have some exposure to some of these notions. I rise to address one aspect of our society that I think demands attention, particularly in the wake of these tragic events. 
   Yesterday, I addressed the rise in popularity of music with hyperviolent, often misogynistic lyrics. More and more kids are tuning in to music which glorifies and glamorizes violence and viciousness. As the popularity and profitability of music depicting murder, torture, and rape grows, the music industry is making a killing off our kids. 
   The problem is not unique to the music industry. It is found in many entertainment fields. This coming Tuesday, we will hold a hearing in the Commerce Committee to examine marketing violence. 
   Today, I will talk about another equally troubling trend in pop entertainment, the rising popularity of gory, graphic video games. The video game industry has received far less attention than television or movies but is among the fastest growing entertainment media in the country. 
   Last year, the video game industry was worth more than $6 billion. Its profitability is climbing steadily and rapidly. The rise in profitability is fueled by the rise in popularity of these games. Video games are being played more often by more people and particularly more kids. 
   Even industry executives acknowledge that video games are a growing part of the cultural landscape. I want to put this in the context of the cultural landscape. One executive of the industry went so far as to assert in a recent Wall Street Journal article that:  
   Games are a primary vehicle for popular culture.  
   These games are. 
   As a father with a young son who plays a lot of video games, I can tell you, they get to spend more time with him a lot of times than anybody else does, as he plays the video games. 
   Although many video games are nonviolent, a growing number of companies are producing and promoting unimaginable gory, interactive video games. They are gory and they are interactive.  
   Consider these few examples. ``Carmaggedon'' is a highly popular video game put out by Interplay, which debuted a little 
   over a year ago. The purpose of the game is for the player, who controls a race car, to mow down as many pedestrians as he possibly can. That is the purpose of the game, ``Carmaggedon.'' You are in the car mowing down people. Points are awarded for each pedestrian killed, and the more gruesome, the better. 
   Unlike some games where the player aims to kill villains, such as monsters or aliens, the targets in this game are innocent people. The game player is no longer cast in the role of vigilante but simply a cold-blooded killer. 
   The video game ``Quake,'' put out by Midway Games and ID Software, the same companies as producers of ``Doom,'' consists of a lone gunman confronting a variety of monsters. For every kill, he gets points. As he advances in the game, the weapons he uses grow more powerful and more gory. He trades in a shotgun for an automatic, and later he gets to use a chain saw on his enemies. The more skilled the player, the gorier the weapons he gets to use. Bloodshed is his reward. ``Quake'' sold more than 1.7 million copies its first year out. 
   Here are some other examples of popular games. I want to show you some of these ads, because I think they are particularly troubling in the advertisement that they use. These are ads that were all taken from a recent gaming magazine, again, aimed at a teenage audience. These are generally aimed at people under the age of 18. And I can see some of our interns and pages up front. I rather imagine they will recognize some of this advertising that I am going to show. 
   But I want you to look at some. Here is ``Quake.'' Just look how this is advertised, if you would, Mr. President.  
   Blowing your friends to pieces with a rocket launcher is only the beginning .......  
   Sound familiar?  
   Whether you are in search of the ultimate online frag-fest or looking for the latest Quake news, information player ranks, or skins--the Imagine Games Network has it all.  
   It talks about ``[b]lowing your friends to pieces with a rocket launcher is only the beginning......'' Unfortunately, does that sound like a news headline? 
   Let's look at the next one we have up here. And I want to point out, before I get to the real graphics of it, it is rated 14. So there is actually a rating system on video games. So this one is supposed to be purchased by people under the age of 18. It is rated to do so. 
   Listen to the title of this one. Look at how this one is advertised at the very top. ``Kill Your Friends Guilt Free'' is the advertising. ``Kill Your Friends Guilt Free.''  
   If you consider yourself a fighter kind of surg, Guilty Gear comes highly recommended. No true fan can be--  
   This is online here. What else do we have of this one? ``Fighting games.'' You can see the rest of it, and the gory details. It is rated for teens. This is rated for kids under the age of 18. 
   ``Kill Your Friends Guilt Free.'' Does that sound horrible? 
   This is an actual game screen, really. This is of a very popular game.  
   It is built on the revolutionary Quake II engine kingpin. Life of crime. Includes a multiple player gang bang deathmatch for up to 16 thugs.  
   I think you can see the blood splattering here at the side in which different people are blown away. 
   One other point I want to make about this is that we will have people testify at our hearing about the desensitization that this does to people to allow and even empower them to do things to people that are not even imaginable, but after you spend so much time looking at and studying the screen and shooting at and blowing up people, the desensitization process happens. 
   We will have an expert witness testifying that that allows you to do things that you would otherwise have an internal mechanism in you saying, no, you cannot do that; no, you do not do that. But after hour after hour of the blood and guts, it has a desensitization to it. 
   These are advertisements. 
   Look at this one. Look at this one: ``Deploy. Destroy. Then relax over a cold one.'' 
   ``Deploy. Destroy.'' And ``[t]hen relax over a cold one.'' 
   On this one you can see the little teen label. This is marketed and this is for teens to purchase. They actually are for teens to purchase. 
   Can you really sit there and say that the consumption of this on and on and on does not have some impact on a young mind, on a young soul? 
   ``Deploy. Destroy. Then relax over a cold one.'' 
   Look at this one. This one goes further than even death.  
   Destroying your enemies isn't enough. *.*.* You must devour their souls [in this one]. Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver. As a result, stalk the shadows of Nosgoth, hunting your vampire brethren. Impale them with spears, incite them with torches, down them in water. No matter how you must destroy them, you must feed on their souls to sustain your quest, the ruin of your creator, Kain. 
   [Y]ou must feed on their souls to sustain your quest, the ruin of your creator, Kain. Dark Gothic story, shift real time between material and special planes. Morph.  
   Those are being marketed to our kids. 
   The video game industry has not only deemed some of these acceptable for teens and parental consent unnecessary, but they market them to teens as well. 
   This may seem over the top, but they are among the more popular games around. One survey of 900 fourth to eighth graders found that almost half of the children said their favorite electronic games involved violence. 
   Columnist John Leo put it this way:  
   We are now a society in which the chief form of play for millions of youngsters is making large numbers of people die. Hurting and maiming others is the central fun activity in video games played so addictively by the young. Can it be that all this constant training in make-believe killing has no social effects?  
   One would think that some of these games are so violent that they are out on the fringe somewhere snubbed by respectable companies, cringing somewhere in the electronic redlight district. Not so. They are backed and distributed by some of the biggest names in the business.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I have some comments I will make today following what has happened in Colorado, the Columbine tragedy that occurred this last week which has caused all of us really to reflect on the causes and the cures. As we mourn the loss of so many precious young lives, we really have to ask ourselves, how did we get to this place? Why do so many young people with so much going for them in their lives have such despair and so much hate? 
   Obviously, there are no easy answers and certainly no silver bullets. There are many factors which led those two young men to don trench coats and kill, just as there were many factors that resulted in the shootings in Jonesboro, Paducah, Pearl, and Springfield, communities the names of which have become all too familiar to us via school tragedies where a child has killed other children. 
   But there are enough common factors that I believe we can start to pull together some ideas as to what is causing this and some solutions. One of the most obvious conclusions is this: The immersion of troubled kids in a violence-glorifying culture is a recipe for disaster. 
   Monday, I addressed this body on the need for a commission on cultural renewal. Today, I would like to address the importance of one of the most important elements that makes up our culture, and that is our music. In many ways the music industry is more influential than anything that happens here in Washington. Most people spend far more time listening to music than watching C-SPAN or reading the newspaper. They are more likely to recognize musicians than Senators--I guess maybe unless the Senators sing. And they spend more time thinking 
   about music than about government. 
   All of those can seem to be some fairly trite statements, but when you look at what we are putting out in the music and then ask that question, it takes on a different color. 
   Of course, no one spends more time listening to music than the young people. In fact, one recent study conducted by the Carnegie Foundation concluded that the average teenager listens to music around 4 hours a day--about 4 hours a day. In contrast, they spend less than an hour a day on homework or reading, less than 20 minutes a day talking with mom, and less than 5 minutes a day talking with dad. 
   If this study is true, there are thousands, perhaps even tens or hundreds of thousands, of teens who spend more time listening to the music of such artists as Marilyn Manson or Master P than mom or dad. 
   In fact, Marilyn Manson himself said this:  
   Music is such a powerful medium now. The kids don't even know who the President is,  but they know what's on TV. I think if anyone like Hitler or Mussolini were alive now, they'd have to be rock stars.  
   Over the past few years, I have grown increasingly concerned with the popularity of some lyrics, lyrics which glorify violence and devalue life. Some recent best selling albums have included graphic descriptions of murder, torture, and rape. Women are objectified, often in the most degrading ways. Songs such as Prodigy's ``Smack My B..... Up'' or ``Don't Trust a B.....'' by the group Mo' Thugs actively encourage animosity or even violence towards women. A few years ago, the alternative group ``Nine Inch Nails'' enjoyed critical and commercial success with their song ``Big Man With a Gun,'' which described forcing a woman into oral sex and shooting her in the head at point-blank range. 
   I brought along a few examples of the kind of music I am talking about. Each of the Marilyn Manson songs shown here are from his 1996 album ``Anti-Christ Superstar,'' an album which debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard charts. These are some of the song lyrics that you can look at. I want to point it out because it is about the culture of violence and the culture of death, and they may be unpleasant words for us to look at, but when these debut at No. 3 on the Billboard charts, when that song wraps itself around one's inside, when it wraps around a person's soul, it has an impact just as significant as when we might listen to John Philip Sousa's music and it makes us feel patriotic and uplifted or a love song makes us loving. Violent, hateful, misogynistic music encourages that in us as will violence come from hate music. 
   Look at this: 
   Marilyn Manson, ``Irresponsible Hate Anthem'' (Anti-Christ Superstar) on Nothing/Interscope Records I'm so all-American, I'd sell you suicide I am totalitarian, I've got abortions in my eyes I hate the hater, I'd rape the raper I am the animal who will not be himself F*** it 
 Hey victim, should I black your eyes again? Hey victim, you were the one who put the stick in my hand I am the ism, my hate's a prism Let's just kill everyone and let your god sort them out F*** it 
 Everybody's someone else's n**ger/I know you are so am I I wasn't born with enough middle fingers/I don't need to choose a side.  
   DMX, ``Get At Me Dog'' (It's Dark and Hell is Hot) on Def Jam Records/Polygram Well in the back with ya fag*** a** face down Lucky that you breathin but you dead from the waist down The f*** is on your mind?

   If these were some off-beat records that were out in a few isolated places, you would probably say, well, you know, that is the price you pay for freedom, for a free culture. But these are not. These are top-of-the-chart hits that are out there playing endlessly in too many cases and even being marketed to a very troubled youth's mind. 
   Are we really surprised, then, when some things happen that are pretty strange? That there seems to be so much violence and so much hatred out in this culture? Are we really that surprised? Should we be really that surprised? 
   I hope people are listening and I hope they are looking. 
   These are not obscure songs. They are immensely popular, and hugely profitable. They are backed by some of the largest, most prestigious corporations in our country and the world--Time-Warner, Seagrams/Universal, Sony, Polygram, Viacom, BMG, and Thorne-EMI. 
   I ask if any of the executives of these companies would allow their children to listen to this music? Would they? I hope not. Yet they are selling it and making millions. 
   Many of my colleagues may not be familiar with these lyrics. Until the past couple of years, I wasn't, either. But most kids are very familiar with them. They make up a vital part of the cultural ocean in which they swim. The messages of these songs are heard over and over, until they are, at the least, familiar, and at worst, internalized. 
   A little over a year ago, I chaired a hearing on the impact of violent music on young people. During this hearing, we heard a variety of witnesses testify on the effects of music lyrics that glorified violence, sexual torture, and suicide. We heard from the nation's experts on the subject. Their conclusion was unanimous: music helps shape our attitudes.  
   This is important. Studies indicate that the average teenager listens to music around four hours a day. It simply stands to reason that what we hear, and see, and experience cannot help but affect our attitudes and assumptions, and thus, our decisions and behavior. If it didn't, commercials wouldn't exist, and anyone who spent a dollar on advertising would be a fool. But advertising is a multi-billion dollar business. Why? Because it works. It creates an appetite for things we don't need, it affects the way we think, the things we want, and the things we buy. What we see and what we hear changes how we act. 
   Thousands of years ago, the philosopher Plato noted ``Musical training is a more potent instrument than any other, because rhythm and harmony find their way into the inward places of the soul, on which they mightily fasten.'' Can anybody listening to this today not readily pull up a song in their mind and listen to it right now? Because it wraps around their inner being. 
   Unfortunately, perhaps the last sector of society to acknowledge the importance and effects of music is the music industry. 
   In this hearing, I asked Hilary Rosen, the president of the Recording Industry Association of America, the trade organization of the music industry, the following questions. I asked, ``Who purchases Marilyn Manson albums? Do you know anything about the demographics of those who purchase these albums?'' She answered ``No.'' 
   I asked, ``Have you looked at the demographic profile of those who purchase shock rock or gangsta rap records? She answered ``No.'' Later in her testimony, she asserted that ``the purchasers of this [Marilyn Manson's ``Anti-Christ Superstar'' album] album 
   in retail stores are over the age of 17.'' 
   I thought--I would be happy to be wrong about this, but somehow, I doubt that the majority of Marilyn Manson fans are out of their teens. The appeal of this music appears to be the greatest to teenagers--the very group of people who are supposed to be protected from it. But they're not. 
   Let me be clear: I am opposed to censorship of music. I believe the first amendment ensures the widest possible latitude in allowing various forms of speech--including offensive, obnoxious speech. But the fact that lyrics which celebrate should be allowed does not mean that they should be given respectability. There are some forms of speech which should be thoroughly criticized and roundly stigmatized, even though they are allowed. Freedom of expression is not immunity from criticism. 
   What we honor says as much about our national character as what we allow. There is an old saying ``Tell me what you love, and I'll tell you what you are.'' A love of violence, murder, mayhem, destruction, debasement and pain, as reflected in the popularity of gory movies, violent music, a burgeoning porn industry, grotesque video games, and sleazy television is a cause for national concern. What we honor and esteem as a people both reflects and affects our culture. We grow to resemble what we honor, and we become less like what we disparage. 
   Glorifying violence in music is dangerous--Because a society that glorifies violence will grow more violent. When we refuse to criticize the gangsta rap songs that debase women, we send the message that treating women like chattel is not something to be upset about. Record companies that promote violent music implicitly push the idea that more people should listen to, purchase, and enjoy the sounds of slaughter. When MTV named Marilyn Manson the ``Best New Artist of the Year'' last year, they help him up as an example to be aspired to. Promoting violence as entertainment corrodes our nation from within. 
   This is not a new idea. Virtually all of the Founding Fathers believed--even assumed--that nations rise and fall based on what they honor and what they discourage. Samuel Adams stated ``A general dissolution of principles and manner will more surely overthrow the liberties of America than the whole force of a common enemy.'' 
   Next week, we will have a hearing to explore whether violence is actually marketed to children. We have invited the presidents and CEOs of the big entertainment conglomerates--Time-Warner, Viacom, BMG Sony, Sega, Nintendo, Hasbro. We hope they will come and help us begin a fruitful discussion on what can be done to protect our children from entertainment which glorifies and glamorizes violence. 
   Mr. President, I have gone on for some time, but I think this is critically important, particularly in light of what we experienced this past week that has shocked us as a nation and really caused us to ask why and what do we do to change. 
   I think it perhaps was best summarized in a speech given by the Most Rev. Charles Chaput who is the Archbishop of Denver. 
   Mr. President, he said this:  
   As time passes, we need to make sense of the Columbine killings. The media are already filled with ``sound bites'' of shock and disbelief; psychologists, sociologists, grief counselors and law enforcement officers--all with their theories and plans. God bless them for it. We certainly need help. Violence is now pervasive in American society--in our homes, our schools, on our streets, in our cars as we drive home from work, in the news media, in the rhythms and lyrics of our music, in our novels, films and video games. It is so prevalent that we have become largely unconscious of it. But, as we discover in places like the hallways of Columbine High, it is bitterly, urgently real. 
   The causes of this violence are many and complicated: racism, fears, selfishness. But in another, deeper sense, the cause is very simple: We're losing God, and in losing Him, we're losing ourselves. The complete contempt for human life shown by the young killers at Columbine is not an accident, or an anomaly, or a freak flaw in our social fabric. It's what we create when we live a contradiction ..... we can't market avarice and greed ..... and then hope that somehow our children will help build a culture of life.  
   He concludes by saying--and the title of his speech is, ``Ending the violence begins with our own conversion'':  
   In this Easter season and throughout the coming months, I ask you to join me in praying in a special way for the families who have been affected by the Columbine tragedy. But I also ask you to pray that each of us--including myself--will experience a deep conversion of heart toward love and non-violence in all of our relationships with others.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. It is time we address this. It is time we address it strongly. It is time we address it clearly and ask two questions: How did we get here, and how do we get out? This is not the culture we were raised in and this is not the culture we want our kids to be in, as one of our colleagues, Senator LIEBERMAN, put it. I hope we can start the change and renew our culture and start to do that by renewing ourselves. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, today the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 3:30 p.m. Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of S. 96, the Y2K bill. A cloture motion on that legislation was filed on Thursday, and by unanimous consent that vote will take place today at 5:30 p.m. Members are encouraged to come to the floor to debate this important legislation. 
   I thank my colleagues for their attention. 
   Mr. President, I wish to address the body today on another matter during morning business. It is about the situation that has taken place in Colorado.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I wish to address the Senate today on the subject of the violence in Littleton, CO. I note that over the weekend a number of funerals took place, and as I speak another funeral is occurring as a result of the shootings in Littleton, CO. I think it would be appropriate for us to observe a moment of silence for the victims of the shootings that took place.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank the Chair. 
   Certainly, all of our thoughts and prayers are with the people in Colorado, across this country and across the world, who have been touched by the terrible tragedies in the shootings. 
   We cannot ignore the shootings that took place in Littleton, CO. I think we really must say that this time we will address these problems that are in our culture. They are 
   here. We have a culture that glorifies violence and killing, where perverse things are put on television as normal. Ours is a culture that has far too much darkness in it. 
   Just listen to some of the words of the writers in various newspapers across this country when they have discussed today's culture. This was in last Thursday's Washington Post in the Style Section, mind you. Its headline: ``When Death Imitates Art.'' It says:  
   Before Teenagers Commit Violence, They Witness It in American Culture.  
   Here is how the writer starts:  
   In what used to be the dark corners of our culture, there is now a prime time cartoon with a neo-Nazi character, comics that traffic in bestiality, movies that leave teenagers gutted like game, fashion designers who peddle black leather masks and doomsday visions. It's all in the open now, mass produced, widely available. Even celebrated. On countless PCs, killing is a sport. And there's Marilyn Manson, a popular singer who named himself after a mass murderer and proclaims he is the Antichrist. 
   Film, television, music, dress, technology, games: They've become one giant playground filled with accessible evil, darker than ever before.  
   Listen to this:  
   Consider: Of the last 11 major movies released on video since April 6, seven of them have violent themes. Among them, ``Art Pupil,'' about a high school kid obsessed with Nazism; ``American History X'' about the rise and fall of a skinhead; and ``I Still Know What You Did Last Summer,'' a teen slasher sequel. 
   ``There is no question in my mind that film and society interrelate,'' said Douglas Brode, a professor of film at Syracuse University and author of 18 books on the movies. ``And not just films but music, video games, all of it. There is a connection. It may be tangential, it may be tight. Nobody knows for sure.''  
   And so caution and perspective are urged.  
   It is surely one of the great debates of this decade: Does the culture simply reflect the dark, decadent times in which we live or is society this way because the cultural proprietors have run amok.  
   Listen to this from the Wall Street Journal, written by Peggy Noonan, a columnist. This was in last Thursday's Wall Street Journal. She writes this:  
   What walked into Columbine High School Tuesday was the culture of death. This time  it wore black trench coats. Last time it was children's hunting gear. Next time it will be some other costume, but it will still be the culture of death. That is the Pope's phrase; it is how he describes the world we live in. 
   The boys who did the killing, the famous Trench Coat Mafia, inhaled too deep the ocean in which they swam. Think of it this way. Your child is an intelligent little fish. He swims in deep water. Waves of sound and sight, of thought and fact, come invisibly through that water, like radar; they go through him again and again, from this direction and that. The sound from the television is a wave, and the sound from the radio; the headlines on the newsstand, on the magazines, on the ad on the bus as it whizzes by--all are waves. The fish--your child--is bombarded and barely knows it. But the waves contain words like this, which I will limit to only one source, the news.  
   Then she goes through and lists:  
   ..... was found strangled and is believed to have been sexually molested.......  
   There are a number of headlines, and they finish this portion by saying:  
   This is the ocean in which our children swim. This is the sound of our culture. It comes from all parts of our culture and reaches all parts of our culture, and all the people in it, which is everybody.  
   Listen to this from the New York Times today:  
   By producing increasingly violent media, the entertainment industry has for decades engaged in a lucrative dance with the devil.  
   That was in the New York Times today. It goes on to describe a process that our young people are going through, that a former Army officer talked about being desensitization, conditioning of people, being able to do heinous violent acts that they are taking culture conditioning through a movie, music, the Internet that just constantly bombard them and it desensitizes them to the humanness surrounding them.  
   Dave Grossman, a former Army officer and professor at West Point and also the University of Arkansas, says that these are the same techniques that were used to great effect during the Vietnam War to increase the ``firing rate''--that is, the percentage of soldiers who would actually fire a weapon during an encounter from the 15 to 20 percent range in World War II to as much as 95 percent in Vietnam. 
   Grossman has written ``On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society,'' in which he discusses how conditioning techniques were used to teach Vietnam-bound soldiers.  
   And then it goes on and he says many of these same techniques are involved in our culture today. 
   Mr. President, we have got to address this. It is time to do something. 
   I think we in the Senate have to say we are not powerless to address this. We can fight back, and we must fight back. We know this is going on in the culture today. We know it is out there. We know what is happening. We know what happened in Columbine. We also know, most of us across the country, it is likely to happen again somewhere else, in some other good high school, in some other place where this never should happen, as it has happened in the past in Paducah, KY; Pearl, MS; other places; Jonesboro, AR; across this country. We can and we must fight back, and now is the time to do it. 
   I suggest two solutions. No. 1, anybody listening or watching, let's all pledge that we will change our culture, our individual culture we are involved in right now, what is it that is going on in our family, in our community, in our school, wherever we are within our culture that is part of this, and let's change it. We are not helpless to changing this. What is coming into your home right now? Do you have things coming into your home right now that are violent, that are of a nature with which you wouldn't agree, or over the Internet, magazines, video games, movies, television? We are not powerless to stop it coming into our homes. Let us all pledge to stop it. 
   I hope that many people across this country will start societies for cultural renewal within their communities where people can come together and say we are going to change the culture in our community; we are not going to wait on producers out of California; we are not going to wait on Washington to do this; we are going to change the culture here, now; we are going to bind together and we are going to say, what can we do in our community to reduce teen suicide, to reduce child abuse, to reduce out-of-wedlock births, to reduce the violence, the drug use, to reduce those sorts of things in our culture. 
   Let's not wait until it comes to us. Let's start binding together as people and forming societies to do this now. We can do it. If 10 people in any community of a limited size, say, of a quarter million, would come together and say, we are going to change the culture in our community, they could start this in their community and they could get it done. With passion, with prayer, with people of commitment, they could do it. It could happen. They could move forward. They can change their culture. We can each change our culture. Let us open our eyes and see what is happening. 
   The second thing I think we in the Senate need to do is create a special commission on cultural renewal. We need to address this topic. We in the Senate should have a high-level commission of people from multiple walks of life searching for the answers to two questions: One, what made this culture the way it is? How did we get to this point we are today? What made us this way? Second, and more important, how do we change it? 
   I will be hosting a hearing on May 4, asking about the marketing of violence, in the Commerce Committee. There we are going to be asking people to address the point about the marketing of violence in our society and how it is being used to sell various products and what we can do to stop it. 
   I want to be clear, too. We obviously have limits in government, and government is part of the culture, but it is not the total culture. Government is limited. This is much more about all of us joining together to say we can change these sorts of things. We want to highlight some problems such as what is taking place in the marketing of violence. Why are companies doing this? What is their mode of operation? How can we dissuade them from doing this? Because it has a profound effect throughout this culture, as the people in Littleton, CO, know all too well, as we know all the rest of the way across this Nation. 
   Cultures change, and we must determinedly change ours, not so much by laws as by changing our thinking about what we consume. We can do it. We must do it. We will do it. It is time we do it. 
   I am afraid people are getting to the point of wondering if we can. Yes, we can. As the culture moved in this direction, it can assuredly move away from it. But it is going to take a determined effort. It is going to take an effort not just of saying OK, Washington is going to solve it, or Hollywood is going to solve it, or New York is going to solve it. We each have to dig in and try to solve it in our own community, and we need to address it from here, too. 
   I will be pressing this on the leadership of the Senate, that we do have such a high-level special commission so we can get at these issues: How did we get to where we are? How do we get away from this? How do we solve it? And we can. 
   I thank the Chair, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Broadband Internet Regulatory Relief Act of 1999 on behalf of myself, Senator NICKLES, and Senator CRAIG. This bill is intended to speed up the deployment of broadband networks throughout the United States and to make residential high-speed Internet access a widely-available service. 
   Mr. President, the Internet has revolutionized the way we communicate, conduct business, shop, and learn. The Internet presents us with the opportunity to remove distance as an obstacle to employment and education. But while tens of millions of Americans now log onto the Internet every day, narrowband connections to the Internet make using the Net a slow and cumbersome process. 
   Broadband connections, on the other hand, provide ultra-fast access to the Internet. With a broadband connection, users may download and upload data from and to the Internet at substantially greater speeds than with a narrowband connection. From downloading full-motion video to uploading an architect's plans, broadband permits consumers to utilize many more applications that will increase the value of the Internet as a communications medium. 
   The technology to provide broadband connections to the Internet is a reality. Cable companies are deploying hybrid fiber-coax (HFC) networks that will enable cable modems to provide high-speed Internet access. In addition, telephone companies have discovered a way to provide high-speed Internet access over their copper-based telephone loops. With the addition of a digital switch in a telephone company's central office, a digital modem at a customer's premises, and the conditioning of a copper loop, consumers may obtain access to the Internet at more than ten time the speed of narrowband connections. 
   The most promising technology employed by telephone companies for residential high-speed Internet access is digital subscriber line (DSL) technology. The family of DSL services, especially asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) service, have the greatest potential to ensure that all consumers throughout the United States obtain high-speed Internet access. Cable service has penetration rates approaching telephone service in urban and densely-populated suburban areas. However, cable penetration is much lower in rural areas whereas the ubiquity of the telephone network makes telephone penetration rates close to one hundred percent even in rural areas. Thus, for many rural consumers, including those in Kansas, high-speed Internet access may only be available in the next several years through the telephone network. 
   As a result, Congress needs to ensure that high-speed Internet access is being made available over the public telephone network as rapidly as possible. While ADSL service is being rolled out in may urban and densely-populated suburban areas, most rural consumers do not have access to it. 
   I am introducing the Broadband Internet Regulatory Relief Act to ensure that high-speed Internet access is available to my rural constituents as soon as possible. To accomplish this goal, I am proposing to provide regulatory relief to telephone companies willing to deliver broadband connections to rural areas. My proposal has several components. 
   First, incumbent local exchange carriers that make seventy percent of their loops ready to support high-speed Internet access will not have to resell their advanced services to competitors and will not have to make the network elements used exclusively for the provision of advanced services available to competitors. Second, the prices for advanced services offered by incumbent local exchange carriers that face competition in the provision of such services will be deregulated. Third, where incumbent local exchange carriers are offering advanced services but do not face competition, the companies will receive pricing flexibility. Fourth, competitive local exchange carriers will not be required to resell their advanced services. 
   Mr. President, the ubiquity of our nation's telephone network presents us with a tremendous opportunity to deliver high-speed Internet access to our rural constituents at a pace comparable with the rate at which urban and suburban consumers will be offered such service. But to realize this goal, we must remove unnecessary regulation that has impeded the rapid deployment of broadband networks. Advanced services should not be regulated in the same manner as basic telephone service. Broadband services are an entirely new market, one in which no company can exercise market power. 
   In the absence of market power, the incumbents should not have to resell their advanced services or provide competitors with access to unbundled advanced service elements. And pricing regulations applied to telephone service should not be applied to advanced services. In addition, a competitive local exchange carrier willing to deploy the facilities necessary to provide broadband services should not be forced to resell its service. 
   Mr. President, I am confident that we can ensure the rapid deployment of broadband networks to rural areas. But to do so, we must be willing to provide companies with an incentive to build out their broadband networks in rural areas. The Broadband Internet Regulatory Relief Act would provide companies with such incentives, and I hope that my colleagues will support this crucial legislation.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to once again voice my support for the Education Flexibility Partnership Act or Ed-Flex. With the passage of this important legislation, we are taking an important first step towards reducing the intrusive regulations and bureaucratic red tape the federal government imposes on local schools in Kansas and around the nation. 
   First, I would like to note that Ed-Flex legislation did not make it to this point without the combined efforts of a great many talented people. I would like to commend and thank my colleagues Senators JEFFORDS and FRIST for their dedication to this legislation. I would also like to thank our colleagues in the House and all of the staff that have dedicated their time and ability to increasing flexibility for school districts. 
   Mr. President, Ed-Flex is a truly significant piece of legislation. For too long, the Federal Government, through the Department of Education, has prevented local schools and school districts from creating and implementing original programs custom designed to help their students learn. Ed-Flex provides local schools a chance to waive Federal regulations and statutes which prevent them from implementing these innovative programs. We are sending an important message to teachers, parents and local school boards that we recognize that they know best how to educate their students. 
   My home State of Kansas is one of the 12 States already covered under Ed-Flex, and which have benefited from the waivers. Schools from across Kansas have submitted 43 waiver requests, none of which have yet been rejected. To hear from the folks back home with whom I visited, students are much better served by flexibility than they are by rigid Federal mandates. 
   And Kansans aren't the only people who have supported our efforts to provide more flexibility. Both the Senate and House versions of this bill passed with broad bi-partisan support. All fifty governors have endorsed Ed-Flex. In fact, even President Clinton agrees that Ed-Flex will help to improve education in this country. 
   However, while Ed-Flex is an important first step towards relieving the pressure of Federal mandates on local schools, it is still just the first step. Recognizing that the Federal Government is not best suited to set the rules under which we educate our students, we must continue to reduce the role of the Federal mandates in local education. The demands on a school district in urban California are quite different from those on districts in rural Kansas--no less daunting--simply different. We, as a body, must continue to move legislation which will allow those two districts to decide for themselves how best to educate their children.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to mark a milestone in the history of the Georgian nation towards consolidating its independence and sovereignty and the progress Georgia has made in moving towards becoming a democratic government with a free market economy. 
   On the 9th of April 1999, Georgian Orthodox Good Friday, Georgia commemorated a tragic anniversary: ten years ago on that day in 1989, twenty-two people died for daring to express their desire for the independence of their country. During a peaceful demonstration in Tbilisi, Soviet troops moved in on the unarmed crowd with tanks. Soldiers carrying field engineer spades bludgeoned these brave people to death--all of them were unarmed and many of them were women. The troops also used an unknown type of poisonous gas which put thousands of people in hospital. These people paid a heavy price for expressing their desire for independence. 
   This week, almost exactly 10 years later, Georgia is celebrating another major step towards the goal of full independence for which those people died: this time economic independence. On April 17th, Georgia celebrated the inauguration of the Baku-Supsa oil pipeline. With this step, Georgia has gained another significant measure of independence. 
   This is a long way to have come in just ten years. And these have been very tumultuous years filled with strife and hardship: assassination attempts against President Shevardnadze; pressures from Russia which continues to harbor Igor Giorgadze, the mastermind behind the 1995 assassination attempt against President Shevardnadze; ethnic conflicts, over 300,000 refugees from Abkhazia, and tremendous economic hardships for the Georgian people. 
   This refugee problem is one which should resonate with all of us. The television pictures and the stories told by the Kosovar refugees of ethnic cleansing, people pushed out of their homes and villages is a sight which shocks us and has galvanized the United States and the west to action. Similar scenes were taking place in Georgia which in a very short time had to assimilate over 300,000 refugees driven out of Abkhazia as part of ethnic cleansing in that part of the country. Had there been TV cameras there the world might have reacted. But there weren't and Georgia has been left to deal with this difficult problem on its own. 
   Despite this difficult backup, President Shevardnadze and the reformers in the Georgian parliament have started and made significant progress in building a new nation. What we are witnessing in Georgia is truly that: the building up from scratch of a new state. This is a daunting task and one which requires immense fortitude and persistent commitment. 
   There is no quick formula for building a state, no blueprint to follow which will smooth the way. In fact, the road is anything but smooth and there have been wrong turns along the way. But it is taking place. There are a number of indicators. 
   One is the regaining control of borders. After much negotiating, and persistence, Georgia is starting to regain control of its borders: in the strategic sea-port of Poti, the northern border as well as parts of the border with Turkey. Georgia is also scheduled to take control of the entire Turkish-Georgian border in Ajara in 1999. 
   Another is in the area of basic legal reforms. Not only have President Shevardnadze and the reformers in Parliament tackled problems systematically, they have clearly demonstrated their commitment by passing legislation which will set the foundations for a free and prosperous society. A recent example is the overhaul of the judiciary. Most of Georgia's judges are being forcibly retired and replaced by new ones chosen by competitive examinations. This is a bold move in the right direction. While the reform of the legal system is moving forward at a fast pace, one area of concern is the recent decision to return to the Soviet system of appointing lay judges for high crimes' sentencing. These judges don't have to pass tests or meet the same standards as federal judges. This is a dangerous road to go down as it could slow down the pace of legal reform and open the door to corruption. Nevertheless, on the whole Georgia should be proud of this wonderful step forward. In a civil society, the legal system should work for the society and not for the benefit of the authorities. The overhaul of the judiciary sets Georgia on that course. 
   Another is the fight against corruption. The reformers in Georgia have also taken on one of the most pervasive problems which is the legacy of 70 years of communism: corruption. Recent examples of the commitment to take on this overwhelming problem can be found in a number of decisions relating to the areas in which corruption is the most prevalent in any society. Georgia has hired foreign companies to take over areas which are traditionally the richest sources of bribes and corruption: the distribution of electric power in Tbilisi and the customs service. In another bold move, the Georgian government will be taking procurement away from the ministries: a law passed recently requires that as of 1 July 1999, all government procurements beyond 20,000 lari must be subject to tender by the Ministry of Economy. This law is most significant and will be further enhanced by establishment of a system for third party procurement. The Ministry of Economy working with seasoned western companies can make these tenders work for the government and not for individual people looking for their own personal gain. Leading the way in this effort is the military and the border guards. This will concretely contribute to the more efficient use of Georgian government resources and reduce the temptation of corruption. 
   The progress made to date has not come easily and has not necessarily been smooth; mistakes have been made along the way. But we must remember that there is no easy map to chart the way from the economic shambles Georgia and the other former Soviet republics inherited to a full blown free market economy and democratic institutions. Building them takes some time, determination and perseverance. 
   Mr. President, once implemented, the Georgian people will surely begin to see that they are on the right track toward a serious improvement in their circumstances. I congratulate President Shevardnadze and the parliamentarians who have stood up for the freedom and long-term wellbeing of their country. 
   Mr. President, the geostrategic importance of Georgia to the United States is clear and has been mentioned often. It also has another claim on our attention and support: the progress toward democratization and free market economy there is a strong example to the other countries in the region. Georgia deserves our support as well as our congratulations.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank my colleague from Georgia for recognizing me and for bringing this bill forward. 
   It was 2 weeks ago yesterday that I was at McConnell airbase in Wichita, KS, meeting with troops that afternoon heading out to run refueling missions and other activities in support of the Kosovo operation. They were in their working uniforms with a number of spouses and some children present. They were determined and ready to go. They said, ``This is our job,'' and they were saluting and saying they were off to do it even though they had questions: What is the objective? How will we get this done? How long will it last? We did not have good answers for them, but I said we would press for those answers. 
   In speaking with a couple of the spouses afterwards, they noted their husbands had been deployed more than 200 days last year and they were having difficulty with that length of time of deployment. Also, they said: We love being part of the military, we want to do our job, but we feel we are being hamstrung by some of the things required of us. 
   They don't believe some of the pay is quite enough, and I don't think it is enough for them. 
   What I see in this bill of Senator COVERDELL is a statement to some of the people at McConnell airbase, and others throughout Kansas who are serving in the military, that we want to help and do what we can in tough situations because you are going into the toughest situation that a nation could possibly send you. You are going in to face a hostile enemy, putting your lives on the line, your blood on the line. We are asking you to do it and you are doing it. The least we can do--God bless you, we want to help any way we can--is to do something to help. 
   This 2-month extension for the due date for filing a tax return for any member of a uniformed service on a  tour of duty outside the United States for a period including the normal due date for such filing is a small statement. It is a small act, but it is a good act. It is an important act and an important statement for us to tell those people in uniform and their families that we do care, we do hear you, and we want to try to respond in any way we possibly can. 
   We need to do a lot more. We need to up the pay to people in the military. We need to be questioning all the places we are sending our military around the world, how many times we are deploying them. We need to upgrade the military's hardware. I think that is important. One thing we recently did for the Nation's defense was to pass on the national missile defense bill. We need to do that. 
   I noted to those at McConnell airbase and those attending the nine townhall meetings I had across Kansas last week a chart showing the percentage of the Federal budget going to military defense spending. About 17 percent of our budget is now going to military defense spending. In 1962--not all that long ago--it was nearly 50 percent going into our military budget. 
   I noted that the amount we invest in the military--which does the very basic thing we are called on to do, which is to provide for the common defense--is going to need to go up if we are going to continue the far-flung operations that the United States is involved in around the 
   world. We cannot maintain this pace in this many places on this budget. 
   That is all they are asking. They are saying: I will put my life on the line, I will subject my family to this, I believe in the United States, and I believe in our cause, but, gosh, can't you help us out a little bit? Can't you make sure that people aren't on food stamps? Can't you address some of these issues? And we should. 
   This is a bill to help some of those people. Some Members may have conflicting opinions on our involvement in Kosovo, but we can all agree that our service men and women should not be penalized for their service to our country. We owe them a debt of gratitude for risking their lives to represent our country. Our soldiers defend the liberties we hold dear, and we should not be arbitrarily penalizing them in our Tax Code for their work to protect our country. 
   With that, I say to my colleague from Georgia I am very appreciative of the bill the Senator has put forward, of the effort to recognize the needs of our people in uniform. I support wholeheartedly this bill and say God bless to our soldiers who are in uniform and in harm's way today. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the amendment put forward by the Senator from Missouri. I join him in this amendment and I join him in the sentiment that he has put forward and articulated, I think very well, about the potential problems and pitfalls if we go this route of the Government investing the Social Security trust fund surplus in the stock market. 
   Now, a lot of us would say if we want to have private sector individuals take certain portions of their surplus and put them in investments they deem worthy and sound, that is one thing to consider; but when you have the Government looking at potentially investing $2.7 trillion over a period of time and directing that in the stock market, I think you are asking for a whole boat load of problems. 
   Having the Government invest the Social Security trust fund in the stock market, I believe, is dangerous because of the Government having cross-purposes when it frequently seeks to do various things. 
   We heard the Senator from Missouri talk about some ``for instances.'' If we have a poor economy taking place and people are looking around saying what can we do to stimulate the economy, what we need to do is put more money in the stock market to stimulate its growth and hopefully that will stimulate the economy. People say, ``Raid the trust fund and move it into the stock market.'' That may be a fine thing for macroeconomics, it may not be. It could be a very poor thing for Social Security and trust funds and pension funds. We should look at these as people's pension funds. That is just not a wise policy to take place. 
   We could also have all sorts of political pressures--the Senator from Missouri or the Senator from Kansas saying, ``Not 
   enough of this money is being placed by the Government into Kansas. I think they ought to be investing more money in Kansas rather than less money,'' so I start lobbying, or others do, to get the Government to invest more of the Social Security money, these pension funds of the American public, into Kansas. 
   That may be a good and laudable purpose. From my perspective, it is a great purpose. Is that the sort of thing we ought to be doing with our pension funds, though? Is that the sort of cross-purpose that we should invite by encouraging and allowing the Federal Government to invest money in the private stock market? I think not. 
   President Clinton has suggested that the Government invest up to $700 billion in surplus payroll taxes in the stock market. I applaud the President for recognizing the strength of our economy. I have to seriously question this proposal. The dangers of a Government-controlled economy are vast and they are far reaching. Socializing our free market economy through Government-controlled investments in the stock market would have a chilling effect on future economic growth. The markets would become more sensitive to the executive branch decisions and less sensitive to market forces and factors. 
   The potential abuses are easily seen, and I have already articulated a couple of them. Businesses that are not supportive of the administration could be punished and those that are supportive would be rewarded. Again, a cross-purpose with people's pension money--not a good idea. 
   Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan has been previously quoted as saying he deems this to be a bad idea for Social Security and a bad idea for the economy. 
   I think his one quote bears repeating at this time because it goes to the heart of the issue. Alan Greenspan said he ``does not believe that it is politically feasible to insulate such huge funds from a governmental direction.'' 
   Now, imagine that--$700 billion multiplied over time being directed by Government and an administration that might be at cross purposes with saying what is the best thing to do for these pension funds, or even if we had the best of purposes, you are going to invite manipulation taking place in the market with pension funds. 
   The last thing this country needs is the Federal Government directing the investment of Social Security funds based on politics. That is simply what we are inviting if we seek to have the Government do this investment. This is something private individuals should do. They should be allowed to do that on certain portions of it, but the Government should not. 
   Our amendment states that it is the sense of the Senate that the Government should not be allowed to invest the trust funds in the stock market. I hope all of our colleagues, seeing the dangers of this proposal, will vote in favor of our amendment. 
   With that, I yield the floor. 
   Mr. ENZI addressed the Chair.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Virginia very much. I am sorry to assert myself at this point, but I have to preside shortly. 
   Mr. President, I think the Senate and the American people, hopefully, heard a number of strong arguments questioning whether or not we should start this bombing campaign at this 
   point in time. 
   Let me say categorically, I am concerned about the carnage that is taking place in Kosovo and in Europe and the number of people who are displaced that the newspapers put at 45,000, the number of people who have been killed, and the possibility of refugees in the surrounding area. 
   Let me also say that if our troops are engaged and are starting to bomb or are put there, I will support the troops. If they go to battle, I will support them. But this action at this point in time seems to me to be ill-advised. If the Senate has not been properly consulted, the American people have not been properly consulted and brought along, and we should back up and rethink what we are about to do in this area. We are making an act of war against a sovereign nation, with likely loss of U.S. life, and neither the Senate nor this Nation has been adequately consulted. 
   The Senator from Delaware previously spoke and talked about the objective is to stop oppression that is occurring. I am supportive of stopping oppression, but if we are looking at oppression, that occurs a number of places around the world. 
   If we want to stop oppression, I have a better suggestion. Let's engage in the Sudan, not with troops, not with bombing, but let's support the southern Sudanese. They have 4 million people displaced at the present time. Two million have had a loss of life, and there you have a government in Khartoum that is supporting terrorism in the surrounding region in Uganda, Eritrea, and Congo, that is expanding, that is a militant fundamentalist regime that seeks to do us harm. There you have a vital strategic United States interest. 
   If we want to stop oppression, let's supply and support the southern Sudanese. If that is what the objective is, then let's do something there where we can help save more lives, help more people, and also a vital and strategic U.S. interest. 
   I do not see us doing that. The situation taking place in Europe is a sad situation, but one where I really question whether we should put forth the loss of U.S. lives which is contemplated at this point in time. 
   Perhaps this can be explained over some period of time. Perhaps the administration can engage the American public and the Congress to get that kind of support. But I cannot give that at this point in time on the basis of the information I have to date. 
   Plus, what is the plan? The Senator from Kentucky just asked a number of very simple and very basic questions. Here is a Member of the Senate asking these sorts of simple and basic questions, saying, ``I don't know the answers to these things.'' Nor do I. 
   Have we been sufficiently brought along and engaged and had discussions on these items that we can have such basic questions and not even know the answers to them? We have been told there is going to be a bombing campaign, maybe several ways of bombing. What if Mr. Milosevic does not blink at that point in time and says, ``OK, we are going to support some kind of autonomy in Kosovo"? What then? What is the plan at that point in time? Are we engaging ground troops not in a peacekeeping but aggressive fashion? I do not think people will support that. 
   After Kosovo, is it Montenegro next where we will be going in and supporting, supplying people who want a separatist movement, if that were to happen in that region of the former 
   Yugoslavia? What next? And what is the full plan? 
   We just do not have the answers to these questions, and we are about to take an act against a sovereign nation that is likely to result in the loss of U.S. lives. 
   Now is the time to debate and discuss and to back up and slow down on this, have the administration engage the American public, engage the Congress in answering the simple questions that my colleagues have put forward. Now is the time to do that. 
   I ask the President, please, let's have that sort of discussion on those sorts of specifics with the American public before we move in to what I think could be a very ill-fated, ill-timed, and inappropriate action at this point in time by the United States. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate our colleague from Idaho recognizing me to speak briefly on this amendment. 
   I rise in opposition to this amendment to this resolution. I think this is an ill-advised, ill-timed, inappropriate action to take, given the situation that we have, given the potential and the actual probable loss of U.S. lives, the lack of involving the entire United States in this and saying to the American people: Why are we doing this? We don't know where it is going on step 2, step 3, and step 4. 
   This is step 1. We go in and we bomb a sovereign nation involved in a civil war. What if he doesn't fall back? What if Milosevic doesn't say: OK, I give up, and you can have autonomy in Kosovo? What if we go ahead into Montenegro and say we want to split off. Will the United States bomb and support Montenegro in that process? 
   This is a very, very serious step we are taking of such foreign policy, and we have not had sufficient debate about what 
   the U.S. position is. This is not in our strategic and vital interest of what is taking place. Yet we are going to go forward and start a bombing campaign. We need to have a thorough, extensive debate here, involving the American people, as to whether or not this is in our vital and strategic interests. I submit that has not taken place to date. The administration has not brought the Congress along, and this is an inappropriate, ill-timed event and action for us to take and is not being supported by the American people. 
   For those reasons, I will be opposing this resolution.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank the author of this amendment from Texas, as well as our colleague from Florida. 
   The idea that we would tell the States how to spend this money from this litigation is absolutely wrong. It is just wrong on its face. The people who are proposing it, I respect their motivation; they are trying to reach out and save lives and to stop these health problems. I think their motivation is appropriate, but the direction and the apportionment that is taking place on the States is the wrong way to do it. 
   In every State in the country that has been a part of this litigation, there is now ongoing a healthy and vigorous debate 
   about how best to spend the tobacco settlement funds. It is happening in Kansas, my State. I am being contacted by the Kansas Legislature in very strong terms. ``Do you not think that we care about what happens to the people here? Do you not have enough problems in Washington to deal with, that you have to tell us what to do with this? We are the ones who brought this litigation forward.'' They are quite offended that we would try to direct them and tell them what to do with these funds that they pursued in litigation and that they need. They are offended as well because they think we don't believe they know what is best for Kansans. 
   I agree with them. I laud my colleague from Texas, Senator HUTCHISON, in what she is doing. I note, as well, that in Kansas in the debate and in the funding proposal that we have, 50 percent of all the funds to Kansas are going to children's health care program funds for prevention and cessation. We are putting in 50 percent which was enacted in the legislature. But we should not require them to go to HCFA after they have appropriated the money and see if they agree or see if they are going to have to do something different. 
   With almost unprecedented unanimity, every State Governor, Attorney General, and State legislature has directly backed the Hutchison-Graham language. In fact, in many cases it is the No. 1 Federal issue for the 106th Congress by a number of these groups. I applaud my colleague. The debate is happening at the right place now. We should not impose a ``Washington knows best'' approach.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise in support of an amendment offered by myself and Senator ROBERTS which will seek to provide fair and equitable treatment for Kansas gas producers. At a time when the oil and gas industry is suffering, the Federal Government has taken unnecessary action against gas producers in Kansas. 
   For almost two decades the Commission allowed gas producers to obtain reimbursement for payment of Kansas ad valorem taxes on natural gas. In a series of orders the Commission repeatedly approved the collection of the Kansas ad valorem tax, despite challenges by various pipelines and distributors. However, in 1993 the Commission changed its mind and decided that the Kansas ad valorem tax did not qualify for reimbursement to the producer, and in 1996 the D.C. Circuit Court determined that a refund was to be made retroactively. 
   This is another example of Federal preemption of State rights and of a regulatory agency that is out of control. Kansas gas producers are being  penalized more than $300 million for abiding by regulations that the Commission had previously approved. 
   The Commission's decision will likely force small producers out of business, causing a slowdown in the production of natural gas which could have a tremendously negative impact on the Kansas economy. 
   This amendment that Senator ROBERTS and I have cosponsored will essentially relieve all gas producers from interest owed on the ad valorem tax. This amendment will save jobs, businesses, and loss of State revenue. I am hopeful that my colleagues will support this amendment and provide fair and equitable treatment for Kansas gas producers.

   For over 200 years, the United States has been fortunate to enjoy a high level of security provided by, among other things, our geographic location. In the past, the Atlantic and Pacific oceans have served well in preventing a direct attack on the United States. However, as we approach the twenty-first century and new technology, we find that the proliferation of missile technology has taken this geographic sanctuary away from us.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I want to make note of a report that came out today that is one, I think, we are going to be seeing and hearing quite a bit more about in the U.S. Senate. It was a report of the Congressional Commission on Military Training and Gender-Related Issues. 
   I rise today to briefly comment on the status of the report and the testimony that was submitted today by the members of the Congressional Commission on Military Training and Gender-Related Issues, a hearing that took place in the House Armed Services Committee. While not the final report of this commission, the initial report does give indications as to their findings and, I think, warrants some discussion in the U.S. Senate. 
   A number of Members will recall, last year we had a spirited discussion about gender-integrated barracks during basic training. The discussion was centered around issues of, is this the most effective way to train our young men and women in the services, to have gender-integrated barracks? These are young men and women just entering into the military. They are going through basic training. There are a lot of difficult issues that they are facing, as they are being trained into a fighting force. Then on top of that, we put them in the same barracks together at night, after they have been side by side during the day. Ask yourself, are you going to be asking for problems if you have got young men and women who are put into the same barracks, right after a long day, next to each other with not a lot of other diversions at night? 
   We have had, unfortunately, a report of many instances of sexual harassment that have taken place, and worse, in these gender-integrated barracks. I am not speaking about basic training. I am talking about the barracks. 
   The report that came out today notes some progress in improving that sexual harassment and other problems that we have experienced with gender-integrated barracks during basic training, but it still invites the question of, why do we even ask for any problems at all? They are saying, the problem level is down, but why are we asking for problems at all by having these integrated barracks during basic training? Why don't we separate the genders during basic training? That was the point that a number of us made last year. A lot of people thought, let's put it off until this report. The report notes we have some progress, but we still have problems. 
   I think this hearing that was held today and the preliminary report that was issued merit a full hearing taking place in the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee to review this very issue. Is this the best way? Is this the right way, and is this the way that is leading to more problems than we need to confront of the current policy of integrating the sexes in their barracks during basic training? 
   I think not. We will continue to have problems we just do not need to invite. I hope that the Senate will take this on as a serious problem as we start to deal with the report that comes out today.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, today is St. Patrick's Day. It is interesting to me that when people think of St. Patrick's Day, they think of Irish, of Ireland and green and spring and those sorts of things, much more than we think of St. Patrick. 
   I was looking up today and asking for some information on St. Patrick himself. 
   St. Patrick of Ireland--this is on a web site. It is fascinating. I do not think most people realize about St. Patrick, but he is one of the world's most popular saints, as people know, along with St. Nicholas and St. Valentine. The day is one cherished by everyone, particularly the Irish. 
   There are many legends and stories of St. Patrick. This is his story. I will go through it briefly. 
   He was born around 385 in Scotland, probably Kilpatrick. His parents were Romans living in Britain in charge of the colonies. As a boy of 14 or so, he was captured during a raiding party and taken to Ireland as a slave to herd and tend sheep. Ireland at this time was a land of Druids and pagans. He learned the language and practices of the people who held him. 
   During his captivity, he turned to God in prayer, and he wrote:  
   The love of God and his fear grew in me more and more, as did the faith, and my soul was rosed, so that, in a single day, I have said as many as a hundred prayers and in the night, nearly the same. 
   I prayed in the woods and on the mountains, even before dawn. I felt no hurt from the snow or ice or rain.  
   Patrick's captivity lasted until he was 20, when he escaped after having a dream from God in which he was told  to leave Ireland by going to the coast. There he found some sailors who took him back to Britain, where he was reunited with his family. 
   He had another dream--and this is just fascinating and miraculous to me--in which the people of Ireland were calling out to him, ``We beg you, holy youth, to come and walk among us once more.'' This, again, was the land where he was enslaved and from which he escaped. 
   He began his studies for the priesthood. He was ordained by St. Germanus, the Bishop of Auxerre, whom he studied under for years. 
   Later, Patrick was ordained a bishop and was sent to take the Gospel to Ireland where he had been enslaved. He arrived in Ireland on March 25, 433. One legend says that he met a chieftain of one of the tribes who tried to kill Patrick. He converted the chieftain after he was unable to move his arm and so he became friendly to Patrick. 
   Patrick began preaching the Gospel throughout Ireland, converting many. He and his disciples preached and converted thousands and began building churches all over the country. Kings, their families, and entire kingdoms converted to Christianity when hearing Patrick's message. 
   Patrick by now had many disciples, several of whom were later canonized, as was St. Patrick. 
   Patrick preached and converted all of Ireland for many years. He worked many miracles and wrote of his love for God in 
   confessions. After years of living in poverty, traveling, and enduring much suffering, he died March 17, 461. He died at Saul, where he had built the first church. 
   That is the story of St. Patrick, the patron saint of Ireland.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Under the previous order, I believe there are 45 minutes equally divided between myself and Mr. WELLSTONE on this debate. 
   At the very start of the Oslo peace process between Israel and the Palestinians, PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat wrote a letter to then Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in which he stated this: ``The PLO commits itself to the Middle East peace process, and to a peaceful resolution of the conflict between the two sides, and declares that all outstanding issues relating to permanent status will be resolved through negotiations.'' That letter was dated September 9, 1993, and it led to the ceremony on the White House lawn 4 days later that publicly launched the peace process. 
   Indeed, it was on the basis of the words that Chairman Arafat wrote that Israel agreed to enter into the negotiations. It was on that basis that Israel agreed to cede land and political authority to the Palestinians. It is the most important and fundamental Palestinian commitment, and it undergirds the entire peace process. 
   And yet it is this very principle that Chairman Arafat now threatens to abandon. Over the past several months he has repeatedly threatened to unilaterally declare a Palestinian state over the entire West Bank and the Gaza Strip, with the eastern part of Jerusalem as its capital. 
   Mr. President, this issue touches the core of the Israel-Palestinian conflict as the question of the permanent status of the Palestinian entity. What will be its final borders? Will there be limits on its sovereignty? Will it be allowed to have a military, to possess jets and tanks and missiles, to enter into foreign alliances with the likes of Iraq or Iran or Libya? All these questions need to be bilaterally negotiated  between Israel and the Palestinians so that Israel's security can be assured. 
   You can just imagine what happens the day after a unilateral declaration. Palestinian security forces begin patrolling an area that they now consider part of an independent state but that is part of the area that Israel has had security control over. Israel would undoubtedly have to take steps to provide for the safety of its citizens. Tension will mount quickly, leading inevitably--and rapidly--to a quick descent into violence and bloodshed. 
   And consider for a moment what the Palestinians have already achieved in the peace process. Five years ago at this time, not one Palestinian living in the Gaza Strip or on the West Bank lived under Palestinian civilian authority. Today, 98 percent have their own executive branch, democratically-elected legislature, and courts. They have their own educational system, their own broadcasting authority, their own airport, their own travel documents, their own flag and anthem. They have full control over virtually the entire Gaza Strip and ten percent of the West Bank, including all major population centers, and civilian authority over another seventeen percent. And that is even before the start of final status negotiations. There has been much progress. 
   So why does Arafat make such a threat? Why jeopardize the entire peace process? On May 4, the five-year period that began with the signing of the first agreement between Israel and the Palestinians ends. It had been hoped that by that point all final status negotiations would have been completed. But it should be noted that none of the agreements signed between Israel and the Palestinians--Oslo I, Oslo II, the agreement on redeployment in the city of Hebron, and the Wye River Accord were negotiated by the hoped for date. Still, the negotiators stuck to it until agreements were hammered out. That is exactly what should occur now. The peace process is much too important to be held hostage to an arbitrary date. 
   Some say that Arafat will back down and not carry out this threat, or that he will postpone the date. I certainly hope that is right. But listen to these words of his closest associate which were spoken as recently as February 22, less than 3 weeks ago. He said,  
   We . . . assure the whole world that the establishment of the independent state of Palestine, with holy Jerusalem as its capital, is a sacred and legitimate right of the Palestinian people. It is a goal that our people will not accept to abdicate or to give up no matter what the difficulties.  
   Palestinian Authority Minister Nabil Shaath said on February 9, ``Our position concerning our right to declare a state on the fourth of May has not changed. 
   Any opposition to this right is rejected.'' Eleven days later, on February 20, he continued on the same line, stating, ``We are moving forward in our preparations for the day, May 4, the date of the declaration of the Palestinian state.'' A few weeks earlier, in January of this year, he indicated that the declaration of independence would, in his words, ``delineate the borders of the Palestinian state as being the borders of June 4, 1967, including all of the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and the part of Jerusalem that was on the Jordanian side of the armistice.'' 
   So it is clear that the Palestinians are still considering their options. Chairman Arafat should know, therefore, that the Congress of the United States strongly urges him not to pursue this reckless course, but to live up to his own words and his own fundamental commitment to negotiate this most complicated and important issue bilaterally with Israel. That is the only true path to a final and lasting peace, which is what we all see. 
   He should know that the Congress of the United States stands strongly in opposition to a unilateral declaration. This resolution expresses that opposition to a unilateral declaration, and it urges the President to make clear to Chairman Arafat that we will not recognize a unilaterally declared state. 
   We should be very clear on this point. This is a matter of principle. We should not be relieved if Mr. Arafat arises on May 4 and says, ``We will postpone this decision until December 31.'' A unilateral declaration, whenever it would occur, would be wrong. The status of the territories controlled by the Palestinian Authority can only be determined through negotiations with Israel. Period. 
   We should not pay Mr. Arafat for not doing something which he should not have threatened to do in the first place. We should have only one message: To make a unilateral declaration of statehood is wrong, we will not recognize it, and we urge you not to go forward with it, but instead to return to the process that has gotten us this far to date--the peace process. That is the only course which holds a promise of meeting the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people while providing the people of Israel what they have yearned for in the past 50 years: peace with security. 
   Mr. President, we have a number of speakers on our side, and I know Senator WELLSTONE does as well. 
   Before I yield the floor, I ask unanimous consent to add Senators KYL, ROBB, ABRAHAM and MOYNIHAN as cosponsors of S. Con. Res. 5. Their names appear to have been inadvertently omitted in the printed RECORD.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   I thank my colleagues, Senator FRIST and Senator JEFFORDS, and others, for the important work they have done on this piece of legislation. I think this is a marvelous piece of legislation. 
   In my time in the Senate, which has not been long, I cannot recall seeing a piece of legislation that has been supported by all 50 Governors. All 50 of them are supporting Ed-Flex. It seems like, to me, it is one of those provisions in bills that comes forward where people say, ``This is the right time, right place, right idea. Let's do it.'' 
   It is time we should move forward with this bill. It passed in committee 10-0. It passed last year out of committee 17-1. This ought to be something on which we could agree. 
   I would just like to make a couple of points. My State is an Ed-Flex State. Kansas is an Ed-Flex State. We have had a number of school districts that have asked for and received the authority and the flexibility. This started down the same path that welfare reform did early on, when you finally had some States saying, ``Look, the situation has gotten bad enough. You have so many Federal strings and redtape on it that we can do a better job here if you'll just give us a little breathing room. Just let us have a little bit of help here, not telling us what to do and letting us decide.'' 
   That is what started welfare reform; you had some States starting to do that and asking for little provisions: ``Let us take this into our own hands and we'll do a better job.'' And you know what? They did do a better job. They did do a better job, and they were the laboratory of the experimentation of democracy in saying, ``Well, let's try it different here; different there.'' 
   And what has ended up taking place? We have in my State welfare reform today where you have had a reduction in welfare recipients of 50 percent over the past 4 years--a 50-percent decline. And the people off welfare are saying, ``Thank goodness I'm working,'' and ``I feel better about myself.'' And I feel better about this program. This has worked. We are seeking to replicate that in education by saying, ``Let the flowers bloom in the States across the Nation.'' 
   The principle behind Ed-Flex is simple. You have heard about it. It allows local schools to implement creative programs that are custom tailored to the needs of their kids, enables State education agencies to waive State requirements, along with Federal mandates, so that local schools can innovate effectively. 
   Listen to what we are doing in Kansas about these Ed-Flex programs that we have in our State. We have had several States where we have had a number of waiver requests. I think we have 43 waivers in my State that have been requested. 
   One school district received a waiver in order to more better distribute title I funds to the neediest students. Leavenworth schools requested a waiver to provide an all-day kindergarten class and preschool programs to better serve the special needs of the children of our soldiers who are serving at Fort Leavenworth. Emporia used an Ed-Flex waiver to implement new literacy programs and an intensive summer school program. 
   Do those sound like good innovative ideas that are particular for a local school district meeting its needs? It certainly does. And that is what Ed-Flex is about; and that is what it is providing in my State. 
   Take that and replicate that across the Nation to the 46 million schoolchildren in 87,000 public schools across this country. And does anyone really think--does anyone really think--that a one-size-fits-all approach would work with such incredible diverse needs, circumstances, situations across the country? Communities need the flexibility to address their 
   unique needs, and given that opportunity they will educate the children better. They will do a better job than the one-size-fits-all mandates out of Washington. 
   I am surprised and dismayed that some people are filibustering this bill and saying: Well, we're not going to let it move forward on such a tried and true concept that is being tried and worked in so many States, that is supported by all 50 Governors, that provides for localized decision making on such an important decision as to how do we educate our children? 
   We have examples in this thing that should be working, and we should allow this to take place. Unfortunately, some people are trying to kill this bill with amendments that, of all things, actually add--actually add--Federal mandates--which the whole point of the bill is to reduce Federal mandates, and a number of people are trying to add Federal mandates. 
   Think about that. When the purpose of this is to allow schools flexibility in how they run their programs and spend their money, most of these amendments do exactly the opposite. They mandate that the schools spend a certain amount of money in a certain way no matter what their situation or their need. It just does not make sense. 
   What is even stranger is that these amendments would require additional Federal spending on new mandates while ignoring the commitments we already made to children with special needs through programs like the IDEA. The way I see it, we should fulfill the promises we have made to disabled children before we create new entitlement. 
   There are many reasons why we need Ed-Flex. I think it can create that innovative environment that can let our schools be as good as our children. Currently, our system is failing our children. What we need to do is get these obstructions of Federal regulations out of the way. We need to stop holding up the passage of these worthy initiatives and start doing the right thing by the American people and by our children. 
   Let this bill move. Let it move forward so that we can give that innovative atmosphere, and we can have a system worthy of the children of America. 
   Mr. President, I yield back the floor. 
   Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, today, I have introduced a proposal for a tax cut which I think answers a number of questions that people have been putting forward. I hear both sides of the aisle talking about a tax cut and the willingness to have a tax cut. Some are saying we need it to be targeted; some say we need to do it with the marriage penalty; others say we need a broad-based tax relief to take place. 
   The proposal I am putting in today would expand the 15-percent tax category over a period of 10 years and raise that to the level of the maximum amount at which we tax Social Security. What it does is, we broaden that 15-percent tax bracket. We make it such that it will take care of most of the marriage penalty. It will be economically simulating in that it will be a great relief for a number of people that grow into that 15-percent category, then, as we expand it. And it will be middle-income targeted because it will be that category of people making in the 15-percent rate and growing it up to $72,000 over a period of 10 years. 
   I think this answers a lot of questions on what we have been putting forward. We set aside every dime of Social Security money for Social Security, period. We do that. All those funds flowing into Social Security will remain and stay with Social Security. Not a dime of that is touched. 
   With the other resources that we have coming in that are building the surplus, let's do this sort of tax cut that moves to the middle-income category and addresses the marriage penalty problem. That is economically stimulating and is one that I think can be fair and helpful to our growth.  
   This is the final point I will make, as I intend to be brief about this. We are at a period of being able to talk about solving Social Security and paying down debt and providing tax cuts and dealing with education problems because we have a strong growing economy. We have a growing economy that is producing these sorts of revenues. We have to maintain that, and the lead thing that we can do to maintain that is to provide for economically stimulating tax cuts like what I am proposing here, and broaden that 15-percent tax rate, target it for people there, and have an economically stimulating benefit from that occurring. I think that is the way that we need to go to be able to maintain what we have in place now in this healthy economy and to be able to deal with these sorts of issues, to stimulate education reform, and to have the funds for education, as well. 
   Mr. President, that is the proposal I have introduced today. I urge my colleagues to look at it, and I would appreciate their support for this bill as we press forward on this broad-based debate on what we are going to do about this budget and how we continue the strong economy.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I am pleased to submit a concurrent resolution congratulating the State of Qatar and its citizens for their commitment to democratic ideals and women's suffrage on the occasion of Qatar's historic elections of a central municipal council on March 8, 1999. 
   By holding these elections, Qatar becomes only the second Gulf Arab state to have an elected house, and the first to allow women the vote and the right to take part in the municipal polls. These elections are a very promising step towards the establishment of democracy. 
   As a country which stands firmly committed to democratic ideals, including the suffrage of women, the United States should applaud this bold move by His Highness, Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa al-Thani, the Emir of Qatar for issuing the decree to create the central municipal council and for making this major step towards democracy possible. 
   This resolution commends the Emir of Qatar for his leadership and commitment to suffrage and the principles of democracy; congratulates the citizens of Qatar as they celebrate the historic election for a central municipal council; and reaffirms that the United States is strongly committed to encouraging the suffrage of women, democratic ideals, and peaceful development throughout the Middle East. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this initiatives.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Educational Flexibility Partnership Act, the Ed-Flex program that has been debated here today. I congratulate Senator FRIST and Senator JEFFORDS for their work on this bill of which I am a cosponsor. 
   Ed-Flex does the important work of granting waivers of certain statutory and regulatory requirements so that local schools can implement creative programs that are custom-tailored to the needs of their kids and allows some State education agencies to waive State requirements along with Federal mandates so that local schools can innovate effectively. 
   I think this is an extremely important program. We have been saying for some period of time that too much of education is directed out of Washington, that problems in education are not solved in Washington as much as they are at the local level. If we can allow people to have the flexibility in Kansas, Nebraska, Vermont, Tennessee, Texas or California to solve their education problems with these dollars, they will get more education done, and they will have more effective education done than if we direct it out of Washington. It is a basic premise. It works. It has worked on a number of programs. We allowed this to take place in welfare reform. We had a number of different experiments on welfare reform that led welfare rates to decline 50 percent. We solve it in Kansas differently than they solve it in other States. It worked. Education--we have a problem. But it is not a uniform problem that you can say, OK, if we just do this and this and this all across the Nation with programs, the problem is solved. It doesn't work that way. We have different educational needs in different places. 
   Ed-Flex is tried and true as a concept. It is a needed concept in education, because we need more flexibility to get these dollars into the classroom than people back here deciding how to spend it. 
   I might note that Ed-Flex is already in place in 12 States, including my home State of Kansas. Schools there have already submitted 43 waiver requests in an effort to better serve the unique needs of Kansas students. At this point, no waiver has 
   been rejected. Around two dozen requests have already been granted, and others are pending. I would encourage the Department of Education to expedite those requests. 
   That speech and that point that I just gave sounds very reminiscent of a point that I made in 1995 about waivers that were being granted on welfare reform and asking that those be sped up so that States could solve the problem. We are at the same point in time with education. Let's let the States have the resources and have them solve the problem. 
   Kansas schools have used Ed-Flex for many reasons. One school district received a waiver in order to better distribute title I funds to the neediest students. Leavenworth schools requested a waiver to provide an all-day kindergarten class and preschool programs to better serve the needs of children of parents that are at Fort Leavenworth at the military facility. Emporia used an Ed-Flex waiver to implement new literacy programs in an intensive summer school program. That fit the needs and what we had for needs in Emporia. The list goes on. 
   These are all very different programs that address different needs. But that is just the point. Schools need this flexibility. We need education decisions made in Emporia, in Fort Leavenworth, in Topeka, and in Manhattan--not in Washington for Kansas. We need it made there. And the people there care for the students. They look in their eyes every day. They can say, ``We need this program here.'' What can we tell them in Washington? No. You don't need that program. What you need is something else when we don't even look into the eyes of that same child. People here in the Washington bureaucracy have great desires to help that child, but the person who is right there closest is the one who can best determine what that child needs. This is the sort of program that allows that to take place. Schools need that sort of flexibility. 
   While Ed-Flex is an important first step, there are other steps that we need to take as well. If we are going to make progress toward improving our schools, we need to give the States and communities far more flexibility and empower them to make decisions with what is best for their schoolchildren. As important as it is to make waivers to Federal regulations available, frankly, I believe it would be better if we would roll back those regulations altogether and provide the resources to Kansas and to the school districts, and say to them, ``You figure out how best to educate these students.'' Believe me. They will come up with the ideas to do it. They will implement them, and they will get them done without the regulation here. 
   I don't think anybody in this Chamber, or in this town, should think that somebody in Emporia, KS, doesn't care greatly about how that child is educated and won't do the absolute best they can to make sure that child is educated well. 
   We need to empower them. We need to empower the parents, the teachers, the school boards, the communities over the government bureaucracy. That is why I will vote in favor of the Ed-Flexibility Act. I urge my colleagues to do likewise. 
   I say let's not stop here. This is where we started with welfare reform--providing these waivers. Ultimately, when we gave the program to the States and the resources to the State, they cut the welfare dependency in half and had people who were on welfare being thankful that they are now out on the job and they are encouraged about that. Why don't we try that with education, letting the States and the locals decide this? We will get more for every education dollar that we put out there. And, more importantly, our students will be better, and they will achieve higher test scores in the key areas that they are not doing today. 
   Mr. President, one other point: I think we have finally started down the road of making some real reforms in education, and reforms that I think people have been afraid that we are going to dictate out of Washington. This, to me, is a positive step forward--letting the local school districts start to decide on how they can implement those reforms. We have a lot of bright students across this country who need a system that is as bright as that are to challenge them and help them move forward. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

    Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, three years ago this month, Congress and the President hailed the enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. This piece of legislation was intended to increase competition, expand consumer choice, foster new technologies and create new jobs. The Act contemplated the achievement of these goals through reliance on the marketplace rather than on a sluggish and burdensome regulatory mandate. 
   The implementation of the Act by the Federal Communications Commission has sailed way off course. Congress provided the universal service program as a means of ensuring that residents of rural and high-cost areas receive the same high quality services and the same affordable rates as their urban counterparts. Yet universal service, one of the most important topics addressed in the Act, remains virtually unchanged by the FCC after three years despite the Commission's statutory responsibility to finish universal service reform in a ``single proceeding'' and within 15 months of passage of the Act. The FCC did complete a small part of the universal service mandate, the program bringing advanced services to schools and libraries. However, the Commission continues to ignore the most significant aspect of universal service reform, ``the preservation and advancement of universal service'' and high-cost areas. The Act commands that the Commission make the support mechanisms explicit and predictable. The Commission's failure to do so threatens the affordability of rural residential rates. 
   The uncertainty created by the FCC's failure to implement universal service is perpetuating the absence of local competition, especially in rural areas. As a consequence, local residential competition will remain at the current inadequate levels until the FCC addresses universal service. Congress intended that carriers providing service to residents of rural and high-cost areas would receive support for the ``provision, maintenance, and upgrading of facilities and services'' which would otherwise be absent in these areas. Accordingly, the Commission must make the now implicit subsidies explicit and sufficient in order to fulfill Congress' mandate. 
   Congress is still looking for more competition and more choice in all communications services, especially for rural residents. Let's allow the marketplace to work, which will give consumers in rural areas some real choices at affordable rates. 
   Mr. President, this year Congress will consider reauthorization of the FCC. I am extremely disappointed with the Commission's track record on implementation of the Act. As we contemplate legislation to change the FCC, its actions over the next several months will determine the outcome of our deliberations. I hope that the FCC will complete the universal service proceeding by July 1, and act in a manner consistent with the Act. I will not accept a universal service proceeding that puts upward pressure on rural rates, and I will hold the FCC accountable it fails to comply with the Act.

Congress intended that carriers providing service to residents of rural and high-cost areas would receive support for the ``provision, maintenance, and upgrading of facilities and services'' which would otherwise be absent in these areas. Accordingly, the Commission must make the now implicit subsidies explicit and sufficient in order to fulfill Congress' mandate. 
   Congress is still looking for more competition and more choice in all communications services, especially for rural residents. Let's allow the marketplace to work, which will give consumers in rural areas some real choices at affordable rates. 
   Mr. President, this year Congress will consider reauthorization of the FCC. I am extremely disappointed with the Commission's track record on implementation of the Act. As we contemplate legislation to change the FCC, its actions over the next several months will determine the outcome of our deliberations. I hope that the FCC will complete the universal service proceeding by July 1, and act in a manner consistent with the Act. I will not accept a universal service proceeding that puts upward pressure on rural rates, and I will hold the FCC accountable if it fails to comply with the Act.

    Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I wish to make a few remarks in support of Senator ALLARD's bill that would prohibit the implementation of the ``Know Your Customer'' (KYC) regulations by the four federal banking agencies (Office of Comptroller of the Currency, Office of Thrift Supervision, the Federal Reserve, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation). As a cosponsor of this legislation, I am concerned that this proposal would bring a regulatory imbalance to banks and their competitors, increase regulatory burdens on the banking industry and potentially violate the privacy of consumers. Once again the federal government has prescribed regulations that are costly to businesses and intrusive to citizens. 
   These regulations would put the banking industry at a disadvantage with their nonbank financial service competitors because many of them are not required to develop and maintain ``Know Your Customer'' programs under the proposal. Many bank customers would correctly view this as an intrusion of their privacy and might elect to conduct their banking business at other financial institutions. 
   Current criminal reporting requirements already mandate that financial institutions report violations of federal law to the Treasury Department after uncovering potential money laundering, insider abuse, or any violation of federal law. Ironically, under the proposed regulations by the federal banking agencies, a financial institution would not be required to report a violation after it has occurred. The proposed regulations create more burdensome and invasive regulations by requiring banks to investigate all customers activity to see if any violation of federal law has taken place, not just those suspected of criminal activity. This could be time consuming and extremely costly for banks. 
   The proposed regulations have generated many concerns from both consumers and the banking industry. A proposal that requires bankers to analyze all customer transactions would violate the public's trust and confidence in the banking industry. The financial service sector has been very effective in reporting possible violations of the law, while at the same time protecting customer information. The proposed regulations do little to increase the ability to curtail illegal activity and would severely harm America's financial institutions and the customers they serve. I encourage the four federal banking agencies to reconsider their proposed regulations and withdraw them.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I am delighted to be here joining my colleague from Kansas and other Members, expressing support for S. 4, the Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's and Marines' Bill of Rights Act of 1999. 
   This bill comes at a time when our services are facing increased difficulties in hiring and keeping quality personnel because of low pay, inadequate benefits, and increasingly frequent deployments. There is nobody who would say that what I just stated is untrue. Those are all true. They are all impacting our military personnel today. I join my colleague from Kansas, who serves on the Armed Services Committee, in strongly supporting this bill and saying that the first and foremost requirement of the Federal Government is to provide for the common defense and we are not providing adequately for the common defense. We have to do that. And, if we let down on that obligation because it does not show up high in the poll numbers or some other reason, we are failing our duty to this country to provide the first and foremost thing that we are required to do. 
   Let me remind my fellow Senators that defense spending has declined in real terms every year for the last 11 years and now comprises a lower percentage of our budget than ever before. We have seen a 19-percent decline in defense spending since 1992. Is the world that much of a safer place today? We have troops scattered everywhere around the world and we have had a 19-percent decline in defense spending since 1992. We have peacekeeping operations, we have had global contingencies in Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, the Persian Gulf, and now we are facing deployment decisions in Kosovo. This is an extremely high operation tempo that is being maintained over this period of time, with an enormous strain on troops and on their families. 
   Even under adverse conditions, our troops have continued to perform their task superbly. The lower defense spending combined with an increased deployment schedule and inadequate benefits, though, have resulted in an all-time low enlistment and inability to retain quality personnel: Soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines. America's service men and women and their families deserve a better quality of life. They put their lives on the line to protect our freedoms and the least we can do--the least we can do, I would think, is provide adequate pay, decent living conditions, and some educational opportunities. 
   This bill includes several provisions that will benefit our military personnel and increase retention and enlistment. It will include a 4.8-percent military pay raise. This, plus future pay raises at the employment cost index plus 0.5 percent, helps close the gap between military and civilian pay. 
   In addition, we have included military pay table reform that will increase pay for those personnel in midcareer points by up to about 10.3 percent. These are experienced personnel that we cannot afford to lose. 
   We also revised the military retirement system by allowing service personnel the option, after 15 years of service, to revert to the pre-1986 military retirement system or take a one-time $30,000 bonus if they remain under the current system. We allow Thrift Savings Plans, similar to what other Federal employees get. Our military members deserve to have the same opportunities that other Government employees have. 
   We also enhanced the Montgomery GI bill. This educational benefit has already sent hundreds of thousands of veterans to college and, I might add, has been a key fuel in pushing forward our economy. These educational benefits come back to the Federal Government in economic growth and opportunity and tax revenues. This is a good investment for everybody, and they will be transferable to immediate family members. But most important, this bill provides for a special subsistence allowance for enlisted personnel eligible for food stamps. 
   If you can imagine that, you are in the U.S. military, you are putting your life on the line and you are living on food stamps--living on food stamps. For those service members who demonstrate eligibility for food stamps, this bill provides them with a monthly allowance of $180 per month. This will keep our military personnel off food stamps and provide them with the support they need. 
   Mr. President, this to me is just unconscionable, that you really would put your life, your family at stake, and what are we paying you? We are not paying you enough if you can get food stamps, that you would qualify for food stamps. That is ridiculous, and we need to change it. This bill, S. 4, does change it. 
   I close by cautioning my fellow Members of the Senate that this may not be enough to stem the exodus of our service members. The Department of Defense and Congress must pursue additional remedies that will rectify the retention problem. This legislation takes a good first step, and I certainly urge my colleagues to support this bill. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
   Ms. LANDRIEU addressed the Chair.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. I find that William Jefferson Clinton did commit perjury and obstruct justice; that these offenses rise to the level of ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors;'' that William Jefferson Clinton should be convicted under the Articles of Impeachment; and that he must be removed as President of the United States. 
   This is a sad chapter in our nation's long and illustrious history. A man of extraordinary talent took a mistake and turned it into a tragedy. William Jefferson Clinton is no ordinary man. Gifted and charismatic, brilliant and refined, he took raw ability and focus and turned it into a Presidency. Such is the stuff of story books and heroes. Sadly for this tale, the hero had a habit he would not break, and, when it called him back to darkness, he sought to hide it at all cost. And there the tragedy occurred. 
   President Clinton repeatedly chose to lie and obstruct justice rather than tell the truth and comply with court orders throughout this ordeal. By his words and deeds he chose to place himself above the law. By his words and deeds he has undermined the rule of law in America to the great harm of this nation. By his own words and deeds, he has undermined the truth-finding function of the judiciary, at great harm to that branch of our government. By his words and deeds, he had done great harm to the notions of honesty and integrity that form the underpinnings of this great republic. 
   The following represents the specific facts upon which I find William Jefferson Clinton is guilty of perjury before a Federal Grand Jury and obstruction of justice, and must be removed as the President of the United States:

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my distinguished colleagues, Senators ASHCROFT, BAUCUS, and KERREY, in authoring the Food and Medicine for the World Act of 1999, which would limit the ability of the U.S. government to unilaterally cut off our exports of food and medicine to foreign countries. 
   The current stressed state of the farm economy is simply highlighting a problem that has existed in U.S. foreign policy for years. That is, our law allows for the application of unilateral sanctions on the export of food, despite extensive evidence that this policy is not only ineffective in achieving U.S. foreign policy goals but also is harmful to American economic interests. This is especially the case for agricultural commodities, which are readily available from other suppliers around the world and which are a critical component of the U.S. export portfolio. Moreover, limiting access to food and medical products is likely to have the most devastating effect on not the governments that the U.S. seeks to punish, but rather the poorest citizens of the foreign country. Thus it makes sense for the U.S. to engage with the citizens of that country by supplying--either through aid programs or through trade--basic life-sustaining products. 
   This bill takes a moderate approach and prohibits sanctioning of food and medical products only. It also provides a safeguard by allowing the prohibition to be waived if the President submits a report to Congress asking that the sanction include agriculture and medicine and Congress approves, through an expedited process, his request to sanction. Therefore, there is a mechanism to prohibit aid or trade from occurring with a rogue foreign regime when there is broad national consensus that it is the right thing to do. I believe that this is a reasonable balance between our need so stop using ineffective agricultural sanctions and our need to continue protecting U.S. foreign policy interests. 
   It is high time we stop shooting ourselves in the foot by cutting off agricultural exports, which are a real building block of the U.S. economy. I am encouraged that many members of the Senate have focused their attention on this problem and I look forward to working with my colleagues on a bipartisan basis to enact needed reforms.

    Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill, cosponsored by several of my colleagues that would reform the current pay-as-you-go financing mechanism of our federal government. 
   As a critical step to help reform the federal government, I believe that we need to change Congressional Budget Rules that make it illegal to use cuts in inefficient government spending to pay for tax cuts. Over the past century, our budget rules have been written in a way that favors spending over savings. We must fundamentally reform Pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) financing this year beyond the current law understanding which effectively turns PAYGO off during periods of an on-budget surplus. 
   Currently, according to PAYGO, Congress cannot make cuts in wasteful, even harmful government discretionary spending programs in order to finance tax cuts. For example, we can't cut the Advanced Technology Program in the Department of Commerce to pay for a capital gains tax cut. Rather, Congress has to make cuts in popular mandatory spending programs like Social Security and Medicare in order to pay for its tax cuts. I believe it is wrong to pit Social Security and Medicare against tax cuts. We need to flip the table on this false trade off by pitting tax cuts against wasteful big government spending. 
   Such a change would amount to a paradigm shift in how government functions and would help limit the size of government while at the same time providing additional resources for meaningful tax relief. The machinery of government is constructed to spend. We need reengineering of government so that the machinery produces savings. 
   My bill would change budget law in order to allow for tax cuts to be implemented in the amount of program eliminations. In practice, if we are able to eliminate a program during consideration of an appropriations measure, that money would be credited to the PAYGO scorecard and reserved for tax cuts. 
   Therefore, should my bill be enacted, we could eliminate programs like the Advance Technology Program, the National Endowment for the Arts, the Department of Commerce, and a whole host of other government programs while at the same time giving the taxpayers the tax relief they deserve--and we can do it without making draconian cuts to mandatory spending programs that ultimately do little to save the programs and much to simply prolong the crisis. 
   Mr. President, I look forward to the coming debate on budget process reforms. I look forward to the bill that is being considered jointly by the Governmental Affairs and Budget Committees, and I look forward to working with the chairmen of each in order to accomplish the type of budget reform that we truly need.

    Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to honor the memory of a great man, King Hussein of Jordan. 
   Today the world said goodbye to King Hussein and the great outpouring of grief by his people and the presence today in Amman of almost all of the world's leaders, is testament to his greatness and to the real honor and affection in which he was held; it was a testament to the enormous contribution he made to world peace and stability. 
   King Hussein was very young when he became king 47 years ago, in a tough neighborhood where wits and courage and character are quickly tested--and tested often. During his reign, he dodged at least 12 assassination attempts and 7 plots to overthrow him. 
   Though he took over a shaky throne, his perseverance, his vision and his great faith carried him through and resulted in a much stronger nation of Jordan and a more stable Middle East. He took his country far down the path of democratic reforms--reforms which he had hoped to continue to improve upon and to broaden. 
   His rule saw his country acquire stability and make peace with Israel. He modernized Jordan and created a situation in which Jordanians enjoy a degree of political freedom not found in most other Arab nations. 
   He did all this by living his faith and his ideals: he practiced political tolerance and even reached a peace and pardoned those who had tried to kill him. 
   He was a true friend and ally of the United States but his true devotion was to his people and to the cause of peace. He took great risks to achieve this peace. 
   He was a lynchpin in Middle East Peace Process. Only a few months ago, he left his sickbed and came to Wye to  help broker the Wye River accord that revived the failing peace process between Israel and the Palestinians. It was his presence and his commitment that brought a successful resolution to this agreement. 
   He did this at great personal sacrifice when he was near death. He fought illness with grace, courage and faith in the same way he had lived his life. 
   A stronger Kingdom of Jordan and a more stable Middle East, capable of eventually sustaining a lasting peace will be one of his great legacies. 
   Mr. President it is vitally important for the United States and Jordan to continue our close ties and to deepen our mutual commitment. 
   I join my colleagues in expressing my support and best wishes to King Hussein's son and successor, King Abdullah. 
   I met with King Abdullah this past November. He is very capable, knowledgeable and his is a strong leader. He is now a key to peace in the world and he is up to the task. We all wish him God's speed and great blessings.

    Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, today, I rise to recognize the 1998 Kansas Wheat Man of the Year, Dr. Rollie Sears. Dr. Sears is a world-renowned wheat breeder and a Professor in the Department of Agronomy at Kansas State University. His colleagues describe him as much more than a college professor. 
   Throughout the wheat industry, Mr. Sears is known for his many contributions to the development of new wheat varieties. Dr. Sears was again in the spotlight in 1998 when he released two new varieties of hard white wheat along with the indication that shortly there was more to come. 
   Mr. President, today I join with the Kansas Wheat Association in honoring a man who works to develop, and improve the wheat industry. I congratulate Dr. Sears for his outstanding contributions to wheat growers and I wish him continued success.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I want to bring to the Senate's attention something that, when I first saw it, I found it just to be unbelievable, that the type of situation that is going on is happening in the world today, in 1999. 
   I am speaking of what is taking place and the human rights abuses that are occurring in the Sudan today. The northern Sudanese Government is waging a vicious war in the south against its own people, who are suffering extraordinary human rights abuses on a massive scale. Slavery--slavery--and Government-induced famine not only exist but are increasing. It is unpardonable that slavery continues in the modern world today, that in 1999 we have slavery going on in the world. And it does in the Sudan. 
   It is even more dismaying that this offense against humanity is officially tolerated, even perpetrated, by a national government against its own people. I believe that America has the moral authority and the duty to protest this outrageous practice. 
   Joined by other Members of Congress, I will be introducing a resolution which demands the end of slavery in the Sudan. Legislation will also be introduced which challenges the famine-induced practices of the Government. Consider this a modern-day abolitionist movement, inspired by the legacy of some of the great freedom advocates such as Martin Luther King or William Wilberforce who ended the slavery trade in Britain nearly two centuries ago. 
   Let the facts speak for the victims. There are 1.9 million Sudanese who have died at the hands of their own Government, more people than Bosnia, Rwanda, and Kosovo combined. Over 2 
   million people have been displaced, driven from their ancient communities--that is nearly 10 percent of the population--and they now wander homeless, without resources, education, or hope for a decent future for their children. This is the largest internally displaced population in Africa. Most alarming, 2.6 million risk starvation this year--this year--because of Government policies deliberately calculated to produce food shortages. 
   Reportedly, 1998 was the worst famine in 10 years because of the official Government practices of denying food distribution to its own starving people. Experts warn that 1999 will even be worse because of the now weakened condition of the population. How could this happen when so much aid stands waiting for shipment? The answer is because the Government denies humanitarian aid organizations access to famine-stricken areas in the south. They deliberately withhold American-sponsored aid from the starving population to manufacture a famine. 
   Now, why would a government deliberately starve its own people? They have made starvation a weapon of war to crush those fighting for self-determination and religious freedom. Through this weapon of starvation, they can drive the people into refugee centers, which they cynically call ``peace camps,'' and there break them with humiliating treatment, deprivation, rape, more starvation, and even bombings in peace camps. 
   The Sudanese people suffer terrible treatment in these so-called peace camps; they are forced to renounce their own deeply held religious beliefs as a condition to being given food. Christians and traditional tribal believers report this is a routine practice.

    Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill which would authorize ``normal trade relations'' treatment to the product of Kyrgyzstan. 
   In 1998, Kyrgyzstan acceeded into the World Trade Organization, one of two republics of the former Soviet Union to be granted membership. Only Latvia can join Kyrgyzstan in boasting of that accomplishment. 
   Admission to the World Trade Organization was an acknowledgement of the progress Kyrgyzstan has made in adopting and implementing economic and trade reforms since its independence from the Soviet Union. However, despite World Trade Organization membership, Kyrgyzstan remains subject to the Jackson-Vanik amendment to Title IV of the Trade Act of 1974. 
   As you are aware, Title IV is the provision of law governing the normal trade relations status of nonmarket economy countries. Under the present arrangement, Kyrgyzstan's compliance with the requirements of the Jackson-Vanik amendment must be assessed semiannually. The legislation that I am introducing would eliminate the twice yearly review by granting Kyrgyzstan permanent ``normal trade relations'' treatment. 
   Currently, the United States cannot extend unconditional and reciprocal treatment to Kyrgyzstan, nor can we apply the World Trade Organization agreements to Kyrgyzstan. Until granted ``normal trade relations'' treatment, transactions with Kyrgyzstan continue to be governed by the provisions of the bilateral trade agreement negotiated under Title IV. 
   It is important that Kyrgyzstan be extended unconditional ``normal trade relations'' treatment. It is important not only because the Kyrgyz Republic has met the criteria required by that designation, but also because Kyrgyzstan is deserving of that designation. It is also important because until accorded that status, neither Kyrgyzstan nor the United States can realize fully the benefits of Kyrgyzstan's World Trade Organization membership. Kyrgyzstan has complied with both the freedom-of-emigration and the bilateral commercial agreement requirements of Jackson-Vanik and Title IV. 
   Kyrgyzstan should graduate from Jackson-Vanik in recognition of the great strides the country has made in employing market-oriented reforms. The Kyrgyz Republic has served as a leader in economic and political reform in Central Asia and demonstrates the potential to serve as a model for other transforming economies. 
   Passage of this legislation would send a powerful message not only to Kyrgyzstan, but to all of Central Asia that a free-market economy is the path to prosperity. Permanent ``normal trade relations'' status for Kyrgyzstan would help advance further reform not only in that country, but would also serve as incentive for other countries in the region. 
   ``Normal trade relations'' is important for both Kyrgyzstan and the United States. I hope my colleagues will join me in acknowledging Kyrgyzstan's progress and support this bill.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to address this body for the first time in this legislative session. We will have an exciting session full of business that the American people need conducted in this body. 
   I am particularly excited about the opportunity for us to deal with issues such as Social Security, creating a real Social Security trust fund instead of robbing from that trust fund, as has taken place for so many years. That money needs to be saved, needs to be used, needs to be kept for the senior citizens or those soon to retire in this Nation. In this legislative session we have that opportunity to create that new Social Security trust fund. That is the top agenda item for the Republicans in the U.S. Senate: Social Security preservation and protection. We need to fight and get it done and do it in a bipartisan fashion. 
   Second is education, emphasizing local control of education. The notion of creating a national school board is not one that many of us are too enthusiastic about, feeling as if we have too much control out of Washington and not enough local control, not enough people on a localized basis saying here is what we need to do with education, and the notion that we are going to create a national school board is one that a number of us would be opposed to. But helping local units of government get access to Federal funds, more access to put more of that money in the classroom, is something many of us would be very supportive of and be excited about doing, and we are going to attack that tough issue of education to make the schools of this country better for the children of this country. 
   Third is taxes. Taxes are too high. It is time to reduce 
   the marginal rates. It is time to eliminate the marriage penalty that is a penalty on married couples in this country. That is a ridiculous tax, if you think about it and the difficulties we are facing as a nation. Those three top items--Social Security, education, taxes--are lead items the Republican Senate is going to be putting forward, and I look forward to a hearty session full of those meaty items, dealt with, hopefully, in a bipartisan fashion. I welcome colleagues from the other side of the aisle to help us in solving those difficult issues.

   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, the issue I specifically want to address this morning, more than just our legislative agenda, is something that we celebrated yesterday, and that is the tribute to Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and the celebration we had yesterday, on January 18, when we once again paused to remember Dr. King, a man who changed the course of history and America's conscience. Dr. King is one of the few individuals throughout history who has so nobly exemplified the principles of sacrificial love and devotion. 
   Yesterday, in Kansas, I attended two Dr. King celebrations, one in Topeka and one in Kansas City, and both full of people rededicating themselves to the life of Dr. King and what he had committed himself to and what he had done. Dr. King dedicated his life to the advancement of individuals in need. He selflessly gave of his time and energy--and his life--in order to bring this country to a higher moral plateau. Dr.  King suggested that we should not, as he stated, ``judge success by the index of our salaries or the size of our automobiles, but rather ..... by the quality of our service and relationship to humanity.'' 
   In keeping with that vision, it is not enough to discuss how we can foster change within our communities. We must act and become involved in our communities the way Dr. King involved himself in the late 1950s and throughout the 1960s. 
   This year, the Martin Luther King, Jr. Holiday observance theme was ``Remember! Celebrate! Act! A day on, not a day off!!'' I cannot think of a better way to honor Dr. King's memory than taking part in our local communities and extending our help to those in need. 
   I am particularly pleased that Kansas organizations are working to honor Dr. King's memory by their outstanding work in their communities. I regularly visit different charity organizations throughout the State of Kansas, such as the Grace Center, which is a home for unwed mothers, and Bread of Life, which is an inner-city church that is leading community revitalization by partnering with schools and neighborhood organizations to provide scholastic, mentoring, and bible study programs. It is through this important work that we truly demonstrate the sacrificial love required to achieve Dr. King's ``Dream'' of an equal society. 
   Likewise, in order to realize Dr. King's ``Dream'' we must constantly work to improve our communities. Dr. King suggested that we will one day live in a society that encompasses all the principles for which he fought so hard and valiantly on April 3, 1968, the day before Dr. King's tragic death, he gave the following speech:  
   I don't know what will happen now. We've got some difficult days ahead. But it doesn't matter with me now, because I've been to the mountain top. And I don't mind. Like anybody, I would like to live a long life; longevity has its place. But I'm not concerned about that now. I just want to do God's will. And He's allowed me to go up to the mountain. And I've looked over. And I've seen the Promised Land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight that we as a people will get to the Promised Land. And I'm happy tonight, I'm not worried about anything. I'm not fearing any man. Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the lord.  
   The day before. 
   Let us keep pressing up the mountain. We are not in the Promised Land yet. We must keep his faith and his wisdom for our future. 
   We need to return to those basic values, which Dr. King promoted. Those values are work, family, and most important, the recognition of a higher moral authority. Only through those qualities will we become a nation truly worthy of Dr. King's legacy. Quoting again from Dr. King:  
   The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but.......at times of challenge and controversy. The true neighbor will risk his position, his prestige, and even his life for the welfare of others.  
   Indeed, Dr. King exemplified these qualities in his life. We should all join me in continuing his legacy. 
   So, as we start this legislative session on the day after we honor Dr. King, let us keep his principles in mind as we press forward in this Nation to the promised land. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.
