    Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, history gives us many examples of men and women who went above and beyond the call of duty to serve our great country. In our military, there have always been men and women who were not satisfied with maintaining the status quo, but who, instead, strove to make our armed forces the world's finest and the most powerful. One such individual was the late Colonel Robert F. Sink, commander of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment in Toccoa, Georgia. 
   The 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment was constituted on July 1, 1942 in the Army of the United States, activated July 20, 1942 at Camp General Robert Toombs at Toccoa, Georgia, attached to the 101st Airborne Division on June 1, 1943 and assigned to the 101st Airborne Division on March 1, 1945. The camp located at Currahee Mountain in Toccoa was soon renamed Camp Toccoa and was chosen because of its rugged terrain. The 506th Regiment selected the symbol of the Currahee Mountain as its Coat of Arms and ``Currahee'' became its battle cry. 
   It was here, in Toccoa, that Col. Sink initiated his rigorous training program called ``Muscle College'' and set many of the standards for the paratrooper basic training program of the 101st Airborne Division. Because of Col. Sink's efforts, the 506th Parachute Infantry established records never before reached by any military unit in the world. Furthermore, Airborne infantrymen around the nation recognized the ``Currahee trained'' men from Camp Toccoa as a cut above their peers in strength and performance. 
   Col. Sink led his 506th Regiment into combat on D-Day at Normandy, then to Holland, Bastogne, France, Germany, and all the way to Hitler's ``Eagle Nest.'' By the end of World War II, the 506th had received several coveted awards and decorations. The courageous service of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment was due, in no small measure, to the tireless efforts of Colonel Robert F. Sink, a true American hero. In honor of this great man, the Currahee Mountain Road, which changed the boys of the famous ``Currahee'' Regiment into men, will be fittingly renamed the ``Col. Robert F. Sink Memorial Trail.'' 
   I hope my colleagues will join with me today in honoring this great man and his groundbreaking work on behalf of our nation's security. For those under Colonel Sink's tutelage who will travel back to Toccoa for this important reunion and celebration, I wish you the best and thank you for your service. Finally, special thanks should be extended to State Representative Mary Jeanette Jamieson for her work on this project. It was a pleasure to be involved in such a worthy effort.

   Mr. MILLER. I, too, would like to offer a few comments relative to the Brunswick Harbor deepening project. Although I have been a member of the Senate for only a short while, I certainly understand the importance of this project and I fully support the inclusion of funds to keep it on schedule. Brunswick handles cargoes important to the region such as grain, gypsum, limestone, perlite, potash, oats, wood pulp, and motor vehicles. As the region has grown, so has the size of the vessels calling on the Port. I am very concerned that if we further delay the deepening project, we run the risk of hindering economic growth. This concern is underscored by the fact that the number of operational delays has increased by 36 percent since 1984. I believe that it is essential to stay the course and keep the project on schedule, and I join my colleague in urging the inclusion of $255,000 to support the administrative tasks which must be completed this year.

   Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, to the distinguished Members of the Senate, first let me say how much I appreciate those very generous welcoming remarks. 
   I do not rise this morning to tell you more about myself or to introduce myself to you because there will be time enough for that later. I rise instead to add my voice to the remarkable chorus that has echoed forth from this floor to the marble floors under Georgia's Capitol dome, a chorus of praise for PAUL COVERDELL. The pain and the love that the majority leader showed as he made that terrible announcement on the Senate floor touched many hearts in Georgia. The eloquence of Senator MOYNIHAN's tribute still rings in our ears. And the personal tribute from Senator GRAMM, a native son of Georgia, I found especially moving. When he spoke of PAUL as a man with a thin body, a squeaky voice, but the heart of a lion, heads were nodding and eyes were misting up from the Potomac River to the Chattahoochee River. 
   Then this morning, I sat in the gallery and listened to the outpouring of love and praise you had for Senator COVERDELL. 
   On behalf of the people of Georgia, I thank you. I thank you for your words and your tears and your testimony to one of Georgia's finest sons. 
   You who served with PAUL knew him well. I served with PAUL and knew him well also. I served with him when he was an up-and-coming State Senator and I was the Senate President--PAUL, a Republican; I, a Democrat. Yet PAUL impressed me with his ability and his integrity and his bipartisan commitment to serving the people first and politics second that I named him as one of the first Republican committee chairmen since Reconstruction in our heavily Democratic State senate. 
   In that job and in that State senate, PAUL flourished. He reached across party lines to build coalitions to reform education, improve our schools, and open up our government to the people. 
   Later, as the Director of the Peace Corps, PAUL's dignity and decency inspired countless young people to serve their fellow man; and then his service in this Senate, where in less than 8 years he rose to be one of the most influential, respected, and beloved Members of this august body. 
   Now, when I think of PAUL COVERDELL, I am reminded of St. Paul's letter to Timothy. It is as if it were written by Senator PAUL rather than St. Paul: I have fought a good fight. I have finished my course. I have kept the faith. 
   Today it is up to us to take up that fight, to continue that course, to keep that faith. 
   You are, of course, aware of PAUL's tireless work here in this body on behalf of the schoolchildren of this country. Yet his work here was just an extension of his lifelong commitment to education. We served together as trustees on the board of that tiny college, Young Harris College, in the tiny village that is my hometown.
