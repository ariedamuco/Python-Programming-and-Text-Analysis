Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, on September 10, 1998, in my role as Chairman of the Subcommittee on International Economic Policy, Export and Trade Promotion, I chaired the Foreign Relations Committee hearing on two important treaties that the Senate will ratify today. I refer to the World Intellectual Property Organization Copyright Treaty (WCT) and the World Intellectual Property Organization Performances and Phonograms Treaty (WPPT), collectively known as the WIPO Treaties, done at Geneva on December 20, 1996, and signed by the United States on April 12, 1997. These treaties will play a key role in assuring U.S. global competitiveness in the electronic commerce marketplace of the 21st century. 
The purpose of the WIPO Treaties is to respond to the challenges of protecting copyrighted works, performances and sound recordings in the realm of digital technology. The adoption of these treaties represents a major step toward achieving adequate protection of intellectual property in the growing global economy. Bringing these treaties into effect will greatly facilitate global electronic commerce, and will facilitate exports and foreign sales of U.S. copyrighted materials in markets around the world. 
In the hearing I chaired regarding the WIPO Treaties, the Foreign Relations Committee heard testimony from representatives of the Administration and from the information technology, telecommunications, and motion picture industries, including Jack Valenti, President and CEO of the Motion Picture Association of America, as well as from a coalition of educational and library interests. All the witnesses gave their overwhelming support for U.S. ratification of the WIPO Treaties. However, the main message that came from the hearing was that the WIPO Treaties needed to pass in conjunction with the corresponding implementation legislation that would update current U.S. copyright laws. We will have accomplished that task. 
On October 8, 1998, the Senate unanimously passed the conference report to H.R. 2281, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. This legislation will allow for the full implementation of the WIPO Treaties, by modifying current U.S. law in a few areas to meet the obligations imposed by the treaties and to ensure that liability questions are clearly defined in the treaties. U.S. copyright laws are strong and are vigorously enforced. However, these changes were needed to bring them up to date so U.S. law fell into compliance with the WIPO Treaties. 
American creativity is the key to our competitiveness in this global economy. With so many industries in the United States protected by copyright--such as the computer software, music, recording, audio-visual and publishing industries--being among the most dynamic and fastest-growing sectors of the U.S. economy, it is important to protect these industries. In 1996, in a study commissioned by the International Intellectual Property Alliance, it was estimated that the U.S. creative industries contributed almost $280 billion to the Gross Domestic Product, and accounted for some 3.5 million jobs, surpassing any single manufacturing sector by both measures. Most important, the estimated $60 billion of foreign sales and exports by the U.S. copyright industries in 1996 made them the leading export sector of the entire economy. Consequently, the strength of legal protection in other countries for U.S. copyrighted materials is a key factor in promoting our global competitiveness. 
The growth of digital networks such as the Internet offers an exciting opportunity for enhanced access by U.S. creators to world markets, but also presents a threat in the form of increased digital piracy of American works of authorship. The same technology that enables rapid and efficient authorized dissemination of U.S. copyrighted materials around the world also enables pirates to make and distribute perfect copies of these materials without authorization, more rapidly and efficiently then ever before, and with less risk of detection. Network-based digital piracy threatens to inflict losses on American creators that dwarf the estimated $18-20 billion which our creative industries now lose to overseas piracy every year. For these reasons, I plan to hold a hearing next year in my subcommittee on International Economic Policy, Export and Trade Promotion on the effects of software piracy on the U.S. economy as well as the global economy. 
Given the leading role of the U.S. creative industries in the global trade in computer software, music and recordings, and published test materials, it is clearly in the U.S. national interest for the WIPO Treaties to come into force as soon as possible. Prompt U.S. ratification of the treaties will send a clear message to other countries and will provide critical momentum to the drive to bring the treaties into force. 
I urge my colleagues to approve the Resolution of Ratification, and thus complete the process of giving the Senate's advice and consent to these two important treaties.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I wish to thank my friend, the distinguished chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, for the time. I also wish to acknowledge, with a great amount of respect, the work that he has done on the Omnibus appropriations bill. He has done this work after being placed in an almost impossible situation, being placed in a situation not of his making. Nonetheless, the quality of his effort and leadership is recognized in this Capitol, as it has been for many years. I, too, wish to recognize that. 
With that said, I rise today to oppose the omnibus appropriations bill. In my opinion, this bill is the irresponsible product of a dishonest process. It is wrong for America, and I will vote against it. 
For the first time in a generation, this Congress balanced the Federal budget. We had a chance to deliver--deliver real tax relief for the second year in a row. Instead, we began to drift early this year by failing to pass an annual budget resolution--the first year without a budget resolution since the Budget Act became law in 1974. Now we have this unaccountable bill that gives away much of our hard-fought budget success. 
It is humanly impossible for any of us in this Congress to know all that is in this bill. Some parts were still changing as recently as yesterday, and the full text of the bill was not available even to most U.S. Senators until almost noon today. It will take months for us to study the more than 3,000 pages of text and learn what is in it. Yet, we are asked to vote on this package, up or down, no amendments, with a couple of hours of debate. Take it or leave it. 
Mr. President, that is irresponsible. That is irresponsible. We cannot forget that the American people are watching. We have to take a step back from all of this, from the swirl of negotiations and the deal-making--oh, yes, there has been a lot of deal-making--and 
remember who pays the bills. Whose money is it? We seem to forget whose money we are dealing with. We talk about a billion here, and a billion there--$100 billion. Now we are up to over $500 billion in this bill. This money comes from the pockets of the American taxpayer. It is their money. It is not the Congress' money. And they are watching. The American taxpayers are watching. They are watching how we spend their hard-earned money. 
We don't have very good answers, certainly not in this bill. None of us knows, or could possibly know everything that the money is going for--the taxpayers' money is going for--in this bill, or how many millions of dollars have been tucked away for special projects for individual Members thrown in at the last minute behind the curtain deals. Can anyone possibly believe that this mindless process gives the American people any confidence that Congress knows what is going on, or Congress knows what it is doing, or Congress knows or cares about how we spend the taxpayers' money? The American people look at this process, and they turn away in disgust, as they should. 
I want to share with this body, Mr. President, a couple of comments from letters and e-mail I have received from constituents in Nebraska in the last 48 hours. 
This one comes from Mr. Lee Hamann of Elkhorn, NE. He writes: 
Absolutely incredible. The 100,000-teacher item is another hoax, just like the 100,000-police-officer scam a few years ago--that the Congress and President Clinton pulled on America. Where do the local governmental bodies get the money to continue to pay these new positions after the Federal money runs out? And who says we need 100,000 new teachers? 
Who invented that number? 
One of the biggest problems in funding education is that the majority of the money is not being spent on teachers; it's going to administration. Compliance with Federal mandates [and regulations] and a whole host of other politically correct nonsense that has nothing to do with teaching our children and maintaining good discipline in schools. If Congress wants to do something positive for education, then give us a realistic school voucher system and allow parents to deduct tuition to private schools [church or secular]. 
This comes from a constituent, a taxpayer. 
Another one from Mr. Michael J. Snyder from Edison, NE. He writes: 
I would like to have seen a tax cut for the family. Not everybody in Nebraska farms. 
Not everybody is going to get some of the extra money.  
There are some of us who would like to see a cut in our income tax so that we would be able to keep more of our own money to use for our own purposes. I think we can find better ways to use it than the Federal Government. 
Another one from David Begley from Omaha, NE. He says: 
Why do all the appropriations bills get done at the last minute and then the President threatens to shut down the Government and blame the Republicans? 
Who is in charge back there? 
Good question. 
Mr. President, I understand very well that our democracy requires compromise. There is much room for honorable give and take in negotiations--honest, open, honorable negotiations. I am well aware that our negotiators had to face a President who pushed again and again and again for irresponsible new spending programs. I did not expect this bill to be absolutely pure and free from all blemishes. None of us did. But there must be a limit. This bill gave up too much. This bill busts the budget. This bill busts the budget by more than $20 billion. 
I don't believe the Founding Fathers of this country ever intended for a few Members and staff to make more than one-half of a trillion dollars worth of arbitrary, closed-door decisions for the rest of us, for America--almost one-third of the Federal budget--and then present them to all other Senators and Representatives, men and women elected by the people of this country, by the taxpayers, and then say take it or leave it, an up-or-down vote. No debate, no amendments. This process, Mr. President, is not worthy of the U.S. Senate. 
Instead of cutting taxes, paying down the national debt, or even `saving Social Security,' this bill squanders the first budget surplus in almost three decades. Almost one-third of the projected surplus is going to more than $20 billion of new spending not paid for by offsetting it, by cutting any other spending. Instead of reflecting the priorities of the American people, this bill reflects on the priorities of the minority in Congress, such as $1.2 billion in new Federal money to pacify the National Education Association. 
Instead of less regulation, this bill gives us more government. 
It includes a provision that will hamstring Federal prosecutors by subjecting them to a patchwork of State ethical guidelines. On its merits, this provision never would have survived the U.S. Senate. 
It includes $192.5 million for the Global Environmental 
Facility, even though, Mr. President, the Senate and the House had rejected this level of funding. We had actually rejected it. And this is to advance a treaty, the Global Warming Treaty, that the administration does not have the guts to send to this body to debate. They don't have the guts to do it, because they know it would be defeated. But, yet, through back-door spending--and what we have given up after the House and the Senate said we weren't--but yet this is now put in this bill. We are allowing this administration to get away with it. How did something like this get into this bill? 
Of course, this bill also includes much that is good, much that I support and fought for, along with Chairman Stevens and others. I worked hard, like many of us, to win full funding and reforms for the International Monetary Fund. 
I strongly support the agricultural relief provisions and many provisions of this bill. But we should have the guts to stand up and say these and other important programs are priorities. And we should have the courage--we should have the courage--to tell the American public how we are going to pay for it. We shouldn't use budget gimmicks to hide what we have spent. 
This bill includes a full range of spending by the Federal Government, and it should have been subject to the full range and full scrutiny of honest, open debate. It should have been subject to debate and amendment--the most powerful, the most powerful and important tools available for the U.S. Senators to carry out their constitutional responsibilities. But, instead, this bill is presented to us without opportunity for amendment or opportunity to really know what is in this bill. Over 3,000 pages make up this bill. 
This `omnibus' bill also includes several authorization bills--policy bills--that should have risen or fallen on their own merits, not by finding their way into this unamendable tome. Congress should set new government policy when ideas are fully debated. Congress should set new government policies when ideas are amended and considered, and defined and voted for--not when a small group of negotiators decides that idea or this idea has merit. But this `omnibus' bill includes entire policy bills included in this one-half-trillion-dollar, over-3,000-page document. 
Many of these policy bills have been slipped in from overhauls of immigration policy to regulation of the Internet. Seven separate antidrug authorization bills were slipped into this `omnibus' bill. And we can't amend any of it. We can't shape it, change it, influence it, delete it. We can't do our jobs as representatives of the American people. 
Mr. President, this is not how the U.S. Senate should operate. The American people deserve better, and until recently they got better. 
Throughout the 1980s--let's go back to the 1980s--Congress did business by passing `omnibus' bills, or `continuing resolutions' very much like this one. These were unaccountable, pork-laden bills that ran thousands of pages like this bill. They made a mockery of accountability of our democratic process. And then in 1988, many of you will remember that President Reagan stood up against what he described as `. . . monstrous continuing resolutions that pack hundreds of billions of dollars worth of spending into one bill. . . .' 
In his very memorable State of the Union Address, he stacked 3,296 pages of budget bills weighing 43 pounds at the podium in the House of Representatives and implored Congress, `Let's change all this.' 
President Reagan called on Congress to pass spending bills the right way--the right way--one at a time, and he pledged to veto any future continuing resolutions. For 8 years, from 1988 through 1996, Congress did its work, as it should, as the American people expected, and passed individual appropriations bills in full and open debate. 
Then Congress started slipping into an old pattern. The omnibus bill that year, in 1996, rolled six of the 13 annual appropriations bills into one. This year is worse, one of the worst ever, including eight of the annual appropriations bills, plus authorization bills, in this omnibus appropriations bill. 
It is time for us to stand up before this old process takes new root. It is time once more to look at ourselves and declare: Let's change this. I will vote against this bill because I believe it is wrong and the process is wrong. I believe the right thing to do is to kill this bill and for Congress to keep working for the rest of this year, if it takes that, until we do this right. 
I believe we should worry less about the elections and polls and government by calculation and more about doing our jobs, the jobs the American people sent us here to do. But more importantly, I believe we will all work hard--I will--to prevent this unaccountable process from ever happening again. 
A top priority for this new Congress, the 106th Congress, that will be seated in January of next year must be, must be, to make the necessary changes and reforms to keep the budget process on track. Perhaps we should enact biennial budgeting and appropriations. The distinguished chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Senator Domenici, has talked of this; Senator Stevens has talked of this. Or we make other changes to ensure that we will put an end to this moonlight madness. This must stop. 
Mr. President, this is not Halloween. This isn't trick-or-treat time. This is serious business. I am prepared to work with the Senate's bipartisan leadership, with all my colleagues, to make these changes occur. The American taxpayers expect and deserve better. We owe it to the people who pay the bills. 
My colleagues, we can change this nonsense. We must change this nonsense. 
I yield the floor, and I thank my friend, the distinguished chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, the Senate is debating the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998. In its current form, this bill is a careful compromise that has been months in the making. I had serious concerns about earlier versions of this legislation, but I am a cosponsor of today's compromise. 
I am confident that we have crafted the right balance among different facets of American foreign policy. Economic freedom and individual liberties are not competitors--they go hand-in-hand! We want nations that are free, that respect rights and liberties, and that have free trade and market economies. 
This is a bill that will focus America's attention on the desire to advance religious freedom around the world while doing no harm to America's national security, diplomatic or economic interests abroad. This is a bill that will give the President flexibility to craft a complete foreign policy--a foreign policy that does not elevate one facet of our foreign relations above all others. 
Religious freedom and tolerance have always been America's creed. Freedom of religion is the first freedom guaranteed in our Bill of Rights. No person anywhere in the world--no Christian, no Jew, no Hindu, no Muslim, no Buddhist, no Baha'i . . . no one--should suffer at the hand of the State for worshiping as he or she sees fit. As a beacon of liberty and freedom, America has a moral duty to speak out against religious persecution around the world and to defend for people everywhere the fundamental right of freedom of worship. 
At the same time, this bill recognizes that America bears a heavy and complicated burden of international leadership. Our relationships with other nations are complex, and our policies must reflect those complexities. American leadership is essential for international peace and security, free and open trade, a stable international economy and many other vital matters. Like all leaders, America must balance competing needs, interests and ideals. 
This bill gives the President flexibility to use the full power of American engagement to promote religious liberties abroad. America's strong commercial and diplomatic ties with other nations remain our most effective leverage to alter the behavior of authoritarian governments. American engagement abroad acts as a catalyst for change. The United States government cannot mandate religious freedom around the world, but America can lead the world in spreading respect for religious beliefs--just as we used the power of our example and determination to spread liberty, democracy and economic freedom around the globe. 
This bill will focus U.S. government attention on religious persecution. It will make religious freedom part of American diplomacy from the training of foreign service officers to the granting of visa requests to the use of our embassy facilities. 
This bill also will shine the light of day on countries, or entities within countries, that engage in religious persecution. It will require annual reporting on the state of religious freedom in every country, as well as annual publication of all actions the United States Government is taking around the world to promote religious liberty. 
And, this bill establishes an orderly procedure for the President to consider taking targeted, calibrated actions against the most severe violators of religious liberty. 
This compromise gives the President the flexibility he needs to conduct a balanced foreign policy. 
The President will have substantial flexibility to calibrate the most appropriate action to help change the behavior of the worst violators of religious freedom, including broad waiver authority and broad latitude to take actions other than sanctions. 
Congress will not be required to undertake a new series of counterproductive `mini-MFN' or `mini-drug decertification' debates about religious persecution around the world. 
The Commission on International Religious Freedom established by the bill will make recommendations but will have no official role in shaping U.S. foreign policy. 
And the President will have substantial flexibility in deciding when and how to identify countries that will be subject to action under this bill. There will be no diplomatically damaging `list' of countries that violate religious freedoms. 
Mr. President, this is not a perfect bill. But it is a good bill. Congress cannot, by passing a law, put an end to religious persecution outside our borders. But we can ensure that America speaks out with one voice, with a strong voice, to make clear that we will not stand idle while people suffer because of their faith. 
This bill will amplify America's voice for freedom. It will strengthen the President's ability to craft a complete foreign policy in which the whole of America's national interests is not held captive to any single dynamic. Security, economics, diplomacy, trade, human rights, individual liberties--these are all part of America's national interests around the world. We can, we must, promote them all--we cannot afford to sacrifice any interest for any other interest. 
When Congress returns next year, we should continue the effort to expand American engagement abroad--by passing fast track trade negotiating authority, by reforming outdated and counterproductive sanctions regimes, by reviewing every international institution in which America participates to ensure they are relevant to today's challenges. And we must strengthen our military, which is the guarantor of our foreign policy. American leadership in all those areas is essential if we are to effectively promote individual liberties--including religious liberties--around the world. 
We should pass this bill. And then Congress should resist the temptation to legislate further on this matter in the months and years ahead, and give this comprehensive new framework for religious freedom a chance to work. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I want to very briefly reflect for a moment on the prayer just offered by the Rev. Robert Kem of Saint Andrew's Episcopal Church in Omaha. It happens, Mr. President, that is the church where my family and I often are seen--more over the few years previous to the last 2 years, because of our recent change to our residency here in Washington. 
Father Kem's guidance, and what that has meant to us as he continues to give spiritual guidance to so many, has been unique. He is known far outside the boundaries of just the Midwest. I think that is quite evident by the elegance of his prayer and his eloquent statement, reflecting on who we are as a Nation: All creatures, children of God. For Father Kem coming before this body today to offer guidance and prayer and hope, I am grateful. We are all better for Father Kem. To all the parishioners, those a part of the Saint Andrew's Episcopal family in Omaha, we know you are proud, as are we in the U.S. Senate. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. HAGEL. For the information of all Senators, in light of this agreement, the leader expects the Senate to resume the agriculture appropriations conference report tomorrow morning. In addition, tomorrow afternoon, the leader expects the Senate to resume the Internet tax bill. Therefore, votes could occur with respect to that bill, as well. A cloture vote on the Internet tax bill will occur Wednesday at 10 a.m. 
Assuming cloture is invoked, the Senate would then remain on the Internet tax bill until disposed of. Therefore, votes can be expected throughout the day and evening on Wednesday. 
Having said all of that, there will be no further votes this evening, and Members can expect votes prior to noon tomorrow.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, on Monday the Senate will convene at 11 a.m. and begin a period of morning business until 2 p.m. Following morning business, it will be the leader's intention to begin consideration of the Agriculture appropriations conference report under a short time agreement. The Senate may also resume consideration of S. 442, the Internet tax bill. 
At 5:30 p.m., under a previous order, the Senate will proceed to a vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to H.R. 10, the financial services modernization bill. Further votes could occur following the cloture vote in relation to the motion to proceed, and if consent is granted, votes on or in relation to the agriculture conference report, the Internet tax bill, or any other legislative or executive items cleared for action. 
Members are reminded that a cloture petition was filed today on the Internet tax bill. That vote will occur on Tuesday. Therefore, Members have until 1 p.m. on Monday to file first-degree amendments.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, foreign policy to Nebraskans and many Americans is not theory or some abstraction suspended between university classrooms, State Department corridors, or congressional hearing rooms. Foreign policy is the framework policy for America's interests in the world--trade and commerce, national security, financial markets, international economics, coalitions and alliances, narcotics policy, technology, immigration, all part of foreign policy. Foreign policy is America's future. It represents the complete and integrated policy that affects every dynamic of American life. Foreign policy connects all other policies. The world is interconnected. And the one overarching policy process America has to engage the world is foreign policy. 
President Kennedy spoke of new frontiers in his 1961 inaugural address. He spoke of the long-term challenges in the long twilight struggle against communism. Today, just as in 1961, and throughout history, mankind has been presented with new sets of challenges and new frontiers. These new challenges dominate after every global transformation. President Bush's new book deals directly with our present-day world transformation-- `A World Transformed'--and we recall President Kennedy's words in that inaugural speech and apply them to the challenges of the 21st century.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, who controls time on the Kyl amendment? 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOCNO>105-hagel-ne-2-19980902</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I yield myself such time that I will need to complete my statement. 
Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment of my friend, Senator Kyl. Six months ago this body spoke very clearly and strongly on IMF. We voted 84-16 to approve a strong IMF package that has two parts: Strong and achievable IMF reforms and the full $17.9 billion funding for America's IMF contribution. 
The IMF reform and funding language in the foreign operations bill today is identical to the reform package of the Senate-passed bill 6 months ago. We should not now start second-guessing ourselves and undoing what we have done. We should stand by the solid reforms and the funding package that won 84 votes in March. 
The Kyl amendment would replace that carefully crafted language with a different and untested mechanism for reform, a mechanism that we considered but abandoned on the Senate floor early in our negotiation 6 months ago. I might add, Mr. President, this was after very long and detailed consultations with the Federal Reserve Chairman, Alan Greenspan, the Treasury Secretary, Bob Rubin, and many others. 
Along with Senator McConnell, Appropriations Chairman Stevens, Senator Gramm, Senator Biden and others, I helped craft the reforms that passed the Senate. We negotiated the reforms carefully, with the involvement of many Senators. It took weeks, many weeks. We worked word by word, line by line to present something to this body that was achievable, workable. The package we passed in March and includes meaningful IMF reforms that are also achievable. 
We recognize that America alone cannot shape the world economy. So we required in our reform language the G-7 countries to come together to help reform the IMF. These reforms consist of the following: Reforms so IMF will require recipient countries to live up to their international trade obligations; reform so IMF will require recipient countries to eliminate crony capitalism and clean up corruption; reforms that will improve transparency of IMF operations, and to encourage bankruptcy law reforms in recipient countries. 
Mr. President, these are not funny reforms. These are not patsy, weak reforms. The new IMF funding will go forward, but not until the Treasury Department succeeds in getting these reforms accomplished at the IMF. This is written into the reform legislation. These reforms are real and they will make a real difference at the IMF. 
It would be absolutely irresponsible for Congress to shrug off the IMF as economies around the globe falter. We should not go backwards. America must continue to lead. The Senate must continue to lead. Global events, such as we have talked about today, yesterday, and will continue to talk about, have demonstrated even more forcefully the need for the U.S. to support the IMF. 
Mr. President, the IMF is not perfect. It is not without flaws. It needs reform; indeed it needs reform. But, my goodness, at a time when we have economic chaos around the globe, we need many confidence builders, and the IMF institution in itself will not change this, but it will help. If we didn't have an IMF, what would we have? Would the United States want to step up to this alone? Would France or Germany? The second largest economy in the world--Japan--is in economic chaos, with no banking structure. We need some type of a mechanism to help address these issues. Asia was burning when the Senate acted 6 months ago. Now that fire has engulfed Russia and is spreading to Latin America. Our own economy is feeling this heat. 
Mr. President, markets respond to confidence. Markets respond to confidence. Our debates today about IMF and other economic issues are not just about numbers, or about the arcane comparisons of one reform versus another reform. No, these debates are real and they are about sending a signal around the world. Is America engaged? Will we continue to lead? Or will America pull back? America's interests require us to help shore up confidence around the world. 
This debate is about America's interests. This is not esoteric. This is about America's interests, America's economic stability and global stability. The U.S. suffered a record trade deficit in May, the fourth consecutive month. Exports hit their lowest point in 15 months. Over the first 5 months of this year, America's trade deficit increased nearly 40 percent from the same period last year. Why is that? Many parts of America's economy are already feeling the pain of the spreading Asian `flu.' Wall Street is on a roller coaster ride. The farm economy is suffering, largely due to the loss of overseas markets. Corn and soybean exports are down more than 50 percent from 2 years ago. Wheat exports are down more than 30 percent. 
These economic problems will not be limited to American farmers and ranchers, and not even to America's investors. They will ripple through the economies of the Midwest and the rest of this Nation. Events around the world will continue to affect our economy here at home and global stability. When you have global instability, Mr. President, it goes far beyond economic instability. Global instability affects everything--our national defense, our interests and our economy. The situation in Japan is very dangerous. Many economies in Asia are clinging to Japan for support. Japan was a direct contributor to the financial package to Russia. I don't think I need to spell out to colleagues the disastrous effect of a significant downturn in the Japanese economy. Let me point out a headline from today's Washington Times: `Tokyo's Troubles Overshadow Russia's: With Bad Economic Decisions, Japan Could Start a Worldwide Recession.' 
This is not the time to lose our perspective and diddle and dawdle--reform versus technicality and reform versus technicality. This is the time for America to do the right thing, to step up and lead the world, help the IMF and insert the reforms that we passed by 84 votes last March. 
I want to close, Mr. President, by quoting the last paragraph of a letter from the U.S. Treasury Secretary, Bob Rubin, which he sent to the congressional leadership yesterday. He talks about the IMF. He talks about how broadly the IMF plays a role across the global economic scene: 
More broadly, a fully equipped IMF is in the economic interest of our important trading partners throughout the world. While we agree that the IMF needs reform, and are committed to continuing our strong efforts to achieve meaningful change, it remains an effective and indispensable tool in the management of the international economy. I respectfully urge you and your colleagues to act with the utmost dispatch to pass this legislation. 
Mr. President, the Senate should stand by the leadership 
that we provided on this issue in March. I respectfully suggest that my colleagues look at this Kyl amendment and defeat this Kyl amendment. Mr. President, I end by saying that when the time on the debate on this issue expires, I intend to make a motion to table the Kyl amendment. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. HAGEL. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, I rise to support, as an original cosponsor, the Family Investment and Rural Savings Tax Act of 1998. I thank the majority leader, Senator Lott, for working with many of us to make tax relief for farmers and ranchers a very top priority this year. 
Mr. President, I am not a farmer. When I want advice about agricultural issues, I ask farmers, I ask ranchers. About a month ago, the Senators offering this bill, and several others concerned about the problems facing rural America, agriculture today, right now, sat down with every major farm and commodity group in America. These representatives of American agriculture--real agriculture--told us the same thing I hear repeatedly from ranchers and farmers across my State of Nebraska: `We do not want to go back to the failed Government supply and demand policies of the past.' That is clear. They told us very clearly that there are three things--three things--Congress can do to help America's farmers and ranchers: One, open up more export markets; two, tax relief; and, three, reduce Government regulation. This, after all, Mr. President, was indeed the promise of the 1996 Freedom to Farm Act. 
Those of us on the floor today and our colleagues have been working very hard over the last few months to open more markets overseas, especially in the area of dealing with unilateral sanctions. And we are going to keep pushing aggressively for important export tools, important for all of America, not just American agriculture, important tools like fast track, and reform and complete funding for the IMF. 
This bill we are introducing today goes to the second point. It will provide real and meaningful tax relief, tax relief to America's agricultural producers. It will provide farmers and ranchers with the tools they need in managing the unique financial situations that they alone face on their farms and ranches. 
This bill has three provisions, which Senator Grassley has just outlined accurately and succinctly: One, the farm and ranch risk management accounts; two, the permanent extension of income averaging for farmers; and, three, reduction of capital gains rates not just for American agriculture but for all of America. 
Mr. President, I have said over the last 2 years I would like to see the capital gains tax completely eliminated. But that is a debate for another day. However, this bill is a major step in the right direction. This bill will mean lower taxes for our farmers and ranchers and many Americans. It is the right thing to do. 
I hope a majority of my colleagues will join us in support of this bill, an important bill for America, an important bill for our farmers and ranchers.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to add my tribute and honor to our fallen comrades and colleagues, Officers Chestnut and Gibson, whose bodies lie in state in the Capitol Rotunda just down the hall, where Members of the House and Senate paid tribute this morning. 
I am not nearly eloquent enough to express the feelings, certainly, that all of us have about what these two men did mean to us, what all of our officers, protectors, men and women who guard over us and our population that visits this great and magnificent Capitol, this Capitol that represents free men and women, this Capitol that represents the best hope for mankind, mean to us. 
What I would like to offer is a saying that I have found comforting over the years and I believe applies very much to our fallen heroes. And that saying goes like this--that man is a success who has lived well, laughed often, and loved much; who has gained the respect of men and the love of children, who leaves the world better than he found it, whether through an improved poppy, a perfect poem or a rescued soul, who never failed to appreciate the beauty of nature, and always gave the best he had.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I am offering this amendment today on behalf of myself, Senators Bennett, Nickles, Roberts, Helms, Shelby, Enzi, and Grams. 
Before I address this amendment, I want to say that I am grateful, as all our members on the Banking Committee, for Chairman D'Amato bringing this important piece of legislation up, focusing on it with some dispatch, getting it out of committee and onto the floor of the Senate. Also, I wish to thank the ranking member of the Banking Committee, Senator Sarbanes, for his leadership as well. 
As I suspect, both Chairman D'Amato and Senator Sarbanes are not going to agree with my amendment. Nevertheless, I am grateful that they have focused on this issue and provided the kind of leadership that is important on these financial service matters. 
Mr. President, I support credit unions and the cost-efficient service they provide to their members. 
Our amendment, which we are offering today, is not designed to hurt credit unions. To the contrary, our amendment is designed to keep credit unions strong, secure, and focused on their special role of serving consumers. It does that by preventing the unchecked expansion of credit unions into commercial lending. Currently, there are no limitations on how much commercial lending in which a credit union may engage. 
Let me emphasize that our amendment does not prevent credit unions from making commercial loans. 
Our amendment has essentially three main points: 
First, we would lower the commercial lending cap contained in H.R. 1151 from 12.25 percent of a credit union's assets to 7 percent of a credit union's assets. This would establish for the first time a cap on commercial lending by credit unions. But the cap currently contained in H.R. 1151 is arbitrary, and because of an accounting loophole, is essentially meaningless. 
We share with the authors of H.R. 1151 the belief that credit union commercial lending should be limited. But we also believe those limits should be relevant and be meaningful. The 12.25 percent of assets commercial lending cap now in H.R. 1151 is completely arbitrary. Our amendment's 7-percent cap is tied directly to the amount of capital that H.R. 1151 requires a `well-capitalized' credit union to keep in reserve. 
Let me explain what this means. 
Credit unions, like all other financial institutions, are required by their regulators to keep a certain amount of ready capital on hand as a cushion in case of hard times--a sort of `rainy day' fund. H.R. 1151 would, for the first time, establish a target amount of capital that a well-capitalized credit union should keep in reserve, and would prohibit credit unions from making commercial loans if they fall too far below that target. By tying commercial loans dollar for dollar to capital reserves, we strengthen the safety and soundness of credit unions that choose to engage in business lending. We must make sure that credit unions cannot risk more of their loan portfolio on commercial ventures than they have reserve capital ready to back up the loans if those loans go bad. 
We protect the consumer. We protect the credit union members. Credit unions would have a 3-year grace period to comply with this cap. 
Our amendment will help H.R. 1151 to better achieve its main purpose, which is described, by the way, in the Banking Committee report on H.R. 1151. This is the actual language coming out of the Senate Banking Committee. And I quote: 
. . . [to] ensure that credit unions continue to fulfill their specified mission of meeting the credit and savings needs of consumers, especially persons of modest means, through an emphasis on consumer rather than business loans. 
Second, our amendment would require that all of a credit union's commercial loans must count toward its cap. 
Current National Credit Union Administration policy, which would be codified by H.R. 1151, excludes any commercial loans made to a single member that totals less than $50,000 from being counted as commercial loans. 
Mr. President, you heard it right. That is right. Current regulations, which H.R. 1151 would codify, say that a commercial loan is not a commercial loan if it is less than $50,000. 
With this loophole, there is no accurate, full, or honest accounting for commercial lending in credit unions. This makes no sense. No other financial institution enjoys this sort of charade and slight of hand. This loophole makes any commercial lending cap meaningless, because it permits an unlimited number of commercial loans so long as each of those loans is less than $50,000. 
Our amendment would require truth in accounting--truth in accounting--for all commercial loans. 
Third, our amendment codifies current NCUA policy that requires a credit union to use qualified personnel to administer commercial loans. Our language states that a commercial loan officer must have 2 years experience in his field. This is a commonsense provision that needs to be codified. For those smaller credit unions that feel this would be a new regulatory burden, there are three responses. 
We are simply codifying current NCUA policy, and we provide a 3-year phase-in for compliance with this provision. The experience requirement will not force credit unions who make a few small commercial loans to hire a full-time staffer. The NCUA's general counsel has stated that this requirement could be met by hiring contract assistance on a case-by-case basis. 
This is a very basic safety and soundness provision. 
Let me be very clear about what our amendment does not do. 
Our amendment does not--does not--restrict credit for farmers, small business owners, or low-income areas that rely on credit unions. 
That's because H.R. 1151, as reported by the Banking Committee, already contains several generous exceptions to the commercial lending cap--and our amendment does nothing to change these important exceptions. The four exceptions are: 
First, a credit union that is primarily engaged in business lending, which includes agricultural and small business lending, will not be subject to the commercial lending cap. That means those credit unions that qualify for this exemption can make agriculture or small business loans without any limits. 
Second, a credit union that is chartered for the purpose of business lending will not be subject to the cap. This means an agriculture co-op credit union would be exempt from the cap. 
Third, a credit union that serves predominantly low-income members will be exempt from the cap. This ensures that low-income areas, many of them located in urban areas, are not hurt by the new commercial lending restrictions. 
Fourth, a credit union that is determined to be a `community development financial institution,' as defined in existing banking law, will be exempt from the cap. This exception is intended to help low-income community development efforts across the Nation. 
Mr. President, only 13 percent of the 11,400 credit unions across this country, including Federal- and State-chartered, have any commercial loans at all. That is according to the Credit Union National Association. 
Our amendment has absolutely no effect on the other 87 percent of credit unions that choose not to make commercial loans. 
And even of that 13 percent of credit unions that are in the commercial lending business, the vast majority will not be restricted by the 7 percent of assets cap that our amendment proposes. That is because commercial loans currently constitute only 1 percent of total credit union assets, according to the Credit Union National Association. 
Why should credit unions be subject to a meaningful commercial lending cap? There are several answers to that question. 
First, credit unions, as stated in the preamble of the Federal Credit Union Act of 1934, were created by Congress to make, and I quote from the preamble: `credit more available to people of small means.' To achieve this goal, Congress exempted credit unions from paying Federal income taxes. Credit unions do not pay any Federal income taxes. When thrifts were exempt from income taxes before 1952, Congress prohibited them from making any commercial loans because of their tax-exempt status. 
A second reason to have meaningful limits on commercial lending is to ensure fair competition--competition between small banks and credit unions in the commercial lending arena. Credit unions' tax exemption allows them to offer lower interest rates on loans and higher interest rates on savings accounts and certificates of deposit. 
The third reason to have meaningful limits on commercial lending is to protect taxpayers by ensuring the safety and soundness of the credit union system. The Federal Government stands behind each credit union depositor, insuring deposits up to $100,000. If a serious financial crisis in the credit union system depleted the Credit Union Share Insurance Fund--which is Federal deposit insurance for credit unions--then the Federal Government would have to step in with taxpayer funds to protect depositors against loss. 
I have several concerns about credit union safety and soundness: 
First, unlike banks and thrifts, credit unions--as non-profit entities--cannot issue stock to replenish their capital reserves during hard times. That's a real weakness when a quick capital infusion is needed--such as during a time of defaults, 
such as during the 1980s when we all recall the tragedy of the S&Ls, when capital levels fell quickly and new capital was required immediately. 
Second, we've seen commercial loans put credit unions in danger before. Rhode Island experienced a credit union crisis in 1991 that resulted in the failure of a State-chartered private deposit insurance fund. The crisis was, in part, caused by excessive and risky commercial lending. Thirteen of the State's credit unions were permanently closed, and the state sought Federal assistance to repay depositors. 
Third, by their own admission, credit unions make loans to those who don't qualify for credit at banks. 
This is their strength. This is the strength of a credit union, serving those who do not receive service at traditional financial institutions. However, this is also a very important area of concern, because this means credit unions are many times making very high risk loans to people whose credit history makes them ineligible for loans elsewhere. 
Fourth, all banks and thrifts are required to abide by risk-based capital standards. This means they must set aside more capital, depending on how risky their loans are. Unfortunately, credit unions don't have risk-based capital standards today. Now, H.R. 1151 makes a weak, valiant but weak, attempt to address this issue by regulating capital standards for `complex credit unions,' but that effort is neither clear nor meaningful. That is why our 7-percent-of-assets cap, which ties credit union commercial loans dollar for dollar to capital reserves, makes sense. This protects the credit union members whose money is at risk. 
In summary, our amendment strengthens the safety and soundness of credit unions with open and honest accounting. It brings market fairness to the relationship between tax-exempt credit unions and tax-paying small community banks, and it refocuses the original intent of credit unions on consumer loans and services. I hope my colleagues will support this important amendment.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, may I respond to my friend and chairman. He made some good points, legitimate questions, as did the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee. 
Let me first assure my friend from New York what this amendment is about. It is not about mischief-making. It is not about burdening credit unions. It is about things like open, honest accounting. I just don't understand why anyone would reject or object to a clear understanding of what the commercial loan portfolio is for any credit union. Why would you object to taking any loan, a commercial loan, under $50,000, and putting it in an appropriate accounting category in a portfolio? It is not about burdening the accounting process. It is about open, honest accounting. 
When my friend talks about burdening these small credit unions by forcing them to bring in professionals who have had a minimum of 2 years in commercial lending, you mention my amendment, did I understand my amendment. I understand it, I think, fairly well, and I will read you from what we say in here. We talk about the NCUA's general counsel position on this, as has stated that the requirement that we put in this amendment could be met by hiring contract assistants on a case-by-case basis. 
Now, this should be, like any financial institution, about solid accounting. I don't know of anybody who doesn't agree with that or who would not want that, so that the members of a credit union know exactly how large the commercial portfolio is of the credit union they belong to. 
There are a couple of other things I want to address, including the issue of large credit unions who would have to scale back within a month or two, or would have to cash in their loans. I read, Mr. President, from the Banking Committee document here on page 10 of the report. It talks about the four exemptions; the four exemptions are pretty clear. You know about these: `Loans for such purposes as agriculture, self-employment, small business, large up-front investment, maintenance. . . .' And it goes on and on. These are all areas that are exempt from my amendment. 
Let's also talk about what this bill is doing and what the House bill did in response to the Supreme Court decision. We now, in effect, have no common bond anymore at all. There is no common bond at all. Now, if there is no common bond left in the credit union policy philosophy--getting somewhat to what my colleague and friend from Utah has been talking about--then is it not appropriate to probe somewhat, saying, well, if we all want to live with the 1934, 1937 statute that says no taxes, but also no common bond, and no this, no that--I am not sure that is a very wise thing to do. 
If we are going to have some changes--and markets change and the financial service industry is dynamic, as demands change, needs change, supply changes--then it is appropriate to focus on some of these areas I believe we have focused on. The chairman is right. His mark that came out of committee was much better, much more responsible, much more accountable than the House version. He is exactly right. 
What Senator Bennett and I and others are saying is that we need to continue to focus on some of these areas of great concern, because when you open up credit unions to where they are now going to be opened up, where there is absolutely no common bond, and then you say, well, you can go forward and lend commercially, yet, don't bother us with the facts, we are not going to count any commercial loan less than $50,000, and we really don't have a good accounting as to how much is in the commercial loan portfolio, then I am not sure how accountable and responsible that is. 
So those are just a couple of items that I wanted to address. These are important issues. These are important questions. This is an important issue. With that, I appreciate an opportunity to further explain some of the dynamics of our amendment. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. BENNETT addressed the Chair.

Mr. HAGEL. I thank the Chair. 
Madam President, I am a supporter of credit unions. I have been a member of a credit union. I have been on the board of a credit union. I support the original charter for their original purpose. But if we are going to change the rules and allow tax-exempt credit unions to get more and more into commercial lending and have essentially unlimited access to new members, with the common bond being realistically eliminated, then additional safety and soundness measures are going to have to be required. My amendment strengthens the safety and soundness of credit unions with open and honest accounting. It brings some market fairness to the relationship between tax-exempt credit unions and tax-paying small community banks, and it refocuses on the original intent of credit unions--on consumer loans and services. 
I encourage my colleagues to vote against tabling the Hagel-Bennett amendment. Vote no. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. HAGEL. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, I rise to support this amendment sponsored by my good friend and colleague, the senior Senator from Nebraska, Senator Kerrey. 
As Senator Kerrey has very directly stated, this amendment is an attempt to bring some much-needed common sense--common sense, Mr. President, common sense--to the EPA regulatory process. We are not in any way attempting to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act. 
I commend my colleague from Rhode Island, the distinguished chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, Senator Chafee, for his hard work in crafting this bill over the years and having brought it up to date and focused on what is important, and that is to protect the safety of our drinking water. It is important that we be clear on this point. We are not attempting to amend the Public Works Committee's hard efforts, the Safe Drinking Water Act. No attempt is being made to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act. 
What we are asking here is EPA delay the enforcement of copper regulations until the completion of scientific studies that are already underway. Regulations imposed by the EPA on copper levels in drinking water are unrealistic and will impose financial hardships on a number of communities in Nebraska. Is it too much to ask--really, is it too much to ask--that scientific studies be completed before costs are imposed? Mr. President, that is just common sense. 
The town of Hastings, NE, population 23,000, will be forced to pay over $1 million in the first year to comply with these onerous regulations and $250,000 the year after that. More than 60 Nebraska water systems face similar financial burdens because of the EPA's enforcement of these copper regulations. 
The most incredible part of this issue is that the EPA has not proven that there is a health risk. As my friend, Senator Kerrey, said, they want to prove it; they want to tell us we have it, but they can't make the scientific link. The EPA used case studies to set these copper levels, some of which are over 40 years old, 
and often included only a few people. One EPA case study from 1957 refers to 15 nurses, 10 of which got sick after drinking cocktails with between 5.3 and 32 milligrams of copper--very strong scientific evidence. 
Yet, a 1994 interim study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that EPA's copper standard seriously exaggerated health effects in Nebraska due to water consumption. In comparison, the CDC study conducted in 1994 to examine almost 200 households in Nebraska in a controlled, scientific way, found no relationship between the copper concentrations and illness. 
One of the problems in Nebraska, Mr. President, is that copper does not come from the city's water system. It comes from copper pipes--copper pipes--in individual homes. Yet only six of the homes tested, in Hastings, NE, had copper levels above the EPA standards. And for those six homes, the EPA is going to force the people of the entire town in Nebraska to spend millions of dollars to change the system. 
This is folly. This is nonsense. This is one of the most clear examples of EPA zealousness that I think I have ever seen. 
The State of Nebraska has attempted to make its case with the EPA but has been repeatedly dismissed. The State suggested allowing residents to let the water run in the taps for a short period of time before using water for drinking. Nebraska's Department of Health and Human Services would have used a public education program to ensure that this `flushing' method was done correctly. Residents already did this on their own and copper levels dropped to nearly zero--copper levels dropped to nearly zero--after letting the tap run for a few seconds. The State also said it would pay to replace the copper plumbing for affected households. 
The attorney general of the State of Nebraska has filed a lawsuit to try to block the EPA enforcement of these regulations until we have some sound science. And the Governor, Governor Nelson, is involved. 
The attitude of the EPA toward the people of Nebraska has been one of supreme arrogance. Some of my colleagues may wonder why this is such a problem in Nebraska. Why haven't they heard about this in their States? 
Well, Nebraska is unique, not only because we play decent football, Mr. President, but also because we rely, almost exclusively, on groundwater for our water supplies. Because of this, some towns and cities in Nebraska do not have a central water system but a number of systems that feed into the main system. 
For these towns of Nebraska, treating drinking water means treating each individual well, which drastically increases costs. And for what? The people of Nebraska do not want unsafe drinking water; of course they don't. If there was a real health risk, they would pay to have the water treated. But when the scientific evidence shows no health risk, when the EPA rejects every commonsense alternative--many of what my colleague from Nebraska talked about--what are the people of Nebraska to do? They have turned to their congressional delegation. They have turned to their Congress and asked for help. 
The Constitution gives Congress the authority to decide whether or not Federal agencies can spend the money of the American taxpayers, what they spend it on, and why they spend it. Too often we have neglected this authority and let Federal agencies run right over the top of the American people, the very people who pay the bills--the taxpayers. But we don't have a voice. That is why Senator Kerrey and I are on the floor today. 
We are here to bring the case of the people of Nebraska to the Senate, as our colleagues are doing in the House. We have no other recourse, Mr. President. Again, we are not attempting to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act. We are asking to change the regulations so that we have some ability, some flexibility to wait until we have sound science. What an outrageous request. What an outrageous request. 
Mr. President, dealing with the EPA is like wandering around in the Land of Oz, this mystical land. But we wish to pull back the curtain and get to some reality and common sense. It is my hope, as is the hope of my friend and colleague, the senior Senator from Nebraska, that our colleagues will listen to this plea and will assist us in this effort. We are grateful for an opportunity to tell our story--a real story. 
Thank you. I yield the floor.

Mr. HAGEL. Thank you, Madam President. 
I rise to support Senator Lugar's amendment. I am an original cosponsor of that amendment. I am an original cosponsor of the Lugar amendment because I believe the Lugar amendment applies some common sense and some relevancy to the issue of sanctions. 
I know that we have a bipartisan task force on sanctions. I think most of this body supports the efforts of that task force, but I don't see any conflict in what Senator Lugar is proposing today, and what Senator Dodd and others will propose later, with the task force assignment. 
It is interesting to note that since 1993 we have imposed 65 unilateral sanctions on 35 nations. We have some responsibility to give some focus and some understanding to our trade policy, which is part of our foreign policy, which is connected to our national security, which is connected to our economy and jobs and growth and productivity. 
I fail to appreciate why this is not relevant, why this is not important. This is not getting in the way of the task force. The task force, as I understand it, is to help frame up this issue. 
This amendment would not undo any existing sanctions. This amendment would establish a process for a more rational consideration of future use of sanctions. Sanctions surely must remain a tool of foreign policy, but sanctions are not foreign policy. Sanctions are only effective when they are multilateral. The world is dynamic. The world is changing. Trade is spherical. It moves. It will move right over the top of us unless we attempt to manage the movement. 
Every great event in history has produced new opportunities, new challenges, new threats, new uncertainties, and the collapse of the Soviet empire has given the world great new opportunities and hope. Only one nation on Earth can help lead the nations of the world to that hope and opportunity, and trade surely must be a major part of that. 
Why in the world would we continue to impose unworkable, unachievable, outdated, irrelevant policy rather than looking forward, getting us into the next century, with the promise that only this country can give? 
Does anybody really believe, in this body, that any nation on Earth cannot get any service, any commodity, any product if they want it from some other nation? Of course not. This is a new world. Both the President and the Congress want some control of the issue of sanctions. We want some definition of what this is about. The Congress of the United States owes this Nation some leadership on this issue. The President must lead on this issue. 
Senator Lugar has described his amendment in detail. It would sunset new sanctions after 2 years. The way it is now, Madam President, we go on and on with sanctions. This amendment starts to clean up sanctions. Do we need them? Are they relevant? Does the world change? I fail to see that that is a threat to our foreign policy and to those who wish us ill. 
It would require cost-benefit studies. My goodness, imagine that. What a terrible thing--a cost-benefit study. It would require an effort, first, to make sanctions multilateral. It would require an evaluation of whether a sanction is likely to achieve its policy goal. Again--again--what a questionable objective. My goodness, actually focusing on an action and figuring out, if you can, if there are consequences, if it is workable. 
I know some in this body care occasionally about a headline, about a press release.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise this evening to strongly support this amendment. We have heard a number of dynamics--issues, good questions, relevant questions--about what is being attempted in this amendment. 
Mr. President, we are not talking about some revolutionary change in our foreign policy here. What we are talking about is what works. We are talking about common sense, relevance. There has been much talk tonight about humanitarian issues, human rights, trade, foreign policy, national security, all wrapped up into this debate. 
But my goodness, Mr. President, as we are about to embark on a new century, a new millennium, the greatest power on the Earth, the greatest power the world has ever seen, are we to rely on embargoing medicine and food to leverage and implement our policy and our position in the word? I don't think so. We are better than that. 
We have heard much conversation tonight about unilateral sanctions, multilateral sanctions. The world has changed, shifted. There is no nation on Earth today that can't get medicine and food, commodities, services, products, somewhere else. They don't need to go through the United States. So, in fact, what are we doing? Are we isolating some other country? Are we isolating a leader? No; we are isolating ourselves. We are isolating our farmers. We are isolating our ranchers, our producers, our people, our future, our growth. And for what? We are not compromising our national security when we talk about these issues of medicine and food. We are not exchanging trade for security. We have gotten a little off focus here this evening in some of this debate, a little bit off focus. 
Foreign policy is about dynamic change, about a world of great change, a world of hope and opportunity. It is about our role in the world and how we best position ourselves in the world to make our point. 
The question always comes back to, How best do we do that? How best do we leverage what we have? What works? Does withholding food and medicine work? Well, look around; look around. This is not some fly-by-night quick deal that we are talking about here. We have debated these issues. 
My colleagues have talked about efforts, which I have been part of, to get hearings. Again, I go back to one point of reality here: This is not a revolutionary shift in policy. And if, in fact, we are to enlist more allies and do what America has always done--defend and enhance more liberty for more people--we come back to the question of how we do that. Does trade and commerce improve people's lives? Does it open societies? I think history has answered that rather clearly. 
Yes, I am from a Midwestern State. I am from a large agriculture exporting State. That is important. Those interests are important. But there is not a farmer in Nebraska who is saying, `I would trade America's national interests in the world' --or even entertaining that bargain--`for selling more corn or beef.' So let's not mislead anyone here tonight that that is the trade. That is not the trade here. That is not what we are talking about. We are talking about what works and who is really penalized here. 
I can go through a list. You all know about what has happened when wheat embargoes have been put on. President Nixon in 1973 banned soybean exports. What has that done? Well, it has made Brazil a very significant soybean producer, is what it has done. I have pages of these things to talk about, specifically narrow, focused issues on agriculture and medicine. But in the interest of time and the interest of good judgment, so that my colleagues won't be completely offended by this debate, suffice it to say that this is a debate about the totality and the completeness of what encompasses foreign policy, and trade is part of that--trade is part of it--and how we best work our way in to nations that don't have the same values and standards and morals and respect for rights as we do. 
I close by a point I made at the beginning of my remarks. A great power, the greatest power on Earth, this Nation that has done so much for so many for so long, should not need to rely on embargoes for food and medicine to implement and further our policy. 
I hope my colleagues look at this in the completeness of how we, who have offered this, intend it to be viewed and would support this amendment. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, thank you. 
I wish to first congratulate the bipartisan leadership in this body, the leadership of our two leaders, Senator Lott and Senator Daschle, for addressing this issue and addressing the more encompassing issue of sanctions in total. 
I want to also thank my friends and colleagues, Senators Biden and McConnell, for their active leadership on this issue. 
This is a strong first step. We need a comprehensive trade package, a comprehensive package we will talk about and address. Yes, sanctions; sanction reviews--a number of my colleagues and I have worked on this issue for the last year. We have legislation pending. Senator Lugar has been a leader in this area. We need to address the IMF issue as a Congress. We will be addressing MFN status with China and fast track. But a complete package. 
This is a strong first step. This is the beginning of the larger debate that this Congress will have and must have about the role of the United States in the world and how we intend to engage the world, and trade is a very important part of that. 
Our relationships with other nations must not be held captive to one issue. But our relationships with other nations are complicated. They include trade, of course, commerce. They include U.S. interests abroad, national defense, and human rights. But we must not allow one dynamic of our relationship with all our other nations on this globe to be held captive to just one issue. 
History has shown, Mr. President, that trade and commerce engagement in reaching out does more to change attitudes and alter behavior than any one thing. Why? It improves diets; it improves standards of living; it opens society; it exposes people who have lived under totalitarian rule, who have had limited exposure to freedom, to liberty, to economic freedom, products, choice, consumerism. That is what trade does. Not one among us believes that just trade alone is all we need. But it is an important, integral part of our relationships around the world. 
We live in a very dynamic time. The light of change today in the world is unprecedented in modern history, and maybe all of history. That change is spherical. It is moving. It touches every life in every way. Food, fiber, housing, and trade are common denominators of mutual interests of all the peoples of the world. 
We must not isolate ourselves. Unilateral sanctions isolate those who impose unilateral sanctions. We need dynamic policies for dynamic times. The world is not static. 
This is a good beginning. This is a significant beginning. Our leadership in this body has seized the moment at a critical time as we have witnessed our President in China for 9 days dealing with many of these issues. We know we have far to go in all dynamics with respect to our relationships with China, Pakistan, with India, all nations. But trade and commerce will play a vital role in building those relationships, enhancing the freedoms and liberties of people throughout the globe. We in the United States must play a full, dynamic leadership role in that process. 
Mr. President, I am very proud to join my friends and colleagues who have worked on this diligently, who will continue to provide leadership, not just to this body but to the country, to the world, and to our farmers and our ranchers, our producers, and our citizens. We are all interconnected. We do live in a global village underpinned by a global economy. 
I encourage all of my colleagues to vote for this very important amendment. Again, I say to my colleagues that this is an engagement we must all be part of. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, today the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 2:30. Following morning business, it is the leader's intention to begin consideration of the VA-HUD appropriations bill. It is hoped that Members will come to the floor during today's session to offer and debate amendments to the VA-HUD bill. There will be no rollcall votes during Monday's session, so any votes ordered with respect to the VA-HUD bill will be postponed to occur on Tuesday, July 7, at a time to be determined by the two leaders. 
During Tuesday's session, under a previous order, there will be a cloture vote on the motion to proceed to the product liability bill at 9:30 a.m. Following that vote, the Senate will resume consideration of the VA-HUD bill and may also consider the IRS conference report Tuesday afternoon. The Senate could also consider any other legislative or executive items cleared for action. 
The majority leader would like to remind all Members that July will be a very busy month with late night sessions during each week. The cooperation of all Members will be necessary for the Senate to complete its work prior to the August recess. 
I thank my colleagues for their attention. 
Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.

Mr. HAGEL. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank my friend and colleague from Kansas. 
Mr. President, Senator Roberts has touched upon some of the most important core issues in the debate that we have had over the last 4 weeks on the tobacco bill. 
I would find it interesting again to recite what has really happened in the world since we began consideration of the tobacco bill on Monday, May 18th. This is our fourth week now on the debate on this bill. 
What has happened in the course of the last 4 weeks is we have seen India and Pakistan test for nuclear explosions, we have seen a new wave of an Asian market crisis begin, we have seen Asian stocks plummet, we have seen the Japanese yen drop precipitously, and leading now to China's warnings that it may devaluate its currency. We have also found Japan officially entering a severe recession, the first since the early 1970s. 
As my distinguished colleague from Kansas referred to a few minutes ago, Kosovo has erupted into flames with NATO exercises now fully engaged on the borders of Albania and Kosovo. There is a very real possibility of a war spreading further south into the Balkans, engaging Macedonia, Greece, and other nations. 
Russia has entered a severe economic problem. 
Our U.S. agricultural foreign markets are shrinking due to economic problems. 
Abroad U.S. exports are down. 
And, as my friend from Kansas pointed out, we have a military that for the 15th year in a row finds its budget dropping, all at the same time that we are asking our military to do more with less--more deployments, longer deployments. 
Something, Mr. President, is going to have to give here. 
But what has the Senate done? The Senate continues to talk about higher taxes and more government and more regulation. We let all of these other important issues that affect every American, our future, and the course of the world hang suspended like it is not there. We ignore these issues. We ignore these issues at our peril and at the world's peril. 
This U.S. Senator is ready to say let's move the tobacco bill caucus off the track, and let's get to what is real in this country. Let's get to the real issues facing our Nation--not just the farmers and the ranchers in Nebraska, and exporters all over the world, but our national defense issues, our trade policy, the sanctions issues, and all of the other issues that we have talked about. That is what is real. 
That is what the greatest deliberative body in the world should be dealing with and talking about--not increasing taxes by hundreds of billions of dollars and bringing to the American people more government and more regulation. 
I again appreciate very much the thoughts and comments of my distinguished colleague from Kansas, Senator Roberts, and his remarks. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. ROBERTS addressed the Chair.

The point here is IMF funding and MFN status and fast track, all of these combine together to be essential components of a trade policy, of a foreign policy, of a national defense policy that directs this Nation and directs the world. We can't just pick and choose--maybe this, maybe not this. But it has to be debated and viewed and acted on in total. So I appreciate again my colleague's comments on this, and I yield.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I want to take this body on a quick trip to the other part of the world to talk very briefly about what is happening in Southeast Asia, Japan, China, Russia, and how it is impacting and affecting all of us in this country, how it will affect the geopolitical economic dynamics the rest of this year and on into the next year and, actually, on into the next century. 
We start at Southeast Asia where the Asian crisis has become a significant crisis, stretching past that region of the world, now up into Japan, where we find in Japan that its economic planning agency confirmed that Japan is now in a serious recession. Last quarter, Japan found that its economy fell by an annualized rate of 5.3 percent. The yen is at an 8-year low against the dollar. The yen has dropped 50 percent in 3 years. The Japanese find themselves essentially without a credible banking system. 
The President of South Korea was here this week addressing a joint meeting of Congress. Some of us had an opportunity to meet with him privately to talk about South Korea, what it is going to take to build South Korea back--infrastructure reconstruction, currency reconstruction, investment reconstruction. 
Let's go further around that loop of the world to Russia. I spent some time yesterday with the Russian Ambassador to the United States. The two of us spoke for more than an hour alone. Russia has immense economic problems, and when Russia has immense economic problems and Japan has immense economic problems, as does South Korea, Southeast Asia, that spills over on to all of us. 
China announced yesterday that it may have to devalue its currency. I was in China in December and met with the Premier. At that time, he assured me--and Senator Chafee from Rhode Island was with me--that under no circumstances would China devalue its currency, and that has been China's position all along. But the dynamics of the economic impact and the consequences of the Southeast Asian crisis have become so severe that it is now taking a rather significant toll on all those nations, including China, Japan, and Russia. 
Our markets yesterday in the United States went down 160 points. The Dow Jones dropped yesterday, and as of this hour, our market in New York is down well over 100 points. 
What does this tell us? If we listen to farmers and ranchers, as I do in Nebraska, and exporters and people who understand the realities and the importance of exports and the fact that economies are linked and stability is linked to economies and to economic growth, security is part of that and confidence underpins all of that. 
When nations and investors lose confidence in markets, they are sending a very direct signal to all of us. They are saying clearly, plainly, `Something's wrong.' We must understand that even though this is a half a world away, it is impacting us today all over this country, and it will continue to very severely impact our growth, our economy, our opportunities, and our markets. And as this economic instability and unrest continues to unfold and deepen and widen, it will require a longer time and more resources and more investment and more attention and more leadership to put it back together. 
I am very concerned, Mr. President, that this Congress is not paying enough attention to what is going on around the world. I am concerned that we are not linking it, we are not interconnecting the dots. I find it remarkable that on this floor, the floor of the U.S. Senate, the last few weeks we have been consumed with billions of dollars of new taxes, building a larger Government, when essentially half of the world is burning. 
I hope that our colleagues in the House take a rather serious look at what is going on around the world. I strongly recommend to our friends and colleagues in the House that they start with looking at the IMF. The IMF is not, cannot be, will not be, should not be, never was intended to be, the rescuer of all economies and all problems. But if we in this Congress continue to turn our backs on what is going on around the world, we will pay a high price. 
We are paying a high price now. When you ask any farmer or rancher or exporter--not just in the Midwest, not just in my State of Nebraska, but all over the country--whether this is affecting them, we will pay a high price when it comes to military issues, strategic issues, as Secretary of Defense Bill Cohen warned earlier this year, as Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has warned earlier this year. Chairman Greenspan talked about it this week. Secretary of Treasury Rubin talked about it this week. We are playing a very dangerous game here. And the longer we lock up, the longer we lock up important decisions on IMF, and other issues that we should be tending to and focusing on, the more dangerous this world becomes. 
I hope my friends in the House are going to unlock this debate on IMF and allow this IMF debate to come to the floor of the House for an honest, open debate, and a vote. There has been a lot of misinformation spread around about IMF--what it does, what it does not do. 
I recall specifically, Mr. President, in our meeting with President Kim, the President of South Korea, he brought up IMF and he said this: `I don't like a lot of what IMF is forcing us to do, but without IMF we wouldn't do it. And if we didn't do it, we would have a complete breakdown of all financial discipline, and there would be some question as to whether we could dig ourselves out of where we are.' 
I say these things knowing full well that these are complex, complicated issues. And there is not one answer to these. But surely, cumulatively, all of the pieces must come together, like the United States stepping up to its world responsibilities. And the IMF is one of those. And at the same time, Mr. President, this body, committees in this body will be debating--have been debating--more sanctions on nations. We are imposing more sanctions on countries today than we ever have in the history of America. 
We cannot do much about the sanctions that the President was forced to impose on India and Pakistan. That is law. Do we really believe, for example, that that helps the situation by pushing India and Pakistan further away, and in Pakistan's case, in particular, grinding them down further and further into economic despair? Does that really improve the possibility that we are going to be able to resolve some of these issues--deadly, deadly issues--to continually isolate some of these countries, but, more importantly, isolating ourselves by sanctions? I do not think so. There is talk about more sanctions for China. 
I hope we get very serious about this, Mr. President, and understand the consequences of what is happening around the world. 
Confidence, courage, leadership, doing the right thing, making the tough choices--that is what makes the difference; always has made the difference. Imperfect possibilities? Imperfect choices? Absolutely. But we must make some choices. We must lead, 
just like Bosnia, just like Kosovo--bad choices all. But the longer we let, for example, Kosovo go without making any decisions, without making any choices, we run a terrible risk of great conflagration in that area. 
I am grateful for an opportunity to share some of my thoughts on these issues because they are real, they are not theoretical. They impact our Nation, the world, our opportunities, and the future. We make decisions today, not to deal with problems today, we make decisions today to deal with problems tomorrow. The future is connected to our leadership, and we must act. 
I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I returned Sunday night from a 9-day trip to Turkey and central Asia. I would like to share with this body and my colleagues some observations from that trip and of the last year and a half. 
There are dangerous and serious events and conflicts occurring all over the globe today. The most urgent and most immediate has occurred in Pakistan and India, but beyond Pakistan and India, beyond the subcontinent of Asia, we find a continuing problem with the Asian financial crisis throughout Southeast Asia, IMF funding, China MFN status, China technology sales, Russia-Japan economic trouble. We are in terrible trouble in the Middle East peace process, probably at its lowest ebb since the process began; Bosnia-Kosovo, east Africa, central Asia where there is fighting now in the northwest corner of Georgia; Azerbaijan and Armenia are at war over Nagorno-Karabakh, and other areas of the world that are of great concern to the stability and concern of the world. 
These situations are all connected. We must develop a foreign policy that captures the completeness of this interconnect. We also must tone down our rhetoric and speak and act responsibly. Actions have consequences. Words have consequences. Words have consequences especially overseas. We are seeing a geopolitical, military, and economic structure shift like the world has never seen. With diffusion of power across the globe, stability and security and peace with new alliances and new alignments become critical to our future, the future of the world. 
One element of our foreign policy--sanctions--needs to be reviewed. Sanctions without our allies' support do not work. We are living in a different world. Sanctions are of limited value. Withholding MFN status from China accomplishes what. Withholding additional IMF funding accomplishes what. We will soon be debating in this body religious persecution legislation to accomplish what. We are playing a very dangerous game here. Isolating ourselves where we have very little leverage over other countries and isolating other nations by driving them further away makes no sense to our national interests and the interests of the world. 
This may be the most important time since World War II when a strong bipartisan, a strong bipartisan American foreign policy is required. The world has changed at a rate unseen and unparalleled in the history of man. This complicates how we deal with crises and problems and relationships. Technology and communications have changed the dynamics of the world. We must bring together the world's interests--not at the expense of national sovereignty. America's strategic triad for the next century is a strong national defense, a strong trade and foreign policy, and a strong economy. And I will have more to say about that later. 
Congress must be very careful in what we say and what we do as we proceed along a very dangerous path. We must be careful not to weaken or neuter the President in front of the world. The world is very dangerous and unpredictable. Congress must not micromanage foreign policy. I have been as outspoken as any Senator on this floor about the concerns and the differences I have with this administration on foreign policy. It is the responsibility of the Senate to question that, to probe that. But we have to understand that whatever we say and do has consequences, reverberations, ramifications. America must speak to the world with some sense and some semblance of unity. We cannot allow our foreign policy to unravel before the eyes of the world during a very dangerous time. The world needs American leadership, consistency, presence and engagement. Without it, without American leadership, the world becomes an even more dangerous place. 
America must show the world that it is resolute about its basic beliefs and freedoms and human rights and God-given rights. But we must do it smartly, effectively, and with the objective of realistically and truly changing the world for the better. Not headlines, not resolutions, not campaign promises, but understanding what this arch is about: to get on the other side of true change, to alter the behavior of totalitarian, authoritarian governments. America will find itself isolated in the word if we continue to moralize to others and force every aspect of our lifestyle and our way of life on others as a blueprint for their lives and societies. 
Again, Congress must be very careful as we proceed. Nations, like individuals, lead by example and force of character. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, today the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 10 a.m. Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of S. 1415, the tobacco legislation, with several amendments pending. It is hoped that those amendments can be dealt with in a timely fashion so that remaining amendments to the tobacco bill can be offered and debated. The Senate will recess today from 12:30 until 2:15 to allow the weekly party caucuses to meet. 
Under a previous order, at 4 p.m., the Senate will begin 2 hours of debate equally divided on the motion to proceed to the nuclear waste bill. At 6 p.m., the Senate will vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to the nuclear waste bill. Further votes could occur following the cloture vote on amendments to the tobacco legislation or any other executive or legislative items cleared for action. 
As a reminder, the majority leader has announced there will be no session of the Senate tomorrow, Wednesday, June 3, in honor of the passing of our former colleague and friend, Barry Goldwater. 
I thank my colleagues for their attention.

Mr. HAGEL. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to reflect on some of the dynamics of the debate on the tobacco bill. I think it is important we as a body step back and focus on some of the various dynamics and the consequences of what we may or may not do as this debate goes forward. And it should go forward. Nobody disagrees with trying to reduce teen smoking. That is not an issue. We are all here to try to do the right thing. The focus on teen smoking, after all, was the core issue that really began this debate more than just a year ago. 
I do not question the motives of my colleagues on either side of this debate. My colleagues on both sides of this debate are trying to do the right thing, trying to focus on making this a better world. I should also say, in the interest of full disclosure, I do not smoke, never have smoked, don't care about smoking. I think it is an unhealthy, bad habit, but at the same time I think we owe this country a good, honest debate about the issue from many of the dynamics, and certainly the constitutional dynamic of what we are about to do or may do is important. 
I also think it is important for us to look at some of the societal and cultural consequences of this debate and of what action we may bring in the Senate over the tobacco bill, because if we do do something, it will have an impact on society, and it will have an impact far beyond just raising taxes and making government bigger, with more unaccountable regulations. This will have a very significant impact on our society. 
I do fear, as I believe many of my colleagues fear, the great law of unintended consequences when we do not think things through very clearly. As we frame the debate, as we frame this issue, I fear that we are not including all that needs to be framed and debated here. As I have listened to and observed a number of presentations, all using statistics, information, and numbers, we pull them from everywhere. But the fact is, we do not have good, accurate information on this issue. I look at the number that is being used by almost everyone here, that this bill would reduce teen smoking by 60 percent. But where do we get the number? Where are we pulling our assumptions from? 
I have here a copy of the New York Times story yesterday headlined `Politics of Youth Smoking Fueled by Unproven Data.' It has some interesting points. This New York Times article says, for example: 
But with the Senate having begun debate on Monday on tobacco legislation, many experts warn that such predictions are little more than wild estimates that are raising what may be unreasonable expectations for change in rates of youth smoking. 
Another point in this article I think is pretty important.  
Politicians and policy makers have tossed out dozens of estimates about the impact of various strategies on youth smoking, figures that turn out to be based on projections rather than fact. 
`I think this whole business of trying to prevent kids from smoking being the impetus behind legislation is great politics,' said Richard Kluger, the author of `Ashes to Ashes,' a history of the United States' battle over smoking and health. 
He goes on to say: 
It is nonsense in terms of anything you can put numbers next to. 
This certainly does not minimize the seriousness of what we are about. It does not minimize the seriousness of teenage smoking, again, if that is the focus, if that is the reason in fact we are debating this. 
Other assumptions that get thrown into this as well are somewhat faulty. We know that we are today debating a massive tax and regulatory bill, and we tend to glide over that. I will give 
you some statistics that actually are accurate from my State, from Illinois, Hawaii, and Massachusetts, four States that have raised--raised--cigarette taxes in recent years, and they have all seen teen smoking increase. In 1993, Nebraska raised the cigarette tax to 34 cents. The number of Nebraska teenagers who smoke increased by about 20 percent over a 3-year period. 
Now, some might say, well, 34 cents is not enough; you have to raise it to where it really hurts. But I think we can understand and get some sense of focus that increasing taxes at least predominantly as the great dissuader of teenage smoking is far, far from being proven. USA Today had a very interesting front-page survey a couple of weeks ago in its newspaper, and it reported such things as, `Only 14 percent of teenage smokers said higher cigarette prices would make them quit.' The same survey in the USA Today said only 12 percent believed requiring a photo ID to prove they are adults when buying cigarettes would make them quit. 
Another dynamic of this debate, which again seems to get very little attention, is, How would this change the power of the Federal Government? Would it increase unaccountable, essential unaccountable Federal regulation through the Food and Drug administration? Yes. Considerably. It would give the Food and Drug Administration unprecedented authority to regulate as yet still a legal product. Now, if this body really is as concerned about tobacco as we are representing, why don't we have the guts to just step up and ban tobacco as an illegal drug? 
Why don't we do that? Why don't we be honest enough about this issue to bring it down here and debate it and say we are going to ban tobacco and say it is an illegal drug? Or let's nationalize the tobacco companies? 
The point is that we are not being totally honest with what we are doing. Where will the money go? The numbers float around. Is it a $565 billion bill? Is it a $750 billion tax bill? Where is this? We do know it is in the hundreds of billions of dollars. We do know that. Where is this money going to go? Where is the money going to go? Because we also know that all that money, whether it is $500 billion, $600 billion, $800 billion, can't possibly be used for teen smoking programs. So, does that give us some impetus to tax more and to do more and, therefore, find, at the end of the rainbow, a pot of gold? More Government programs, more Government, more bureaucracy, more regulation. I think that is an important dynamic of this debate. Higher taxes, obviously. Nobody has yet denied that. Nobody has denied, yet, that we are, in fact, increasing taxes. Not just increasing taxes but we are really increasing taxes by a new dimension here. 
Where does that money go? For example, we do know somewhere, in all these bills out there, there is a figure we can get pretty close to focusing on, that, over the next 8 years, at a minimum, we would be raising about $130 billion in new taxes. 
There are some constitutional issues, believe it or not. Again, let's face the facts here. What we are doing here, we are expropriating a legal industry. We are expropriating a legal industry for the first time in the history of America. I said at the beginning of my remarks that I don't smoke. No one can come to the floor of the Senate and defend the tobacco companies' conduct, their behavior. It has been outrageous. That is not what this debate is about. Let's not get ensnared in the underbrush of that debate. Let's be careful here how we frame the debate. 
Nobody that I know of is on the floor of the Senate defending the tobacco companies. That is not the issue. We are defending some constitutional rights here. We are defending the honesty of how we are getting at this issue. Again, if we wish to take tobacco and criminalize it, that is certainly an option. If we go forward and do what some in this body intend to do, and want to do, essentially expropriating a legal industry, then what kind of precedent does that set? I think, first of all, constitutionally it would be out, but what kind of precedent does that set? Who is next? Caffeine? Diesel fuel? Who is next? That is another consequence, another dynamic of this debate on which we should reflect. 
Just one example of a constitutional question is--I think we all understand it does raise some very serious constitutional questions. For example, the Federal district court in North Carolina ruled that the FDA cannot restrict advertising and promotion of tobacco products. We have a legal system for this. We have a legal system that works pretty well in this country. It has worked over 200 years. 
Again, this is not a matter of defending the tobacco companies. That is not what this is about. This debate, parts of it, remind me of other debates we have been engaged in about the environment or religious persecution. I do not know one Senator who wants dirty air and dirty water and a dirty environment. Nor do I know one Senator who supports religious persecution. It is always a matter of how you improve it, not either/or. This is a good example of that kind of debate. 
Black market--my friend from Texas talked a little bit about that an hour ago. It is a very, very real concern, a very real issue. For example, after increasing its cigarette taxes in the late 1980s, Canada saw a huge increase in the black market for cigarettes. By 1994, one-third of the Canadian cigarette market was contraband. Is that where we are headed here? We need to talk about that. It isn't just Canada. How about Sweden? Recently, Sweden lowered its cigarette tax by 27 percent to reduce smuggling from Denmark. England estimates it loses over $1 billion in tax 
revenue every year because of smuggled cigarettes. 
My friend from Montana, Senator Burns, tells me the biggest export in Montana is--wheat? No, it is contraband going to Canada, illegal cigarettes--another dimension of this that we need to be very seriously looking at, the consequences of a well-intentioned action. 
The State of Washington estimates that 27 percent of its cigarette market is now contraband--that is now. The State legislature moved the enforcement power of the cigarette tax from the State revenue department to its liquor control board, `whose agents carry guns and have complete police powers.' Is that a consequence we want from this? 
Personal responsibility--my goodness, my goodness. The very foundation of this Nation is rooted in personal responsibility. Where has been the debate on this issue about personal responsibility? There was a lot of debate about blaming everybody for one's actions. It is the Army's fault. It is the Army's fault that I started smoking. It is the Government's fault. It is the tobacco company's fault. It is everybody's fault, except mine. 
What does that say to our young people? Why have I not heard any connecting issue or debate in all the debate that has raged on so far about personal responsibility--consequences for one's actions? Our young people need to understand that actions have consequences. They need to understand that. Yes, we need to help them. Yes, we need to protect them. But that should be part of the debate, talking about personal responsibility--not that it is everybody else's fault. That is a dynamic of this.

Mr. HAGEL. I will be very happy to yield when I finish. I thank the Senator. 
The Federal Government, no government, can tax or regulate young people's behavior. That is silly. That is complete folly. Come on. How many parents do we have in this body? How many people in this body have dealt with young people? I suppose everybody in this body remembers when they were 16, 17, 18--and you believe that the Government is going to regulate behavior and change behavior? We are going to make everybody's life-style healthier? That is another dynamic that has not been debated in this. 
Ignoring other problems--isn't it interesting that the real problems in this country for young people, far more severe and far more immediate, are with illegal drugs and underage alcohol use, but, yet, we are not talking too much about those issues today. Why aren't we? Because we are losing the illegal drug debate and war. More young people today are on illegal drugs than before. It is a tougher issue. It is everybody's concern. But we beat our breasts down here and say, aren't we doing something great because we are going to take care of underage cigarette smoking. 
By the way, you can look at numbers and polls on this. I know they all have them, and I have one done by Citizens for a Sound Economy, May 13 to 15 of this year, asking 1,200 Americans, as parents, what their biggest concern for teenagers is. No. 1, illegal drug use, 39 percent; gangs, 16 percent; alcohol, 9 percent; tobacco use, 3 percent. Again, does this diminish the importance of this issue? No, of course not, but let's have some perspective in this debate. And there are other problems that young people face. We have numbers from polls and from very conclusive studies that show what I am talking about. 
Let me conclude, Mr. President, with a couple of final observations. 
There is an interesting thread of arrogance that has run through this debate: Government is smarter; we can tell you what to do; you really don't understand the seriousness of tobacco use; you are not smart enough to sort it out yourself; but you see, we are in the Congress, we will tell you when something is dangerous and when it isn't; you can't read; you don't understand, I am sorry. 
We can have that kind of society. We can have that kind of a world. Some countries do. But if that is what you opt for, you will opt for also giving up some personal freedom, some personal responsibility, and it might be a better world that way. But that is another part of this debate we haven't heard enough about, and it should be part of it. 
As I said in my earlier remarks, all my colleagues mean well. They are well motivated, they want to make the world better, they want to do the right thing. There is no question about that. But I hope they will think for a few moments about some of the issues I have raised as we step back for a moment and try to put in perspective what we are doing. Are we really making the world better and accomplishing what we want to accomplish, focusing on teenage smoking, underage smoking, which, by the way, there are now laws on the books to deal with? Are we making it better by putting hundreds of billions of dollars of new taxes on our people, building a bigger Government and more programs and more regulations, and then on top of that, having to deal with the unintended consequences of our action that will affect culture and it will affect society? Those are all part of the total debate, Mr. President, that should be brought into focus. 
I will vote against this bill, because I think it is not the right way to deal with some very serious problems. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support for the American Competitiveness Act, of which I am a cosponsor. 
The American Competitiveness Act is important to the American economy and to our Nation's high standing in a global economy. It will also have a positive and direct impact on promoting job creation and economic growth in Nebraska. 
Mr. President, as the 21st Century quickly approaches, American companies, businesses and universities increasingly find themselves in a fiercely competitive global economy. Thus far, the United States has been able to succeed and benefit overwhelmingly from this increased `globalization.' 
However, our continued economic growth is being threatened by a shortage of highly skilled and internationally experienced workers, While companies around the U.S. have invested billions of dollars in educating and training employees, demand for qualified people continues to grow faster than the supply of available workers. This is particularly true in the area of information technology. 
The shortage of workers with technical or computer-related skills is a real concern to Nebraska. My colleagues may not realize that Nebraska currently has an unemployment rate of 1.6%, which is the lowest rate in the country. While this is very good news, it also presents a challenge for many of Nebraska's employers. 
Employers in Nebraska have told me over and over again that the state is unable to meet their increased demand for labor, particularly high-skilled labor. In fact, the Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce estimates there are currently 1,500 to 2,000 job openings in the field of information technology in the Omaha area alone. 
While the Chamber, other business community leaders, and the Nebraska state government, have been actively recruiting workers from within the State, across the country and around the world, they have not been able to produce enough skilled workers to keep pace with job growth. 
The United States Senate can take an important step toward addressing this problem by passing the American Competitiveness Act. This legislation will immediately help America's companies and universities by raising the current ceiling on the number of foreign-born professionals we allow to work in the United States under the H-1B visa program. These temporary visas are used to attract the best and brightest minds from around the world to U.S. companies and universities, which helps them to compete in global markets. 
We must also address our Nation's long term employment challenges by preparing more American students for the high technology, global workforce of tomorrow. Not enough of our students are being prepared, or preparing themselves, to excel in an increasingly high-tech economy. 
The American Competitiveness Act takes steps to correct this situation by creating 20,000 scholarships annually for low-income American students to study math, engineering, and computer science. It also authorizes $10 million a year to train unemployed U.S. workers for jobs in the information technology industry. 
I strongly urge my colleagues to support Senator Abraham's bill, which will keep American companies in this country, create and save American jobs and contribute to the growth of the economy. I urge my colleagues to support this bill because it will help ensure that America remains a great, industrious and rich nation both culturally and economically.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to reflect on the business at hand today; that is, our Department of Defense authorization bill. 
Three hours ago, I had the privilege of joining a couple of my colleagues at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier during a very somber, serious ceremony to exhume the remains of the unknown Vietnam veteran from the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. If you have followed this, as all of our colleagues in this body and most of America have, you are aware that through sophisticated, primarily DNA testing--and you, Mr. President, of all people understand this very well--we now are going to be able to identify almost all remains from the Vietnam war. 
I begin my remarks this afternoon with that reflection because what we are about here today is serious business. It is about the business of national defense--defending America's interests in the world. It is costly, it is serious, and at some times it is devastating. It is devastating for the families who lose loved ones in crisis, in war, in conflict. 
But when I say it is costly, Mr. President, I mean costly. As one who has spent some time in the Armed Forces, who is somewhat familiar with the sacrifices that we ask of our men and women and their families, I am as concerned today about the defense capabilities of our armed services as I have been since the late 1970s. Not that our men and women, our warriors, are not up to the task, but I fear what we are doing to our men and women who have committed their lives to the defense of freedom and the defense of this Nation is that we are not providing them, we are not making to them, the kind of commitment in the resources they need to do their job. 
We are asking--and this has been the case over the last 10 years--our Armed Forces to do more with less--more deployments, longer deployments. And as you look at our Defense Department budgets, this fiscal year 1999 budget represents the 14th consecutive year of decline in defense spending. In real dollars, I think the American public should know that this budget represents $3 billion less than current levels and about a 40-percent drop from the spending levels of the mid to late 1980s. 
I compliment my colleagues on the Armed Services Committee for dealing with a difficult issue. I especially compliment Chairman Thurmond, who, I understand, will lead this authorization bill fight for the last time. His commitment to his country is not only exemplary but it is truly unmatched in this Chamber. There is no one who understands this business better than Chairman Thurmond and who understands what I am talking about today. 
I will jump to the conclusion of my remarks by saying this. It is time the Congress of the United States be direct and honest with the American public and say what needs to be said, and that is, we need to increase spending for our Defense Department. We need to increase spending. Any measurement you take of where we are in inflation-adjusted dollars, this year's defense budget represents the smallest, in real dollars, the smallest Defense Department budget since the beginning of the Korean war. We have the smallest military in nearly 50 years. 
I am astounded that the President of the United States comes before the Congress and the American public and says we have the smallest Government ever. First of all, we don't have the smallest Government ever; a $1.7 trillion Government is rather significant. But he is half right; we have a military that we have continued to hollow out over the last 10 years. We will pay a severe price for what we are doing to our Armed Forces capability. 
About 3 percent of our gross domestic product today, less than half of what we had in the 1980's, goes to defense spending. By any measurement you take of this issue of research, acquisition, and deployment of new weapons systems, we are relying on aging and older equipment. 
I had an interesting conversation over the weekend at the airport in Omaha, NE. It was with two DOD auditors who have been with the DOD, auditing systems equipment, for almost 30 years. Each of them told me independently that they have never seen such a situation since the late 1970s. When they are auditing military orders to cannibalize equipment in order to get spare parts off of our jets, off of our ships, off of our military vehicles, something is drastically wrong when that happens, drastically wrong. 
I hear very interesting commentary from the Secretary of Defense, whom I admire greatly, about, if you would just close more bases, that would give us more money and free up the resources. Well, that may do some of that, but what is interesting is that it does not give you any more manpower, and in fact in the President's budget this year he calls for cutting 36,000 uniformed men and women from military service, 12,000 Reserve men and women. How can we, in fact, focus the resources and make the commitment we need to make to our men and women who defend this Nation? 
Let's remember something. National defense is the guarantor of our foreign policy. Without a national defense, we have no foreign policy. Yet we continue to ask our men and women in uniform to do more. Since 1990, our Armed Forces have been used in 36 foreign missions compared to 22 from 1980 to 1989. The Army decreased its manpower by 36 percent while increasing the workload by over 300 percent. Since 1989, the Air Force personnel have been cut by one-third yet the number of missions has quadrupled. From October to January of last year, we lost over 600 Air Force jet pilots. The Army estimated in 1997 that its deployable units spent 180 to 190 days away from home each year. This was before--before--the recent escalation of our forces in the Persian Gulf. 
The Army Chief of Staff, General Dennis Reimer recently said, `Our requirements exceed our people to man those requirements.' 
Let's look at the quality of life. Let's ask what we are doing for the men and women we are asking to commit, in some cases, their lives; what we are asking them to do and what we are giving in return--not only the increasing rate of deployment, longer deployment, cutting their time with families, impacting their quality of life, but what about housing? It is disgraceful. Last year, the outgoing Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General John Shalikashvili, said that, `* * * we have family housing that we ought not be asking our folks to live in.' 
In the Air Force alone there are over 41,000 families on waiting lists for decent housing. In my State of Nebraska, at Offutt Air Force Base alone, there is a terrible need for decent housing. When I say decent housing, I don't mean villas, I mean running water, hot water, plaster not falling from the ceiling, windows not broken out. These people in our Armed Forces are not asking for palaces. How do we expect the men and women in our Armed Forces, as we send them, deploy them all over the world, to concentrate on the serious business before them if they are worried about their families at home because we in the Congress and the President are not paying attention to focusing on the resources that our men and women need? 
Military pay lags 13 percent behind that of the private sector. By the Department of Defense's own estimates, more than 23,000 men and women in uniform, and their families, are eligible for food stamps. What does this do to retention, recruitment and readiness? That is the essence of a capable military. The Army has fallen short of its recruitment goal for the first time since 1979--the first time. And the percentage of recruits in the United States Army with high school diplomas is declining. Since Desert Storm, the percentage of Navy petty officers who say they intend to make the Navy a career has dropped by 10 percent. 
Look at the world today. Is it getting safer? Need we really look beyond what happened earlier this week with the atomic testing done by India? We have major troop deployments around the world today: 37,000 troops in South Korea, major deployments of forces in the Middle East, Japan, Europe, Bosnia. And what about the flash points that are there today, the real possibilities of conflict south of Bosnia, Kosovo? What is yet to happen on the subcontinent of Asia with Pakistan and India? I will be in the Caspian Sea region in 2 weeks--a tinderbox. Are we prepared? 
The end of the cold war has reduced some threat. But now is no time to not only withdraw American leadership but to withdraw the commitment to our Armed Forces. Our armed services are the capability that we are relying on to protect our national interests, our role in the world, to guarantee our foreign policy. That will not be done by hollowing out our military. Today we see a world that is shifting globally in its geopolitical, economic, and military power structures. We cannot allow America to become weaker, or withdraw from that world. Now is not the time. Now is the time for America to project its leadership and help form and help craft and help incentivize and lead the world to more freedom. You cannot accomplish that with an unprepared military. 
I looked at the President's budget again this week, his 
fiscal year 1999 budget. The President proposes $123 billion in new domestic programs, but again proposes to cut our military budget. Surely now--surely America's national interests and our national security has some priority in this budget. 
As we step back for a moment and survey the world as it is--not as we hope or wish it will be, but as it is--if we in fact are, and I believe we are, capable of taking advantage of the tremendous opportunities and hopes and the series of historical consequences and events that have come together in a rather magnificent way to make the world better, it is going to require American leadership. Not that we need to shoulder all the burden--of course not. But part of that American leadership is a national security worthy of who we are and a commitment to the people that we ask daily to defend our Nation--a commitment to give them the resources they need. 
I would say finally, Mr. President, to me a part of that commitment is not to underfund our military but, in fact, it is to start rebuilding our military. I hope as this issue develops and debate develops, that the issue we are about today will extend far beyond the narrowness of the focus that we debate today, but interconnects with the future and our leadership, and much of that future resides at the core of our national defense capabilities. 
I thank my colleagues who serve on the Armed Services Committee for their efforts, their leadership, and their lives that many have devoted to making this a more secure world and helping our military. 
I yield the floor. 
Several Senators addressed the Chair.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Conference Agreement on S. 1150, the Agricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reform Act of 1998. This measure will solidify the financial foundation for crop insurance and agriculture research well into the next century. Agriculture research and crop insurance are vital to America's farming and ranching livelihood. 
Research, crop insurance, regulatory relief, and expanded markets play a vital role in moving federal farm policy away from government intrusion and toward a free market through the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996. Farmers and ranchers now have greater flexibility in their crop and livestock production efforts. Crop insurance and research efforts are both tools that will help farm producers become more competitive as they move toward a greater reliance on the free market and less upon the federal treasury. 
No country in the world can match America's efficiency in agricultural production. Not only is this a result of American ingenuity and hard work, it's also the result of our investment in cutting edge research. Our research efforts have led to more efficient production, better products, new uses for our products--all of which have led to new markets where we can sell our products. S. 1150 provides 600 million dollars for the Initiative for Future Agriculture and Food Systems. 
The global demand for our agricultural goods will continue to grow as the world's population increases and as more nations achieve higher standards of living, resulting in a demand for better diets. Research allows American agriculture to meet the world's demand for food and fiber. Under S. 1150, research dollars will go toward new and alternative uses of agricultural commodities and products, agricultural biotechnology, agricultural genome research, natural resource management, precision agriculture, food safety, and food technology and human nutrition. These dollars will help our agriculture research facilities, such as the University of Nebraska, to continue to lead the world in crop and livestock production sciences. 
Expanded markets and increased trade are a clear byproduct of agricultural research. Research will lead American agriculture into the next century and keep American farmers and ranchers at the forefront of global food and fiber production. Research, global food production, global trade and farming profits are all connected. 
Crop insurance is also vital to the long-term health of American agriculture. Farming and ranching involves risk. That's a fact of life in American agriculture. Crop insurance provides a very important management tool for our agricultural producers to withstand fluctuations in the market and changes in weather and production conditions. 
For example, in recent years, severe weather conditions have forced some Nebraska farmers to face the loss of their crops and livestock. Protecting farmers and the agri-businesses that depend on them from suffering major losses is what crop insurance alternatives do for America's producers. Comprehensive crop insurance plans will minimize losses for many agricultural producers so that the economic damage from diminished crop yields is not overwhelming for our rural towns and communities. This conference report provides 500 million dollars to partially fund crop insurance delivery expenses. 
Research and crop insurance are interconnected with agricultural production and basic farm and ranch income. Research keeps American agriculture on the leading edge of production technology. Crop insurance minimizes the many risks involved with producing food and fiber for the world's growing population. 
I strongly support S. 1150 and urge my colleagues to support its adoption.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, the time has arrived to put some accountability and common sense into one of the most out of control federal agencies in the Federal Government, the Internal Revenue Service. 
Over the past nine months we have heard volumes of testimony regarding the many problems associated with the Internal Revenue Service--lack of leadership, an unresponsive agency and abusive employees. But the most important issue that we must not forget is accountability. No one is being held accountable at the IRS. This must change. 
If federal agencies and their employees are not held accountable for their actions, we have lost control. The American people send billions and billions of dollars of their hard-earned money to Washington, D.C. each year in taxes, to fund a government that most Americans see as too big, too intrusive, and unaccountable. 
Congress is taking a good first step at bringing accountability to the IRS through the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act. This legislation would create an IRS oversight board to oversee the IRS in every aspect of its administration of the tax laws. The Act also replaces the many levels of bureaucracy at the IRS--district offices, regional offices and national office--with offices that are trained to handle groups with specific concerns--individual taxpayers, small business, large business and tax-exempt entities. 
The Act also creates and enhances many taxpayer rights and protections. The burden of proof in court proceedings would be reversed from the taxpayer to the IRS when the taxpayer produces credible evidence that is relevant. The Act extends the attorney-client privilege to accountants and other tax practitioners. Finally, the Act overhauls the `innocent-spouse' relief provision. A spouse would be allowed to limit their tax liability for a joint-return to the spouse's separate liability attributable to the spouse's income. 
These are just a few examples of where and how the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act will bring the IRS back to reality. If there is accountability there is control.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to support the ratification of NATO expansion. I have had the good fortune, over almost the last year and a half that I have been in the U.S. Senate, to serve on the Committee on Foreign Relations. That has given me a unique opportunity to examine the NATO expansion protocol. I attended, start to finish, each of the eight full hearings we had in the Foreign Relations Committee on this issue. I also was appointed by the Senate Majority Leader to serve on the NATO Observer Group Task Force. I attended almost all of the 17 meetings that our distinguished colleagues from Delaware, Senator 
Biden and Senator Roth, held. That does not give me a particularly unique perspective on this issue, but it gives me some grounding on understanding the complications of NATO expansion. 
As I have listened to the debate the last 2 days, and in previous weeks when this Chamber debated this issue, and during committee hearings, I have come to the conclusion that, yes, a number of the questions and points raised by my colleagues are not only relevant but are important and they should be fully aired and fully debated. It is based on those observations that I have made, as I have listened to this debate, that I wish to offer some of the following points. 
Aside from the obvious defense purpose of the expansion of NATO, there are other issues involved. The obvious defense purpose of expanding NATO is to help assure stability and security in Europe, all of Europe. There has been some debate on the floor about this issue, this fourth expansion--and, by the way, a not unprecedented expansion. We have expanded NATO three other times, to include West Germany, Greece, Turkey, and the third expansion was Spain and Portugal. So this would be not an unprecedented action we take, that we include three new countries. But I find interesting that there has been some reference made to `we would split Europe.' I say just the opposite, just the opposite. We would, in fact, do much to unify Europe. Why would that be? That would be because stability, security, economic development, development of democracy and market economies, would extend across the continent of Europe and no longer would there be the Iron Curtain that fell at the end of World War II. NATO expansion would help assure that. 
I also find the argument interesting from the perspective of--I thought, when the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, that meant something. It was beyond symbolism. It was a witness to history that authoritarian, totalitarian government does not work, under any name--Nazism, communism, it doesn't work. 
Here we are, almost 10 years after the fall of communism, with the Berlin Wall, talking about, `Well, I don't know, should we do this? We might offend our Russian friends.' Certainly any important decision must factor in every dynamic in the debate and every dynamic of our national security interest--relationships, future relationships, and in this case it certainly does factor in our relationship with Russia. But, my goodness, why did we fight, for 40 years, a cold war? And we won it. Only 10 years later, to some extent, to be held hostage to what the Russians want? 
You see, I don't see an awful lot of sense in that. Yes, it is important to understand the Russians. Yes, it is important to engage the Russians. But not allow Russia, or any other nation to dominate the final analysis and decisions of our Nation's security interests, nor all of the collective security interests of Europe. 
There is another consequence of this that has not yet been fully developed and that is we would be helping provide role models for Central and Eastern Europe by these three new nations, Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, coming into NATO, complying with--not as a handout, not as a gesture, but complying with all of the requirements established 50 years ago to belong to NATO. We just didn't invent these. They didn't just `happen.' They are the same requirements for Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary as we had for the previous three expansions of NATO. 
Other nations of Central and Eastern Europe can look to these three nations as role models, for help, and not just in the national security dynamic. Let's face it, I have heard, also, a lot of talk about the European Union--why not allow these nations to be brought into the European Union first? Mr. President, you cannot separate economics here. You can't separate economic stability from military stability. 
They are integrally entwined. 
There is no question the world is a global community underpinned by a global economy. Of course--of course--these nations will benefit economically. And that will invent and give opportunities to other countries, and more opportunities as well. Now, this is not just--not just--a national defense issue and a security issue for the United States. This is an investment for the United States. 
This is an investment because it is connected. And if we invest, yes, some money--my goodness, isn't that something? We would actually have to pay some money, not wild exaggerations that we have heard on the floor of the Senate, but some real dollars to invest, to expand the security and stability umbrella of NATO eastward. 
It is an investment for us for a couple of reasons. One, it will help assure this country will not be sending its children and its grandchildren to fight another World War or a war in Europe. Democracies do not attack other democracies. Democracies do not go to war. So it is an investment in national security and peace for us. 
It is also an economic investment. As these nations that had been under the yoke of Communist dictatorship for almost 50 years are now in a position to develop democracy and flourish economically as they develop their democratic governments and their freedoms, they are as well developing market economies. 
What does that mean to us? That means markets, that means some stability, that means connection. 
I also have found some of my colleagues, particularly on my side of the aisle, comment about, `Well, but this President, this administration, wants to take NATO expansion beyond the boundaries of what the mission is of NATO.' I remind my colleagues on this side of the aisle, my Republican colleagues, who might have some concern about this present administration, 10 Republican and Democratic administrations have presided over America's involvement in NATO, 10 administrations, Republican and Democratic. 
This debate should not get confused with the underbrush of detail or who is in the White House today. This debate is about the future and how we are preparing for the future as we go into the next century--not about Bill Clinton, Madeleine Albright, Bill Cohen. They are players on the scene for a very brief time, just like 10 administrations have been on the scene, essentially for a brief time. 
Missions and organizations change, believe it or not. Missions and organizations change. Times change. Dynamics change, challenges change, circumstances and situations change. 
To my colleagues who say, `Well, prove to me that NATO is going to be important. Prove to me every dollar that's going in. Prove to me we need NATO,' well, as brilliant as many of my colleagues are, no one can give them that answer, you see, because no one can predict the future. But that is what NATO expansion is about. That is why we established NATO 50 years ago, because the future was uncertain and was unstable. If we did not have NATO today, we would have to invent NATO. 
To those of my colleagues who say, `Well, why rush? We're rushing into this. What's so important about doing this now? This year? Next year?' I say, I suppose you could have asked that question after World War II--there was relative peace in Europe after World War II--`What's the rush?' And for every one of the previous three expansions into NATO, you could have said, `Why West Germany now? Let's wait until about 1980,' or for any of the other nations. But, my goodness, doesn't it make a little more sense to develop strong, bold, dynamic, futuristic policy now--now--when we can think clearly, when we can understand the dynamics of the issues rather than, well, let us wait for some country to be invaded and then we will show them what we are going to do? Come on, it does not work that way. It does not work that way. 
Let us not squander the time we now have to plan as best we 
can for a surely uncertain future. 
Another dynamic that gets lost in this debate, Mr. President, is another certainty--the diffusion of power in the world. The face of this globe will not look the same in 25 years. It will not look the same because the geopolitical, economic and military power structures of the globe of this 5.2 billion-people world are changing. Like life changes, everything changes. 
It is in the best interest of this country and the world for us to lead as best we can to prepare for those new challenges and to prepare for that new diffusion of power, as it will surely come, as it is coming today. 
Yes; yes, Europe is only one part of that. But look at the numbers--a rather significant part. Any measurement you take of the importance of Europe, any measurement you take--people, gross domestic product, exports--and do we really believe Europe still and will still be untouched into the next century with no war, no conflict? 
Who would have predicted Bosnia? Who would have foreseen that in 1990 and 1991? Kosovo. These are deadly, real examples of how fast things can come unraveled even in--even in--Europe. 
Another question that is asked, and appropriately so, is our force strength. It is a very good question. Over the last 10 years, we have been asking our military to do more with less--more deployments, longer deployments. We now have a force structure, in real dollar terms--in real budget terms--that is down as low as any time since 1940. Less than 3 percent of our gross domestic product goes for our national defense. That is below dangerously low. And if we in fact are going to ask our military to take on new responsibilities, like NATO expansion, which I support, and NATO and the Persian Gulf, and a hundred other nations where we have troops, then we are going to have to pay attention to our military. And we have not been doing that. 
Another debate for another time surely, Mr. President, but one that is appropriately talked about in this debate and asked because if we are going to ask our military to do more, we are going to have to pay attention to the budget and to rebuilding our military. We are soon becoming a hollow military, and that is in any measurement you wish to take. In the President's own budget for fiscal year 1999, he cuts another 25,000 uniformed men and women from the services. We cannot have it both ways. But, as I say, part of the debate should be part of that debate, but that debate should come at a different time. 
I conclude my remarks, Mr. President, by saying that we have a unique opportunity, as the most dominant nation on Earth, at a most unique time in history--not a time seen probably since Rome during the Roman Empire--when one nation has so thoroughly dominated this globe. 
There is a bigger question for this country and a bigger challenge that will require a bigger debate than NATO. But it is part of the debate. And that is, yes, a great nation is required to do great things, to take on great burdens, and to give great leadership. It is an awesome responsibility the United States has. And our challenge, our debate is, do we wish in fact to go into the next century as that dominant great nation and carry that great burden of leadership? 
This is part of that debate. 
We have an opportunity, unique in history, to help build strong democracies, help to build structures that will give more people more freedom than the history has ever known, more market economies, better standards of living, better health, less conflict, less war. That is why NATO expansion is important. It is not the only issue, maybe not the most important issue, but surely it fits into the grander debate that we will have. 
New alliances are being formed, new alliances will continue to be formed in the next century. We want to be part of that. As we rely on more nations and more relationships and more alliances, in the end that will mean less burden for us, less burden for us because we are helping develop strong democratic nations with resources, with economies that can defend themselves. That is in our interest. In the end, it is in the world's interest. 
That, more than any other reason, is why I strongly support NATO expansion. I ask that my colleagues in this body who are still undecided, for legitimate reasons, listen to this debate closely, because in the end this debate is about our future and what is in our best interest. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. HAGEL. No, I didn't say it is for all of Europe. I said we would have a Europe, as we expand NATO eastward, that gives Europe an opportunity from east to west, all of Europe, to be democratic, opportunity to develop market economies, the potential to be a free continent, and that NATO could help do that.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise this morning to express my strong support for the Parent and Student Savings Account Act, or PASS Act, of which I am a cosponsor. I have listened over the last few weeks to the debate on this issue. It is about things bigger than just the Coverdell bill. It is about the philosophy of education in America. I am constantly astonished that the Coverdell bill has so exercised so many of my colleagues. I question why this is such a big deal. 
The Coverdell bill is part of an overall philosophy about education. Yes; our future is our children, and our children's future is education. But this Coverdell bill should be part of the national debate about where we take education into the next century--this new, bold, dynamic competitive new century. For the first time we will ask our young people to compete in a new, competitive, international world. 
After all, Mr. President, what is education about? What is education really about? It is not about debating amendments on the floor of the Senate. It should not be about whose money it is, or whose money it is not, nor about bureaucracy. It should be about our young people. It should be about educating our young people so that they are prepared to compete in this brave new world--this world full of immense opportunities. But there will not be opportunities if we do not prepare our young people to negotiate this new world. 
Education is about something else. It is not just about science and math, and reading and writing--yes, that is important--and economics, history, and geography. It is also about developing young people so that we are producing happy, productive citizens--happy, productive citizens so that they, too, might contribute to our society and to our culture. But ignorance is the great enemy to productivity and to secure, happy lives. It is all connected. It is all connected. 
If in fact you believe, as I do, that the Federal Government does not belong in education--in fact, if we will roll this back 200 years, you show me in the Constitution of the United States, or show me anywhere, where the Federal Government has the responsibility to educate our young people. It does not. It can't. We are overloading our circuits. We are overloading our system. We are asking the Government to do things that Government can't possibly do. Therefore, as we have done over the last 30 years, there has been a breakdown in confidence in our country and in government at every level, but especially Government at the Federal level. 
What do we do about it? Let's step back for a moment and pause and be unemotional and sort this out. We sort it out this way. Who has the most to win or lose when it comes to education of our young people? Of course, the parents are the ones who care the most, and who should care the most. The parents are the connecting rod for our children in every facet and every aspect of our children's lives. Who also cares about our students and about their education? Teachers. Revelation--teachers--parents and teachers. 
So we have a good combination going on here--not the Government, not the Federal Government, not the Department of Education, not the President, not Senator Hagel nor Senator Coverdell. Education belongs at the local level because that is where the issue is. This is not about books and textbooks, numbers, frogs, dissecting, and biology class. It is about people. It is about young people. It is about their lives. It is about the strains and stresses of young people. We have all been through it. 
What is wrong with examining in some detail, as we are doing, the Coverdell bill? What is wrong with actually allowing parents to put aside after-tax income? By the way, after-tax income is not costing the public schools a dime. It is not costing the public schools a dime. We are allowing the parents who have the most to win or lose by the education of their children an opportunity to take their own money that they work for after they have paid their taxes and put it into a savings account. It is the same thing that we did last year. My goodness, President Clinton had a Rose Garden ceremony. He took great credit for allowing our parents to have education savings accounts to educate our children after they are out of high school. 
All this does is allow the same parents to set aside money to help educate their children in K through 12. That is all we are doing here. We are not really breaking any new ground. What is so wrong with that? What is wrong with that concept? This Senator from the State of Nebraska doesn't think there is anything wrong with it. As a matter of fact, we need more of that. We need more. We need less government influence and more local parent-teacher influence in education. 
So much misinformation has been spread around on this issue. We should set the record straight. As I said, this does not inhibit, damage, nor affect public schools adversely at all. As a matter of fact, it helps public schools because the parents who set up the savings account can draw from that savings account to help their students and their children if they are in public school just as if they are in private school. Those moneys can be used for transportation, tutors, equipment, supplies, tuition--anything that helps the student learn. After all, Mr. President, isn't that what this debate should be about? It shouldn't be about defending turf. It shouldn't be about, `Gee, I do not want to give that program up.' It should be allowing the parents to have as much direct influence and responsibility, as well as teachers, as well as the local school board, the city, the county and State, in how our young people are educated. 
That is what this debate is about. As we work our way through this Coverdell bill, expanding on what we already did last year in setting up education savings accounts, it should be a national debate, and it should reside in the arena of a philosophy about education. 
I would also point out that in the more than 200-year history of this country, there is one point that has been unmistakably clear. And I go back to an earlier point I made. Governments do not change behavior. Young people are formed from the inside out. Young people are not formed from the outside in. Young people are formed from their parents, their religious mentors, their religion, their teachers, their coaches, and private voluntary organizations like Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts. 
That is how young people are taught. That is how they develop standards. That is how they develop expectations and understand values. That is what this debate is about. I hope we can focus on what is really important here, and that is helping our parents and our teachers help our students learn, to prepare them for a hopeful, happy, productive educated life. Only then can this great Nation not only survive but be dominant well into the next century, a nation which has produced so much good not only in this country but in the world. 
Think of what this country through freedom of expression, individual liberty, and our educational system has done for the world. That is our charge in this body. That is our responsibility--to assure that the next generations not only have the same opportunities but better opportunities and are better prepared than we were. The Coverdell bill is one way to help us get there. 
I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, last month the U.N. global climate treaty became available for the formal signatures of those countries who reached agreement in Kyoto, Japan, in December. President Clinton has not signed the treaty. There is speculation, however, that he may sign the treaty this week. 
Today we remind the President that the U.N. global climate treaty does not meet the standards clearly established by the U.S. Senate in its 95-0 vote last year on the Byrd-Hagel resolution, Senate Resolution 98. The President should not sign any treaty until that treaty complies with Senate Resolution 98 in its entirety. 
The administration completely ignored the strong position of the Senate when it agreed to this treaty last December. 
I led the Senate observer group delegation to Kyoto, Japan, in December. After Vice President Gore came to Kyoto and instructed our negotiators to show `increased flexibility,' the doors were thrown open and the objective became very clear. The objective was: Let us get a deal at any cost. The clear advice of the U.S. Senate and the economic well-being of the American people were abandoned under pressure from the U.N. bureaucrats, international environmentalists and the 134 developing countries that were not even included--not even included--in the treaty. The United States of America was the only Nation to come out of these negotiations worse than it came in. In fact, there was no negotiation in Kyoto; there was only surrender. 
When the Senate voted last year on the Byrd-Hagel resolution, it was very clear as to what the resolution said. 
First, it directed the President not to sign any treaty that placed legally binding obligations on the United States to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions unless--unless--and I quote directly from S. Res. 98 passed last year by this body 95-0--  
. . . unless the protocol or agreement also mandates new specific scheduled commitments to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions [for all nations] for Developing Country Parties within the same compliance period. 
Meaning simply that if this was a global problem, it required a global solution. All nations had to be bound by legally binding mandates, not just the United States and the other developed nations. The message was simple. There was no ambiguity. This was not the administration's nebulous definition of `meaningful participation' for developing countries. This word of the Senate was quite clear. 
The Kyoto Protocol does not include a single developing nation. The Kyoto Protocol agreed to by the United States in December does not include a single developing country; 134 developing nations, including China, Mexico, India, Brazil, and South Korea, many of whom compete fiercely--fiercely--with the United States for trade opportunities, are completely exempt from any obligations or responsibilities for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 
During a recent hearing in the Foreign Relations Committee, Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat, the lead U.S. negotiator in Kyoto, admitted the administration failed on this 
account. Secretary Eizenstat said--and I quote the Undersecretary--`You're absolutely right; we did not get binding commitments [from any] developing countries.' 
The second requirement of the Byrd-Hagel resolution speaks directly to the impact this treaty would have on the American people. And it, too--it too--fell victim in Kyoto. Senate Resolution 98 stated that the President should not sign any treaty which `. . . would result in serious harm to the economy of the United States.' 
The Kyoto Protocol would legally bind the United States to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions to 7 percent below 1990 levels by the years 2008 to 2012. It even goes much further than the President's own bottom line that he personally announced last October when President Clinton pledged he would not accept a baseline below 1990 levels in greenhouse gas emissions, and he said there must be `meaningful participation' from all developing countries. 
Numerous independent economic studies predicted serious economic harm even if the administration had held to its position that it enunciated last October. These studies found job losses in the range of over 2 million, large increases in energy costs, a 50-cent increase in gas prices per gallon, a drop in economic growth rates of more than 1 percent a year, and major American industries being driven out of business or driven out of the United States--industries like steel, aluminum, petroleum refining, chemicals, iron, paper products, and cement. 
That is why American agriculture, American labor, American business and industry and many consumer groups have all united in opposition--in opposition--to this treaty. Yet, our negotiators in Kyoto--the ones who were supposed to be looking out for the American people--agreed to a treaty that would have had an even more devastating impact on the U.S. economy and on the lives of the American people. 
The administration's recent anemic attempt to develop an economic analysis showing `minimal' harm to the U.S. economy is laughable. It is truly laughable. No models, no numbers, no percentages, no economics. It is laughable. It is based on fabrication and vapor, on a wildly optimistic assumption--as an example, China, India and Mexico agreeing to the binding commitments in this treaty. That is nonsense, Mr. President. These very nations blocked language in Kyoto, Japan, last year that would have allowed developing countries to even voluntarily--voluntarily--undertake the obligations of this treaty. They will never agree to binding commitments, and have so stated. 
Even from an environmental standpoint, the Kyoto Protocol is a failure. This Wednesday is Earth Day, and some will undoubtedly attempt to hold up this treaty as an example of a significant accomplishment to help our environment. The truth is, this treaty is so flawed that it will do virtually nothing to slow the growth of manmade greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere. Even if one accepts the validity of the science on global warming, which is still uncertain and at best contradictory, this treaty would do nothing to stop any of these emissions. The Kyoto Protocol excludes the very developing nations who will be responsible for more than 60 percent of the world's manmade greenhouse gas emissions early in the next century. 
China will be the world's largest emitter of manmade greenhouse gasses by the year 2015. On February 13 of this year, the Washington Post reported, `But even if the accord is ratified and fully implemented, it would barely dent the world's output of manmade greenhouse gasses * * *.' This treaty makes no sense. It is folly, complete folly. 
Yet, the administration has made it clear that President Clinton intends to sign this treaty at some point during the period it is open for signature between now and next March. The administration has also made it very clear that it understands the treaty has no chance of ratification in the Senate and that it intends to withhold this treaty from Senate consideration. The President claims that the treaty is, in his words, `a work in progress.' This leaves people with the mistaken impression that the treaty remains under negotiation and that objectionable parts of the treaty can be negotiated away before it is submitted to the Senate. Mr. President, this is not the case. This is not the case. Why would anyone sign a legally binding treaty they consider a work in progress? That is complete nonsense. 
This treaty cannot be amended until it goes into force, and even then, only by a three-quarters vote of all countries that have become party to the protocol. The 134 developing countries that would not even voluntarily sign on to this, which are not bound by any emissions limits, make up more than the three-quarters of the world's nations. Hence, they control any amendment to this treaty. The countries that have no obligations in this treaty are the very nations that dictate and enforce its terms. This is outrageous. 
My coauthor of S. Res. 98, Senator Byrd of West Virginia, said recently on the floor of the Senate that the Kyoto Protocol did not meet either of the Senate standards laid out in the Byrd-Hagel resolution. Senator Byrd said, `I hope that the President will not sign his name to the protocol at this point * * * I am concerned that if the President signs this protocol 
at this point, it will compromise his flexibility in dealing with the developing countries over the next year.' 
Senator Byrd is absolutely correct. It makes no sense to sign a flawed treaty, thereby giving away our leverage and our negotiating strength. If the President believes this treaty is good enough to sign, it should be good enough, Mr. President, to submit to the Senate for an honest and open debate. The American people have a right to know exactly what obligations the United States would have under this treaty. 
Members of the Senate and the House will remain actively engaged in this issue. Oversight hearings will continue. We will continue to hold hearings this year to ensure that the administration does not attempt to implement this treaty or any part of this treaty prior to Senate ratification through Executive order, budget fiat, or regulatory action. 
During the Foreign Relations Committee hearing in February, I asked Secretary Eizenstat about any attempts to implement this treaty prior to Senate ratification. He replied, `We have no intention through the back door or anything else, without Senate confirmation, of trying to impose or take any steps to impose what would be binding restrictions on our companies, on our industry, on our business, on our agriculture, on our commerce, or on our country until and unless the Senate of the United States says so.' That is Secretary Eizenstat. 
Mr. President, we will hold the Clinton administration to its word. Recent news reports, however, have brought to light a very dishonest attempt by the EPA to impose carbon emissions caps through the deregulation of the electric industry. I was glad to see that the administration dropped this nonsense from its final electric deregulation proposal. There will be no implementation of this treaty before ratification by the Senate of the United States. 
The Senate's bottom line, as represented in the unanimous 95-0 vote on S. Res. 98, remains unchanged. The U.S. Senate will not support the ratification of the Kyoto treaty because it does not include binding commitments by the developing nations and does serious harm to the U.S. economy. 
This has become an economic treaty, not an environmental treaty, and it is a bad treaty for America. So bad that it will not be ratified by this body.

Mr. HAGEL. Today the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 1 p.m., at which time the Senate will resume consideration of the budget resolution. As previously announced, there will be no rollcall votes conducted during today's session. However, the managers do expect amendments to be offered, and the next rollcall vote will occur on Tuesday morning at a time to be determined by the majority leader. As always, Members will be notified as to the time of those votes. 
In addition, today the Senate may consider any executive or legislative business cleared for Senate action. In regard to the balance of the week, the Senate is expected to complete action on the budget resolution and the supplemental appropriations conference report, if available, prior to recessing for the Easter holidays. Therefore, Members can anticipate a very busy week of floor action. 
As a reminder to Members, the next rollcall vote will occur on Tuesday at a time yet to be determined. It will be announced later. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. HAGEL. Madam President, I rise with about 20 minutes remaining before the vote on the IMF package. 
I wish to first thank the distinguished chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Stevens, for his leadership in this area. This is a tough issue. It is an important issue. It is an issue that has come to the floor with much heated debate and exchange. But I wish in just a minute to try to put some perspective on what we are doing here. 
First, our economy is connected to all economies of the world. When Asian markets go down and currencies are devalued, that means very simply that we in the United States cannot sell our products in Asia. Asia has represented over the last few years the most important new export opportunity for all of the United States--not just commodities and agriculture, but all exports. What we are doing today is connected to all parts of the world. We understand something very fundamental about markets and that is that markets respond to confidence. We in the United States--because it is, in fact, in our best interests to participate and lead, not to bail people out, not the IMF bailing anybody out, but what we are doing through a very deliberate businesslike approach, an approach through the IMF established 50 years ago--are participating in a loan process where this country has never lost $1. We ourselves have used this. 
So today all those colleagues of mine who have been so helpful, so involved, I wish to thank and wish also, in these final minutes, to encourage all my colleagues to take a look at this, understand the perspective, ramifications, the consequences, and the importance of what we doing here with this IMF support. 
Madam President, I yield the floor.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I thank my friend and distinguished colleague, the chairman of the appropriations subcommittee that is handling this piece of legislation. I am grateful. 
I might add, Mr. President, there were many people who worked hard, and some even diligently, on this to get an achievable reform package that really would do what the chairman from Kentucky has pointed out it would accomplish. There is not one among us in this body who did not want real reform, nor understand that real reform was required within the IMF structure. That was accomplished. I am proud of what we have done here and how we have done it. I am proud of the product. 
Beyond that, I think it is important to recognize that today we live in a global community, anchored by a global economy. Certainly all the markets of the world are important to the United States. Not just farmers and ranchers and small businesspeople, but every person in America is affected when markets go down and when currencies are devalued. Not that the United States should rescue or has the obligation or responsibility to rescue every economy, but we must lead because it is relevant, it is in our best interests, our national interest. 
We know that markets respond to confidence. What we are doing here is projecting the leadership that America must project in a global economy and with that is attached a certain amount of confidence. Investors and others around the globe, regardless where they look for those investments and opportunities in stable, secure areas, can do so with some confidence that all nations of the world are interconnected and have some global responsibility for those markets. 
I might also add to something the distinguished Senator McConnell from Kentucky mentioned. This is not foreign aid. There is some confusion about that when it is portrayed as a bailout to big bankers and big investors who care little about jeopardizing their own interests, thinking that there is some safety net of taxpayers' dollars under them. This is not a foreign aid bill. This is a process where for 50 years the United States has been essentially on a credit/demand process loaning money into the International Monetary Fund. We are repaid for those loans, and we are repaid with interest for those loans. We can get our money out of the IMF at any moment. The IMF moneys and accounts are backed up by gold reserves. The United States has never lost one dollar on any loan it has made to the IMF. As a matter of fact, it should be pointed out the United States, in fact, in 1978, took advantage of the IMF. 
So it is my opinion, and I think the opinion of many of my colleagues, that the IMF can play an important role in the world. It should not be the banker for everyone. It should not be the safety net for every investor, no. But, in a world that is interconnected--and when markets in Asia go down that backs up to every market in America; that we are connected--the IMF institute, and that kind of institution, is important as we trade and become more globally linked. 
So I am pleased that I have had an opportunity, along with many of my colleagues who were mentioned by Senator McConnell, to have played a small role in this. I encourage my colleagues to support what has been done here today and what has been agreed upon and the language that is in this amendment. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, today I am joining with Senators Grams, Roberts, Chafee, and Domenici in introducing the International Monetary Fund Reform Act. This legislation is the product of weeks of work and negotiation we have undertaken to develop a package of very tough--but achievable--reforms for the IMF. We all agree that there must be IMF reform. But relevant, workable, and achievable reforms are what we must put in place. 
It's in America's national interest for Congress to move swiftly to support the full $18 billion request for the IMF. Our actions--or inactions--will have real short-term and long-term economic consequences for America's interests in Asia and around the world. This morning, I chaired a hearing in the Foreign Relations Committee that showed how important the IMF is to American agriculture and our ability to build and keep markets overseas. We cannot discount the importance of the message our actions or inactions here will send. A stable Asian marketplace is in America's interest. 
We are introducing this legislation today so that all our colleagues can review the compromise language we have put together. As the debate on this issue unfolds, we intend to remain actively involved.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I wish to take a moment to call attention to a significant day in our Nation's history. Not only is this St. Patrick's Day, but it was 25 years ago today, St. Patrick's Day, March 17, 1973, that our friend and colleague, Senator John McCain, was released from the Hanoi Hilton. Senator McCain was shot down over Vietnam on October 26, 1967, and spent almost 6 years in a North Vietnamese prison. Most of that time was in solitary confinement. 
It is appropriate today that we not only recognize that 25-year anniversary of Senator McCain, but recognize the leadership, the inspiration and what he has meant to this country. In a day when I know many people sometimes question whether values do count and standards and expectations do count, our colleague, our friend, Senator McCain, is an embodiment to what is best in this country, what has always been best, and what always will be important--that is loyalty and commitment to your country, that is dedication, it is values and standards, it is having high expectations in oneself. 
It is a rather unique example of how someone has been able to take the experience that he has had and harness that energy and focus that energy for something very positive for this country and to help make this world better. That is Senator John McCain. 
This morning, some of our colleagues--I see one on the floor, our friend, Senator Cleland from Georgia, who, too, gave so much to his country in the Vietnam war--recognized John McCain in a surprise visit to his office at 9:15. One of the things that we gave him was a United States Navy A-4 jet fighter ejection seat. I reminded him when he came to campaign for me in 1996, as we flew across Nebraska in a small plane, one of the copilots said, `Now, let me explain to you how you get out of this plane if you need to,' and I interrupted this young pilot by saying, `Senator McCain never uses the door, he gets out another way.' As that young pilot went up into the cockpit, the other pilot said, `You dummy, that is Senator McCain. Don't you know the story how he ejected and crash landed and did these incredible things?' We reminisced about that this morning and then presented Senator McCain an actual A-4 ejection seat. I don't know what he does with that, but a couple of old infantry men like Senator Cleland and I were out of our league dealing with the ejection seats and we didn't go near that seat. 
Suffice it to say that this Nation owes Senator McCain and all the POWs a great debt. We recognize their service, their commitment, their loyalty, but mostly we recognize their leadership and what they have meant to us when times are tough and when we dig down deep in our society and we look for standards and leadership and commitment and role models. Mr. President, that role model is John McCain. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, these are very serious times. The administration and America face a complicated and dangerous dilemma in Iraq. This dilemma must be approached from a framework of both our short-term and long-term foreign policy objectives. 
As the administration weighs its short-term options, including the possibility of military action with regard to the situation in Iraq, I believe it is very important that we in the Senate keep a steady focus on the objective before we start playing out these other options. 
We all know that any military action must have a clear objective. If our Nation decides to risk the lives of young American men and women, we must do so for a clear purpose, with a clear understanding of the possible intended and unintended consequences and a reasonable assurance of success. 
Let us remember that the original objective in the Iraqi puzzle was the full compliance by Saddam Hussein with the 1991 resolutions that ended the Gulf war. Most important is Security Council Resolution 687, adopted on April 3, 1991, which clearly spelled out Iraq's obligations under the cease-fire agreement that ended the Gulf war. Those obligations have the force of international law and still stand today. 
This has been the U.N.'s primary focus and objective. It was Saddam Hussein who created this current situation when he invaded Kuwait in 1990 and the world united against him. This is not the United States and Great Britain against Iraq. This has been the civilized world united against a pariah intent on developing and using weapons of mass destruction. 
We have sympathy for the Iraqi people. The U.N., led by the United States, has provided millions of dollars in humanitarian aid for the Iraqi people. But we must remember that Hussein used chemical weapons against his own people and has starved his own people in his clandestine and relentless pursuit of these weapons. 
Time after time he has directly challenged the terms of his surrender under the U.N. resolution. What he is now challenging is the resolve of the world community to stand up to him. 
The members of the international coalition that condemned his actions in 1991 and fought against him must remember who is the guilty party here; who is the guilty party. The guilty party is Saddam Hussein. 
Just as the world stood united in terms of his surrender, it should stand united and resolved in action against his defiance of those terms. If he refuses to comply with U.N. Resolution 687, he will pay a heavy price. And if Saddam Hussein offers his own people as sacrificial lambs, their blood surely will be on his hands. 
Mr. President, there is a growing chorus which suggests that perhaps our short-term objective should be more than Saddam Hussein's full compliance with U.N. Resolution 687, that our immediate short-term objective should be to expel Saddam Hussein from Iraq, to sweep him from the world stage. This kind of talk is very dangerous and inhibits the administration's efforts as it seeks to reconstruct the 1991 coalition united against Saddam Hussein. Let us not be buffeted by the winds of quick fixes, bombing raids and shortsightedness. Saddam Hussein has cleverly framed this world debate as Iraq against the United States. We must not play into his manipulative hands. This is not the 
equation. 
We all would like to eliminate the threat he poses to the civilized world and that should be our long-term goal. That should be our long-term goal. But for the moment we must not forget that from objectives come actions, and from actions come consequences. Every objective carries with it a different set of military options and will have very real consequences. Actions always produce consequences and not always the geopolitical consequences we expect. We must guard against the short-term objective turning into a long-term unexpected problem. 
After our lightning success in Desert Storm, I fear that we, as Americans, may have been lulled into a false sense of believing that modern wars can be fought relatively quickly and painlessly, with high-tech weapons and very limited casualties. This is not the case, nor will it ever be the case in warfare. 
Those who believe that this greater short-term objective could be accomplished without the use of a massive ground force are underestimating the task. 
We need to be aware of the `law of unintended consequences.' There are always uncertainties in war. The consequences of any kind of military undertaking are far-reaching. With the current tensions in this region and the grim prospects for peace in the Middle East, this area of the world could erupt like a tinder box. Whatever military action might be taken against Saddam Hussein, it must be surgical, it must be precise, and it must be focused and, above all, well thought out. Other nations would undoubtedly seek to increase their spheres of influence in the Middle East if our immediate objective was to eliminate Saddam Hussein. If we were to escalate the level of our short-term objective, would we create consequences just as, if not more, dangerous to our national interests in the world than the situation we currently face? 
As painfully slow as this process seems to be moving, events can unfold very quickly and uncontrollably. We cannot allow Saddam Hussein to stampede us into precipitous actions. Remember how the Six Day War began in 1967. Remember other events of this century that engulfed nations in wider, larger, and more deadly conflicts than anyone could have predicted. 
I ask my colleagues in the Senate to keep this in mind when thinking about how to respond to the present situation in Iraq. What chain of events will we unleash with any action we take? Always the question must be asked, what then happens? What happens next? Are we prepared to not only answer this question but deal with the answer? Any short-term action must fit into a long-term foreign policy objective. 
Any short-term action that America takes must fit into a long-term foreign policy objective. What is the administration's long-term objective in Iraq? Do we have one? Or are we crafting a long-term policy to justify short-term actions? 
In the long term, I believe we need to be more creative in reviewing our options against Saddam Hussein. We must not allow ourselves to get caught up in the trap of doing something--anything--just because we said we would and the world expects us to. Our options should be based on what's right, what's achievable commensurate with the risk we are willing to take with American lives and what will truly have an impact in resolving the problem. And the problem is Saddam Hussein. 
Mr. President, I am a little disturbed about reports over the weekend quoting high-ranking administration officials and congressional leaders saying such things as: We may have to face the reality that we will not get U.N. inspection teams back into Iraq; any military action would be to just slow Saddam Hussein down and we would have to keep going back to bomb him again and again every so many months and years; and our allies' support of us in Iraq may be tied to our future commitment to NATO. 
These are disconcerting remarks. We owe it to our country and the men and women in uniform who will be called upon to fight a war, if that decision is made, to do better than just bomb Saddam Hussein. First of all, the military option alone will not work if we truly want a final resolution of this problem. Some form of immediate military action may well be required as part of an overall long-term solution but only a part, only a part of a long-term solution.

Mr. HAGEL. I find that I am asking myself the unescapable question--are we preparing to send our young men and women to war because we just all expect that this is the thing to do because we don't know what else to do? 
That is not good enough. There is something very surreal about all the war talk, and war preparation being played out in this matter of fact tone on international TV with every talk show panelist in the world presenting his or her theories and options on war in Iraq--when most all of them have never been to war, prepared for war or understand the first thing about the horrors of war. 
Our national defense is the guarantor of our foreign policy. I don't know if we have a long term policy on Iraq other than maintaining the U.N. sanctions and enforcing the resolutions, but that's not a foreign policy. If we are to commit America to war, it should be to enforce our foreign policy--just going to war alone is not enough. We must have an overall long term policy to enforce. The reason for war must be connected to more than just short-term sanctions enforcement. 
It is my opinion that if we exercise any military option it must be accompanied by and attached to creative geopolitical elements of a comprehensive policy toward Iraq--geopolitical elements such as Secretary Perle listed yesterday. In the long run, how do we realistically get rid of Saddam Hussein? That's the policy question we should have been focused on over the last seven years. Sending America to war with one ally is no policy. We can do better. We must do better. 
Nations lead from their strength of purpose, self confidence, and character. As President Teddy Roosevelt once said, `The one indispensable, requisite for both an individual and a nation is character.' Allies will follow us if they trust our word and our policy. Bullying allies into submission for agreement is not leadership. 
With regard to the immediate situation in Iraq we need to remain focused on the original objective--the full compliance by Saddam Hussein with U.N. Resolution 687. We should not act out of frustration or impatience. We have to stay focused on the objective and not overstate--not overstate expectations to the American people or the world. 
For the mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, and loved ones of our men and women in the Gulf--we must proceed with clear eyed realism, not with emotionalism, not with revenge. 
There are no good options. Saddam Hussein is intent on building the most vile weapons in the history of man, weapons outlawed by nearly all the countries of the world, and is openly defying the will of the global community. He cannot go unchallenged. 
Should diplomatic efforts fail, we will be forced to take additional action to force Saddam Hussein to comply with the unanimous mandate of the U.N. Security Council. As long as this action meets a clear immediate objective, and the level of force is commensurate with that objective, the American people will come together and be unified behind the action taken. 
In the future, the American people and the Congress must have a more solid basis for our support. We cannot continue to ricochet from crisis to crisis and call that foreign policy. Our nation must develop a long term, coherent policy not only toward Iraq and Saddam Hussein, but toward the entire Middle East. How are we prepared to deal with Iran? How do we plan to help make meaningful and lasting progress in the Middle East peace process? What are our foreign policy objectives with regard to North Korea, China, Bosnia, Europe, Russia, Asia, and other areas of the world? These policies must be clearly stated and clearly understood by both our allies and our adversaries. 
As I said in the beginning, these are serious times. These are difficult times. There are no easy answers, only tough challenges and tough questions. They require serious solutions to serious questions from serious people. America is up to the task. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of Senate Joint Resolution 40, introduced yesterday by my distinguished colleague from Utah, Senator Orrin Hatch, proposing an amendment to the Constitution authorizing Congress to prohibit the physical desecration of the American Flag. 
From the birth of our nation, the Flag has represented all that is good and decent about our country. Whether it be the battlefields of Bunker Hill and Gettysburg, the trenches of Flanders Field, the shores of Normandy, the rugged terrain of Korea, the jungles of the Mekong, or the desert of Kuwait--the Stars and Stripes led young Americans into battle. Proud young soldiers would carry it high, and if they should fall another would be right there to pick up Old Glory and carry it forward. It may have been tattered by the battle and singed by fire of war, but the American flag burned as a guiding beacon of hope and freedom for our young men and women. For those who paid the ultimate price for our nation, the Flag blanketed their journey and graced their final rest place. 
You see, Mr. President, the Flag is not just a piece of cloth. The `broad stripes and bright stars' shining through the `rockets' red glare' inspired Francis Scott Key to write the Star Spangled Banner. It is a symbol so sacred to our nation that we teach our children not to let it touch the ground. It flies over our schools, our churches and synagogues, our courts, our seats of government and homes across America. The Pledge of Allegiance unites all Americans regardless of race, creed or color. The flag is not just a symbol of America, it is America. 
Those who oppose this legislation say that it impinges on freedom of speech and violates our Constitution. In my view this is a hollow argument. There are many limits placed on `free speech,' including limiting yelling `fire' in a crowded theater. Other freedoms of speech and expression are limited by our slander and libel laws. 
In 1989 and 1990 the Supreme Court of this great nation struck down flag protection laws by narrow votes. The Court has an obligation to protect and preserve our fundamental rights as citizens. However the American people understand the difference between freedom of speech and `anything goes.' 
When our citizens disagree with our national policy, there are a number of options available to them other than destroying the American Flag to make their point. Let them protest, let them write to their newspaper, let them organize, let them march, let them shout to the rooftops--but we should not let them burn the Flag. Too many have died defending the Flag for us to allow it to be used in any way that does not honor their sacrifice. 
Mr. President, in a day where too often we lament what has gone wrong with America, it's time to make a stand for decency, for honor and for pride in our nation. Just as the Flag has wrapped itself around the hearts and souls of our nation, let us now wrap the protection of our Constitution around the Flag.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to address what I believe is a serious issue. Let me read just the opening paragraph of a story that appeared this morning in The Washington Times. The headline of the story is `Koop given waiver for burial at Arlington; former Surgeon General helped Hillary.' 
The first paragraph of the story is this:  
President Clinton overrode Army opposition and granted a unique burial waiver at Arlington National Cemetery to C. Everett Koop at a time when First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton had enlisted the former Surgeon General to support her national health care plan, internal documents showed yesterday. 
The story goes on to talk about not just the dynamics of an implied deal, but it is far more serious than just an implied deal in my opinion, Mr. President, because what we are talking about here is giving sacred resting spots of our Nation's veterans away as deals, as rewards, as bargaining chips, as thank yous, as awards, as quid pro quos. 
Mr. President, this is not only a bad precedent and very dangerous for the future of our country, but it flies in the face of the honor and the trust that America has always placed in its veterans and their service to our country. This is hallowed ground, Mr. President, this is sacred ground. Arlington National Cemetery is a national shrine. It should be a national shrine. We have very strict regulations and limitations as to who is allowed the great and distinct honor to be laid to rest at Arlington. 
Mr. President, I have no quarrel with Dr. Koop. He was a very successful and important Surgeon General, a renowned doctor, and he has done many good things for his profession and our country and our Government. But someone has to talk about this because, you see, there is a connection; there is a connection between what obviously was done and what is not being done today for our active military men and women in uniform and for our retirees. I would like to read just two lines from one of Rudyard Kipling's finest poems. This poem, Mr. Kipling wrote is called `Tommy.' Many veterans will know this poem. Two of the last lines go like this: 
For it's Tommy this an' Tommy that, an' chuck him out the brute! 
But it's `savior of 'is country' when the guns begin to shoot. 
Mr. President, this is a time when this body will debate and vote on shortly--in the next few weeks--whether we are going to ask our military, our men and women in uniform, who we call on every day to protect our liberties around the world, and we are going to commit them to more responsibility in Bosnia, NATO expansion, Iraq, maybe, yet we are now in a position to be giving away burial spots that were originally always intended for the man and the woman who put on America's military uniform and serve our country with great honor and great distinction. This is also a time, Mr. President, when veterans are having difficulty using the veterans' preference in getting jobs in the Federal Government. We are asking them constantly, especially over the last few years, as we have cut more and more of our defense budget, to do more with less. We are asking them to go on longer deployments and more deployments. 
The state of our military housing is embarrassing. Yet, the President is very proud to submit a military budget that has no increases. I watched this morning the President's news conference, bragging about this small, limited little Government we have, that we have cut Government. Well, again, as I said last week, I don't know how he measures the cutting of Government, but the fact is we are going to spend $1.7 trillion on this Government this year. The Defense Department budget continually gets hammered and hammered. There has been no increase, but a 40 percent reduction in the last 10 years. 
Health care. What have we done about health care for our retirees? We have done nothing. We have essentially taken away the promise that we made to these men and women in uniform, who served our country in time of war and peace, and now we are saying you need to get into the Medicare queue. I am sorry we cut back on military hospitals and on military personnel. Don't we understand that this may well inhibit readiness, retention, recruitment, and the best people for the military? Of course, it will.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, this morning I come to the floor to recognize a man who has lived the American ideals of integrity, courage and, leadership. This man, Mr. President, is Dr. Tom Osborne, head football coach of the University of Nebraska Cornhuskers. 
My good friend and Nebraska colleague, former Governor of the State of Nebraska, Senator Bob Kerrey, joins me in this recognition this morning. 
I have also informed my good friends and colleague from the State of Michigan, where there seems to be some controversy as to which football team really was No. 1 at the end of the season, Michigan or Nebraska, that I would welcome their support in recognition as well. Quite honestly, and seriously, Mr. President, Senators Levin and Abraham have asked me to extend to Dr. Osborne their best wishes as well. Of course, with the distinguished Presiding Officer being a leader in the Kansas State Wildcats' efforts over the last few years, I, too, will add your good wishes for Dr. Osborne, and thank you, Mr. President. 
After 25 years as head coach, Tom Osborne has decided to retire and devote more of his time to his family and important voluntary organizations. Tom Osborne has been a constant in Nebraska sports history. In 1955, as a high school student in Hastings, NE, he was named the Omaha World Herald's High School Athlete of the Year. He continued his success in athletics at Hastings College where he was a starter on both the school's football and basketball teams. Once again, in 1958, the Omaha World Herald honored him with the College Athlete of the Year award. 
After a stint in the National Football League with the San Francisco 49ers and the Washington Redskins, he landed at the University of Nebraska in 1962. Shortly thereafter, he joined the now legendary football coach, the late Bob Devaney, and coordinated the offense for Nebraska's national championship teams in 1970 and 1971. In 1973 Tom took over from the retiring Devaney as head coach of the Nebraska Cornhuskers. 
Tom Osborne made lasting impressions on his players and people of Nebraska and all of college football. His resume is unprecedented and essentially unbelievable--a 25-year record of 255 wins, 49 losses and 3 ties. Over the past 5 years, his Cornhusker teams posted an NCAA record of 60 wins and 3 losses. Coach Osborne led the Huskers to three national championships--1994, 1995 and 1997 in which the Huskers shared the title, as I mentioned, with the University of Michigan. Tom led the Huskers to 13 Big 8/Big 12 Conference titles, 25 straight 9 win seasons and 25 straight bowl appearances. 
With all these accomplishments by his teams on the field, it should also be noted that, under Coach Osborne, Nebraska had 46 first team academic All-Americans and 201 academic all-conference honorees, and the graduation rate of Osborne's players leads and has led the Big 8/Big 12 Conference and is ranked also as one of the highest graduation rates in the Nation. 
Tom Osborne loved coaching. It was his life. But he was more. He was more than just a coach. If you would ask any of his players, they would tell you that he was a father figure, a good friend. Osborne had many opportunities to leave college football and coach in the National Football League, but he never did. He had many opportunities to leave Nebraska, but he never did. He loved the coaching and the teaching associated with college football. But probably more than that, he loved the opportunity to help his players grow mentally and spiritually and become outstanding citizens. As Coach Osborne has said over his magnificent career, that in the end is all that counts. When the game is over, it is over. But what that young man does with his life at the end of his football career is most important; how he contributes to his community, to his family and to his nation is most important. 
The Nebraska football program will continue on successfully. There will be more national championships and conference titles, but Tom Osborne will not be at the helm. We all know that he will not be far away, however. When spring football practice starts, we probably will not expect to see Coach Osborne on campus. You might locate Coach Osborne at a local fishing hole. 
Tom Osborne will be remembered as one of the greatest college football coaches ever to stroll up and down the sidelines. His contributions to the University of Nebraska and college football will never be forgotten. When the reigning national co-champions run on to Tom Osborne Field next fall in Memorial Stadium in Lincoln, there will be something missing. The stoic figure of Tom Osborne will not be roaming the field guiding the Cornhuskers to another victory, but his inspiration and his legacy will be present. 
Thank you, Tom, for your leadership and your contributions. Thank you, most importantly, for your character, for serving as a role model for America's young people. You have inspired us all, and you will be missed. 
We all wish you well. We wish Nancy and your family much continued success, good health, happiness, and a little rest--and good fishing. 
I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. HAGEL. Madam President, I would like to make a couple of observations about last night, the agenda for the second session of this 105th Congress; what is ahead of us, what is ahead for the American people, the challenges that lie ahead for the world. 
As I listened intently and seriously last night, as I am sure all my colleagues did, to the President's message, questions came to me like, `Isn't the definition of the debate for this year and the defining of the debate that the Congress will have into the next century about the role of Government?' That is the issue. What is the role of Government in our lives? How much Government do we want? How much Government can we afford? What do we want Government to do for us? And how much are we willing to pay for Government? 
The President--and I have all eight single-spaced pages of the text of his speech last night--gave a good speech. But the speech was about new programs, the federalization of America. This is the same President who said 2 years ago in a State of the Union Message that the era of big Government is gone. No more big Government. And then the President said last night, early on in his text, that we, today, have, `the smallest Government in 35 years.' I don't know how the President measures that, but this body is going to debate this year a $1.7 trillion Federal budget to keep this small little Government going. 
He talks about federalizing education. I don't find the responsibility of the Federal Government to be education anywhere in the Constitution. I don't find it in any document that education is in the purview and the province of the Federal Government. Yet this President says we, the Federal Government, representing the people who pay the taxes, are going to hire 100,000 new teachers. We are going to federalize new teachers. We are going to build new schools across America, federalize our schools. But yet, of course, he fails to tell us how he intends to do that. Where are those resources coming from? 
At the same time he boasts, rightfully so, that we in fact have moved toward balancing our budget. So he takes credit for that on this side. And then on this side we have page after page, line after line, of new Government spending proposals. 
Medicare has been running a deficit the last couple of years. Yet this President is proposing that we add more people onto Medicare. This is at the same time the President and the Congress have come together and said we need a Medicare commission, a bipartisan Medicare commission to take a look at the seriousness of the problem, of the issue, of the challenge, and report back to the President next year. But, no, he decides not to wait for that. 
Child care--we are going to federalize child care? These are all important, critical issues for our country, for our people. Of course they are. But I think we might be better off if we would essentially continue this effort to cut Government, cut spending, cut programs, cut taxes, and take the responsibility of governing ourselves back to where it should be; back to the cities, the school boards, the counties. Who best understands the problem? I 
trust school boards. I trust teachers. I trust parents. I don't trust bureaucrats. We are rapidly developing into this monolithic centralization of bureaucratic rule. People in the Department of Education and all these areas are good people, family people, but we just, year after year, load more on them. 
I ask this question when I hear a retort from my friends on the other side, or from the President, that Medicare, for example, and all these new programs, will pay for themselves; there will not be an increase in spending; we don't need to find more taxpayers' money: Is there anyone out there who can show me any time we have had a Federal program that has gotten smaller? Do Federal programs and agencies and bureaucracies and departments vanish after a few years? Oh, no, no; they get bigger. And who has to pay for it? My children and your children. And it gets bigger and bigger. Where have we cut Government in the 1990s? We have cut it in one department. What department? Defense. Our national security has been cut over the last 10 years in real dollars by 40 percent. How many other departments and agencies have been cut? None. 
So my point is this. Before we rush into all these new programs and new Government and new federalization, we better sober up for a moment. This is not a time for campaign rhetoric. This is not a time for campaign speeches. This is a time for clear-headed, strong, dynamic, smart, realistic leadership, gutsy leadership. That is what America demands. That is what America will get. 
I say these things not because I am opposed to the President or trying to complicate the President's life. But we, too, have a constitutional responsibility in this body. We have accountability to the people we represent. And this is one U.S. Senator who is going to ask some very tough questions about every one of these new programs. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. HAGEL. 
Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Federal Home Loan Bank System Modernization Act of 1997. I am joined in this effort by my distinguished colleagues Senators Bennett, Grams, and Kerrey. 
This legislation represents months of work in crafting a bill that has bipartisan support. The process has been open, and we have included all the affected parties: The Federal Home Loan Banks themselves, the Federal Housing Finance Board, and the banking industry. This process has allowed us to craft legislation that represents, above all, sound banking policy. 
This bill will help community banks and the consumers who rely on them. Take, for example, the case of Commercial State Bank in Wausa, NE. Commercial has served northeast Nebraska as an agricultural and business lender for more than 70 years. 
Now, with a growing economy in the region, the bank is growing as well. In the small community of 600 people, deposits cannot keep pace with the growing demand for loans--and that means the bank's liquidity is declining. With less liquidity, there just isn't as much money available for lending as the community demands. 
This bill would help banks like Commercial and communities like Wausa. As Doug Johnson, president of Commercial State Bank, wrote to me about this legislation: 
If banks like the Commercial State Bank were able to access the Federal Home Loan Bank, our customers would be better able to be serviced with a consistent and competitive source of funding. Denying credit to qualified borrowers is not productive for Nebraska or the Midwest. Unfortunately, those borrowers may miss the opportunities available to them at this time to improve their economic prosperity. 
Mr. President, that is what this bill is all about--helping small communities to better secure their economic futures. 
The Federal Home Loan Bank system was established in 1932, primarily to provide a source of credit to savings and loan institutions for home lending. Now, a majority of the members in the FHLB system are commercial banks. We should update this system to recognize this change in its membership. 
Not since 1989 has significant Federal Home Loan Bank legislation become law. The system is working well, but I believe Congress can make it better. It's time for Congress to act. 
This legislation has four main components:

Mr. HAGEL. I thank the chairman for his leadership and the leadership of the distinguished ranking minority member, Senator 
Levin. 
Mr. President, it is rather appropriate that we debate this issue today. Next week is Veterans Day. It is the day, a unique day, when America honors the sacrifices and commitments made by our men and women who served in uniform. 
I rise today to speak in support of the fiscal year 1998 defense authorization bill conference report. As we have debated this important bill over the past few months, I couldn't help but wonder whether we would be able to meet our national security challenges in the years ahead with the current state of our readiness of our current military forces. 
Our national defense ensures the survival of our Nation and our interests around the world. Our national defense is not only the protector of the American people, it is the guarantor of our foreign policy. One of the most important national debates we need to have is over what kind of military will be required as the world moves into the next century. Are we making the necessary investments to meet that need and will America be strong enough to back up the international commitments being made today by our President? 
I am very concerned, Mr. President, that we are not making the necessary investments that we will need to make to have the military capability to back up those commitments in 5 to 10 years. While the cold war is over, the world is still very dangerous. It is very uncertain. It requires a skilled, highly mobile military force structure. Rather than one global enemy that we can work to contain, we need to be able to respond to head off crises in hot spots around the world. 
Look at our situation today. We have troops in Bosnia. We have a madman in the Middle East whom we already went to war with once, and again he rattles his saber and threatens the peace. 
We are faced with the continuing menaces, the dilemma in North Korea. We face proliferation, not only of nuclear weapons, but of chemical and biological weapons around the world. What are the issues on the horizon? 
Next year, this body will make a decision on expanding the security blanket of NATO eastward. Difficult decisions still must be made regarding Bosnia. The Caspian Sea has the world's second largest oil reserves, located in the center of a very turbulent area of the world. The Middle East continues to be in turmoil. 
What will the future requirements be for the U.S. military? No one can predict with certainty what those requirements will be. But what has made our military the most powerful in the world and has kept the peace is the preparedness and the ability of the United States to respond to whatever crisis may develop worldwide. 
In a turbulent, unpredictable world, we cannot now risk weakness. As President Ronald Reagan said so clearly--peace through strength. Our dedicated men and women in uniform are up to the task, as they have always been up to the task. 
However, our military has suffered Draconian cuts over the past 10 years. In real dollars--in real dollars, Mr. President--the U.S. military, our national defense, has taken far deeper and more dramatic cuts than any other area of our Federal budget. Over the last 10 years our defense budget has been reduced in real numbers by 40 percent. 
We are deferring--we are deferring--vitally important weapons procurement systems to meet our needs for the future. That is not leadership. 
Today, I fear we could not repeat what we accomplished during the Desert Storm war because of our strength and our readiness, because that has been cut so drastically. Not a comforting thought, Mr. President, with the current situation in Iraq. 
Our Armed Forces have been stretched to the breaking point. While the administration has continually proposed reduced spending in our defense budget, the President continues to deploy more and more overseas forces. At the same time we have been cutting our national defense resources, we have been directing more and larger overseas deployments. This, Mr. President, is very dangerous, with severe long-term consequences for peace and stability worldwide. We are witnessing an unhealthy stress in our military today. 
Since 1989, the Army's missions around the world have increased by 300 percent--while funding for our primary land forces has decreased by 38 percent, and the number of soldiers has declined by 35 percent. In the Air Force we face a similar story. Recent press reports indicate that 107 Air Force pilots who were eligible for promotion this year from captain to major asked not to be considered, they decided to leave active service instead. The senior leadership in the Air Force say they have seen an alarming number of pilots leave the Air Force and are concerned that so many pilots are finding the demands of a military career on their families so stressful that they are choosing to quit. It is not just about money either. Most say they are not concerned about going in harm's way, but they are concerned about their unit's readiness to face the challenges ahead. 
I am pleased to note that this bill does begin to reverse the downward trend in defense spending by increasing the administration's request by $2.6 billion. It is a good start on the road back to restoring our military forces to a complete ability to defend our vital interests around the world--but it is not enough. 
I understand that some of my colleagues believe that this bill is now irrelevant. They say we have passed an appropriations bill already, why do we need an authorization bill? We need this bill to authorize a 2.8-percent pay increase for our men and women in uniform. Who among us wants to look a soldier in the eye, whom the President has just sent to Bosnia and say, `we sent you in harm's way, but you and your family don't merit a pay increase.' How many of us in the Senate are aware, according to the administration's own data, that compensation for our men and women in uniform currently lags 12.9-percent behind the private sector. Without this meager pay increase, our soldiers would fall even further behind civilian wages, at a time when the administration asks them to do more with less on a daily basis. 
The pay raise issue alone should be enough justification to support this bill. However, there is more. By the Defense Department's own estimates 23,000 service men and women are eligible for food stamps. There is no honor for a nation that asks its men and women in uniform to risk their lives to defend it, then asks them to feed their families with food stamps and live in rundown, dilapidated housing. 
Another reason we need this bill enacted into law involves housing for our military personnel. Denying them appropriate and just compensation is clearly one issue. If we, as a nation can't pay our service members enough, surely we can at least provide them with decent, affordable housing. Here again we are failing our troops. As most of my colleagues are aware, military construction projects require both authorization and appropriation to be executed. If the fiscal year 1998 Defense authorization bill is not enacted this year, more than $4 billion in military construction projects cannot be executed during the coming year. 
If we do not provide our men and women in uniform with at least a decent quality of life for them and for their families, how can we expect to recruit and retain the best and the brightest? 
Signals from the White House indicate that the President is considering a veto of this bill. I ask him to reconsider. Chairman Thurmond and the members of his committee have worked tirelessly to reach an accommodation with both sides in the depot closure debate. This divisive issue has consumed enough of our efforts. It is time to move on. We are wasting time and draining precious resources away from our Nation's military readiness. Let's show some leadership and get on with our responsibility. 
In summary, Mr. President, I close with this: National defense should not be a partisan issue. The security of our Nation is not a Democrat or Republican issue. It is an American issue. The debate over our national defense should not be driven by economic decisions. It should not be driven by jobs. We must be steely eyed, clear eyed, clear headed when we make these decisions for our national security. 
Deferring tough decisions and lack of vision and shortsightedness in planning our national defense will have deadly consequences for the future of America and the world. 
I strongly support this bill and strongly encourage my colleagues to support it as well. 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, today the United States is unilaterally disarmed in the intense global competition for new markets. For the first time since 1974, the President lacks fast-track authority to negotiate agreements that would help open up new markets and reduce international barriers to U.S. exports. 
This failure means slower economic growth, lost markets overseas, and fewer opportunities for high-paying jobs. Fast-track authority allows the President to submit to Congress a clean vote on trade agreements negotiated with other countries. 
Under our Constitution, the Congress alone has the power to `lay and collect . . . Duties' and `To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations. . .' 
The Constitution, however, uniquely empowers the President to send and receive ambassadors and negotiate with foreign powers. Over 20 years ago, the fast-track mechanism was created to accommodate this divided authority. Renewal of fast-track authority will enable our Nation to continue pressing for world economic systems based on free markets, free trade and free people. 
As a nation, the continued growth of our economy depends on trade. In the past 50 years, trade share of the world's gross domestic product grew from 7 percent to 21 percent. Today, trade makes up 24 percent of the U.S. economy. 
This decade, export growth has created 23 percent of all new U.S. jobs, and those export-related jobs pay 13 percent more than the national average. 
Clearly, our economy will suffer without the ability to continue to negotiate timely new agreements to further open foreign markets to U.S. goods, commodities and services. 
Those opposed to renewing the President's fast-track authority argue that the lack of such authority does nothing to hinder the President's ability to negotiate new trade agreements. Unfortunately, this is not the case. 
No nation will enter into a major new trade negotiation with the United States if the product of those negotiations can be picked apart in the U.S. Congress. With any agreement that can later be unilaterally changed or amended by the Congress, we run the risk of having no agreement at all. 
As long as the President lacks the ability to present such agreements to the Congress for our clean approval or disapproval--and bad agreements deserve to be defeated--our Nation will be endangering its ability to compete in today's competitive global economy. 
Our Nation should be working aggressively to reach new agreements that will expand free trade and open up the emerging economies of Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe to American exports. We should be building on the major achievements of the last global trade talks. These talks, the Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, for the first time, established rules for services and agriculture goods, two areas where the United States leads the world in global competitiveness. 
Instead, the United States is losing opportunities for economic growth and job creation. It is time to do what is right for American workers, farmers, ranchers, and businesses. It is time to restore fast-track negotiating authority for the President. 
I hope that my colleagues take a good look at this and do support fast-track authority for the President. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join with the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Roth, as an original cosponsor to his legislation to strengthen the President's hand in opening up China's market to American exports. I commend Chairman Roth for his leadership on trade issues. This bill would extend permanent most-favored-nation trading status to China upon that country's accession to membership of the World Trade Organization under commercially viable terms. 
Mr. President, I believe that the annual debate over so-called most-favored-nation trading status for China has become counterproductive. It is time for the United States and China to transcend this flawed process. It is time for trade relations between our two countries to be based on the normal commercial standards that one would expect between two of the world's great trading powers. 
This legislation would greatly strengthen the President's hand in achieving trade negotiations with China. It would do this by giving the President the authority to grant China permanent MFN status upon that country's accession to the WTO under normal commercial arrangements. As long as the Congress merely promises to consider granting permanent MFN status after China has agreed to accept WTO obligations, the President's leverage in trade negotiations with China will be weakened. 
I would like to emphasize that I do not support China's entry into the World Trade Organization under any special arrangement that would allow China to avoid full compliance with WTO standards. However, China's accession to the WTO under normal commercial arrangements would be good for the United States and good for the world trading system. It would require China to adhere to international trading standards. And should China fail to live up to its WTO obligations, we would then have access to the WTO's multilateral dispute resolution mechanisms. As long as China remains outside of the WTO, our only recourse for resolving our trade disputes with China is through the threat of often less effective bilateral actions, such as threats of section 301 trade sanctions. 
But once China becomes a member of the WTO under a viable commercial protocol, the rules of the WTO require other WTO nations to grant permanent MFN to China. If we do not, we lose much of the benefit of getting China to accept WTO rules. This is because the United States would be denied access to the WTO's dispute resolution process for forcing China to live up to its agreements. That is why this bill is so important. 
There are a great number of common misunderstanding over the annual debate on so-called most-favored-nation trading status for China. First of all, the archaic term `most favored nation' is itself misleading. MFN status is not, as many believe, some special trade benefit. It is not even the most favored trading status that we maintain with other countries. The United States grants much more favorable trade status to many other countries, including Canada, Israel, Mexico, the countries of the Caribbean, and a host of other nations--more than 130 in all--that benefit from special trade programs. All MFN status means is that we are willing to maintain some semblance of regular trade relations with that country. This is demonstrated by the fact that only six countries in the world do not have MFN status. 
What is more, under current trade laws, there is no middle ground between full MFN trading status with average tariffs of 4 percent, and the disastrous 1930's-era Smoot-Hawley tariffs that average over 50 percent. Let there be no doubt about the consequences of repealing MFN trading status for China: it would mean a virtual end to United States-China trade relations. 
United States trade with China is important. Throughout the ages, commerce has been a driving force of modernity and the spread of western ideas. Withdrawing from China will not bring the kind of change we are all seeking in that still autocratic system. Isolating China economically would have a disastrous and counterproductive result. 
Nevertheless, there are serious trade issues between the United States and China that need to be resolved. This bill will make their resolution more likely. Nebraska is a major exporting state, with total exports last year of $2.45 billion of which $1.5 billion was food or agricultural products. Nebraska's meat exports to the world, primarily beef, grew 89 percent in the first half of this decade. United States beef exports to China, however, are severely constrained by China's 80 percent tariffs. These levels must come down in the context of the WTO negotiations. China also maintains a wide range of trade restrictions that are illegal under WTO rules. These illegal trade barriers include unscientific health laws that entirely prohibit certain types of U.S. wheat exports. 
Mr. President, aggressive United States efforts to negotiate China's entry into the WTO under normal commercial arrangements is clearly in our national interest. The United States continues to run a large, persistent trade deficit with China. Last year, our deficit reached $39 billion, and it is expected to be higher this year. But the way to reduce that deficit is not by closing off our borders and cutting off export markets, but to work aggressively to open those markets, particularly the China market. 
Export jobs pay 13-16 percent more than average American jobs. Exports are the future of our Nation, and we need to have China's market opened to American goods, services, and agricultural commodities.

Mr. HAGEL. This morning, the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 1:30 p.m. Following morning business, we hope to begin consideration of the pending Federal Reserve Board nominees or the Interior appropriations conference report. 
Also, later in the day, we hope to make progress on amendments to S. 1173, the highway legislation. As Members are aware, a fourth cloture motion was filed to the highway bill on Friday, so there will be a cloture vote on Tuesday at a time yet to be determined. 
In addition, the Senate could be asked to consider Amtrak strike legislation during this week as well. Under the previous order, at 5 p.m. today the Senate will vote on the confirmation of the Marbley of Ohio nomination to be U.S. district judge. Members are reminded that this may not necessarily be the only vote scheduled today. Members will be notified when other votes are scheduled.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, yesterday the President of the United States announced the United States negotiating position on the U.N. global climate treaty. Some have called the President's position a compromise. I would say that is the case only if you define compromise as an action that would have devastating consequences for the United States without any meaningful progress toward the overall goal. 
This is how an editorial in Investors Business Daily defined the President's proposal yesterday morning. This doesn't make any sense. `Signing a treaty that hobbles U.S. growth getting no environmental payoff in return.' Now, here is what does make sense. `Listening to science rather than overheated rhetoric and acting on the basis of real events, not computer models.' 
The President's announcement follows along the same lines of what this administration has been pushing in international circles for years. No matter how he wraps his package, the President is still talking about making the United States, our businesses, our people, subject to legally binding international mandates while letting more than 130 nations off the hook. Most important for this body, the U.S. Senate, is how does the administration's position stack up against the Byrd-Hagel resolution which passed this body in July by a vote of 95 to zero? The Clinton administration's position announced yesterday falls woefully short on all counts. 
The President obviously realizes this since he stated yesterday that America cannot wait for the U.S. Senate on this issue. The President said: 
I want to emphasize that we cannot wait until the treaty is negotiated and ratified to act. 
This flies in the face of the Constitution and the powers it gives to the U.S. Senate to give approval for the ratification of treaties. Why does the President's proposal fall short? Regarding participation by the developing nations, the Byrd-Hagel resolution states very clearly that no treaty will get the support of the U.S. Senate unless, and I read from the Byrd-Hagel resolution, `* * * unless the protocol or agreement also mandates new specific scheduled commitments to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions for developing country parties within the same compliance period.' 
That is very clear. I noted some of my colleagues yesterday, and others, have said what the President proposed yesterday is in full compliance with Byrd-Hagel. I strongly recommend to those colleagues who actually believe that, that they go back and read the Byrd-Hagel resolution. It is only five pages long. It is not legal. It is very clearly understood by everyone. 
What this means also is that support of the U.S. Senate is contingent upon China, Mexico, India, Brazil and the other 130 developing nations committing to specific limitations on greenhouse gas emissions within the same time period as the United States and the other industrialized nations. Anything less, anything less than this, what is clearly defined in the Byrd-Hagel resolution put forward by the U.S. Senate, is not in compliance and it is the U.S. Senate that will have the final say on any treaty signed by the administration in Kyoto, Japan, in December. 
At the same time President Clinton was calling for `meaningful participation'--those were his words--meaningful participation by the developing countries, at the same time he was saying that, this is what his negotiator in Bonn, Germany, Ambassador Mark Hambley, was saying in a prepared release. `In our view,' said Ambassador Hambley, the President's negotiator in Bonn Germany this week--`In our view, this proposal is fully consistent with the Berlin mandate--it imposes no new substantive commitments on developing countries now. Instead, it calls for such obligations 
to be developed following the third conference of the parties' in Kyoto in December. 
I think that is rather clear, what Ambassador Hambley said: That the Third World, the developing nations, would not be called upon for any commitments, any obligations in this treaty. It is obvious that this administration has no intention of ensuring that the developing countries have to meet the same obligations as the United States. 
What about the second condition of the Byrd-Hagel resolution, which stated the Senate would not ratify a treaty that would cause serious economic harm to the United States? Most of the economic impact studies are based exactly on what the President proposed yesterday, in terms of timetables, targets, reducing emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2010, and excluding the developing nations from any binding limitations of greenhouse gases. The President's own analysis shows that this will require a 30-percent cut in projected energy use by the year 2010. 
So, we are going to cut our energy use, between now and the year 2010, by 30 percent; at the same time the administration says we don't have an economic analysis to really understand what economic impact this might have on our economy, on jobs. After a year and a half of the administration promising to me and others in both the House and the Senate that they would come forward with an economic model and economic analysis showing that there would be no harm to our economy, they have now said: Well, economic models don't mean anything. But we are going to surge forward and sign that treaty having no understanding whatsoever of what it might do to our economy, to jobs. 
I have seen studies, I have seen economic models and analyses done by the AFL-CIO, done by independent economists, done by business, done by industry, done by the agriculture industry, farmers, ranchers. The results are not good. Here is what these studies have shown: Job losses in the millions for this country, lower economic growth in this country meaning a lower standard of living and less opportunities for all Americans, energy rationing. What the Clinton administration is talking about is the rationing of energy use in the United States. 
Remember the gas lines the last time this country rationed energy use in the 1970's? I remember them very well. Energy taxes--I know the administration has said we don't think this is going to require any taxes. We are not sure, but we will kind of get going, sign that treaty and bind the United States to these commitments, and allow an international body to enforce and police and administer it. Maybe we will need more taxes, who knows, they say. 
In an October 4 article in the Washington Times an unnamed Clinton administration official said that the President's proposal would raise energy taxes up to five times greater than the Btu tax the Clinton administration proposed back in 1993. That is devastating. That is devastating. Much of the State that I represent, Nebraska, is agricultural. Agriculture is an energy-intensive industry. When you start talking about raising taxes on energy five times greater than what President Clinton proposed in 1993, that will put literally thousands of farmers and ranchers and agricultural interests out of business. What I find incredible about this is at the same time the President is asking for fast-track legislation because we are trying to do something about our deficit of payments, deficit in the balance of payments to China, to Japan, all the other areas of trade we are trying to pursue, what this would do is go the other way, make our products less competitive because they would cost more. Higher prices for all goods because of higher energy costs mean American goods cost more worldwide, making American products and services less competitive in the world market. And when you are allowing China and Mexico and Brazil and India, South Korea, and 130 other nations not to legally bind themselves to this, what do you think happens in the world marketplace? Our products cost more, our services cost more, and these other nations' economies will thrive as their 
products cost less. Does that put us in a stronger competitive position worldwide? I don't think so. 
The real question is, for what? Why are we doing this? Why are we doing this? The nations that would be excluded, the over 130 nations that would be excluded from this treaty are the nations that will be responsible for 60 percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions within the next 20 years. Not the United States, the nations that we are not asking to bind themselves to this treaty. 
China, which has said very forcefully that it will never agree to legally binding emission limits, will be the largest emitter of greenhouse gases by the year 2015. By 2025, China will surpass the United States, Japan and Canada combined, as the greatest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world. Yet we are not asking them to sign up to any legally binding mandate to do something about their greenhouse gas emissions. So how can any treaty that exempts these 134 nations be at all effective in reducing global greenhouse gas emissions? It will not. This is folly. This is feel-good folly. It makes great press, but it is insane that we would bind our Nation to this kind of folly and allow these other nations to go untouched. 
What President Clinton proposed yesterday is for the American people to bear the cost and suffer the pain of a treaty that will not work. That is the legacy, or more appropriately the lunacy he would leave to the children of America. I have always said that this debate is not about who is for or against the environment. That is not the debate. We are all concerned about the environment. We are concerned about the environment we leave to our children and our grandchildren, our future generations. But let's use some common sense here. Let's use some American common sense. 
Mr. President, in its present form, this treaty will not win Senate approval. We can do better. We must do better. Our future generations are counting on us to do better. Let's bring some balance, some perspective and some common sense to this issue and do it right. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. HAGEL. I thank the Chair. 
Madam President, much of the debate this past week about campaign finance reform has missed an important dynamic of the political process. The integrity of any process depends on the 
integrity of the individual. We recapture the trust and confidence of the American people not by passing more laws, more regulation and more Government but by taking responsibility for our own actions and the conduct for our own campaigns--personal responsibility. Will more Government control, more regulation, more law really change our behavior and our conduct? Will more Government control make us more honest and fill us with new-found integrity? I do not think so. 
Systems are corrupt because of the people. Systems are not corrupt because of the system. When we lower our expectation and we lower our standards, as we have in American politics, we lower our self-worth. We lower the system. And when we do not expect much, we do not get much. When we do not expect much from our candidates and our politicians, we will not get much. It all becomes self-fulfilling. 
Now, why do we blame the system and excuse the violators? Where is the outrage over those who subvert the system and deliberately break the rules and the laws already in place? Where is the outrage over individuals who break the law and refuse to take responsibility for their own actions? Where are the voices demanding personal responsibility and personal accountability? Where are those voices? Those voices are now talking about the system. 
We glide over the alleged wrongdoing of individuals, saying, well, it doesn't count, it doesn't matter--like it is beyond our control. We say that it is the system; that is the problem. The system is flawed, not the individual but the system. We say that money is evil, money is the terrible evil in our system. We excuse the alleged wrongdoing and corruption by blaming the so-called vagaries of the campaign finance system and the laws. 
We dance on the pinhead of technicalities. What is allowed? What is not allowed? What is the correct shading of the law? Did the person really break the law? How must we change the rules and regulations so that this never happens again? All we need is more Government. Everybody knows that. If we have more rules, more regulation, more enforcement, more Government, then people will abide by the law. 
Something is greatly amiss when we are debating the technicalities of right and wrong. There are no technicalities between right and wrong. Right is right. Wrong is wrong. There are no shades of right or degrees of wrong. The difference between right and wrong is not subject to a controlling legal authority. It is a matter of honesty. It is a matter of simply just doing the right thing. Is that difficult to grasp? Is that so difficult to this body to grasp? 
We are here today debating whether or not to pass new laws based on the fact that some people broke the law, or at least allegedly broke the law. Those are laws that we already have. Those are regulations and rules on the books now. It is very clear. We already have laws prohibiting foreign contributions. We already have laws prohibiting the solicitation of campaign funds in a Government building. We already have laws that very clearly spell out the difference between so-called hard money and soft money. 
I ask my colleagues one question: How will changing the rules and the laws and the regulations change behavior of those already inclined to break them? It will not. No number of new laws and new regulations will change the basic integrity of the candidate. The integrity of the system depends on the integrity of the candidate. Each candidate must take personal responsibility for his or her own actions in the conduct of their campaigns. We need to focus on individual violations of current law. We need to focus on individual conduct and behavior, individual responsibility and accountability. If each of us in public office conducted our campaigns, every aspect of our campaigns in a manner that our constituents will be proud of, not necessarily always agreeing with our positions but be proud of how we conduct ourselves and our campaigns, then we would not be engaged in this campaign finance reform debate. 
People get involved and participate in a democracy because they believe in things. The idea that more people will participate in our political process if we pass more laws and regulations completely discounts the nature of free people. Politics is about people. Politics is not about Government. Politics is not about rules and regulations. Politics is about people. Politics is about people who believe in things. We will not restore the trust and confidence of the American people in elected officials and the political system by placing further restrictions, by placing further restrictions on the rights of Americans to participate in the political process. 
A former Governor of Deleware and former Member of Congress, Pete DuPont, made a very compelling argument in last week's Wall Street Journal when he wrote that limits in campaigns are akin to price controls in the economy. And he said, `All of these ideas are bad economics, bad politics and, as 40 centuries have proved, very bad public policy.' 
The best way to correct the system is not to replace an old bad set of rules with a new bad set of rules. That is not reform. That is rearranging the restrictions. Too many people 
here in Washington confuse the two. The best thing to do would be to provide the American people complete and immediate disclosure of all contributions--complete and immediate disclosure of every dollar in the system. Hard money, soft money, independent expenditures, every single dollar that goes into the system must be disclosed immediately. 
The press already does a good job of telling the people who is giving money to whom, when the media knows, that is. I have every confidence that if we had full disclosure of every dollar, the press would inform the people as to who is giving and receiving these contributions. They will tell the people who is spending the money for or against candidates. They will let the people know where candidates are getting their campaign contributions. Let the press do the job and report all of these contributions. 
I trust the people. I trust the people of this country to be able to sort it out. If they have the information, if the people of this country have the information, they will make an informed decision. They will determine what is acceptable to them, not because some bureaucrat or Washington regulator tells them what is right or wrong but the people sort it out. Just give the people the information. 
As Governor DuPont wrote, `A well-informed electorate will safeguard American campaigns far better than any appointed group of the best and brightest Washington regulators.' 
Another change we might look at is to again make political contributions tax deductible. We used to do that. We allow people to deduct contributions to charities. We allow union members to deduct their union dues, but if people want to participate in American democracy by giving money, it is not tax deductible. Is not our system of self-government just as important as a charity or a union? 
How will we restore the trust and confidence of the American people in their elected officials? By electing good people to office, by holding those who serve in public office accountable for their actions, and holding them to the highest standards. I consider serving in public office to be an honor and privilege. I know every one of my colleagues feels the same. This is not a right. This is not a right, to be in this body, to hold public office. It is not mine to hold onto by whatever means I can, no matter how questionable those means. It is a privilege bestowed on me by the people of my State. It is a privilege they also have the right to revoke. The people need to be our partners in the political process. We can create all the laws we want, but only the people--not the laws, not the regulators, not the regulations, not the system--but only the people can hold elected officials accountable for their actions. Only the people can, through their votes, determine when someone no longer deserves their trust and confidence. 
I believe that for far too long we have been creating a society less dependent on the voluntary rule of honesty and good behavior of the citizen than on the impressive mandates of Government. Government does not mold human behavior. Behavior comes from within. I cannot support any proposal that seeks to limit the ability of the people and institutions to express themselves and takes the power to shape our public policy debate away from the people and gives it to the Government. I cannot support such legislation. That is what McCain-Feingold would do, in the name of reform. 
What are we really reforming, the right of people to participate in the political process? In a free democracy, taking away people's rights is not reform. In Buckley v. Valeo the Supreme Court ruled the debate about campaign finances is about the fundamental role of the people in our democratic society. The Court wrote:  
In the free society ordained by our Constitution, it is not government but the people--individually as citizens and candidates and collectively as associations and political committees--who must retain control over the quantity and range of debate on public issues in a political campaign. 
Madam President, the system has not failed us. Campaign dollars are not the problem. They may be the excuse--the system, dollars, may be the excuse for some. But our problems are with ourselves. What outrages the American people is the conduct of some politicians--and my good friend, Senator McCain, talked about this earlier this afternoon when he referenced in the poll the `lying windbags,' the lying windbags that many people think of as politicians, and I know that is true. But what really outrages the American people is the conduct of some politicians and their supporters who have corrupted the system by violating the integrity of the process for their own end. 
Our political leaders have, as one of their most sacred responsibilities, the responsibility to set the moral tone in America and give moral leadership. I do not mean religious leadership. I do not mean religious leadership. I mean moral leadership. Moral leadership goes well beyond the rule of law and regulation. Were the great leaders of our Nation great because of laws and regulations dictating their actions and behavior? No. Our great leaders were great because they had a moral compass and they shared that moral compass with our people and our Nation. And they relied upon that moral compass for governance. America deserves leaders who lead through the force of character and integrity, not through the force of regulation and law. Before we reform the campaign finance system, we should first look at how we might reform ourselves. We might look at how we might reform ourselves. 
Madam President, I would like to end my speech this afternoon with a quote from Thomas Jefferson, our third President, one of our Nation's strongest defenders of the rights of the American people. Thomas Jefferson said, many, many years ago: 
I know of no safe depository of the ultimate powers of society but the people themselves; and if we think them not enlightened enough to exercise their control with a wholesome discretion, the remedy is surely not to take it from them, but to inform their discretion by education. 
Madam President, I yield the floor.

Mr. HAGEL. 
Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Small Business Banking Act of 1997. I'm joined in this effort by my distinguished colleague Senator Reed of Rhode Island, who is the principal cosponsor of this important legislation. 
Passage of this bill will remove one of the last vestiges of the obsolete interest rate control system. Abolishing the statutory requirement that prohibits incorporated businesses from owning interest bearing checking accounts will provide America's small business owners, farmers, and farm cooperatives with a funds management tool that is long overdue. 
Passage of this bill will ensure America's entrepreneurs can compete effectively with larger businesses. My experience as a businessman has shown me, firsthand, that it's extemely important for anyone trying to maximize profits to be able to invest funds wisely for maximum efficiencies. 
During President Ronald Reagan's first term, one of his early actions was to abolish many provisions of the antiquated interest rate control system the banking system was required to use. With this change to the laws, Americans were finally able to earn interest on their checking accounts deposited in banks. Unfortunately, one aspect of the old system left untouched by the change in law was not allowing America's businesses to share in the good fortune. 
Complicating matters is the growing impact of nonbanking institutions that offer deposit-like money accounts to individuals and corporations alike. Large brokerage firms have long offered interest on deposit accounts they maintain for their customers. 
While I support business innovation, I don't believe it's fair when any business gains a competitive edge over another due to government interference through overregulation. This is exactly the case we have with banking laws that stifle bankers, especially America's small community bankers, and give an edge to another segment of the financial community. The Small Business Banking Act of 1997 seeks to correct this imbalance and allow community banks to compete fairly with brokerage firms. 
I'm pleased to say our bill has the strong support of America's Community Bankers and the American Farm Bureau Federation. In my home State of Nebraska, this bill has the support of the Nebraska Bankers Association and the Independent Bankers Association. These important organizations represent a crosscurrent of the type of support Senator Reed and I have for our bill. Senator Reed and I also have the support of the Federal regulators. In their 1996 Joint Report, `Streamlining of Regulatory Requirements', the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Office of Thrift Supervision, stated they believe the statutory prohibition against payment of interest on business checking accounts no longer serves a public purpose. I heartily agree. 
Mr. President, this is a straightforward bill that will do away with an unnecessary regulation that burdens American business. I urge my colleagues to support it.

Mr. HAGEL. On just as important business, Mr. President, I will address this morning the issue of global warming. 
Let me first say that the more attention the media and the American people pay to this issue, the better. For the global climate issue will have a major impact on the future of our 
country, our people, and, indeed, the entire world. How the nations of the world address the global climate issue will be one of the most important global economic and environmental decisions of the next century. 
There are differing opinions on the conclusiveness of global warming and how we should address it. But this is not a debate nor has it ever been a debate about who is for or against the environment. I have yet to meet any American who wants dirty air, dirty water, dirty environment or declining standards of living for their children or grandchildren. We all agree on the need for a clean environment. We all want to leave our children a better, cleaner, more prosperous world. So the debate is not about those for or against a clean environment. 
As my colleagues, the media and many people in America know, the nations of the world are currently negotiating a treaty to limit worldwide emissions of greenhouse gasses. This treaty will be presented for signatures this December in Kyoto, Japan. Many of my colleagues and I fear the current treaty negotiations will shackle the United States' economy--meaning fewer jobs, lower economic growth and a lower standard of living for our children and our future generations. This treaty would do so without any meaningful reduction in greenhouse gasses because--because--it leaves out the very nations who will be the world's largest emitters of greenhouse gasses, the more than 130 developing nations including China, India, Mexico, South Korea, and many others.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, the fact is this treaty is not based on sound science. The scientific community has not definitively--even close to definitively--concluded that there is global warming caused by human actions. The science is inconclusive and often contradictory. Predictions for the future range from no significant problem to global catastrophe. The testimony of some of our most eminent scientists and climatologists have made this abundantly clear. The global climate is incredibly complex. It is influenced by far more factors than originally thought. The scientific community has simply not yet resolved the question of whether we have a problem with global warming. But the lack of conclusive scientific data is only one of five reasons why the U.N. Global Climate Treaty is such a very, very bad idea. 
The other four reasons are these: 
The treaty excludes the over 130 developing nations, including the world's biggest emitters of greenhouse gases over the next 15 years. The treaty excludes these people, rendering the treaty's objectives meaningless. It would not accomplish--even if you accepted the science--what it intends to accomplish. 
The economic impact would be devastating for the United States. We would see the loss of millions of jobs, entire industries would flee to other countries, our people would face higher fuel costs, higher taxes, leading to lower productivity and a lower standard of living. It is not because I say this. Why, Mr. President, do we have an almost unparalleled development where American business, American industry, American agriculture, and America's labor unions are all united against this? There must be a reason. There is a good reason. The testimony is very clear on this. 
This also cuts to the heart of our national sovereignty. We don't hear much about our national sovereignty. Is that important to me? Yes, it is. I think it is important to every American. It cuts to the heart of our national sovereignty by setting up an international authority that would subject U.S. businesses and industries to its authority and penalties. Never before in the history of this free Nation has that occurred. This is one U.S. Senator that will not allow it to occur. 
And it would have a devastating impact on our national security interests. There is not much talk about that either. One of the biggest users of fossil fuels in America is what? The U.S. military. So are we really talking about subjecting our national security and our national defense to unknown environmental quests? I don't think that is smart. I don't think the American people want this body of policymakers to do that. 
Even if the scientists could agree--and they don't--this global climate treaty would do nothing to provide a long-term solution because of the first factor here, excluding the world's largest emitters of greenhouse gases over the next 15 years. They don't have to sign up to any mandatory requirements--mandatory by the force of law, incidentally--that the United States and other developing nations would subject themselves to. Over 130 other nations would not have to do that. 
This makes no sense, given that these nations include some of the most rapidly developing economies in the world. What would that do to our competition? How would we be able to compete? By the year 2015, China alone will be the world's largest producer of greenhouse gases. They are held harmless in this treaty. Mr. President, let the record show that in all the negotiating sessions leading up to the Kyoto treaty signing, China has made it very clear that it will never agree to binding limits on its emissions of greenhouse gases. 
It is the United States and other developed nations who are already doing the most to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The United States is far beyond most countries here, and we continue to be. So how could any treaty aimed at reducing global emissions of greenhouse gases be at all effective when it excludes these other nations. The exclusion of these nations is a fatal flaw. 
It should be pointed out that these treaty negotiations are being chaired by--and this is a particularly interesting point--a diplomat from one of the developing nations. So we have an individual who is chairing these negotiations, whose country will not be required to adhere to the treaty. Yet, he is directing the United States and other developed nations to abide by mandatory treaties obligations. In fact, four of the five U.N. working groups charged with drafting the language of this treaty are chaired by diplomats from developing countries who would not be included in this treaty. All would be exempt from any binding commitments. That doesn't make sense to me, Mr. President. 
Third, this global climate treaty would cause a significant slowdown in the U.S. economy. One of the notable aspects of this issue in the United States is that it has united all the different groups that I mentioned. We have heard testimony from the AFL-CIO, the American Farm Bureau, National Association of Manufacturers, noted economists, and dozens of other organizations that represent the rank and file, the working American men and women in this country. They have all agreed on one thing: This treaty would have a devastating affect on America. I could go on and cite economic models, economic analyses, as to what degree. Would we lose 3 percent, as some forecasts have said, from our annual growth? Would we lose 1.5 or 2 million jobs if this treaty goes into effect? 
The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that the President's own economic advisers are very concerned. The President's own economic advisers are very concerned about the impact this treaty would have on the U.S. economy. It was a large back-page story in yesterday's Wall Street Journal. According to the article, some are concerned that `ambitious targets for reducing carbon emissions * * * could trigger economic upheaval greater than the 1970's oil shocks.' Does anybody remember that? I do. 
Lawrence Summers, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury stated, `What we have to do, what we are all working to do, is find the best way to meet environmental objectives along with meeting strong economic growth.' 
These are not the rantings and ravings of big business, or the energy industries, or some bizarre group of people--these are the concerns of the President's own economic advisers. 
I have not spoken with any American who would choose to relive the high energy prices and gas lines of the 1970's--all for a treaty which excludes so many nations that it wouldn't work anyway. 
The Argonne National Labs study, commissioned by the U.S. Department of Energy, concluded that constraints on six large industries in the United States--pertroleum refining, chemicals, paper products, iron and steel, aluminum, and cement--would result in significant adverse impacts on the affected industries. They furthermore concluded that emissions would not be significantly reduced. The main effect of the assumed policy would be to redistribute output, employment, and emissions from participating to nonparticipating countries. 
The fourth troubling aspect of this treaty is one which has received very little discussion, but would have long-range and far-reaching consequences. This treaty has the potential of bringing under direct international control virtually every aspect of our Nation's economy. The power of legally binding emissions mandates in this proposed treaty would control nearly all forms of a country's energy use. This kind of international authority cuts to the very heart of a nation's sovereignty. Do we want U.S. companies answering to an international authority on how much and what kinds of fuel they can use at what cost? Do we ant an international body dictating energy prices in America and enforcing these mandates? I don't think so. 
The fifth problem with this treaty is another which has received little discussion. America's military is one of our Nation's largest users of fossil fuels. How would legally binding controls on the emission of greenhouse gases affect our military capabilities, military readiness, flying our planes, driving our tanks, our ships? 
This treaty could have a serious impact on the readiness of our Armed Forces, and our ability to defend our national security interests around the world. Sherri Goodman, the Defense Department Undersecretary for Environmental Security has said that the U.N. Global Climate Treaty could have large impacts on our military. Two weeks ago Senator Inhofe and I wrote a letter to Secretary of Defense Cohen asking him for an answer to press reports that the administration was planning to adopt draconian new restrictions on U.S. Government use of fossil fuels and asking for any studies the Defense Department had done to assess the impact of forced reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. 
Why are we rushing headlong into signing a treaty in Kyoto this December? The scientific data is inconclusive, at times even contradictory. The treaty excludes the nations who will be the world's largest emitters of greenhouse gases. The economic costs would be devastating. This treaty would be a lead weight on America's economic growth, killing jobs and opportunities for future generations. It would cause U.S. companies to have to answer to an international authority. And this treaty could have dramatic consequences for America's national security interests. 
An additional threat to the United States on this issue is coming from the Clinton administration. According to press reports, President Clinton is being pressured by environmental organizations to sign the kind of draconian treaty that would have all of the consequences I've just described. Some administration officials have recommended that the President sign a treaty in Kyoto and then withhold it from the Senate for ratification. In the words of one participant in that meeting, `anything that could get through the Senate next year is probably not worth doing.' Last month, Majority Leader Trent Lott and I sent a letter to President Clinton warning him that it `would be a grave error to go forward with this kind of strategy and treaty, with the explicit intention of withholding such a treaty from the Senate for domestic political considerations.' 
Undersecretary of State Tim Wirth testified before my Foreign Relations Subcommittee on June 19, and I specifically asked him for assurances that the administration would submit any agreement reached in Kyoto to the Senate in the form of a treaty. Undersecretary Wirth testified that `it will either be a protocol to a treaty or an amendment to a treaty * * * (that) will have to come back up in front of the United States Senate.' 
I expect President Clinton and the administration to honor the commitment stated publicly by Undersecretary Wirth. 
Well, Mr. President, we could go on. It is very clear that we have a real concern, a real problem. Many of us in this body are taking a rather active role in addressing this issue. I would like to end, Mr. President, with this quote. This is a quote from a recent newspaper article from Bryan Tucker of Australia, the past president of the International Association of Meteorology and Atmospheric Science, who makes one of the best arguments for why this track to Kyoto is entirely off base. He writes,  
The impossibility of attaining the 1992 Rio targets was not acknowledged at Berlin, let alone the lunacy of setting still more stringent ones . . . The real trade offs were not mentioned, and many new strains of hypocrisy were in evidence . . . Environmental opportunists, grasping at any information no matter how selective or exaggerated to foment alarm, appeared completely oblivious to the downstream effects of their extravagant demands. 
This says it straight. This says it directly. 
I know that in this body the American people will hear more about this issue, as they should, and I am grateful for an opportunity this morning to talk a little bit about a very, very important issue. I yield the floor.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Department of Commerce Dismantling Act as an original cosponsor. This legislation continues the battle to do away with unneeded government and wasteful spending. Over a 3-year period the Department of Commerce would be dismantled. Certain programs would be transferred or consolidated into agencies or departments that are better suited to handle them. Other programs and agencies would be terminated altogether. Unnecessary agencies and several tiers of bureaucracy would be eliminated. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the abolishment of the Department of Commerce would save taxpayers more than $2 billion over 4 years. I commend Senator Brownback for his leadership in crafting this legislation to abolish the Department of Commerce. 
Today the Department of Commerce is a 31,000 person department costing American taxpayers $4 billion annually. Sixty of these employees have the rank of deputy assistant secretary or higher and have annual salaries of at least $96,000 each. 
During my campaign, I ran on the ideals of less government, lower taxes, fewer Federal regulations and more personal responsibility. To obtain such goals, I called for the abolishment of four Federal departments including the Departments of Commerce, and Energy. Earlier this year I signed on as an original cosponsor to legislation to abolish the Department of Energy, sponsored by Senator Rod Grams. 
The Department of Commerce, as we know it today, was created in 1913 during the Woodrow Wilson administration to help promote American businesses around the world. Today, only 5 percent of the Department's nearly $4 billion budget is dedicated to trade promotion. By comparison $2 billion is spent annually out of the Department's budget on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Additionally, there are 19 other Federal agencies that hold some jurisdiction over trade. Trade is now a small part of the Department of Commerce. 
America's future lies in trade, but the Department of Commerce's bureaucracy is a relic of the past. This legislation attempts to correct that by consolidating trade functions under a single agency, the United States Trade Administration, and eliminating the waste, bureaucracy, and duplication we have today in the Department of Commerce. 
The time has come to abolish the Department of Commerce. We cannot continue to waste tax payers' dollars on outdated inefficient, and redundant programs. Taxpayers deserve better.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I rise to support the Coverdell bill, of which I am a cosponsor. 
Mr. President, we have been debating several pieces of legislation on education here in this body over the last few weeks. It is important to clearly understand how all of this legislation fits together and why. This is about restoring the fundamental 
belief that education policy and curriculum belong at the local level; they are best determined by those closest to the students, who care most about the students, and who have the most to win or lose--the parents, the teachers, the local school boards, not Washington. As well-intentioned, as well-motivated, as the Department of Education is, as are the President and the Congress, who all care about education, it is those at the local level who understand it best. 
The Gorton amendment, which has been referred to by my friend and colleague from Alaska, was passed last week during the debate on the Labor-HHS appropriations bill. This amendment block grants funds from several K-12 education programs in the Department of Education. It sends that money back to the States, back directly to school boards. 
The Coverdell bill, another piece of the fundamental education philosophy debate in this body, is the Parent and Student Savings Account Plus Act. This legislation, as has been referred to many times this morning, allows parents to make up to a $2,000 per year contribution in after-tax dollars to an education IRA, or you could refer to it as an expanded education savings account for primary and secondary education. Parents would be free to choose how this money and where this money would be used on behalf of their own children's education. 
The Coverdell bill helps families, especially lower-income families, exercise the same rights as wealthy people when it comes to deciding where their children go to school. 
Mr. President, I always start with this premise: Whose money is this? Whose money are we talking about? It is not my money. It is not the President's money. It is not the money of the Secretary of Education. It is the parents' money, the taxpayers' money. My goodness, should they not be empowered with some responsibility, since it is their money, as to how they use that, where they focus to help educate their children? I think so. 
Our education problems begin not at the college or postsecondary level. Somehow we glide over that. Our problems in education begin at the beginning, at the elementary and secondary levels. This is where we must capture these young people. This is where they learn to read and write and discipline themselves and develop logic and work through problems--at the beginning. Not in college; it is too late. This is where we should focus. This is where the choice should be. This is where students and parents desperately need a choice in education. 
We will probably soon have the opportunity to vote on a third education reform measure in this body, that being the District of Columbia Student Opportunity Scholarship Act, another fit, Mr. President, in the overall education debate, the overall education philosophy. 
It is no great secret that the District of Columbia school system is deeply troubled. It is not the parents' fault. It is not the students' fault. But this bill that we will debate would create a tuition scholarship fund that would allow 2,000 low-income students in the District to attend public schools, private schools, or parochial schools, but schools of their parents' choice. It would also provide direct aid to an additional 2,000 public school students who want to improve their academic skills through afterschool tutoring. 
As Alveda King recently wrote, `Is it moral to tax families, compel their children's attendance at schools and then give them no choice between teaching methods, religious or secular education, and other matters?' I do not think it is. `Is it consistent to proclaim, meanwhile, that America is a Nation that prides itself on competition, consumer choice, freedom of religion, and parental responsibility,' yet, in fact, we don't give our parents a choice where they send their children to school? 
The Gorton amendment, the Coverdell bill and the DC Student Opportunity Scholarship Act are not an attempt to destroy public 
schools. My goodness. And that is an important point, Mr. President. I hear my colleagues on the other side of this debate saying, `Oh, you will destroy public schools. You will take funds from public schools.' Nonsense. This Nation is a rich, great Nation because we have always had diversity. From the first days of the people who settled this Nation, it has been about diversity. People from all over the globe have made America great and continue to make America great. It is about diversity. It is about choice. It is about competition. 
Americans should want their public schools to be the very best, to be the absolute best school systems that they can make, they can provide, they can develop. I have a daughter in a public school system in Virginia. It is a good school system. I am not standing in this Chamber today to do anything that would deteriorate, take away or harm the public school systems. But we must enable all people to choose the best education for their children, whatever their circumstances are in life. And we must restore the fundamental belief that education policy and curriculum are best determined by those closest to the students--parents, teachers, school boards--not Washington. 
Mr. President, I strongly encourage my colleagues to support the Coverdell bill, and I yield my time. I thank the Chair.

Mr. HAGEL. Madam President, I take the floor this afternoon to talk about an issue that we have debated in this body all week, an issue that is as important to our Nation as these young pages who sit among us today and the future of this country, as any issue that we debate. 
The issue of education is the foundation of the future of our country. At a time when our schoolchildren--over 50 million--across America are returning to school, including my 6-year-old daughter, Allyn, who started first grade last week at Great Falls, VA, elementary school, it is appropriate that we talk about education not just in terms of amendments to the appropriations bill, but we talk about education in a way that is relevant to our young people and to our future. We will continue to debate education, as we should, because not only does every home in America show, as it has shown over the years, that education is the No. 1 issue on the minds of our citizens--and well it should be--but because we spend billions of dollars on education, K through 12 and beyond. 
This morning's Washington Times had two very interesting articles, one talking about the American Federation of Teachers and President Sandra Feldman discussing why our young people are not being educated. 
If I might, Madam President, allow me to read the first paragraph of a story that appeared in the Washington Times this morning. 
The practice of promoting students to the next grade before they are ready is `rampant across the country,' according to American Federation of Teachers President Sandra Feldman.

Mr. HAGEL. Madam President, as we pick up newspapers daily across this country we don't talk of great success stories for the most part about our American education system. We talk about failures. That will be a self-fulfilling prophecy if we allow our newspapers to be consumed with what is wrong with our public educational system without focusing on not only what is right, because there are many things right with our system, but how we fix them. How do we make American education better? It is easy to criticize. But how do we make it better? It is not just money. We know that. Quite honestly, it is more important than money. There is not a parent in this country who doesn't understand that. 
We need to look beyond the technicalities and the small details of the Gorton amendment, or any other amendment to the appropriations bill. We need, and we will continue, to debate a much bigger question that gets to our Nation's philosophy, our basic philosophy on education. 
Who should control what our children learn and what our teachers teach? The Federal Government? I don't think so. No, I don't think so. That is not the role of the Federal Government. Our Founding Fathers gave us the answer very clearly. We need to look no further than article I and amendment 10 of the U.S. Constitution, which reserve the authority for education to the States, to the people--not to the Federal Government. 
Education should be between parents, teachers, and local school boards--not the Department of Education, not the President, not the Congress, but the school boards, the teachers, the parents. 
I am one Senator who wants to stop the flow of taxpayers' money, parents' money, coming to Washington, and it resides here, and all the smart people in Washington sort out for all the children of America--more than 50 million--what they should know and what teachers should teach. I want to stop that. 
One, among many, reasons why I support the Gorton amendment is that I want to give the money back to the States, back to the people, back to the local school boards and the teachers. They can better spend it. They can reward teachers. They can improve our schools. They can help our students. Who understands it better than the people who are there? I trust the people. I trust our teachers. I trust our school boards. I don't trust Government. I don't trust Government to educate our young people. Who cares most about making sure that children get a good education? Who cares most? Well, of course, the parents care most, and the teachers care most. 
All parents--all parents--should have the opportunity to choose where their children go to school. It shouldn't be just for rich people. The parents pay the bills. We seem to forget that dynamic in Washington. The taxpayers, the parents of the children, pay the bill for education; for everything. Why then do we take the opportunity away from the people who pay the bill from applying their money where they think their children can get the best education? That makes sense to me. 
Another reason is that I support efforts by my colleague from Georgia, Senator Paul Coverdell, to allow parents to use money they have saved in educational savings accounts for K through 12 education. What in the world is wrong with that? Not only does logic dictate that that makes sense, but it seems to me that it is fundamental to America. Education standards should be set locally, not imposed by the Federal Government. 
We need to motivate our children to learn. We need to motivate our children to learn, not just take tests. There has been some debate lately on national testing and school standards. We are confusing the issue here by shifting the emphasis from learning to testing. We have it backward. The emphasis should not be on testing; it should be on learning. The motivation should be learning and not testing. If we institute national testing, our teachers will teach to the test. Of course, they will. Who wants to be a teacher in a school with a low standard on national testing? So if you figure out what the test is and what the testing process is and what the questions are, then you teach to the test. That is wrong. That doesn't prepare our young people. 
It is time that we stop making our teachers jump through the hoops that they have been jumping through with these senseless and burdensome paperwork responsibilities and free them up to do what they can do better than anybody, and that is teach our children. Let's help our teachers teach our children. It is a novel idea. Anyone who has talked to teachers in any State, in any town, or in any community has heard all the horror stories of amounts of time they spend on wasteful, unproductive paperwork. That is time that could be spent teaching our children. We need to prepare our children to compete in a global economy in the 21st century. Just preparing them to pass a test will do nothing to ensure they have the knowledge and the skills, the abilities, to compete in a very competitive new century. 
For example, if we let students off the hook in math by letting them use calculators for the most basic of problems, they will never learn, they will never grasp the logic and discipline gained through exercising good mathematics skills. 
There is nothing wrong with calculators, but let us start with the basics first. Everybody knows why we have trigonometry and geometry and the advanced mathematical courses. Very few will ever use that in their professions, but it is about discipline. It is about learning. It is about pain in your mind and using your brain. Any fool can pick up a calculator. That is not what education is about. That kind of thinking, that kind of training will be vital, if we do it right, throughout the lives of our young people for what they will need to succeed in a very competitive global economy. 
Where I am from in Nebraska, we call that thinking. We call that thinking. If our young people cannot read and write, they do not know much about science and math and have limited knowledge of history, economics, and geography, what chance do they have to succeed in the next century? Very little. 
Preparing our children for the next century is not the job of the Federal Government. My goodness, we have not been able to balance our budget for over 30 years. That is not our job. It is the job of parents and teachers and local school boards working together to ensure that all of our children have the very best education possible and ensuring that all of our children have an opportunity to attend the school of their choice. 
That is what this is about. Our Founding Fathers knew very clearly what they were doing when they determined that education should be a local issue. 
It is time we get back to the fundamental principles and basics that made this a great nation. We are a great nation today not because of our Government, not because of our systems, but because of our people. Our people have, through their wisdom, through their common sense, through their hard work, their discipline, made the right choices for over 200 years. And basic to all those choices has been how you educate your children. There will be much debate, as there should be, in this Chamber over the next few days, weeks, months, and years on our philosophy about education, but let us not forget where it all resides. It resides at the local level with the parents, with the teachers, with the schools. 
I wish to go on record supporting the Gorton amendment. I wish to also go on record supporting the Coverdell bill and the philosophy of local control for education. 
I thank the Chair and I yield the floor. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in praising a man who has contributed more to the morale and well being of American fighting men and women than anyone else in the 20th century. In every conflict where our forces have gone to uphold freedom or to deter aggression Bob Hope has traveled with them. As president of the USO, I worked closely with Bob Hope on many trips to visit our troops around the world. As a combat veteran of the war in Vietnam, I know personally how much he improved the lives of young Americans in Southeast Asia. The places where he entertained the troops were often dangerous areas where the enemy had the opportunity to attack. Bob Hope went there anyway, because he knew what he was doing was important to those ordinary soldiers. He may have been in danger, but our military personnel were in even greater danger. Invariably Bob Hope made the trip to these far off places during the holiday season when he could have been at home with his family, but he knew the feeling of isolation and loneliness that all soldiers feel when they are far away from their families around the holiday season. 
Bob Hope has received numerous awards in his life, including the Medal of Freedom, and the Distinguished Service Medal, but I can think of no finer, no more appropriate award than that of veteran. Certainly if anyone in America can be said to have served, and served with distinction, it is Bob Hope.

Mr. HAGEL. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, I would like to take a couple of minutes to give some perspective about what this body has been doing the last few months, culminating in a vote shortly today or tomorrow on the Tax Relief Act, and what we have just done this morning in the balanced budget amendment. 
Four years ago almost exactly, the Congress of the United States passed the largest tax increase in the history of America. I bring that point to the front because, Mr. President, the agenda has changed. The issues have changed. We are now talking about cutting spending, cutting taxes, balancing the budget, and actually stepping up to the short-term and long-term challenges in our entitlement programs. I might add as well that this is a bipartisan effort. The vote that we just held this morning on the balanced budget amendment was 85 to 15 with strong bipartisan support--Democrats and Republicans working together. 
As we approach a new century--a hopeful, dynamic, energetic, new century full of great promise for our next generation--it is very appropriate that we take in this body the responsibility to focus on fiscal change and infrastructure change to prepare us as we go into this next century. We cannot hope to compete in a global economy when we overtax, overspend, and overregulate. I believe that all of us in this body have come to that conclusion. 
The House overwhelmingly last night passed the balanced budget amendment. They, too, will vote on the tax act, as we will shortly. But sometimes in the rush of the activity and the heat of the moment and the passion of the politics, we tend to forget what has been accomplished here. This has been a remarkable accomplishment. Imperfect? Of course. Tax cuts--not deep enough. Spending cuts--not deep enough. This body is on record in going further on dealing with some of the tough, tough issues that we are going to have to deal with in Medicare and entitlements. But what is important is that we have made a beginning--a very strong, substantive beginning. It is due to the efforts of both sides of the aisle and all in this body who have helped to make this happen. 
I listened to my colleagues this morning walk through some of the specifics of the tax bill. I think they are worthy of what we have done because, as you frame it up and understand it, what we have done is, for the first time in 16 years, we are about to bring real tax relief to Americans. By our vote this morning we have started to begin to harness the energy and the resources that we have in this country with showing some fiscal responsibility--balance the budget and, again, in a bipartisan way. Those are elements that should not be forgotten or dismissed easily when both sides of this debate talk about what we have done and what we have not done. 
So I, Mr. President, appreciate the opportunity to bring some general perspective to this, because occasionally we don't step back enough and understand what really has happened here and how this will strengthen this country and the opportunities for our young people as we go into the next century. 
Again, imperfect, more to do, strong beginning. And I, for one, Mr. President, as a new Senator to this body, am proud to have voted for the balanced budget amendment this morning, and I intend to vote for the Tax Relief Act when it comes to this floor. 
I appreciate the time which my distinguished colleague from North Dakota and the chairman of the Finance Committee have given me. 
I yield the floor.

But they also intended for the Senate's voice to carry weight in negotiations. This morning, the Senate is fulfilling its constitutional responsibility to give its advice to treaty negotiations.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, we have more than a dozen Senators on this side who want to speak on this issue. Under the time agreement, however, we have only 1 hour for proponents to debate. I, therefore, encourage Senators to insert their statements in the Record so they will be fully available to our negotiators before next week's meeting of the ad hoc group on the Berlin mandate in Bonn, Germany. I also hope to discuss this issue further on the Senate floor at a later date. 
Mr. President, I thank the majority leader and the minority leader for their leadership in bringing this resolution before the Senate. I also thank the chairman and the ranking minority member of the Foreign Relations Committee for their leadership as well. I particularly thank the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia. It has been a privilege for me to work on this important issue along side one of the Senate's giants. 
We are here today to debate a very important issue, one which will have a major impact on the future of this country. How our Nation addresses the global climate issue may prove to be one of the most important economic and environmental decisions of the next century. 
Let me say from the outset, this is not a debate about who is for or against the environment. We all agree on the need for a clean environment. We all want to leave our children a better, cleaner, more prosperous world. Nor is this debate about motives, personalities or politics. It is about finding the truth. What are the problems? If there are problems, what is the best solution? What are the costs? What are the consequences? And what do we need to do now? 
The debate on the Senate floor today is about the path the administration is taking on this issue. I believe they are on the wrong path in their negotiations for any treaty to be signed in Kyoto, Japan, this December. 
That is why my distinguished colleague from West Virginia and I have offered the Byrd-Hagel resolution. Senate Resolution 98, with its 65 cosponsors, puts the administration on notice that an overwhelming and bipartisan majority of the U.S. Senate rejects its current negotiating position on a proposed new global climate treaty. It is so important, as my friend, Senator Byrd, has repeatedly pointed out, that we in the U.S. Senate forcefully practice our constitutional role of advice and consent over these important negotiations. The credibility of the United States is not enhanced when the administration negotiates a treaty that has no hope of ratification in the U.S. Senate. 
The Byrd-Hagel resolution is a strong bipartisan wake-up call to the administration. This resolution rejects the United Nations' current negotiating strategy of binding United States and other developed nations to legally binding reductions without requiring any new or binding commitments from 130 developing nations, such as China, Mexico, and South Korea. In addition, this resolution rejects any treaty or other agreement that would cause serious economic harm to the United States. 
A simple reality of the current situation is that a core group of negotiators in the State Department has brought us near a point of no return. What this broad bipartisan coalition of 65 Senators is saying is `we need a new direction in these negotiations.' 
I approach this issue, Mr. President, believing that any action this serious that is undertaken by the United States must be based on sound science and common sense. This proposed treaty is based on neither. 
If anything has become clear during congressional hearings on this issue, it is that the science is unclear, that the scientific community has not even come close to definitively concluding that we have a problem.

First, let's be very clear. This is all interesting, but it does not at all have anything to do with the Byrd-Hagel resolution. That is No. 1. Two, I am saying--and I think much of what we are talking about on the resolution that legally binding commitments are pretty tough, and we want to understand about those legally binding commitments before anybody gets legally bound, regarding if we are talking about a European bubble, or whatever.

Furthermore, any kind of implied United Nations bureaucracy with the power to come in and inspect and penalize and fine and shut down American companies, which obviously is the legitimate logical conclusion of this, I want to be on record right now in saying I oppose that. Obviously, Senator Byrd can speak for himself.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Veterans Employment Opportunities Act of 1997, along with my good friend and distinguished colleague, Senator Max Cleland. We are joined by Senators Hutchinson of Arkansas, Helms, Dorgan, Roth, Faircloth, Burns, Landrieu, Moynihan, Reid of Nevada, and Campbell. This important piece of legislation is needed to help America's most deserving and self-sacrificing citizens, our veterans, to get and hold jobs with the Federal Government. 
In 1944, the Congress enacted the first veterans employment preference legislation. That law was intended to assist service men and women returning from the battlefields of World War II in getting Federal Government jobs. Through the years many changes have taken place in the way we manage civil service personnel within our Government, and most recently there has been considerable focus on downsizing the Federal bureaucracy. One thing has not changed however, and that is that our veterans need to find employment when they return to civilian life. 
This bill addresses the critical need to revise and make more `user friendly' those laws that help veterans to get Federal jobs, and to hold on to them as the Government downsizes. I want to emphasize that this bill does not guarantee anyone a job, but it does allow the sacrifices made by those who served in uniform to have their service recognized as they are considered along with others for Federal jobs. 
The statistical evidence of need for this legislation tells a troubling story. When Federal job openings occur, the hiring official is sent a job referral list that includes the names of qualified applicants from which the job can be filled. The General Accounting Office [GAO] found that 71 percent of job referral lists were returned without hiring when a veteran headed the list. By contrast, 51 percent of nonveteran lists are returned. Not only are veterans not getting the preference that the statutes require, but too often, veterans are less likely than other applicants to be hired for a Federal job. 
This bill will also end unfair designer RIFs that single out veterans for removal from the Federal work force during reductions in force. Perhaps more important, this bill makes a violation of this law a prohibited personnel practice, putting teeth in the law where none now exist. 
I am proud to say that 19 military, veterans, and patriotic associations have indicated that such legislation is needed and that they strongly support this legislation. 
Those who have made very special contributions to America and our way of life, ensuring freedom and individual liberties to all Americans, deserve recognition and fairness when applying for employment in Federal Government. Our veterans do not ask for special privileges. Fifty years ago this Nation made the decision to recognize the sacrifices and extra commitment made by our veterans for America. This legislation ensures that special recognition will be provided. 
I am very proud to join my friend and colleague, the distinguished Senator from Georgia, Senator Max Cleland, who himself has made tremendous contributions to this country.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise to reflect a little on what my friend and neighbor--literally my neighbor--from Colorado has talked about here in the last few minutes regarding OPIC. First, I rise to oppose my friend, the distinguished Senator from Colorado, regarding his amendment. I will explain why. 
Before I came to this body, I was a businessman, a small businessman. Over the last 15 years, my partners and I founded a number of companies. A number of those companies were international companies. I have dealt with OPIC directly. I understand a little bit about, I think, the real world, how jobs are created, how you must market in the international community, what kind of competition is out there against a little company like mine that has to go toe to toe with foreign competitors all over the globe. 
One of the things I learned very quickly was when you go toe to toe with international competitors, whether it is telecommunications--which I know a little something about--or any other industry, the support that comes with your competitor, from his government, his country, is rather significant. I think that is important in this debate. As my friend, Senator Allard, said, we will have an opportunity to truly debate this issue over the next few months. But I would like to make a couple of points that I think are very relevant to OPIC, what OPIC does, what it represents. Again, I come at this, not as a U.S. Senator; I come at this as someone who understands a little bit about how this works and who has been out in the real world in over 60 countries and done business in about 20 of them. 
First, I am concerned that an amendment like that of my friend, to slash administrative expenses, could lead to the very point that he is concerned with. It is a good point. If you slash administrative expenses for OPIC, the likelihood is the quality of the portfolio of OPIC, the quality of investments that OPIC has made and will continue to make, will suffer. I think it would cut directly to eliminating the ability to monitor those loan portfolios. I do not think that is in the best interests of the American taxpayer or anyone associated with OPIC. It endangers the creditworthiness of OPIC if you slash their administrative budget. 
Let me hit just a few very specific points as to what OPIC does. There is an awful lot of sound and fury and smoke and mirrors when it comes to OPIC. First, OPIC, in fact, does level the playing field in global competition. I spoke to that earlier. All of America's major trade competitors have OPIC-like agencies to help them. It covers the gaps in the markets all over this world. 
OPIC creates American jobs. I have a document here--I am sure Senator Allard has seen it--of the kind of jobs created in Colorado, his home State, and in my home State of Nebraska; the kind of revenues that flow into Colorado because of countries that buy from companies that have either OPIC insurance that they pay for, or OPIC loans that they pay for. This is a job creator. This is a growth creator. To give some of the specific numbers on this, since 1971 OPIC has supported $108 billion worth of U.S. projects resulting in over 250,000 new American jobs and $53 billion in new American exports. OPIC is prohibited under law from supporting any project that would result in the loss of one single American job. 
Two, OPIC does not cost the taxpayers money. In fact, every year OPIC returns to the U.S. Treasury--last year $209 million. OPIC requires no appropriation of funds. Its operations are entirely funded by the market-rate fees it charges businesses. There is some myth about this. If you want 
an OPIC loan or guarantee or insurance, you pay for it. This isn't a free deal. OPIC is not corporate welfare. I am always amused, and I am a conservative Republican--let me tell you, I am for less Government and cutting Government and cutting taxes. But I am always amused when I ask my colleagues, what do you mean corporate welfare? What is corporate welfare? 
No American business receives any subsidy or free benefit from OPIC. All OPIC loans must be paid in full. OPIC charges full market rates and, where applicable, high-risk-based interest rates and insurance premiums for all of its services. Remember, OPIC returns money to the Treasury through the fees it charges firms that use its services. 
OPIC has a strong record. Let's not overlook this. It has extraordinarily low default rates, less than 1 percent since 1971. OPIC maintains a well-diversified portfolio by region, by sector, by industry, and maintains $2.7 billion in reserves. We have talked about the possibility of privatizing OPIC. Last year J.P. Morgan looked at it, made a study. It won't work that way. Let me tell you, when you are a small company, a small business like I had, to try to compete with the big guys from France and Germany and Britain--all over the globe--to be able to have some base of your country behind you, and you pay for that, is significant. 
The last point I will make, OPIC supports small business. There is a lot of myth about that as well, that this is a big-business boondoggle. It is not. I am living proof of that. In 1996, OPIC supported record numbers of small business projects worth $1.8 billion in 17 countries. Many small American businesses are suppliers to the larger exporters that indirectly come through OPIC. More than half of all suppliers to OPIC-based projects are small businesses. This is a ripple effect. When we get projects and deals internationally, you have to sponsor those. You buy products to support those. And those come from States like that of my friend from Colorado and Nebraska and every State in the Union. So this is a ripple-effect operation. 
Mr. President, again, I rise in opposition to this amendment. I think it is shortsighted and I think the wisest thing to do is to continue with our funding, with our authorization, and as I said earlier, we will have ample opportunity to address this issue in debate. But I don't think a hit-and-run way to approach this with an amendment is the correct way to do it. 
I yield the floor. 
Several Senators addressed the Chair.

Mr. HAGEL. I thank the Chair. 
I again say what I said this afternoon regarding my good friend and real neighbor next to me. His amendment I think at best is shortsighted. I came to this body with the background of a small businessman, Madam President. I know a little something about OPIC. I have marketed companies, built companies, that have worked around the world. I understand the importance of what OPIC is. This is an organization that, in fact, sends money back to the Treasury each year. This is an organization that creates jobs. It has a tremendous ripple effect all across this country. And as we are able to export American technology and products abroad, the support for all of those products comes from American companies in each of our States. I respectfully request that my colleagues vote against this amendment.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, on behalf of the majority leader, today the Senate will be in a period of morning business until the hour of 11 a.m. By previous consent, at 11 a.m., the Senate will begin consideration of S. 955, the foreign operations appropriations bill. Amendments are expected to that appropriations bill, and Senators can, therefore, expect rollcall votes throughout the day. 
As a reminder, under the consent agreement reached last night, a vote will occur on final passage of S. 1004, the energy and water appropriations bill, immediately following the first vote relative to the foreign operations bill. It is hoped the Senate will be able to complete action on the foreign operations bill during today's session of the Senate. 
It is also the intention of the majority leader to begin consideration of the legislative appropriations bill this week, as well as complete action on the nomination of Joel Klein under the remaining 3-hour time agreement. 
I thank my colleagues for their attention.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise this evening to support and cosponsor the amendment that has been brought to the floor by my distinguished friend and colleague from Massachusetts, representing the six Vietnam veterans serving in the U.S. Senate with our view of what has happened in Cambodia as well as now the distinguished Senator from North Carolina, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. And I hope that all of our colleagues join in supporting this resolution. 
I echo, Mr. President, and very much support what my colleagues have said tonight about the tragedy that has befallen Cambodia. I would only add, Mr. President, that at a time in our world when we are reaching out to secure more freedom for peoples around the world, secure more stability, that we have talked about and will debate in detail NATO expansion, and we are currently involved in Bosnia, we must not forget the other corners of the globe. Certainly what we as a free country, the leader of the free world, have invested in Cambodia, in that part of the world, is very important. 
This is a serious matter, Mr. President. It is serious not just for Cambodia, but it is serious for that part of the world because instability in that part of the world leads to great tragedy. We know that firsthand, some of us in this body. It is very important. It is essential that the leadership of this Nation be brought foursquare. We enlist the ASEAN nations and other nations to support our efforts to be able to lead Cambodia back to a time when there is the rule of law and there is security and there is stability. 
Hopefully, this resolution presented tonight will be a good beginning. I add as well, Mr. President, the administration has taken action today. The ASEAN nations have taken action. But we need more. 
I only add this as a summary statement to what we are doing this evening. It is critical, as we enter this new century, that all that has been invested in southeast Asia in blood and treasure, not just Americans, but our friends from Australia, South Korea, all over that area, to make sure that we do not slip back into a morass of tyranny and lose progress that we have so diligently fought for over the years. 
Mr. President, I very much hope that all of our colleagues will strongly support this resolution. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from Wyoming for an opportunity to speak this morning about something that is rather important to Americans, all Americans, Americans who pay the bill, the forgotten American, I think, as we enter this next phase of debate in this country about tax relief. Make no mistake, Mr. President, this is what it is about. This is not about social tinkering. It is not about environmental policy. It is about tax relief--tax relief for those people who pay taxes, those people who have been footing the bill in this country for a long time. So, let's first of all put this in perspective. 
I say that especially in light of the news conference that I saw yesterday and again this morning held by the Vice President and Secretary Rubin. I have the highest regard for Vice President Gore and Secretary Rubin, but I was astounded that much of the focus in that news conference was not about tax relief for the average middle-class American. It was about brownfields. It was about inner cities. It was about other policies. 
This policy is about providing Americans tax relief, providing relief for the forgotten American. 
The bill that we passed in this body 2 weeks ago, and the bill that was passed in the House 2 weeks ago, is not perfect, but it is a very significant first step. As my friend and colleague from Wyoming just said, it is the first significant tax relief legislation in 16 years. 
We are here to do the Nation's business. We are here to focus on the average man and woman who pay their taxes, raise their family, and need to keep more of their income. You heard all of the numbers. You heard the statistics. But I think it is worth noting that we talk a little bit about what is in fact--in fact, not theory, not fabrication, not imputed income, not phony economic tax models that we are hearing from some corners--but in fact what is in this bill. Let's just take a moment to review some of this. 
This is about helping the 6 in 10 Americans who must file Federal tax returns, the people who work hard to make a good life for themselves, their families, and their communities. 
It is about helping the 3 in 4 Americans who file tax returns and earn less than $50,000 a year. Three-fourths of all taxpayers make less than $50,000 a year. In fact, three-fourths of all the tax cuts in the Taxpayer Relief Act that the Senate and the House passed overwhelmingly in a very strong, bipartisan way go to people making less than $75,000 a year. 
This act has a number of provisions that will help families, small businesses, students, farmers, ranchers, and single parents who earn less than $75,000 a year. Couples earning less than $110,000 will get the full benefit of the family tax relief in this bill. 
Parents with children age 12 and under get a $500 per child tax credit against their taxes--keeping more of their money. Parents with children ages 13 to 16 also get a tax credit. The Taxpayer Relief Act allows parents to set up special tax-deferred savings accounts to help with their children's education. It allows single people with incomes under $50,000 and couples with incomes under a $100,000 a tax credit for part of their children's college expenses. 
Mr. President, come on. This is not a rich person's tax bill. This is a middle-class, average-American tax bill. And anyone who says to the contrary doesn't understand what we are doing here. 
This also allows recent college graduates who are struggling to get established to deduct up to $2,500 in student loan interest payments during each of their first few years after graduation. 
Capital gains tax cuts will help anyone who owns property--not rich people. Come on. Anyone who owns property is affected by the capital gains tax in this country. A capital gains tax cut helps middle-class Americans. Fifty-six percent of all tax returns reporting capital gains come from taxpayers with total incomes below $50,000. We move in this bill capital gains taxes from 28 percent to 20 percent. 
Estate tax cuts will help millions of Americans. Both the House and Senate bills raised the estate tax exemptions to $1 
million. It is not perfect. We need more. Of course, we do. But it is a good, strong beginning. It is a start. We need to phase these out. These estate taxes are not only unfair but they are un-American. You work all of your life. You work hard. You pay taxes. And at the end automatically the Government comes in and takes half of your estate. 
You tell me, Mr. President, where that is fair. Some people think it is. I don't. I don't think most Americans think it is fair. 
There are many, many other tax provisions in this bill to help farmers with livestock killed by severe weather and farmers hurt by unwarranted IRS rulings regarding the alternative minimum tax. Truckers are restored with the business meal deduction to 80 percent. 
These are not rich people. 
This bill helps small businesses by delaying a new, burdensome requirement that they file their income tax returns on anything other than electronic payroll tax means. 
It helps universities and other researchers by extending the research and experimentation tax credit. 
It helps people suffering from rare diseases by permanently extending the orphan drug tax credit. 
This is real America. This is for real Americans. 
We need to pass this tax relief bill. None of us likes everything in this bill. But we can either squabble ourselves into total stalemate or we can pass this bill and get the first real tax cuts since 1981. 
Congress needs to reconcile this, move ahead in our conference, and send it to the President. He needs to sign it. America expects us to do this business. Mr. President, we have a responsibility and an obligation to do America's business. 
I encourage my colleagues in the U.S. Senate and in the House to do the right thing and vote for a conference report and bring real tax relief to the American public. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I returned with six of my colleagues over the weekend from a day in Bosnia. Majority Leader Lott and five of our other colleagues spent the Fourth of July early in the morning until late at night with our troops and officials in Bosnia. 
I think it is appropriate that as we debate the fiscal year 1998 defense authorization bill we reflect just for a moment on the men and women on the ground in Bosnia and the men and women who secure our liberties around the world. 
Much of the debate, much of the policy reflect numbers, reflect general overall direction. Increasingly, that policy direction is debated, and should be. But we tend to forget the humanness, the very men and women of what our Armed Forces are all about. 
As my colleagues and I, on the Fourth of July in Bosnia, spent a great deal of time with the 8,500 American men and women who are part of that large contingent in Bosnia, I could not help but reflect on what an outstanding job these men and women do for this country, for peace, stability around the world. 
I want to add the human dynamic to this debate today, and that will go into tomorrow, on the DOD authorization bill. Because, after all, it is the men and women who are on the ground who are there every day and every night who secure those liberties, for not only this country but for the people in the area of Bosnia. 
I tend to think also, when I was an infantryman in Vietnam in 1968, our policy in Vietnam might have been better served, Mr. President, if the Secretary of Defense and more Members of the House and the Senate had come to Vietnam, had spent time with the troops, listening to what they think, listening to their issues and concerns and qualifications, and not unlike wars and peacekeeping missions throughout our history it still is the man and the woman on the ground that we count on to secure those liberties. 
Mr. President, I appreciate the time. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, today the Senate will resume consideration of S. 936, the Department of Defense Authorization Act. As previously announced, there will be no rollcall votes during today's session of the Senate. Any votes ordered today with respect to amendments to the DOD bill will be set aside to occur at a time to be determined later. Under the consent agreement, there will be a cloture vote on the DOD bill at 2:15 p.m. Tuesday afternoon. As a reminder, all first-degree amendments to the bill must be filed by 1 p.m. this afternoon. It is the hope of the majority leader that we will make significant progress on the bill today so that we can complete action on the defense bill this week. 
Beginning next week, the Senate will begin consideration of the available appropriations bills. Senators should be prepared for a busy legislative period between now and the August recess as we consider these appropriations bills as well as the conference reports to accompany the Balanced Budget Act and the Taxpayers Fairness Act. There is much work to do in the next 4 weeks, and the majority leader thanks all Members in advance for their cooperation. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, thank you. 
I wish to offer my thanks to my friend and colleague from across the prairie from the great State of Wyoming. 
People in Wyoming and Nebraska and all over America, I think, rather plainly understand and sense what we are doing this week in this body in this Congress; and that is addressing their issues. 
You know, Mr. President, I am amused at much of the debate that has been raging in the Congress the last few months on the budget and taxes. And, you see, I define this down rather simply. Whose money is this? Whose money are we talking about? Is it the President's money? Is it my money? Is it the distinguished Presiding Officer's money? Is it Congress' money? No. No. 
You see, this is about the people's money. This is about the hard-earned money of taxpayers. The Government should be accountable to the people. Our taxpayers, our citizens should not be accountable to government. And we are living at a time when we are taxed as highly as at any time, except in World War II, in the history of this country. We are living during a time when we are taxed that highly. A median family of four, total tax paid out, over 40 percent. These struggling young families are paying more in taxes than they are in combined efforts to ensure that they have enough for shelter or clothes or food and other necessities. 
At some point, Mr. President, we will not only bankrupt our country, but we will surely bankrupt the opportunities for our young people. These young people starting out in life in our country, a country of promise, of hope, of opportunity--always has been--are looking at a very bleak future unless this Congress steps up and honestly deals with the challenges that take us into this bold new great century. 
And it does start with tax cuts. It starts with real tax relief. And what we will be debating this week is tax relief for families, for lower middle-income people, people who need tax relief, people who pay the bills in this country. But let us not also be unmindful of what else is attached to what we will be debating. 
Real budget cuts, putting this country on the trajectory for fiscal responsibility, we have an opportunity here for the first time in 30 years to agree to a balanced budget, a budget that would be in balance within 5 years, put this country on a course to balance our budget as far out as the eye can see. We also have an opportunity to cut government. 
Government is too big. Government is unresponsive. Government cannot possibly do everything we have asked government to do. We have overloaded our circuits, Mr. President. Not government's fault. But we have asked government over the last 30 years to do everything. 
And who has paid the bill? Who has paid the bill? Well-intentioned programs, but this is an era of prioritizing our resources. And we start with giving our people, our taxpayers, the people who have been doing the heavy lifting and paying the bills in this country the last 30 years, especially, a break, give them some of their money back. 
My goodness, they understand how to spend their money better than government does. Let us decentralize power. Let us put power back where the people are. Let us make government accountable and make it responsible. So all of this is a total package. 
Mr. President, I serve on the Foreign Relations Committee. Before I came to this body, I was a businessman. I started my own companies, international/national companies. And the opportunities that lay ahead for this country, for our people, and the world, if we are wise enough to understand and seize the moment, the potential for our people is unlimited if--if--we are wise enough to cut our taxes, to cut our spending, to balance our budget, and take the burden of government off the backs of our people who produce. 
Oh, we will be able to get along for the next 5, 10 years. But we are entering a time like no other in the history of man. It is a time full of hope; but it is a time of great 
competitiveness. This next generation coming in behind us will have to compete in a complete global economy. And as we look all around the world, on every continent--and it is not just Asia--South America, Eastern Europe, the former Soviet Republics, all of the areas in the world are doing well and will continue to explode with opportunity. They are disciplined. They are focused. And the movement of most of the governments in the world today is less government. 
The countries in trouble today are in trouble because of the burden of taxes and the burden of government. We have an opportunity here, as my distinguished colleague from Wyoming said earlier, to change that. Imperfect? Yes. Do the taxes go deep enough, far enough? No. But it is a beginning. It is a start. It is tangible. It is real. 
We can build on that. And we can show America that, in fact, we can govern and lead and do the people's business, that we do not get all tangled up in esoterics, in tactics and nonsense that goes on in this town. But, in fact, we can stay focused and clear-headed and do the people's business, and do what we are required to do on behalf of the people of this country. 
Mr. President, I want to also address for a moment some of the weekend television on this issue of tax cuts. I was a little amused that I saw our distinguished Secretary of the Treasury, Bob Rubin, who is a great public servant, who is dedicated, who has done a good job as Secretary of the Treasury, talk about the White House modeling of our proposed tax cuts that show most of the benefits going to the higher income and the wealthy. That is just not true, absolutely not true. 
I note here, for example, a press release sent out on Friday from one of the big six accounting firms, Deloitte & Touche. In the first paragraph it talks about:  
Families with household incomes between $20,000 and $50,000 are the biggest beneficiaries on a percentage basis under the Senate tax plan, according to a new analysis by Deloitte & Touche. 
The big winners are middle-class families with kids. 
And it goes on and on. 
The scoring, the methodology, the models that the Members used are the same models that the Congressional Budget Office uses, that we use, that most everybody uses. I want to take issue with my friend, the Secretary of the Treasury, when he talks about some scoring model he referred to over the weekend. That, in fact, is rather bizarre. It imputes income from unrealized capital gains. It talks about rent back income. If you own your house and you actually put that house on the market for rent--that is just nonsense. What we are talking about here is real tax relief for real people. If we do this right, we can give the American public, for the first time in 16 or 17 years, a tax cut, a real tax cut that we can build on. 
Mr. President, in my final comments, I will reference my weekend back in Nebraska. I was, on Saturday, in North Platte, NE, the home of Buffalo Bill. Being a good Kansan, Mr. President, you probably understand that and have probably been across the border and paid homage to Buffalo Bill's home ranch. It was amazing to me, all day in North Platte, NE, farmers, ranchers, small business people, and families would come up to me during the day and talk about this issue. Farmers, ranchers, and small business people asked me, `Senator, do you think I consider myself rich because I support capital gains tax or inheritance tax relief? You see I don't think I am very rich. I have an income of $50,000, $40,000, or $60,000, but I would like to leave my children something. Why is it fair, Senator, for the Government to take these big chunks out of an estate that the Government did not do anything to produce? I paid my taxes, and my father and mother paid their taxes all along the way. Yet in the end, the Government automatically comes in and gets half.' 
Mr. President, being the former chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, you understand what it has done to agriculture in this country, what it has done to devastate farms being passed along from generation to generation, ranches, and small businesses. It is unfair and wrong. 
Anybody who has an asset is going to deal with a capital gains tax. You do not have to be a millionaire. It is a sense of fairness, a sense of getting ahead in this country, a sense of doing the right thing. We have a Tax Code in this country that essentially penalizes success. We give disincentive to savings and investment. 
Now, are we going to change the Tax Code this week? I doubt it. But this is surely a darn good start. It is a very tangible, real beginning for the people of this country who deserve it most. I hope my colleagues during the debate this week will rivet in on this debate because it will be, as Senator Thomas said, one of the most important debates not only of this Congress but, I think, of the last 10 years and into the next century because we have an opportunity to truly shape and mold the future of this country, the future for our young people. 
We cannot leave them the mounds of debt that we are now leaving them, the burden of regulation, the burden of big Government, the burden of high taxes, and think they are going to succeed. They will not. We must get at it. This is a good start. I strongly support what we have done so far and what has been produced out of the Finance Committee and over in the House Ways and Means Committee. 
With that, I yield back my time to Senator Thomas of Wyoming.

Mr. HAGEL. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, first, I want to commend my distinguished colleague from Vermont for his leadership over the years. This has been an issue that has been worked with some difficulty with a certain intenseness to develop, first of all, an awareness of the problem. 
This is an issue that, like all difficult issues, should always come with a certain amount of information. And through the process over the years, Senator Leahy; my friend and colleague from Nebraska, Senator Kerrey; and others, have been remarkable in their tenacity and their effort to focus on this issue of landmines. Today, I continue with my friend from Vermont; my distinguished senior Senator, Bob Kerrey; and others in our efforts to ban antipersonnel landmines. The legislation that we are introducing this morning would permanently ban new deployments of antipersonnel landmines. 
Now, my colleague talked a little bit about why it is important. But I think there are a couple of primary reasons, Mr. President, that we owe this country the world leadership on this issue. First, America has always taken the moral high ground over its brief 200-year history. There is some debate and argument about the military necessity, the military use, the viability of landmines. But as we enter a new century, a bold new century full of hope and promise, in my opinion--and I have some experience in this business--I do not really believe, nor do many former commanders and present commanders believe, that to continue to use antipersonnel landmines in our arsenal is in the best interest of anyone. 
So I take up this debate as a conservative Senator from Nebraska, a combat veteran. There is no U.S. Senator in this body who supports more strongly the U.S. military, what we must do to always arm our military, never taking away the capabilities of our military. So I come at this as a very strong advocate of our national defense forces and the awesome responsibility our military has to protect our people and freedom worldwide. 
However, I believe the issue here regarding the banning of antipersonnel landmines is no longer the argument of whether we should or shouldn't. The issue now is when and how. I believe the time is now. The time is now for this country and for this body to provide leadership, as so many other nations around the world are providing leadership on this issue. 
We can change the face of warfare. We must not make the mistake in believing that this act alone will do away with landmines. It is a beginning. We must understand and face the fact that there are over 110 million landmines in the ground today all over the world. This act today will not dig those 110 million mines up. But it is a beginning. It is a moral beginning. It is a beginning that sends a message to the world that we are a moral nation, that we will defend freedom as we always have, and that we will defend the rights of individuals, but we do not need indiscriminate killing machines like antipersonnel mines in order to defend those liberties. 
Mr. President, there are colleagues other than Senator Leahy and I on the floor, and I wish to ensure that they have time to express themselves on this issue. 
With that, I will summarize by saying that those of us in Congress--especially those of us who have served in combat--have a responsibility to those Americans who now serve in our military to give our best judgment on all weapons systems, including landmines, to the future. We owe no less to the countless thousands of civilians, including many men and women who will yet suffer from the indiscriminate use of these weapons. 
It is significant, as I see my friend and colleague, Senator Bob Kerrey, the recipient of the Congressional Medal of Honor, walk around on the floor of the Senate, that my other five Vietnam combat veterans have joined Senator Leahy and I in cosponsoring this important initiative. It is time for America to lead. 
Mr. President, thank you. I yield my time to Senator Leahy.

Mr. HAGEL. I will be brief, Mr. President. I know there are others who want to speak on this issue. There is an old North Carolina adage that goes like this: Don't make the perfect the enemy of the good. 
The Senator has heard that, I know. I think that is what we are talking about this morning. This is rather remarkable. What has been pieced together over 5 months of very diligent effort, leadership, and hard work, making something work based on a bipartisan foreign policy effort and a commitment made by Chairman Helms, Senator Biden, Secretary of State Albright, and the administration, who all have worked very hard on this. When you add to that Senator Grams from Minnesota, as the subcommittee chairman, who has put his imprimatur and worked hard and given his leadership to this effort, this is a remarkable effort. 
Mr. President, I don't know about you or other Senators in this body, but for years and years, as a private citizen, as a taxpayer, and as a businessman, I would hear constantly, and I have heard over the last 2 years during my campaign: What about the United Nations? What are we doing? The United Nations says we owe money. Do we owe money? How much? What about the peacekeeping efforts? Are our peacekeeping dollars counted? How do we account for that? Isn't it true that we put American men and women in harm's way and we paid the bill and we are in Bosnia and all over the globe? 
So what is the correct way to assess our dues, our commitment to this very important organization? The debate, ladies and gentlemen--don't be mistaken here--is not whether the United Nations is good, bad, or whether we want to be in it or not. Of course it is good. The world is better because of the United Nations. But we need to get this issue cleared up. We need to take the negotiations that have been held by the leaders in this and hold negotiations. I think it was rather evident in our committee hearings and the subsequent markup of this bill last week, when it was reported out 14 to 4. It said to me that, in fact, bipartisanship is in effect and, in fact, the commitment made by the administration and Senators Biden, Helms, and others, will make this work. We need to get this behind us and we need to address this issue. I think it is a fair resolution to the issue. We can then work on the bigger issues that this country and the world must face as we move into a bold, new century. 
Big issues. We have trade issues. We have treaty issues. I, for one, am not one Senator who wants to go back and replay this. I say this with the greatest respect for Senator Lugar and others 
who have been involved in this. Hardly an individual in this body is as aware and provided as much leadership on foreign relations as Senator Lugar. But I think the time is now to make what we came up with--the good effort of bipartisan leadership--the bill that we move forward with and, therefore, allowing this body, the committee, and all those responsible for policy in this country, as we move into the next century, the freedom to focus on that. I rise today in strong support of the Helms-Biden bill. I hope my colleagues will take what I and my colleagues have said this morning into consideration as they vote today.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I am proud to serve as the principal Republican sponsor of this important legislation. I want to express my gratitude to my colleague from Vermont, Senator Leahy, for the dedication and leadership he has shown in bringing this issue before the U.S. Senate. 
I approach this issue from two perspectives. First, I've had a real life experience with this issue. My brother and I were wounded twice together in Vietnam as a result of landmines. Second, I am a strong supporter of our military. It's important that we not take any action that would inhibit the military's ability to fight and win wars, do their jobs, and maintain valuable weapons options and strategies. 
However, we are dealing with a different world than we fought in world wars, Korea and Vietnam. Our recent military actions have been actions where we've been in and out relatively quickly. I am concerned with the effects of laying down mines and then leaving them behind when our troops leave. There are already an estimated 110 million landmines in the ground around the world, and the destruction that these mines continue to inflict on innocent lives is devastating. It's the indiscriminate nature of their killing that makes landmines so hideous. 
I believe this legislation addresses a number of the concerns expressed by the military. Exemptions have been provided for when the military needs specific options, such as Korea and the use of antitank mines and claymores. 
We have a responsibility to those who've served and those who are now serving in the military and the peoples of the world to take a close look at this issue. This question comes down to, is this really a military option we need today? I don't believe it is. After careful study and consideration and seeking the opinions of many present and former military commanders, I have decided that America should show leadership on this issue. We can take the moral high ground and still insure a strong, flexible military. I am proud that my five Senate colleagues who are also Vietnam combat veterans have joined me in support of this legislation.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the senior Senator from West Virginia in cosponsoring the resolution that he has brought to the floor this morning. As my distinguished colleague has already noted, this resolution deals with U.S. policy on the global climate issue. This is a very serious issue, with potentially disastrous consequences to the United States economy. Next week I will begin, as Senator Byrd noted, hearings in the Foreign Relations Subcommittee on International Trade and Export Promotion on the global climate negotiations. 
Like Senator Byrd, I believe that the Senate must not simply wait until the negotiations are completed and then respond. If we do that, it then would be too late to exercise our constitutional responsibility to not only give our consent to treaties but, even more important, to give our advice to the President. 
Next week, my subcommittee will be hearing from the Under Secretary of State for Global Affairs, Tim Wirth. Secretary Wirth has been the administration's chief negotiator in the U.N.'s global climate negotiations. 
I will be following that first hearing a week later with a second hearing. We will ask fair questions, tough questions, and we will expect honest answers. 
All Americans are concerned about our environment--of course, they are and should be--and how to ensure that it is protected for our children and our grandchildren. 
The responsibility we have as public servants, as policymakers, is to seek the best solutions where problems exist and come to a strong and commonsense bipartisan consensus on what is the best policy to deal with this problem. 
This resolution offers a general baseline for what we can accept as sensible, commonsense policy. 
This resolution does not address all the specific concerns many of us have over this issue. We know that. 
As the necessary debate over the global climate issue progresses over the next few months, we will have an opportunity to hear from all sides, just as Senator Byrd pointed out, and further open up this issue and talk about the specifics associated with the global climate issue. 
How we deal with this issue of climate control will have serious consequences--serious consequences--for our economy, the environment, Americans' future standard of living, energy costs, energy use, economic growth, our global competitiveness, impact on jobs, trade, national security and maybe, Mr. President, most important, our national sovereignty. 
All of these dynamics will be explored before the December meeting in Kyoto, Japan, formally known as the `Third Meeting of the Conference of Parties for the Framework Convention on Climate Change.' 
Mr. President, this is clearly a very serious issue that demands a major national debate. 
The purpose of this resolution that Senator Byrd and I are offering today, with a number of our distinguished colleagues representing States from all over this country with varied economies, varied interests, is to begin that debate, to begin that debate today and to let the world know that the U.S. Senate intends to have a very serious and strong voice in shaping the American position on this global climate issue. 
Mr. President, thank you, and I yield back my time.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Responsive Government Act. I am proud to be the principal cosponsor of this legislation, and I commend my colleague from North Carolina, Senator Faircloth, for his leadership in introducing this bill. 
This bill would make Government agencies more responsive to the people who use their services. It is a narrow and targeted approach that addresses several of the most common complaints that Americans have about the service they receive from Government agencies. 
This bill would make the Federal Government more user-friendly by requiring all Federal agencies to: 
Include the telephone number of the author on all official correspondence so citizens know whom to contact and how to reach that person if there are questions; 
Provide a person, not an automated system, to answer the main telephone number at service-oriented Federal agencies so citizens do not have to talk to a machine; 
Ensure that telephones are answered until 5 p.m. so citizens can get assistance by phone during normal business hours; 
Publish principal telephone numbers in the local directories so citizens can readily find how to reach the agency; 
Attempt to locate service-oriented offices in areas with sufficient parking so citizens can come and go easily when doing business; and 
Remove computer games from all Federal Government computers so Federal employees are not distracted from their jobs. 
Mr. President, I ran for the U.S. Senate because I believe we need less Government. I also believe that we must make our Government better and more efficient. Federal agencies must always--always--be as user-friendly as possible for our citizens. Government agencies must always treat taxpayers with courtesy and respect. 
This bill is a small but important step toward creating a service-oriented climate in the Federal Government. Americans deserve no less. 
I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

 Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, last Friday a distinguished former Member of the United States Senate, Roman Hruska, was honored during a groundbreaking ceremony for a new Federal courthouse to be constructed in downtown Omaha. This new Federal facility will be named the Roman L. Hruska United States Courthouse. 
I had the honor of knowing Senator Hruska when I served as administrative assistant to former Congressman John Y. McCollister (R-NE), my friend and mentor, in the 1970's. Senator Hruska served on the Senate Appropriations Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee as its ranking member. Several of my colleagues still serving today no doubt recall Senator Hruska and his contributions to our work here in the Senate. He is still going strong at 92 years of age and continues to stay involved in the Omaha community. 
Much of his work on the Senate Judiciary Committee remains with us today. Whether it was the creation of the Legal Services Corporation, revision of the Federal bankruptcy laws, reform of the Federal criminal code or amendments to the Federal antitrust laws, his imprint can be found. Senator Hruska always considered himself a work horse rather than a show horse and his numerous contributions to our Federal legal and justice system bear that out. 
That is why it is so fitting that the new Federal courthouse in Omaha has been named after him. His lifelong work as a public servant and lawyer was dedicated to making our system of laws fair, just, and workable for all citizens not just a privileged few. This is especially true with the Federal judiciary. Senator Hruska worked tirelessly to ensure that the Federal court system and the judiciary would be run by people of integrity, intellect, courage, and empathy for all the people--traits that he exhibited throughout his career. 
Mr. President, the new Hruska Courthouse is a welcome addition to downtown Omaha. It will meet the immediate needs of the Federal judiciary and other agencies that support the judicial system like the U.S. Marshals Service, U.S. Attorneys Office, U.S. Probation Service, U.S. Pretrial Service and several other Federal agencies. The complex is designed to permit future expansion if needed. It will fit the traditional solid architecture of downtown Omaha but have new technology to meet the demands of the 21st century.

Mr. HAGEL. Madam President, I wish to add my thanks to my distinguished colleague from Missouri for his leadership on this bill. 
I rise today in support of the Family Friendly Workplace Act. I will read a letter from a small businessperson, Gary Tharnish, in Lincoln, NE, dated April 30, 1997. I will read this because I think it does, in fact, cut directly to the essence of what this bill is about. As my distinguished colleague before me made very clear, this is a voluntary bill. This is not a mandate. This is about flexible work time for our men and women. 
I will read this letter from Gary Tharnish, the owner of Burton's Flowers: 
Dear Senator Hagel: It is my understanding that S-4, `Compensatory Time' will soon come to the floor for a vote. I would like to urge you to vote in favor of this bill. As a small business person my employees are begging me to offer them compensatory time. I explain to them I can not offer this. They do not understand the governments intrusion into their personal affairs. I would like to explain the situation an employee is in. 
Elaine is a mother of 3 children. This day and age it is so important for a mother to be home when her children get out of school. In order to make ends meet Elaine needs to work. Her options are a full time job and children home alone, or part time work. I offer her and 2 other women a part time job from 9:00 to 3:00 so they can be home when their kids get home. However in the summer they are not able to work. They would love to take their overtime pay and use it at that time. At Valentines Day and Mother's Day they receive a lot of overtime. They would love to use their `time and a half' hours to receive pay during the summer. 
Please, I am asking that you vote in favor of S-4. All Small Businesses and the thousands of constituents working for them will benefit. 
Sincerely, Gary J. Tharnish.  
Madam President, this really does say it very effectively, very succinctly, and I think it encompasses what we are trying to do with this bill. 
I ask my colleagues to spend some time in the remaining minutes that we have, reviewing their own constituencies, reviewing their own situations for their own workers in their States. I strongly urge cloture be invoked this afternoon and my colleagues vote in favor of the Family Friendly Workplace Act. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise this morning to be one of many to pay tribute to our distinguished senior Senator from South Carolina. 
Mr. President, I, like all of Senator Thurmond's colleagues, feel it is a privilege to serve with the distinguished Senator, the man whom the Almanac of American Politics calls `the most enduring figure in American politics.' 
As you and I both know, Mr. President, because you and I are both new Members of this body, we are quickly learning what it means to serve in the U.S. Senate. So it is with genuine respect that I reflect upon Strom Thurmond's many, many, many years of service here in this body, the votes he has cast, the issues he has debated and the people he has known, and the history that Senator Thurmond has helped shape. 
Strom Thurmond was serving America for more than a decade before, you, Mr. President, were born, or before I was born. He landed at Normandy on D-Day. Many people do not know that Senator Thurmond was a legitimate hero of World War II. He was jumping out of planes not at the age of 21, but far beyond those tender young ages. He landed at Normandy on D-day. He was a State legislator, a Governor, and a candidate for President of the United States, all before he came to the U.S. Senate. 
However, it has been his service in the U.S. Senate that has made Strom Thurmond's boldest and most enduring mark, service that began when I was in grade school in the sand hills of Nebraska. Strom Thurmond came to this body when there were only 48 stars on the American flag. He has served with nine Presidents of both political parties, and his leadership has spanned five decades with tremendous change in American culture, society, and government. Strom Thurmond is part of American history. 
This freshman, 6-month-old, humble Senator from Nebraska, wishes to thank Senator Thurmond for the opportunity to learn from his experiences and his leadership. I wish to add my commendation to Senator Thurmond for his dedication, his commitment to our Nation. I admire the strong example he has set for all of us, especially our young people. Mr. President, in a day when we do not have enough strong role models in this country, Senator Thurmond is one. He is an example of a life well lived. He is a true American role model, an American hero. 
Senator Thurmond is the highest ranking 95-year-old in the Nation, as far as I know, Mr. President. My only request is that I hope that during my time in the Senate I may conduct myself in such a way that Senator Thurmond will remember me as his colleague and friend long after I have departed this body and Senator Thurmond is still presiding. 
Mr. President, I thank you for your time. I once again commend my colleague and my friend, the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee and a most distinguished American. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my strong support for Senate Concurrent Resolution 27. I want to begin by applauding the dedication of the Budget chairman and all those who have worked so diligently over the last few months to craft a budget that makes some sense and for bringing this balanced budget to the floor. 
I want to speak in more global terms about this budget issue. I have not been around here very long. It seems to me that if we continue this `what if' theory and `one more amendment' theory to budgeting, we will never get there. 
The fact is, at least in this humble freshman Senator's opinion, that the real challenge to this country over the next few years, well into the next century, is like this: It is the prioritization of our resources. If we are going to do that, then we are going to have to have some framework that makes some sense, that disciplines this Congress, disciplines this body. We have been an undisciplined Congress for 30 years, and what Chairman Domenici and the President and the leadership on the Democratic and Republican sides in the House and the Senate, and all those who have been part of this process have brought to this floor is 
something that makes sense. 
This is a historic budget. We have not been able to craft this kind of a budget for more than 30 years. We should not forget this point as we debate this budget. 
Is this a perfect budget? No. I think it is a good budget. Over the years, Mr. President, like many of my colleagues and most Americans, I was running my own business and paying taxes. Like most Americans, I was doubting whether this Congress had the will and the discipline to ever balance the budget. Now we have an opportunity to do what many thought would never happen, and that is to pass a balanced budget. 
What also makes this budget significant is it cuts taxes. I, like many of my colleagues, know how difficult it was to craft such a budget. I also know, like in my campaign last year and the campaigns of others, that people said you can't cut taxes, you can't cut spending and balance the budget. Well, we can. That is what this is about. 
Mr. President, there is a reason that more Americans believe in Santa Claus than believe we can actually balance the budget. We are at a crossroads in governance. We are at a crossroads in leadership. If we allow the further erosion of confidence of the American public in this body, this Congress, trust and confidence to do the right thing, to balance the budget, then it may be some time in getting it back. 
I don't doubt the sincerity of my colleagues, Senators Hatch, Kennedy, and others. I applaud what they are doing. But if we continue to proceed with amendment after amendment after amendment, I don't know what we would do at the end of the day. These are issues that should be debated in the appropriate forums. If we are not careful, we will undo a very delicate balance in coming to this budget agreement. 
I will support this budget, but I will not support any of the amendments that are being offered. This budget is too important to our Nation and the future of our children to place it at risk with various amendments, regardless of how well-intentioned. 
I urge my colleagues to defeat the amendments offered today and to support this balanced budget that so many people have worked so hard to craft and make work. This does include tax relief, spending cuts, and balancing the budget, putting this country on a responsible fiscal plane over the next few years. Until we bring some stability to our financial responsibilities and our fiscal responsibilities starting right here, then we will pay consequences for that. 
I urge my colleagues to support Senate Concurrent Resolution 27. 
I yield the remainder of my time. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution commemorating the 15th anniversary of the construction and dedication of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, also known as `The Wall.' I am pleased to be joined in this effort by my distinguished colleague from Nebraska, my senior Senator, Bob Kerrey, who, incidentally, is the only Member of this body who was a recipient of the Medal of Honor for his service in Vietnam. I also am joined by the other Vietnam combat veterans who serve in this body. In all, 75 Senators have joined in cosponsoring this resolution. 
The creation of this memorial marked the beginning of a healing process for the Nation and for veterans divided by the war. I was proud to have spoken at the 1982 groundbreaking for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, as did two of my colleagues, Senator Robb, who then was Governor of Virginia, and Senator John Warner. 
I keep in my Senate office, Mr. President, a shovel I used during the groundbreaking ceremony 15 years ago to remind me of that day. While the debate over our involvement in Vietnam and the conduct of the war will continue for years to come, the wall has united Americans in honoring those who served. It honors warriors, not the war. The Vietnam wall stands as a stirring reminder that memorials are built not to honor or glorify war. There is no glory in a war, only suffering. Memorials are built to honor the commitment and the sacrifice that men and women give to their country because they are willing to risk their lives in defense of freedom. 
As we commemorate the 15th anniversary of the groundbreaking for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, it is important that we remember those brave men and brave women who fought and died for liberties we take for granted, and it is important we remember their families who also sacrificed for this Nation. 
Recently I was joined in a ceremony to mark the wall's 15th anniversary by my friends and colleagues, Senators Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, John McCain of Arizona, Max Cleland of Georgia, John Kerry of Massachusetts, and Chuck Robb of Virginia. We come from different States and different parties, but despite our differences, we six U.S. Senators have a common background. We are all Vietnam combat veterans. We attended the ceremony on behalf of every man and woman who served in Vietnam, every man and woman who gave their life in Vietnam, every Vietnam veteran who is still missing in that far away land, and every family in this country who sacrificed to keep this Nation strong. 
We marked the anniversary of this groundbreaking in order to remind us all that the liberties we cherish do not come without great sacrifice. One needs only to run a hand over the rough names inscribed in the smooth glossy surface of the wall to realize that freedom is not free. As we laid a wreath in honor of the 58,202 
men and women whose lives are memorialized by the names, each of us realized we could easily have been present only in the memories of those who survived. We, too, could have been listed on the wall. 
We also remembered and honored the more than 2,000 Americans still missing in action from this war. Mr. President, this morning I noted that our new Ambassador to Vietnam, Ambassador Pete Petersen, a Nebraska native, held as a POW in Vietnam for more than 6 years, received the remains of two of our MIA's yesterday in Vietnam. 
Each year, more than 3 million people visit the Vietnam Memorial, making it the most visited monument in Washington. Many visitors are so moved they leave flowers, letters, pictures, and other mementoes to their fallen comrades, parents, relatives, friends, children, and loved ones. 
Next weekend, Memorial Day weekend, the traveling Vietnam memorial will come to Omaha, NE. It is a half-scale replica of the wall that stands here in Washington. It has visited cities and States across America so Americans who may never visit the Nation's Capital can experience the healing power of the Vietnam wall. 
The resolution before the Senate today is an important statement by the Senate to mark the 15th year of the wall and all that wall has meant to so many. I am proud to be a sponsor and am grateful for my colleagues' support. 
Mr. President, I yield time to my distinguished colleague, friend, and fellow Vietnam veteran, Senator Bob Kerrey.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I have two final comments to make regarding this resolution commemorating the 15th anniversary of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. 
First, the recognition of the vision, the heart, the soul, and the leadership behind it, a remarkable man, Jan Scruggs. It was Jan Scruggs who many, many years ago came home one night after a movie, sat down with his wife, and said, `We are going to do something to recognize those who served in the Vietnam.' It was a great dream, an impossible dream. 
One of the collaborators with Jan Scruggs was one of our colleagues, Senator John Warner. Without Senator John Warner's leadership, and without his force, and without Jan Scruggs' vision and leadership and love, this Wall would never have been built. It is very appropriate to recognize Jan Scruggs and Senator John Warner because those two great Americans led this effort and have given us a magnificent monument and memorial. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution, Senate Resolution 87, be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I want to compliment my distinguished colleague from Wyoming, Senator Enzi, for introducing this important piece of legislation. This bill addresses an issue that is critical to small businessowners across America. I am proud to be an original cosponsor. 
The Safety and Health Advancement Act is a commonsense approach to reining in an overreaching Federal agency. 
I worked in Congress when the Occupational Safety and Health Administration [OSHA] was created in the 1970's. Many people today would find it hard to believe that OSHA was created to assist business--especially small businesses. In its original intent, OSHA existed not just to help enforce workplace safety laws, but to help small businessowners understand those laws and advise them on how to comply. 
What OSHA has grown into is an agency of confrontation and intimidation. The mere mention of OSHA strikes fear in the hearts of small businessowners everywhere. 
The father of one of my staff members owns small heating and air-conditioning business in Nebraska. He's a good employer. He runs a safe workplace and treats his employees fairly. But he faces the constant threat that an unannounced visit by OSHA could shut him down because he doesn't have the resources to appeal the high fines frequently handed out by OSHA. 
I hear stories like this from small businessowners throughout Nebraska. Businesses that are fined tens of thousands of dollars for a minor infraction of a regulation they frequently did not even know existed. They are forced to close their doors and lay off their employees because they can't afford to fight the fines that come through arbitrary process. 
Mr. President, the safety of our workplaces must continue to be a top priority. Where there are those violating the law and creating unsafe working conditions, we should go after them and persecute to the fullest extent of the law. Those are the individuals OSHA should be going after. But the Government should not be killing jobs by intimidating honest, hardworking small businessowners. We need to focus on the real problems in the workplace. 
The Safety and Health Advancement Act would help address this problem. It gives OSHA the flexibility to prioritize its resources in order to target the worst offenders. It encourages voluntary compliance by rewarding employers who use third-party consultants. It holds employees responsible for their misconduct at a site that is in compliance with OSHA regulations. 
This bill returns OSHA to its original intent and expands its consultative services. Under this legislation, OSHA would actually work hand in hand with small businessowners to create safe workplaces, not merely hand down punitive fines. It moves OSHA away from confrontation and back toward cooperation. 
I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the Safety and Health Advancement Act. Not only will this bill help make America's workplaces safer, it will go a long way in freeing America's small businessowners from the heavy burdens of Government regulation. I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense legislation.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, following morning business the Senate will hopefully resume consideration of H.R. 1122, the partial-birth abortion ban bill. It is still hoped that an agreement will be reached shortly to conduct a vote on final passage of H.R. 1122 early this afternoon. In addition, I remind all Senators, from 12:30 to 2:15, the Senate will recess for weekly policy luncheons. This afternoon it is hoped we will begin consideration of the budget resolution. Therefore, Senators can expect rollcall votes throughout the day in this session of the Senate. 
As previously announced, Members who intend to offer amendments to that resolution should be prepared to offer those amendments during today's session. Also it is hoped that the two leaders will be able to reach an agreement on yielding back much of the statutory time limitation for the budget resolution, leaving 15 hours of debate on the resolution in order. 
As always, all Members will be notified accordingly as any votes are ordered with respect to any of this legislation. I thank all Members for their attention.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my full support for the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this important legislation. 
I thank my distinguished colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Santorum, for his leadership on this issue. 
This debate, of course, is about abortion, which I strongly oppose. But it is about much more than that. It is about doing what is right. It is about values. 
And it is about a civilized society standing against a heinous procedure that is used to kill a mostly born child--a procedure that, as even some advocates of abortion rights have conceded, comes dangerously close to murder. 
The debate about abortion raged in America long before I began my service in the Senate. It will continue long after the Senate votes on this bill to ban one specific abortion procedure. 
It will continue until America comes to grips with the moral crisis that makes abortion just another sign of the times. 
This debate itself may rise and fall, but my view on this matter is straightforward--I believe America should ban partial-birth abortion because it is wrong. 
For too long, our society has drifted too far from that simple conclusion. In this body--as in this country--we are adept at weighing and debating the pros and cons. We know how to balance competing interests. We know how to strike compromises. But do we think often enough about the consequences of our actions? 
I fear we have strayed from seeking straightforward answers to tough questions. We have too often strayed from making public policy based solely on what is right. 
The vote we are about to cast is about banning a specific method of abortion. But the debate in which we are engaged is about larger questions. 
Have we become coarsened by a society that cheapens life--from our failure to stop violence in our streets to our unwillingness to keep violence from our television screens? 
Have we come to accept what should never be acceptable--a society where drug use is termed recreational, and irresponsible behavior is just a sign of the times? 
Have we lost the basis of a civil society? Are we no longer willing to stand up and say enough is enough? 
Mr. President, I came to this Senate with a firm belief that we can make a real difference for America's future. I have no doubt we can put our financial books in order--by cutting spending, cutting taxes, cutting regulations, and balancing the budget. 
But can we put our values in order? If we, as leaders, fail to do what is right and fail to stop what is wrong, will we really have left a better America for our children and our grandchildren? 
I think not. 
For two centuries, America has rested on a value system anchored by personal responsibility. Our society has always been underpinned by respect for others, respect for self, faith in God and family, and helping those in need. We have always held these values important--worth struggling for and worth fighting for. 
People of good character stood up for these values in their own lives, and in their communities. They expected their leaders to stand up for them as well. 
Mr. President, I have every confidence that this body will vote to outlaw this gruesome procedure because the goodness of our people will demand it. Just as families across America wake up every day and try to do the right thing, so they are expecting their leaders to do the same. 
The vote we will cast on this issue is important. It goes to the heart of who we are as a people and who we want to be as a Nation. 
I hope we will all take pause, in this body and throughout America, to reflect on what type of society we have become and what type of society we want to leave for our children and grandchildren. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I am pleased to support this CFE Flank Treaty today. It is good for the security of the United States and the security of our NATO allies. 
This treaty modifies the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty. This treaty was reached in 1990 before the breakup of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact. The modifications in CFE flank restrictions contained in this treaty are reasonable, and we all should support them. 
Under Chairman Helms' guidance, the Foreign Relations Committee added a number of important conditions to this treaty. These conditions clarify parts of the treaty that could be construed as granting special rights to Russia to intimidate its neighbors, but most importantly are the clarifications that nothing in the CFE Flank Treaty grants to Russia any right to continue its current violations of the sovereignty of several neighboring states. 
I am pleased that these clarifications were fully bipartisan conditions that received the support of our distinguished Foreign Relations ranking member, Senator Biden. 
There is, however, one remaining condition that caused some controversy. This is condition 9, which requires the President to submit to the Senate for ratification another treaty modification, the ABM multilateralization treaty. This is not a question of support or opposition to the ABM Treaty. This is purely a matter of the prerogative of the Senate, of whether or not to adhere to the clear intent of the Constitution of this country. 
During negotiations over the Chemical Weapons Convention, Senator Helms and Majority Leader Lott succeeded in convincing the President to submit to the Senate two out of three pending treaty modifications that the President had intended to implement as executive agreements. One of those treaty modifications, the CFE Flank Treaty now before us today, and another, the ABM Demarcation Treaty, is before the Foreign Relations Committee where it will receive serious consideration. 
Only one treaty modification has yet to be submitted to the 
Senate, the ABM multilateralization treaty agreed to in Helsinki by Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin. It is right to require that treaty to be submitted as well. 
Again, this issue is merely the constitutional obligation of each of us in this body to give our advice and consent on the ratification of treaties, not whether this treaty modification is good or bad. 
I again congratulate Chairman Helms, Senator Biden, and the distinguished majority leader. I am proud of the leadership they have shown on this treaty and on the constitutional prerogatives of the Senate. 
Mr. President, I yield my time.  
Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Private Property Fairness Act of 1997. This bill will help ensure that when the Government issues regulations for the benefit of the public as a whole, it does not saddle just a few landowners with the whole cost of compliance. This bill will help enforce the U.S. Constitution's guarantee that the Federal Government cannot take private property without paying just compensation to the owner. 
The dramatic growth in Federal regulation in recent decades has focused attention on a very murky area of property law, a regulatory area in which the law of takings is not yet settled to the satisfaction of most Americans. 
The bottom line is that the law in this area is unfair. For example, if the Government condemns part of a farm to build a highway, it has to pay the farmer for the value of his land. But if the Government requires that same farmer stop growing crops on that same land in order to protect endangered species or conserve wetlands, the farmer gets no compensation. In both situations the Government has acted to benefit the general public and, in the process, has imposed a cost on the farmer. In both cases, the land is taken out of production and the farmer loses income. But only in the highway example is the farmer compensated for his loss. In the regulatory example, the farmer, or any other landowner, has to absorb all of the cost himself. This is not fair. 
The legislation I am introducing today is an important step toward providing relief from these so-called regulatory takings. I know my distinguished colleague, Senator Hatch, intends to introduce an omnibus private property rights bill, and I look forward to working with him. My bill is a narrowly tailored approach that will make a real difference for property owners across America. It protects private property rights in two ways. First, it puts in place procedures that will stop or minimize takings by the Federal Government before they occur. The Government would have to jump a much higher hurdle before it can restrict the use of someone's privately owned property. For the first time, the Federal Government will have to determine in advance how its actions will impact the property owner, not just the wetland or the endangered species. This bill also would require the Federal Government to look for options other than restricting the use of private property to achieve its goal. 
Second, if heavy Government regulations diminish the value of private property, this bill would allow the landowners to plead their case in a Federal district court, instead of forcing them into the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. This means, for example, that Nebraskans can have their case heard in a Nebraska courthouse; they won't have to travel to Washington, DC, at their own expense to seek relief. This bill makes the process easier, less costly, and more accessible and accountable so all citizens can fully protect their property rights. 
For too long, Federal regulators have made private property owners bear the burdens and the costs of Government land use decisions. The result has been that real people suffer. 
Joe Jeffrey is a farmer in Lexington, NE. Like most Americans, he is proud of his land. He believed his property was his to use and control as he saw fit. 
Then he met the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Army Corps of Engineers. 
In 1987, the long arm of the Federal bureaucracy reached onto Mr. Jeffrey's property in the form of wetlands regulations. Mr. Jeffrey was notified that he had to destroy two dikes on his land because they were constructed without the proper permits. Nearly 2 years later, the corps partially changed its mind and allowed Mr. Jeffrey to reconstruct one of the dikes because the corps lacked authority to make him destroy it in the first place. 
Then floods damaged part of Mr. Jeffrey's irrigated pastureland and changed the normal water channel. Mr. Jeffrey set out to return the channel to its original course by moving sand that the flood had shifted. But the Government said `no.' The corps told him he had to give public notice before he could repair his own property. 
Then came the Endangered Species Act. 
Neither least terns nor piping plovers--both federally protected endangered species--have ever nested on Mr. Jeffrey's property. But that didn't stop the regulators. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service wanted to designate Mr. Jeffrey's property as `critical habitat' for these protected species. 
The bureaucrats could not even agree among themselves on what they wanted done. The Nebraska Department of Environmental Control wanted the area re-vegetated. But the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service wanted the area kept free of vegetation. Mr. Jeffrey was caught in the middle. 
This is a real regulatory horror story. And there's more. 
Today--10 years after his regulatory struggle began--Mr. Jeffrey is faced with eroded pastureland that cannot be irrigated and cannot be repaired without significant personal expense. The value of Mr. Jeffrey's land has been diminished by the Government's regulatory intrusion--but he has not been compensated. In fact, he has had to spend money from his own pocket to comply with the regulations. The Fish and Wildlife Service asked Mr. Jeffrey to modify his center pivot irrigation system to negotiate around the eroded area--at a personal cost of $20,000. And the issue is still not resolved. 
Mr. President, we do not need more stories like Joe Jeffrey's in America. Our Constitution guarantees our people's rights. Congress must act to uphold those rights and guarantee them in practice, not just in theory. Government regulation has gone too far. We must make it accountable to the people. Government should be accountable to the people, not the people accountable to the Government. 
What this issue comes down to is fairness. It is simply not fair and it is not right for the Federal Government to have the ability to restrict the use of privately owned property without compensating the owner. It violates the principles this country was founded on. This legislation puts some justice back into the system. It reins in regulatory agencies and gives the private property owner a voice in the process. It makes it easier for citizens to appeal any restrictions imposed on their land or property. It is the right thing to do. It is the just and fair thing to do.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I thank you. 
Mr. President, it was 30 years ago this week that I joined the U.S. Army. It was 29 years ago this week, with my brother Tom, that I was first wounded in Vietnam. This is an important week of reflection for me as we take up the final hours of debate on the Chemical Weapons Convention. 
I rise this morning to say that I will vote for the Chemical Weapons Convention. America's national security interests are better served with this treaty than without it. Our men and women in uniform are better served with this treaty than without it. 
There are few Senators who have put as much time in on this issue than I have, studying this treaty over the past few weeks. As a freshman Senator, I began with very limited knowledge about this convention. I had to understand it totally before I could make an intelligent vote on the treaty. 
This treaty is much improved from the form in which it was first submitted to the Senate. I would have voted against this treaty in its original form. 
But as the Framers of our Constitution intended, the Senate has worked its will and has substantially strengthened the final agreement. Because of the strong leadership and negotiation, in my judgment, the balance has tipped strongly in favor of ratification of this convention. 
The people of this country should recognize the important roles that Majority Leader Lott, Chairman Helms, and Senators Biden, Lugar, and Kyl played in this debate. They allowed the Senate the opportunity to listen, to learn, and to understand this treaty, to debate this treaty, and they have brought a more informed Senate together to vote on this treaty as we will throughout the day. 
That is what this body, the Senate, should be about, debating important issues that have consequences for all Americans. This convention will have consequences for all peoples around the globe. 
Under the leadership of Majority Leader Lott, Senator Biden, the administration, and others, the Senate made 28 substantial changes to the original treaty to address major problems in the treaty, several of which were key to improving it, in my opinion. The majority leader held a news conference 45 minutes ago and read a letter from the President--as far as I know, unprecedented in arms control conventions--laying out some of the concerns that this President has and this body has about issues in this convention. I think that, too, further strengthens this treaty. 
We fully protected the constitutional rights of our businesses against unlawful searches and seizures by ensuring that international inspection teams must obtain a search warrant before entering any American facility. This means no challenge inspection will occur unless a U.S. Federal judge finds probable cause to believe a violation of law has occurred at that facility. The rights guaranteed under our Constitution will continue to reign supreme. 
We ensured that the American military will be able to use nondeadly riot control agents, such as tear gas. As military operations become increasingly complex and involve more areas with civilian populations, it is imperative that our military commanders have the maximum flexibility to employ a range of force, including nondeadly force. 
We made clear that our existing national and international export controls will remain in place. The United States simply will not transfer chemical technology in any manner that would weaken our existing controls or military defense capabilities, or would tend to allow dangerous chemical technology to fall into the hands of pariah regimes. 
We put in place safeguards to ensure that American intelligence data is protected whenever it is shared with the international organization that will oversee operations of the convention. We also prohibited chemical samples taken at American laboratories from being transferred off American soil--an important provision that helps protect proprietary and security information. 
And, we took steps to ensure that the new international organization set up to monitor and enforce the convention will not become an ill-managed bureaucracy that burdens the American taxpayer. We put a cap on the American contribution to that organization, and we required the organization to establish and maintain an independent inspector general. 
I should like to close with this. As I have referenced, there are a number of improvements that have been made to this treaty. We have five more proposed conditions that remain in disagreement that we will vote on yet today. I will vote to strike at least four of those conditions because they would effectively prevent American participation in the convention and would undermine the very purpose of this treaty. 
This treaty, however, is no magic instrument that will guarantee Americans and our troops safety from chemical attack. No treaty can substitute for unwavering American strength, determination, vigilance, and leadership. But this treaty is one more tool we can use to make chemical attacks less likely. It does improve our eyes. 
With or without this treaty, the United States years ago decided never again to use chemical weapons and is committed by law to completely destroy our stockpile of chemical weapons by early in the next century. That decision was made during the Reagan administration and was reaffirmed by the Bush administration. 
The important question now is, what can we do to give ourselves more leverage to press other countries to do the same? It is a very important question. Ratifying this treaty is not the end of our efforts to make chemical attacks on Americans less likely. To the contrary, it is only the beginning. As President Reagan's top arms control negotiator, Ronald Lehman, said last week before our Foreign Relations Committee: 
Ratification is essential to American leadership against proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, but ratification alone is not enough. Strong follow-up involving all branches of Government will be vital. 
We must now use the tools of this treaty effectively. The treaty tools give us, I believe, the most effective way to deal with the proliferation of chemical weapons. We must keep America strong. We must keep America vigilant. The Senate has an important and ongoing role to play in making sure this treaty is implemented properly, and I am committed as a Senator to making that happen. 
For me, this has never been a political issue, Mr. President. This vote is not about Republicans. It is not about Democrats. It is not about conservatives, not about liberals. It is not about Bill Clinton. It is not about Trent Lott. This vote is about America's national security interests. It is about our young men and women in uniform all over the world who may someday face an adversary with chemical weapons. It is about each Senator doing what he or she thinks is in the best interests of our country. 
For those reasons, Mr. President, I urge our colleagues to vote for ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention. 
I yield my time.  
Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, we are engaged in an important debate--a debate about privacy, liberty, and the role of Government in our lives. The American people want less Government, less regulation and less taxes. They want less hassle and more respect from their Government. 
I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the Taxpayer Privacy Protection Act, which was introduced by my distinguished colleague from Georgia, Senator Coverdell. The Senate will vote on this important legislation later today, and I urge all of my colleagues to support it. 
As the April 15 income tax deadline approaches each year, Americans rush to file their returns while wading through a paper storm of tax forms that even some tax lawyers have trouble understanding. During tax season, animus for the IRS reaches its peak as taxpayers are reminded what an intrusive, overbearing bureaucracy the Internal Revenue Service has become. 
Nobody likes taxes, and nobody likes tax collectors. They are necessary evils. But if we must have them, then we need to do all we can to ease the burden they impose on our citizens and to make the system user-friendly and respectful of our people. 
The IRS system today is neither user-friendly nor respectful. Today we have an IRS that is out of control from top management all the way down to its field offices, and the American taxpayers are paying the price for that disarray--a price in inefficiency, inconvenience, intrusiveness, and even harassment. 
The American people deserve better. It is bad enough that taxpayers have to pay for an agency that wastes their money and time. But it is simply unacceptable that the IRS has tolerated some of its employees snooping through confidential taxpayer information. 
The headlines of our newspapers have been littered with accounts of IRS employees reading taxpayers' confidential files without authority and without cause. During fiscal years 1994 and 1995, there were 1,515 cases of IRS employees browsing through confidential taxpayer computer records, according to a recent General Accounting Office report. These employees violated the privacy of hundreds of taxpayers when they snooped through the tax returns of friends, family member or celebrities without authorization and without justification. 
Yet, of those 1,515 cases of snooping, only 844 resulted in employees being fired, disciplined, or counseled. 
Let me emphasize that, Mr. President--only 844 of the 1,515 snoops had action taken against them. That means almost 700 known cases of snooping went unpunished. 
This is not acceptable. Unauthorized snooping is wrong and intolerable. That is why the laws need to be changed. 
The Taxpayer Privacy Protection Act imposes civil and criminal penalties against IRS employees who snoop through tax returns and related information without authority. It puts real power in the hands of taxpayers who are the victims of IRS snooping--it lets them bring suit against the IRS employee who is responsible. Under this legislation, IRS employees can be fired, fined, and jailed if they are found guilty of snooping. 
This bill is an important step toward protecting Americans from an out of control IRS. It is an important step toward holding IRS employees accountable for their actions. It is a small but important step toward making our tax system respectful, trustworthy, and sound. 
It should become law--now.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my distinguished colleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin, to introduce legislation that will cut taxes and improve access to health insurance for millions of small business owners and farmers across America. 
Our legislation--the Health Insurance Tax Equity for Self-Employed Act--is a bill about fairness. Under current law, corporations can deduct from their income tax the full amount of money spent on health care for their employees. But the 10 1/2 million self-employed men and women in America cannot fully deduct what they spend on their own health care. They can deduct a percentage--which is now 40 percent and will increase to 80 percent by 2006--but they cannot deduct the entire cost. 
Our bill would immediately eliminate this disadvantage--effective January 1, 1997--and put the self-employed on the same footing with their incorporated competitors. And it would make health insurance more affordable for the 3 million uninsured Americans who are self-employed. 
This bill will make a real difference to real people. The high cost of health insurance was the No. 1 problem that small businesses cited in a recent comprehensive study by the National Federation of Independent Businesses [NFIB]. Small business owners often pay 30 percent more for the cost of their health insurance than do larger companies--they pay more, but they can deduct less. 
Our bill will make health insurance more affordable for small business owners. That is why it has been endorsed by the National Federation of Independent Businesses. 
It also is strongly supported by the National Farm Bureau and by the Nebraska Farm Bureau Federation. Both have sent me letters endorsing this legislation. I ask unanimous consent that the full text of these be submitted for the Record.

Mr. HAGEL. More than 95 percent of farmers and ranchers are self-employed and generally pay the full cost of their insurance coverage themselves. Our bill makes a real difference to them as well. 
I am involved in this issue because it is vitally important to my home State of Nebraska. There are 98,000 self-employed people in Nebraska, of whom more than 10,000 are uninsured. These are real numbers. These are real people. This legislation can make a real difference for them--making their health insurance more affordable and their businesses more profitable. 
Every State in America has hardworking, self-employed men and women who need the tax relief and health care assistance this bill offers. I hope my colleagues will support this important effort.

Mr. HAGEL. Madam President, I wish to thank my distinguished colleague and fellow tax cutter, the distinguished Senator from Wyoming. 
The people of the United States are drowning in a sea of taxes. Reducing the tax burden on the American taxpayer was a principal reason I ran for the U.S. Senate last year. Tax relief is a top priority for my State, for Nebraskans, and I believe for all Americans. We must make it a top priority in this Congress. We must make it a top priority in this Congress for the American people. 
American taxpayers are honest, hard-working people. They deserve to reap and to keep the benefits of their labors. Yet, the typical American family pays more in taxes than it spends on food, clothing and shelter combined. 
On average, nearly 40 percent of income goes for taxes; 28 percent goes for those other necessities of life. I say other necessities because it seems in America today taxes are considered a necessity, a more important necessity than food, shelter, and clothing. These numbers are according to the Tax Foundation. 
That is not what our forebears envisioned for America. That is not the freedom that so many of our people have fought, sacrificed, and died to defend. That is not the America we want to leave our children and our grandchildren. Our people, Madam President, deserve better. The American people want less Government, less regulation, less spending, and less taxes. It is time for our leaders, the leaders of this body, the leaders of the Congress of the United States of America to act on America's wishes. It is time for significant tax relief. 
Tomorrow is tax day 1997. We must make change happen. We must provide the leadership to make tax relief happen now. The heavy burden of taxes must be taken off the American people so they can enjoy the life they work hard to provide their families and not have to worry if they will have enough to be able to survive financially. 
As we look down the road into the next generation, we know by any scoring of the budget that unless we make drastic changes in our spending habits, spending habits that now have given this country a $5.3 trillion debt, and we add $700 million a day to that debt, if we do not change those spending habits and out of control fiscal policy in this country, we know one thing: that within 10 years, every dollar in the Federal budget will be consumed by four programs--interest on the national debt and entitlements. There will be not $1 for national defense, for roads, for scholarships, for the environment--not $1. It will go to pay interest, not even the principal, interest on the national debt and for entitlements. 
This is the modern challenge. This is the modern challenge to our ongoing quest to secure life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness for all Americans. We need to look to the future, we need to look seriously to the future, and we need to look to the future now. We need to completely overhaul our present Tax Code. It is a sham, it is ridiculous, it is an embarrassment. 
Our system is too complicated, too punitive and too unfair. We need to make it flatter, fairer and simple, and we need to get at it now. We need to look at all the options as we tackle this issue, but we must make sure that a new Tax Code eases the burden on the American taxpayer and encourages--encourages--rather than inhibits or destroys growth, investment, and savings. Growth, investment and savings, that is our future. That is how we pay down this debt. That is how we continue to give generation after generation in this country real opportunities, like my generation has had and every preceding generation has had. 
We have a very important stewardship here. This is a stewardship about fiscal responsibility, that our children and our grandchildren inherit something worth inheriting, not a mound of debt, not a concern that they will not have an opportunity to buy a home or send their children to college. We must ensure that the American taxpayer is treated fairly and that any new tax system is managed correctly. The people who enforce our tax system must always--always--act with respect for taxpaying men and women. We need a smaller, leaner, more responsive Government. Americans are willing to pay for the Government they need, but they are not willing to keep paying for the oversized, overreaching Government that we now have. 
The Omaha World Herald, the State daily newspaper in my State of Nebraska, recently put the case very well, and I quote from the Omaha World Herald:  
Taxation isn't evil. Without it, the Constitution's mandate of providing for the common defense and promoting the general welfare might well go unfulfilled. But there's a point at which too much taxation makes Government the master of the people instead of their servant. 
Let me repeat that. 
There's a point at which too much taxation makes Government the master of the people instead of their servant. That point comes nearer each year that Government figuratively gobbles up more of the workday for its own needs, leaving Americans less time to support themselves and provide for their families. 
Today, the typical worker works 2 hours 49 minutes of each 8-hour work day just to pay taxes at every level of government. That is almost three times as high as it was in 1930 when it took only 1 hour each day to earn enough to pay taxes at every level of government. This trend will continue until something is done. 
The time for tax relief is now. If we fail to provide that relief, our economy will weaken--it surely will weaken--our 
people will suffer and our role in a global economy will be lessened, and just at a time when America should be leading the world into a grand hopeful new century, a century that should be full of promise and hope and opportunity. We will have to forfeit the leadership and the opportunities that should be there for our young people. But if we meet the challenge, we will open the door to an exciting new era in America and the world. 
This country is great, not because of its Government, not because of the country; the Government is great and the people are great and the Nation is great because of our culture, because of our people. Let's not hold our people back from their potential with a heavier and heavier tax burden. But rather, let's allow our citizens to flourish, prosper and soar, just as we have done in this country for over 200 years. Americans deserve tax relief. I intend to do all I can to make that happen. We need tax cuts and spending cuts now. 
Madam President, I thank you for the time, and I yield the floor. 
Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.

Mr. HAGEL. Thank you, Mr. President. I will be very mindful of my distinguished colleagues' time. I too want to add my thoughts and thanks to my distinguished colleague from New Hampshire and fellow Vietnam veterans. 
Mr. President, I join my colleagues tonight in confirming former Congressman Pete Peterson to be our Nation's Ambassador to the socialist Republic of Vietnam. Through his integrity, hard work, and bipartisan temperament, he has earned the highest possible regard of his former colleagues in Congress on both sides of the aisle, and I think that is evident tonight. 
I can think of no other American better suited to be the first United States Ambassador to Vietnam, and I know, as do my colleagues, that Congressman Peterson will bring his integrity and unique personal experiences to this extraordinarily challenging job which we all wish him well with and we all will help him with. 
As a Vietnam veteran, as my colleagues here in the Chamber, I know well how the issue of Vietnam has for so long divided this country, but all the Senate Vietnam veterans agree that not only is it time for the United States to have an Ambassador to Vietnam, we also agree that Congressman Peterson, soon to be Ambassador Peterson, is an outstanding choice for this difficult assignment. 
A small minority of Americans continue to question whether this is appropriate, whether it is an appropriate time in United States-Vietnam relations to have a United States Ambassador in Hanoi, and certainly those views deserve respect. Personally, however, I believe that the time for healing has, indeed, arrived, and Congressman Peterson is the one to lead us in that direction. 
Congressman Peterson will bring not only his own experience to the POW Vietnam combat veteran, but he also has been a successful businessman and respected Member of Congress, the recipient of 18 military medals including the Legion of Merit, two Purple Hearts. He is a man of great personal strength and mind with something missing for too long in this business, a quiet dignity, a quiet confidence, a respect for others. 
Clearly, President Clinton has chosen well with his nomination, and I am pleased to join with my colleagues in confirming Pete Peterson to be the first United States Ambassador to a united Vietnam. 
On a personal note, Mr. President, I might add I bring him greetings from his family and his friends in Nebraska. The Congressman was off to a good start early on in life; he was born in Omaha, NE, and still has many relatives and friends there. And so that gives him probably an unfair advantage to be a most unusual and a most effective Ambassador for this country, and we wish him well. 
Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I thank my distinguished colleague from Massachusetts and fellow Vietnam veteran for allowing me a little of his time. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, the American people are fed up with the IRS and its tactics. They are calling for change. Today I have taken a first step to help. I am joining as a cosponsor of S. 365, the Internal Revenue Service Accountability Act, which was introduced by my distinguished colleague from Georgia, Senator Coverdell. 
The IRS is in disarray from its top management all the way down to its field offices, and American taxpayers are paying the price for that disarray--a price in inefficiency, in inconvenience, in intrusiveness, and even in harassment. It is not fair for American taxpayers to fund an agency that is wasting their money and time. It is time to clean up the IRS. It is time for a change. 
The IRS Accountability Act puts a tight rein on the IRS and its agents. It makes IRS agents personally accountable for their actions and subjects them to criminal prosecution if they abuse their authority by harassing taxpayers. The bill makes it a crime to release information from tax returns without proper authority. It restricts the ability of the IRS to conduct audits. It ensures that the IRS will abide by court decisions against it. And it ensures that taxpayers have a chance to correct any honest mistakes on their tax forms without incurring a penalty. 
American taxpayers are honest, hard workers. They do not deserve an overzealous agency with its agents tormenting and harassing them. It is time to make the IRS more accountable for its actions. 
This bill is an important first step toward protecting Americans from a Tax Code that is unfair, restrictive, punitive, and complicated. We need to do more. We need to completely overhaul our Tax Code to make it flatter, fairer, and simpler. We need to look at all options as we tackle this issue, but we must make sure that a new Tax Code eases the burden for families and businesses and encourages, rather than inhibits, growth, investment, and savings. That should be our top priority. 
That is our task for the coming months and years. But until we can successfully meet that greater challenge, the very least we can do for the American taxpayer is to get the IRS cleaned up and off the taxpayers' backs. 
The time has come for tax relief. The people of the United States have had enough. They want less government, less regulation, and less taxes. And they want less hassle and harassment from their Government. The IRS Accountability Act is a good start. As we approach tax day, April 15, it is only appropriate that we take a bold step toward fixing the IRS. 
The time for change is now.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today as an original cosponsor of the legislation introduced by my distinguished colleague from Kansas, Senator Brownback. This bill is an important step toward opening foreign markets to American products--especially our agricultural products. 
Several countries have State Trading Enterprises that control all imports of certain products. These trading enterprises create a bottleneck in trade--a bottleneck controlled by the Government, not by free enterprise. The result is that foreign politics end up controlling trade decisions, and American exporters get hurt. 
This bill would require the United States to oppose membership in the World Trade Organization for any country that has a State Trading Enterprise that refuses to buy our products for reasons other than market conditions. Its purpose is simple: It gives America leverage against countries that shut out our exporters for political reasons. 
This is important for all of America's exporters, who benefit from having a level playing field. It is especially important for American farmers. This bill will give our negotiators an important new tool to use as they oppose the unjustified actions of State trading enterprises around the world. It will help us get American dairy products into New Zealand and American wheat into Canada. 
But its most important effect will be in regard to China. China is an enormous and growing market. As China emerges economically, we must do all we can to bring China into the world trading system as a full partner. If we want our exporters to do business in China's emerging market, we need to ensure that China plays by all the rules of trade that govern the rest of the world. 
The discussions about China's accession to the World Trade Organization are ongoing. I strongly believe China must accept all obligations that WTO membership entails. That includes letting the market, not the politicians, control its trading decisions. China must dismantle its remaining State Trading Enterprises--especially the enterprise that controls the import of wheat into the country. 
American farmers--especially our wheat producers--need full and free access to China's market. This bill gives our trade negotiators a small but important tool to help ensure that will happen. 
I urge my colleagues to support it.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senate Joint Resolution 22, asking that an independent counsel be appointed to investigate the alleged illegal fundraising activities in the 1996 Presidential campaign. 
It is in the best interest of both the Nation and the Congress that an independent counsel be appointed. In light of the continued severity of the allegations that arise on a nearly daily basis, this is the only way to properly investigate wrongdoing and prosecute where laws were broken. The requests for an independent counsel have been bipartisan. I have twice written Attorney General Janet Reno and asked that an independent counsel be appointed. To date, I have not received a reply. 
We need an independent counsel to supplement congressional hearings. Only an independent counsel has the power to bring charges against those alleged of breaking the law. Congress will investigate, as we should--that is our responsibility--but we need someone looking into this with the ability to prosecute. 
I also fear whether Congress will be able to bear the entire responsibility for investigating these alleged campaign finance abuses and still act on the important issues awaiting our attention. We were elected by the people to address the challenges facing America. We were elected to solve problems. 
As we look forward to the 21st century, America is faced with serious challenges. Domestically, we must come to terms with our Federal budgetary problems, our national debt, the burden of taxes and regulations, the threat of crime, the explosive growth projected in entitlement programs. Internationally, we need to reshape a foreign policy, a foreign policy that will guide us through the uncharted and potentially treacherous waters of the post-cold-war era. This is a time of great hope, a time of great promise for the world. The fulfillment of this hope and promise will come only if America demonstrates bold, imaginative leadership, leadership that seizes the moment. 
Determining the direction our Nation will take beyond the year 2000 is a very critical debate, 
one that all the Nation should be involved with. The issues involved require and deserve the full attention of this body. We must not be held hostage by partisan bickering over campaign finance investigations and daily allegations of political wrongdoing. 
For example, Medicare's slide into bankruptcy will not wait for a determination of whether campaign finance laws were broken in last year's Presidential campaign. Action needs to be taken now to save Medicare, or America's seniors will pay the price. 
If we allow the poison of political retribution and revenge to dominate the Congress, we will never be able to work together on these very important issues. The congressional hearings are important. Surely they are important. Surely they must go forward. But we need to get to the bottom of this mess. At the same time, we cannot allow these hearings to overshadow the present challenges facing this body. 
Political leaders frequently express their dismay at the lack of confidence and trust the American people have in them and in all political institutions. However, we bring it on ourselves when the image we present to the American people is one of constant partisan wrangling and bitter accusations. 
When we allow our system to become polarized and paralyzed, the American people have to wonder who is on the job, who is looking out for their interests, who is governing America. 
The American people are tired of the lack of civility and the inflammatory rhetoric that too frequently dominate the political discourse in Washington. They are tired of the gridlock that results when both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue put political considerations before the Nation's business. The American people want action. They want their elected representatives to give their full attention to the challenges facing this country. They deserve nothing less. 
The destiny and legacy of our people is that we have always risen to meet the challenges put before us. As we lead America and the world into the 21st century, we must build on this legacy. Big challenges lie ahead. We fail our children and the children of the world if we allow ourselves to become bogged down in political intrigue and fail to address these important issues now. 
Criminal investigations should be taken out of politics. Prosecuting wrongdoing should be done without regard to politics. The Attorney General needs to appoint an independent counsel now. 
I thank the Chair and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the constitutional amendment offered by my distinguished colleague from South Carolina. Allow me to say how much I respect my friend Senator Hollings and the years of service he has given to this great body and to America. During this time he has seen more than his share of scandals and has surely grown tired of and frustrated with what seems to be almost daily revelations of political wrongdoing. My argument is not with the Senator's motives or his quest for a better campaign finance system. I think we all agree with that. My argument is with this particular solution. 
In many ways it could not be more fitting for this body to begin the important debate over campaign finance reform than with this proposed constitutional amendment. As my colleague Senator Enzi said, by proposing a constitutional amendment, my distinguished colleague from South Carolina concedes what many who support restricting political speech fail to recognize: that denying an American citizen his or her constitutional right to contribute to a candidate of choice requires a fundamental rewriting of our country's most sacred document, our Constitution. 
I hope that my colleagues who support this measure will take pause and recognize the significance of what they intend to do. In particular, I hope that my colleagues who support this measure will realize, as Senator Enzi noted, the irony of the fact that less than 2 weeks ago this body killed a constitutional amendment that would have ensured our citizens and future generations a balanced Federal budget. Now, some of my colleagues wish to pass a constitutional amendment that would restrict one of our most basic constitutional rights--freedom of speech. 
The people know that we do not need to amend our Constitution, we need to amend our ways. We need to amend ourselves. 
Mr. President, I, like all of my colleagues, am concerned about corruption in our political system. And I believe this Congress will find ways to improve upon our campaign finance system. But, like corruption in any organization or system, it is the people who are corrupt, not the system. Why do we blame the system and excuse the violators? 
Where is the outrage with those who subvert the system and deliberately break the rules and laws already in place? 
The fact is, we already have campaign finance laws. We have a Federal Election Commission to enforce those laws. We do not need to continually add more layers of laws, regulations, and bureaucracy and pass those off to the American people as solutions to the problem. We need to deal severely with those who break the law and violate the trust and confidence the people have placed in them. We need to make certain those who seek public office and their campaign teams follow the current law and we need full and complete disclosure of all campaign receipts and expenditures for and against candidates, by candidates' campaigns, and by all political bodies. 
I do not believe we need to pass a constitutional amendment restricting the rights of our citizens. We need to focus on individual violations of current law. We need to focus on individual conduct and behavior, individual responsibility and accountability. I have often said to my colleagues, if each of us in public office conducted our campaigns--every aspect of our campaigns--in a manner that our constituents could be proud of, then we would not be engaged in this debate about campaign finance reform. 
I listened with interest to the political posturing and spins of the White House over the weekend and was amused but, more honestly, dismayed by what seemed to be an attitude of the end justifying the means. As the Wall Street Journal rightly noted in an editorial yesterday: 
Public life . . . is about mainly one thing--the law--the rules that all consent to abide by and enforce so that life can be civil. 
The role of a public servant, Mr. President, is to protect the laws and make sure they are being followed for the good of society. Our role is not to bend, mold, stretch or interpret the law to our own benefit or arrogantly disregard it in order to achieve a goal of our own making that we may find more noble than others. That is not what we are about. 
If it seems that we have heard this all before it's because we have. Senator Hollings knows that. That is why Senator Hollings has taken the floor, trying to resolve this issue. For decades, we have debated important social issues such as crime and welfare, and that violations of our laws were really not the responsibility of individuals--it was the system that we needed to fix. Individual accountability really was not very important. Life was unfair. `If we truly want to find a solution to all of our problems,' many argued `then we should glide over individual responsibility and focus on how we can change the system.' More laws, more rules, more regulation. 
Where is the outrage with men and women who have gained the public trust but violated it by not being held to the highest ethical and moral standards? What we are too often lacking is leadership and doing the right thing. We have the laws, we have the regulations, we have the enforcement mechanism. But we do not always have leaders who do the right thing. 
Mr. President, have we so lowered our standards and expectations in politics and society that the only way we can think to curtail individual wrongdoing is by amending the constitution? I refuse to accept that. I think we are better than that. This country, this society, our people are better than that. 
Where is the outrage over individuals who break the law and refuse to take responsibility for their actions? Where are the voices demanding personal responsibility and accountability? I believe that for too long we have been creating a society less dependent on the voluntary rule of good behavior by the citizen than on the oppressive mandate of Government. 
We must not be swayed by the emotion of the moment, or the pundits and politicians who would rather lead us down a dangerous path of restricting everyone's rights than have the courage to just do the right thing. The proposed constitutional amendment before us today would be an enormous step in the wrong direction for a society that has already become too dependent on regulation and procedure, and too little influenced by the behavior of its individual citizens. 
The goal of meaningful campaign finance reform should be to involve more people in the political process--not to curtail their constitutional rights. 
More than two centuries ago, the Framers of our Constitution set out to build a nation dedicated to government by consent of the governed. That Constitution draws its power from only one source: `We the people.' 
For two centuries, we the people have shaped this Nation and made it great. 
For two centuries, we the people have chosen our leaders from among ourselves and have held them to the highest standards. 
For two centuries, we the people have taken responsibility for the Federal Government of the United States of America. 
I sought the privilege to serve in the U.S. Senate with some of my distinguished colleagues like Senator Hollings, because I want to take power and authority away from the Government and return it to the people. I cannot support any proposal that seeks to limit the ability of the people to speak--and takes the power to shape our public debate away from the public and gives it to the Government. That is what this debate is about. 
In Buckley versus Valeo, the Supreme Court ruled that the debate about campaign finances is about the fundamental role of the people in our democratic society. The Court wrote:  
In the free society ordained by our Constitution, it is not the government, but the people--individually as citizens and candidates and collectively as associations and political committees--who must retain control over the quantity and range of debate on public issues in a political campaign. 
Mr. President, the system has not failed us. Our problems stem from a failure of leadership. I am outraged, not by the system, but by the deplorable conduct of those few men and women who abuse it. That is what outrages the American people. 
Before we reform the Constitution, we should first look at how we might reform ourselves. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.

 Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today as an original cosponsor of the Congressional Responsibility Act. I commend my distinguished colleague from Kansas, Senator Brownback, for his leadership on this matter. 
This legislation is an important step toward restoring the intent of our Constitution's framers that Congress--not the executive branch--makes the law. For too long, unelected bureaucrats in Federal departments and agencies have issued rules and regulations that have the force of law but that have never been deliberated by the people's elected representatives in Congress. That's not democracy. That's not accountability. America is not supposed to work that way. 
We all know stories of Federal regulations run amok. We know of rules that make no sense, of regulations whose costs far outweigh their benefits, of rules that either don't solve the problem or prove worse than doing nothing at all. 
Time and again, these senseless regulations hurt real people--people who expect accountability from their Government. Regulations have become one of the largest burdens on America's small businesses, farmers, ranchers, and private property owners. If Americans are to maintain faith in our democracy, the onslaught of regulation must be stopped. 
Of course, Congress is not perfect either--but at least we are accountable to the people. That is why the Framers intended that Congress would make laws, and the executive branch would only carry them out. Regulatory agencies should interpret the laws passed by Congress--not make laws of their own. That is why we need to restore the Constitution's intended separation of powers. 
This legislation would do just that. It would prevent any Federal regulation from taking effect until Congress votes on it. In essence, it transforms the Federal regulators into Federal advisors--suggesting regulations that Congress may or may not approve. 
Last year, Congress enacted the Congressional Review Act, which permitted Congress to review major Federal regulations. That was an important first step. This legislation we are introducing today goes a step beyond that--it requires Congress to approve all federal regulations. If Congress does not approve, the regulators cannot regulate. 
Mr. President, this bill is an important tool to return accountability to the regulatory process. This is about cutting Government and renewing the basic principle of our democracy--that the people, through their elected representatives, control the Government, and not the other way around. 
I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this legislation, and I urge all of my colleagues to support it.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I ran for the Senate because I wanted to help strengthen America's future. I, like my colleagues here, want to help solve problems. America is reaching out for leadership to put our fiscal house in order. 
When we debate the budget, we are debating America's future, the future we leave for our children and our grandchildren--the opportunities they will have, the burdens in debt they will inherit, the America they will know. 
Balancing the budget must be our top priority, not because we have some abstract fascination with accounting but because the future of every man, woman, and child hangs in the balance. The future of our very liberty is at stake. 
That is why I strongly supported the proposed balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, an amendment that would have forced Congress to make the hard choices and set priorities, priorities that we have for too long avoided. Despite the support of all my Republican and 11 of my Democratic colleagues, the Senate last week defeated the balanced budget amendment. We lost by one vote. 
President Kennedy told us three decades ago that real leaders `are not here to curse the darkness but to light a candle.' Without the balanced budget amendment, we are still looking for a candle to guide us to a balanced budget. Now more than ever we need leadership for America's future. 
However, when I read the President's budget, I do not like the future I see. This budget offers a future that continues to pile up more and more and more debt. The President's proposal keeps running deficits for as far as the eye can see. Next year, the President's budget actually increases the deficit by more than $25 billion. That is not acceptable. 
Three weeks ago, I, along with 23 of my colleagues, sent a letter to the majority leader. As we told the leader, `A path to a balanced budget should be just that--a path on which the deficit decreases every year in as near equal amounts as possible until the year 2002,' the year of a balanced budget. 
The President has chosen another path. At the end of his path, there is still a pool of red ink. The Congressional Budget Office says the budget that the President has submitted is still $70 billion in the red in the year 2002. That is $70 billion, Mr. President, in the red in the year 2002. That is a far cry from responsible, balanced fiscal policy. That is a far cry from the balanced budget the President promised us. And it gets worse. 
The President's budget offers a future where we put off tough choices until `tomorrow.' We all know that in the world of the Federal budget `tomorrow' never comes. Our $5.3 trillion debt is proof enough of that fact. We have to act today if we are to balance the budget and save programs like Social Security and Medicare for years to come. 
We need to act today if we are to save programs that protect education and the environment. We need to act today if we want to maintain a strong national defense that will preserve our children's freedom as it has preserved ours. We need to act today if we care about tomorrow. 
The President's budget does not act today. The truth is it does not act at all; it is a fraud, and the people need to know it is a fraud. Mr. President, 98.5 percent of the deficit reduction in the President's budget comes in the last 2 years of his 7-year plan--98.5 percent. Those are not my figures. Those numbers come from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Does anybody here remember the President's first State of the Union Address when he promised to rely on CBO's figures? Well, the CBO has spoken. It says the President's numbers just do not add up. 
The President's plan is very clear. He plans to put off the tough and painful choices until he is out of office and somebody else will have to make them. That is not leadership. That is business as usual. That is disaster. 
But even that is not all. The President's budget offers a future where taxes go up and families must work harder to have less. The President may put off real deficit reduction until later, but he does not procrastinate when it comes to raising taxes, for example. Despite the President's claim that he will cut taxes, the Joint Committee on Taxation reports that the budget the President has submitted will result in a net increase in taxes of $23 billion over the next 10 years. There is no tax cut. This budget includes at least 39 specific tax increases, and they are permanent. By contrast, those tax cuts that the President proposes expire by the year 2002. The bottom line is simple: The President's tax cuts are temporary and conditional, but his new tax increases are permanent. That is fraudulent. That is wrong. 
Last week, 13 of my colleagues joined me in a second letter to the majority leader. We made it very clear to the leader that we will not vote for any budget plan that increases taxes. Any solution to our budget problems that relies on tax increases is really no solution at all; it is just more debt. 
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan testified recently before the Senate Banking Committee that `Ultimately, you cannot solve long-term deficits from the receipt side.' He added, `It's got to be from the expenditure side.' That means cut spending. 
That is why we are here. I came to Washington, as did many of my colleagues, to cut spending, cut taxes and cut Government. We came to take power and authority away from the Federal Government and return it to the States and to the people. We did not come to destroy. We came to renew, to renew the American dream for future generations of Americans, to renew the freedom that made this Nation great and kept it strong. 
The President's budget does none of this. It increases spending. It increases taxes. It increases the power of the Federal Government. 
This body must be about the work of the future, not the past. It is immoral for us to mortgage our children's and grandchildren's future. The truth is the future begins now. It is in our hands. It is time for us to lead. We must balance the budget with a real balanced budget. 
Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I yield back my time.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, this is about leadership. The balanced budget amendment to the Constitution is about the future of this country. It is about bold leadership. It is about stepping up to the challenges that face our Nation and what kind of country we are going to leave to our children and to our grandchildren. 
This is about doing the right thing. This is not about esoteric, theoretical, and academic issues. This is not about deferring more of the same that we have deferred for almost 50 years in this country. This is about stepping up to the real challenges that affect real people that will have a lasting impact on this country. If we do not provide the bold, dynamic leadership that this country requires, then we will pay a heavy price in the future for our inaction. Our children and our grandchildren will pay a very high price. They will pay a price that will restrict their opportunities, restrict their future, and restrict the future of our Nation and the good this country can do for the rest of the world and for our people over the next 25 to 50 years. 
For those reasons, I strongly support this constitutional amendment to balance the budget.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today to address a very important issue for our Nation's men and women in uniform, an issue that you and I have spoken about. 
A recent article in the Omaha World Herald detailed problems that Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska, headquarters for the Strategic Command, is having with the condition of military housing on that base. I would like to read just a few paragraphs from this story. This is a story all too familiar, Mr. President, especially to you as our distinguished leader in the Armed Services Committee. This is a quote from the Omaha World Herald story: 
Staff Sgt. Tony Suprenant and his wife, Karen, never thought that life in the United States Air Force meant they would get a palatial estate to call home. But the cramped and drafty townhouse that was offered to them when they arrived at Offutt Air Force Base last year was more of a sacrifice than they were willing to make. 
The two-bedroom home was so small that it would not hold the modest amount of furniture they had gathered during their 7 years together on five bases. Offutt officials eventually found a more spacious and recently refurbished three-bedroom home for the couple and their 2-year-old daughter, Emily. Not every family at that base is so lucky. 
Many of the 2,600 Offutt families who live in base housing must cope with cramped conditions and an array of maintenance headaches--frozen pipes, leaky basements, difficulty in heating and cooling--that have only increased with time and heavy use. 
Sadly, Mr. President, this is a problem that extends across the country and throughout all branches of our military throughout the world. It is a problem that we are not addressing as a nation, as a Congress. This is shameful. Like America's strength, our military strength is its people--the men and women and their families who have committed their lives to protecting the freedoms of this country. 
The Pentagon has estimated that they have problems with a majority of its 350,000 military housing units all over the world. In the Omaha World Herald article, Pete Potochney, who works in the Pentagon office overseeing military housing, is quoted as saying:  
We would consider a lot of our houses as being unsuitable. 
The Pentagon is devoting $680 million in the 1998 budget proposal to fix these houses. However, at that rate of spending, it will take the Pentagon more than 30 years to fix all of the housing that need fixing. 
Mr. President, the men and women who wear the uniform of the United States should not have to wait 30 years for adequate housing for their families. At the rate we are currently making progress, it is a rate that is being made on this issue far too slowly, and most, if not all, of our current military personnel will never live in decent housing at this rate. 
The Clinton administration has repeatedly proposed budget cuts and more budget cuts for our Nation's defense and our military. The President's national defense budget request for fiscal year 1998 is $2.9 billion less in budget authority than the level in the congressional budget resolution and $3.6 billion less in outlays. Moreover, the President's budget proposes a decrease of 16 percent for military construction in housing for our families. 
Military officials estimate they have problems with a majority of our military housing units, and yet the President has suggested reducing the funding for this program by 16 percent. He also proposes a decrease in the military personnel account. 
Where is the commitment in this budget to the men and women who wear our Nation's uniform? These men and women may be asked to put their lives on the line at any time, and yet we offer them inadequate housing and pay below the poverty line. 
This is wrong, Mr. President. This is very wrong. We are not taking care of our people in the military. If we do not reverse this trend, our national security will suffer. 
This is a readiness issue, just as it is a quality-of-life issue. Our troops are being deployed for longer periods of time, with more time away from their families and for more missions. We are asking more and more from our service men and women and their families. 
I ask my colleagues to place themselves in the position of a young enlisted person stationed halfway around the globe. How can this young man concentrate on his critically important national defense job if he is worried about his wife having to deal with broken pipes or his children living in a cold, damp home? Our service men and women are often placed in tense situations in charge of multimillion-dollar pieces of highly technical military equipment. We only help to distract them from their duties of national defense if we do not assure them that their families are being taken care of and their families are living in decent housing. 
I truly fear the long-term consequences of the lack of attention and funding devoted to maintaining adequate housing for our Nation's military. I fear many bright young men and women will opt not to enter the military when they see the lack of resources devoted to meeting their basic family needs. 
The military today is much different than it was when I served nearly 30 years ago. Today, most members of the military are married with families. They all volunteer to serve this country. They volunteer for many reasons. They do not expect to be treated in any special way, but they should have the right to expect decent housing for their families. 
Today's military is a high-technology military, Mr. President. It needs to be capable of responding rapidly to a variety of situations throughout the world. We need our best and our brightest young men and women to serve. But we will not attract or retain them if we are unwilling to invest in them and their families. 
Mr. President, I intend to be very vocal on this issue. I have already spoken to the distinguished chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee this morning about this issue. We must begin placing a higher priority in the defense budget on taking care of our people. These are the people who protect America's freedoms. Freedom is not free. 
In fact, we need to place a higher priority for total defense spending in the overall budget. In many ways we live in a world today of greater uncertainty and danger than the one we have known for the last 50 years. If we expect our military to respond to all these challenges, if we expect our service men and women to risk their lives defending America, and America's interests, then we must match those expectations with appropriate funding for an acceptable standard of living for them. 
The foundation of our military is the men and women who serve. That is the very foundation of our society--our people, our families. Our military is no different. Our military is the guarantor of American foreign policy and the protector of all our freedoms. Just as a house built on sand will soon crumble, our military might cannot stand strong without committed good men and women. 
If we are unwilling to invest in these men and women we will pay a heavy price, a very heavy price, a price far greater than budgetary numbers. 
Mr. President, I have written to the distinguished chairman and ranking member of the Armed Services Committee today, as well as our former colleague, the distinguished Defense Secretary, Bill Cohen, on this issue. I intend to be very involved working with my colleagues on this matter. 
Let us do the right thing. Let us do the right thing for our people. Let us find ways to fix this problem. We owe it to the men and women who proudly wear the uniform of the U.S. military.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I would like to join with so many of my colleagues in opposing this resolution requested by President Clinton. There are several reasons why I believe it would be wrong for the Congress to accelerate funding for international population control programs. It is the wrong thing to do fiscally, and it is the wrong thing to do on its own merits. 
For the past 3 weeks, the U.S. Senate has been debating the need for a balanced budget amendment. And now, as one of the Congress' first acts, we are considering spending an additional $123 million in fiscal year 1997 for international population control? 
Second, does it make sense for us to be accelerating spending on this extraordinarily controversial program without the kind of sensible protections that existed during the Reagan and Bush administrations? 
Mr. President, despite the claims to the contrary by the other side, this is a vote that involves the issue of abortion. That is because this vote involves U.S. taxpayers funding of organizations that perform and promote abortions overseas. During the Reagan and Bush administrations, our international family planning programs were administered under the Mexico City policy, so-named after the 1984 U.N. population conference in Mexico City where this U.S. policy was formulated. Under the Mexico City policy, this program was kept entirely separate from the issue of abortion. This was accomplished by requiring that U.S. family planning programs overseas could only be administered by private groups that do not conduct abortions, or promote abortion as a method of family planning. 
Because we all know that money is fungible, funding abortion-promoting groups to conduct family planning programs overseas permitted these groups to extend their international presence, increase their abortion activities, and lobby more aggressively to weaken laws restricting abortion overseas. The Reagan/Bush policies helped protect our international family planning programs from the controversy that inevitably arose through their association with private pro-abortion groups. With the protection of the Mexico City policy, funding for our international family planning programs increased from $251 million in 1987 to $434 million in 1993. 
One of President Clinton's first actions after his inauguration in 1993, however, was to rescind the Executive order that put the Mexico City policy in place. Because of the President's action, suddenly this once again became one of our most controversial foreign aid programs. 
This Congress has an opportunity to reinstate the sensible family planning policies of Mexico City. I commend my colleague from Arkansas, Senator Hutchinson, for his leadership in introducing legislation that would return family-planning funding to the principles set forth by Presidents Reagan and Bush. I am proud to be an original co-sponsor of this important legislation. 
There is a reason why last fall's Omnibus Appropriations Act delayed expenditures for this program so that some of the expenditures of the money would not actually be spent until next year. This was the result of a delicate compromise between the Congress and the administration. The administration was offered the choice. The Congress was willing to lift all restrictions on the rate of spending for overseas family planning funds, but only if the administration would refrain from funneling those funds through abortion advocacy groups like the International Planned Parenthood Federation. I would note that the Clinton administration preferred to keep funding restrictions in place so that it could continue administering the program through pro-abortion groups. 
Now the administration wants to undo this compromise. The administration wants all funding restrictions lifted. At the same time, they refuse to accept the sensible Reagan/Bush policies that protected this program from the contentious abortion debate. 
Groups supporting this resolution have argued that a more rapid expenditure of these funds by groups that perform abortions and lobby aggressively for abortion-on-demand laws would, in the long term, reduce the rate of abortions around the world. This Senator, however, fails to understand the logic of funding pro-abortion groups to advance this pro-life objective. It is a simple fact that the rate of abortions increases dramatically whenever a country legalizes abortion. I do not believe sending more U.S. taxpayer dollars to an international network of clinics run by groups that conduct abortions is likely to reduce the number of abortions worldwide. 
Mr. President, the answer to ensuring the long-term health and welfare of women across the world and stabilizing the world's population is not to promote abortion overseas as a population control alternative with U.S. taxpayers' hard-earned dollars. The answer is to promote free markets and individual liberties in underdeveloped countries. Over two-thirds of the world's recent fertility decline can be accounted for by the expansion of economic opportunity and personal freedoms, as women across the world are given access to greater educational and lifetime opportunities. Freer markets, more education and information and more opportunities for the world's women--that's the answer. 
Mr. President, I would gladly vote to remove spending restrictions on this program if the administration would agree to protect it from abuse by pro-abortion advocates. But under the legislative procedures we have before us today, that sensible option is not available. Therefore, I cannot support this resolution, and urge its defeat.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today to, again, voice my strong support for Senate Joint Resolution 1, the balanced budget amendment. I might add that there are many `Bud Hentzens' in Nebraska, just as my distinguished colleague from Kansas so eloquently stated. The numbers are real. I would like to pick up on my distinguished colleagues' remarks with the following statement: 
During this debate, we have heard a number of arguments from both sides on the effects of a balanced budget amendment. I believe this debate comes down to one question: Is the balanced budget amendment in the best interest of our children, their children, and the future of America? My answer is `yes.' 
Balancing our Federal budget is critical to ensuring that the American dream lives for our future generations. The real issue behind balancing the budget is our national debt. Mr. President, our national debt has risen to proportions that are virtually unimaginable to most of us. Numbers like $5.3 trillion in present debt, or $7 trillion in debt by the year 2002 are so far beyond the range of the daily lives of most persons that these numbers are easily dismissed. But these numbers cannot be dismissed. These are not just numbers. Each and every dime of our debt represents a burden we are placing squarely on the shoulders of our children. It is our children--our children--whose incomes will be taxed to pay off this debt. It is our children who will have to deal with a limited-growth-in-job-opportunity world because the debt has so constricted this economy that opportunities and possibilities will be severely limited for our children. It is our children who may never be able to purchase their own homes, or send their children to college, because their incomes will be consumed with high taxes to pay for an oppressive Government and make payments on the enormous debt that we have run up for them. 
The balanced budget amendment is no cure-all. Passing it will not save us from the hard choices required to balance this budget. But it will help us get there. It will force Congress to deal with the budget honestly. It will force Congress down a different path than the one it has traveled for 36 of the last 37 years. It will force Congress to balance the budget. Most importantly, it will force Congress to keep the balanced budget--to keep the balanced budget. It will give our future generations the hope and opportunities so that they can determine their own futures and the futures of their children, rather than being held hostage by an undisciplined Congress and an undisciplined Government deciding their futures for them by mortgaging their futures. 
Creating the kinds of opportunities for our children that we have enjoyed will require the kind of economic growth that should be America's legacy for the 21st century. It will require bold, strong, and imaginative leadership. To get there, we must cut Government spending, cut taxes, and cut regulations. We need to cut the size and scope of Government and allow private and personal initiative to soar. We must bring Government back to the people, where it is accountable. Balancing the budget is critical to this effort. 
Our children deserve better than a balanced budget based on `ifs,' `buts,' `maybes,' conditional tax cuts, and conditional spending cuts. 
They deserve the security of knowing Congress is required to balance the budget every year. They deserve to know that Congress will not continue to add to the national debt. They deserve to know that we are not playing shell games and numbers games and word games with their futures. 
Either we are going to balance the budget or we are not. Let us be honest. Let us be honest with our children and our grandchildren. Let us be honest with this country. Our children deserve better than the hocus-pocus that we have been giving them. Where is our leadership? Where is the leadership in this Congress? Where is the leadership in this body? Where is the courage in this body? And where is the outrage? Where is the outrage in the U.S. Congress for what we are doing and what we have done to the children of this country? 
We must get control of the Federal budget and America's fiscal policy. We must enforce lasting fiscal discipline on the Congress of the United States. A balanced budget amendment ensures that we will balance the budget for years to come. Regardless of who is President, regardless of which party controls the Congress, the balanced budget amendment would be a nonpartisan enforcer of controlled Federal spending and responsible fiscal policy. 
We owe our children no less. We owe our children more than flimsy promises and optimistic assumptions. We owe it to them to make a lasting commitment to balance the budget of the United States for years to come. They deserve no less than the same opportunities that were afforded each of us. In fact, Mr. President, they deserve greater opportunities to succeed just as our opportunities exceeded those of our parents. That has been the legacy of every American generation. That is the magic of America. That is the greatness of America. 
The only way to ensure this commitment to our children, the only way to make sure our promises are not undone, is to pass the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. 
Mr. President, thank you, and I yield my time.  
Mr. INHOFE addressed the Chair.

 Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, today I am cosponsoring S. 251, a measure that will provide farmers and ranchers with a valuable tool--income averaging--to help manage their agricultural operations, improve profitability, and reduce the tax burden on a crucial Nebraska livelihood. I commend Senator Shelby, the bill's principal sponsor, for his leadership on this matter. 
Today's Federal Tax Code is hardly a friend to the family farmer. 
For example, farmers and ranchers do not have access to company or government pensions and retirement plans, in which many other Americans have the ability to participate. Farmers and ranchers will receive fewer Social Security benefits than workers in most other careers since they plow much of their income back into the farm And, as self-employed workers, farmers and ranchers are charged with payroll taxes that are nearly double that of most any other private business employee. Even retirement can be a painful proposition for agricultural producers who have spent their lives building a security nest egg only to be faced with onerous capital gains tax rates and, later, with a confiscatory estate tax when they want to pass their farm along to their children. 
The American consumer still enjoys the most plentiful food supply at the lowest cost in the developed world--thanks to our Nation's agricultural might. Population growth, rising per capita incomes, expanded trade opportunities, along with new production and marketing technologies, are a few of the reasons why the future of American agriculture is so bright. However, flexibility in our U.S. Tax Code is still needed to strengthen our position as the world's leader in production agriculture. 
Before 1986, agricultural producers were allowed to average their income over a 2-year period, which allowed greater flexibility in both profit potential and management decisions. This tax management tool was repealed in the 1986 tax reform bill, but the need for this instrument to reduce the farm tax burden still remains. 
A fairer and more equitable tax policy will also have a profound effect upon the creation and sustainment of jobs in rural America. The economic vitality of our rural communities continues to hinge on the success of our agricultural industry. A prosperous rural economy means greater opportunities for the local men and women who sell the farm implements, drive the grain and livestock trucks, deliver the feed and fuel, market the seed and fertilizer, and process the fruits of our harvest so as to maintain our position as the world's most efficient and reliable food supplier. 
As we continue to move toward a more market-oriented farm program, farm and ranch producers will need to derive a greater proportion of their income from the marketplace--and to retain a greater proportion of their hard-earned income through tax relief. Income averaging is clearly a practice that will bring some degree of fairness to the U.S. Tax Code. 
The current Tax Code adds up to higher taxes, more regulatory burdens, and added retirement worries for Nebraska farmers who labor year in and year out in order to feed and clothe the world. This simply must change. Income averaging is one tool that agricultural producers can utilize to enhance profits and keep rural dollars in rural communities. It's time that Congress properly recognizes the contributions of the family farmers by reducing rather than raising their taxes.

 Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, today I join as a cosponsor of the Congressional Pension Disclosure Act of 1997. I commend Senator Abraham for his leadership in drafting this important legislation. 
This bill will require that detailed information about the pension of every Member of Congress be published twice a year as a part of a report on Congress that already is required by law. Under our proposal, each report would show how much a Member has contributed to his pension, how much he would receive if he retired, and any other information needed to enable the public to compute the Federal retirement benefits of each Member of Congress. 
I strongly support this step because the people have a right to know fully and completely how their Congress works and how the congressional pension system works. There should be nothing hidden here. Nothing should be difficult for the people to determine. No calculations of congressional pensions or other benefits should be murky or confusing. 
This bill will shine some sunlight on the congressional pension system. It will be another step toward restoring the confidence and trust of the American people in our National Legislature and in our system of self-government.

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of expanding the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to help ensure stability in Central and Eastern Europe. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this resolution to encourage the NATO expansion process and to put the 105th Congress on record in support of bringing Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovenia into the alliance. 
I believe restructuring Europe's post-cold-war security architecture and securing lasting peace and stability throughout the continent constitute one of the great foreign policy challenges of our time. From two world wars to the former Yugoslavia, history has shown that Europe's security problems eventually become America's. Time and again, we have found ourselves confronted with only two options: Choosing to lead and help shape events in Europe, or waiting for events to overtake us as they certainly will. 
Americans are well-served when America chooses to lead. 
For half a century, the NATO alliance has been the foundation of European security. It has been the most meaningful multinational security framework in history. NATO will continue to be that foundation for the next half century--but only if America helps lead the alliance to adapt to the new reality in Europe after the end of the cold war. 
The new reality is that the nations of Central and Eastern Europe are free from oppression and many yearn to align themselves with the West. 
The new reality is that instability in the lands one author called `Between East and West' has replaced invasion from the East as the most likely threat to our allies and to our own interests in Europe. 
The new reality is that America, Russia, and Europe will all benefit if the nations of Central and Eastern Europe are anchored in the peaceful security that NATO can offer. 
I am convinced that we must move swiftly to expand the NATO alliance and to rethink our commitment to European security. More than 7 years after the Berlin Wall fell, NATO has yet to take in new members. 
Congress has consistently supported NATO expansion and has enacted legislation to prepare the nations of Central and Eastern Europe for membership in the alliance. The resolution we are introducing today is designed to push ahead once again. It encourages the President to move quickly. It endorses the idea of embracing new members by the alliance's 50-year anniversary in 1999. It makes plain our belief that our alliance must reach out to work with Russia as friends rather than antagonists. And it names Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovenia as nations whose membership would contribute to the alliance's security. 
Those of us who support NATO expansion must be prepared to make the case that it serves America's long-term security interests. This is a debate that must reach far beyond the Halls of Congress. NATO expansion, when it does occur, will require the consent of the Senate. And that will require the support of the American people. 
It is time for this debate to begin.

Mr. HAGEL. Thank you, Mr. President. Let me also add my thanks to the distinguished senior Senator from South Carolina, Senator Thurmond, for giving me an opportunity to take his place this afternoon in this debate over the balanced budget amendment. 
Mr. President, I rise today to add my strong support for Senate Joint Resolution 1, the balanced budget amendment. I believe Americans want a smaller, less intrusive Federal Government. They want more freedom from the burdens of Government. This is America, a country born from a desire to escape the yoke of oppressive government. Our Founding Fathers did not trust government. They trusted the people. 
As we approach a new century, we have again reached a turning point in America's history. We have been given a charge, as a nation and as representatives of the people, to work together to prioritize the role of Government, to redefine the role of Government in our lives. How much Government do we want? How much do we want Government to do for us? What do we want Government to do for us? How much Government are we willing to pay for? 
Reducing the role of the Federal Government will require tough choices. A balanced budget amendment will not make those tough choices and difficult decisions. It is the responsibility of those of us entrusted by the American people in leadership positions in this country to make those tough choices and those difficult decisions. However, a balanced budget amendment will force us to step up to these decisions and help make us better able and disciplined to make those choices necessary to ensure a strong future for this country. 
The American people are tired of political posturing and partisan rhetoric. They want action. They want results. They want us to do what we said we would do. We are not here to defend the status quo. We are here to solve problems. We are here to ensure that the taxpayers get the most efficient and effective use of their tax dollars. After all, the money we spend is not our money. It is not the Senate's money. It is not the President's money. It is the American people's money. They earned it. They work for it. It is up to us to spend it wisely. And right now the American people do not believe that Washington spends their money wisely. The American people want us to get control of this country's fiscal policy. They want fiscal responsibility. 
That is why a balanced budget amendment is so important. It will force discipline upon the Congress of the United States, a fiscal discipline that has been absent since 1969, the last time America balanced its budget; 36 of the last 37 budgets in this country have not been balanced. It will force us to be honest with the American people. 
As our former colleague, Paul Simon, a strong proponent of the balanced budget amendment, wrote just last week in the New York Times: `Elected officials like to do popular things, and there is no popular way to balance the Federal budget.' The balanced budget amendment will give us the constitutional discipline to do the right thing. 
This debate is about accountability. This debate is about responsibility and leadership. It is about restoring the confidence and trust of the American people and their Government. 
We have all been called upon to provide leadership. There is no bigger challenge facing the future of this country than paying down our enormous national debt. 
During the debate on the balanced budget amendment there will be numbers and numbers and more numbers. But I ask you to focus on these numbers: America made gross interest payments of $344 billion in fiscal year 1996 on our national debt. That's $344 billion that was not used to improve our schools, strengthen our national defense, protect our environment, or build new transportation systems. And that's just the annual interest. The only thing that we are doing is paying interest on the national debt. We are not even beginning to touch the principal. Each day, we add an average of $700 million to our national debt that already totals $5.3 billion. By the time we reach anyone's plan for a balanced budget, the national debt will be $7 trillion. 
The national debt that we are leaving for our children and our children and grandchildren is the real issue in this debate. 
What we are doing in cheating the generations that follow us is immoral. We must put our Government in a position to begin paying down our national debt. We must begin to put our fiscal house in order, or our next generation--and I see young people in the galleries today--will face a disaster. They will have a limited future because they will have limited opportunities. This debate is about their future, the future of America, the future of our children and their children. 
It strikes me as ironic, Mr. President, that opponents of the balanced budget amendment argue that it will cause cuts in education, Social Security, Medicare, and other programs. What they fail to tell the American people is that if we do nothing--if we fail to act--deficits and our debt will continue to rise until there is nothing left in the Federal budget for education, entitlement programs, national defense, or any other programs--including Social Security. 
The real threat to Social Security is the national debt. If we don't act to balance the budget and stop adding to that debt, then we are truly placing the future of Social Security in jeopardy. 
Furthermore, exempting Social Security from the balanced budget amendment would actually make Social Security more vulnerable. We are all well aware that Social Security will begin to run a deficit of trillions of dollars early in the next century. Taking Social Security off budget would put it out on a plank all by itself when that time comes. Including Social Security in our total unified budget calculations ensures that Congress will have to deal with this crisis before it hits. How can we take America's largest program off budget? 
If Congress took Social Security off budget and ran trillions of dollars of deficits in it, Congress could still say that they balanced the budget. That is ludicrous. That is folly. But, more important, it's dishonest. Does anyone truly believe that Social Security will suffer if we balance our budget? Let's get real. Social Security has been, and will continue to be, the highest priority program in the Federal budget. 
Let me say this as straightforward as I can. The best thing we can do to ensure a sound future for Social Security and America is balance a unified Federal budget. 
Let's be honest with the American people and say it straight. We have to balance our budget. We cannot continue to pile on to the debt that we are leaving this next generation and then expect them to be competitive in the global economy of the 21st century. If it takes an amendment to the Constitution to balance the budget, we should have one. Our Framers gave us that option. When it was required to do the right thing for the people and the Nation, the Framers gave us amendments to the Constitution to help ensure that we balance our budget, and we need a balanced budget constitutional amendment. So let's get at it. Let's show the American people that we are going to do what we said we would do. 
The future for our next generations is growth and more economic opportunities for all Americans. Only through growing our economy, cutting taxes, cutting regulation, and cutting Government spending will we be able to pay off our national debt. 
We cannot delay these decisions any longer. Generation after generation will live with the consequences of our actions or our inactions. Will they live with the crushing debt of our indecision? Or will they look back and say that we did rise to the occasion and to the challenge? Will they say that we faced the deficit and the debt honestly and took action and ensured the survival of the American dream? 
The magic of America has always been that each generation has done better than the last because it had more opportunities. I do not want to look my 6-year-old and 4-year-old in their eyes in 20 years and say to them that I was a Member of the U.S. Senate, but I didn't do enough to protect their future. 
I will not allow that to be the legacy of this U.S. Senator, nor do I believe that this is the legacy my distinguished colleagues wish to leave to their children, grandchildren, and America. 
Thank you, Mr. President.
