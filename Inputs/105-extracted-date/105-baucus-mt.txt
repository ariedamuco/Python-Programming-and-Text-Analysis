Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to speak a few minutes about the bill we just passed. I would like to register my personal views about both the substance of the bill and the process by which it was passed. 
I have very mixed emotions. First, I am very disappointed in a process that led to this midnight power play. This bill, as has been pointed out by others speaking before me, is almost 4,000 pages long. It weighs 40 pounds. It contains about $500 billion in Federal spending. I might tell you, Mr. President, that $500 billion is enough to pay for the State budget of Montana for 200 years. It was also produced within 24 hours' notice of this vote. As a practical matter, most offices had no more than a few hours to look at this bill. They had no copies of it. They had to go to a central location and wade through it with other staff members. There is nobody in this entire Congress who knows all of the provisions in this bill; it is that massive, and it was written behind closed doors. 
Mr. President, I will admit that it is a with many worthwhile projects and programs. For example, it provides assistance for farmers, so important to the State of Montana and other farming states. It has provisions that help increase our investment in education, again not only for the Nation but for my State of Montana. It provides important new tools on the war against drugs. And it provides important new funding for health care programs. The bill also provides money for the International Monetary Fund to help fulfill our obligations as a leader in the global community. By doing so, we are strengthening the economies on which our export markets depend. Montana has seen wheat exports decline by 50 percent, almost entirely because of lack of demand in Asia. 
In addition, one company, U.S. Semitool in Kalispell, MT, has had to lay off over 200, again because of a reduction in demand. 
By funding the IMF we also fulfilled our role as leader of the world community. Like it or not, the United States is the sole remaining superpower, and our leadership is essential in resolving international crises. By appropriating $18 billion for an IMF credit line, Congress is letting the world know that the United States is interested in living up to its unique role. Incidentally, it should be noted that the United States has never lost one thin dime in the last 50 years that we supported funding for the IMF. It is not the big drain that some people, unfortunately, believe it is. 
Mr. President, I obviously have serious reservations about the process with which this bill reached the Senate floor. That said, I do want to commend the efforts of those who made a flawed process better. The President's Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles, who is departing, was outstanding. He will be sorely missed by anyone, who has worked with him. I know of no finer public servant than Mr. Bowles. 
The President's Director of the Office of Management and Budget, Jack Lew, has likewise been a pleasure to work with, as has Larry Stein, the President's congressional liaison. There are many others I could name in the executive branch with whom I worked--devoted servants tenacious in their support for good programs for our country. 
The same applies to the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Stevens, and Senator Byrd. Both are tremendous leaders and both are tremendous men. The House leadership was also very helpful at times, as were the chief persons in the House Appropriations Committee. I very much appreciate their efforts, without which we would have faced an even more objectionable means of legislating today. 
Mr. President, I am convinced that Americans are less concerned about the process we have used to pass this bill than what is actually in it. Whether it is highway funding an airport project, I think process is less important than outcome, as long as results are delivered. I think Tip O'Neill, the former Speaker of the House, said it best: `all politics is local.' 
So, why am I so concerned about the process? Let me explain. Ordinarily, bills that go through the Congress arrive through committees. They are debated there and, if passed, sent to the floor. After being placed on the calendar, the majority leader--some years it is a Republican leader, other years it is a Democratic leader--sets the agenda and decides which bills to bring up to be debated before the Senate. It is generally a collegial agreement between the majority leader and the minority leader as to which bills are brought up and debated. 
Following debate and passage on the floor, bills go to a conference, because the House has gone through a similar procedure. Many of the bills that are brought up on the floor under the Senate rules have added onto them various amendments. Some amendments are relevant and germane to the bill before the Congress but often, under the Senate rules, many are not. Regardless, all of those provisions are debated, in full view of the public and press. Senators cast their votes yes or no--sometimes with recorded votes, sometimes with voice votes--but then they go to conference. 
What happens in conference? Generally, the principal members of the committee of jurisdiction meet with the principal members of the committee of jurisdiction of the House of the bill that passed, because they are similar but there are different provisions. There are some adjustments the conferees have to make, so they recommend the same bill with the same provisions back to both bodies. Both bodies then vote yes or no, and, if passed, the President gets one bill. The President can sign it, veto it, or pocket veto the bill. 
That is the procedure, and it is basically the procedure our Founding Fathers had in mind when they wrote the Constitution. They didn't write all the rules for the House and the Senate, but they decided there should be a House and Senate and the bodies should make their own rules. They intended that Congress should operate in the context of openness in government and representative democracy in government. That was the whole purpose of our Founding Fathers writing the Constitution, escaping tyranny from Europe: representative democracy, where the people are in charge. 
Mr. President, I am not going to stand up here as a purist and say we should follow that lock, stock and barrel. We have to be practical and do what works, but we must do so with full respect for the people who elected us, the people we have the privilege of serving. 
Unfortunately, something very different than the process I just described was used to pass this omnibus appropriations bill. What happened, essentially, is that 3,800 pages of legislation--which, by and large, contains 8 appropriations bills that did not pass both bodies and go to conference, was put in one conference report. This legislation did not go to the floor of the House or the Senate, where it could be debated and amended. It is legislation, rather, which is in this conference report and sent back to the House and Senate unamendable--unamendable. I might also mention that roughly half this bill is authorizing language that ordinarily goes through the committee process. 
So who made the decisions that resulted in this 4,000 page bill? Were they the chief people in the committees of jurisdiction? No. Were they Democrats, Democratic leadership? Not very often. So, who were they? Essentially, the people in the closed room--unavailable to the press, to the public, unavailable to other Senators--were top staff in the administration and the leadership of the House and Senate, usually Republican and to some degree Democratic, which would mean about five or six, maybe eight Members of Congress. 
Mr. President, we have 535 Members of Congress, roughly. Eight of whom were in the room with the administration officials, hammering this bill out. There is so much here, even they do not know what is in it. What did the rest of us do? We had little choice but to do the very best for our people at home and get on the phone. We called the select few in that room, trying to make our views heard, trying to make a semblance of a democratic process. 
I spent a lot of time talking to the chief administration officials who I know were in the room. To their credit, they listened to me. And to their credit, they agreed with a good number of the views that I was espousing. 
I did the best I could, given the circumstances we had, and I am pleased that those people in the room decided to include some Montana provisions, like Canyon Ferry; various land and water conservation funds, like money for the purchase of the Royal Teton Ranch right next to Yellowstone Park; funding to help the massive Gallatin land exchange; the purchase of Lindbergh Lake, for a number of the same reasons. There are a lot of provisions in this bill that directly affect my State, in addition to broad national policies, such as more teachers, more funding for education, and so forth. 
But I believe, Mr. President, that there comes a time when the process becomes so corrupted that it undermines and corrupts the legislation that is passed. 
Let me give a little personal background here. Several years ago, I was involved in writing Montana's State Constitution. I think we are the last State in the Nation to rewrite a constitution. There is a very important provision in our State's constitution called an open meeting law. In Montana's constitution, all public meetings are open to the press. The Governor of our State knows all the meetings he has in his office will be attended by the press. 
Sure, it causes some problems. Some in State government say, `Oh, my gosh, this is a terrible provision; it cramps our style; it makes it difficult for us to do our work.' Sure, it makes it sometimes difficult, but we all know deep down it is for the public good and, as with a lot of things that are good, it takes effort, it takes hard work. Most of the good things in life take effort and hard work. This is one of those. We have an open process in Montana, and we have a much higher view in Montana of our public servants. It is very helpful. 
I will relate another personal experience which indicates my resolve toward a more open representative process. It occurred a little more than 20 years ago, when I was a freshman Member of the House. I had a free hour with not much to do, and I said, `Well, I think I will learn something. I will go to a tax conference writing a tax bill,' by Senate conferees, House conferees, Senate Finance Committee, House Ways and Means Committee, top folks who are in the conference for a large tax bill. 
I asked around, `Where is this meeting, where are they?' I got the runaround. Nobody could tell me where they really were. I finally went to Mike Mansfield, then majority leader of the Senate. I thought, `Gee, Senator Mansfield could find out where it is occurring.' Sure enough, his people told me. I went over there. A policeman was standing right at the doorway. I said I am a Member. I think he thought I was a member of the conference, so he let me in. 
I took a seat in a corner so I could watch and learn a little about tax policy and how conferences work. I was there, minding my own business listening to Wilbur Mills, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, and Russell Long, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, talking. 
They were trying to work out this bill. There were a lot of executive branch people in the room. Treasury Secretary Bill Simon was in the room, along with other executive branch people. I was just sitting there about 5 or 10 minutes, and up walked a senior House Member, Congressman Burke from Massachusetts. He said, `Sorry, you can't be here.' 
I asked, `Why? Why can't I be here?' 
He said, `Well, it's the rules.' 
I said, `What rule is it?' 
He said, `Well, it's the Senate rule.' 
I said, `What Senate rule is it?' 
He said, `I'm sorry, you just can't be here. Nobody can be here. No other Member of the House and Senate can be here. Not even Congressman Bill Green can be here.' 
Bill Green, who was then a Member of the House Ways and Means Committee who successfully authored the provision on the floor of the House to modify the percentage of the oil depletion allowance, even he couldn't be in the room. All the people allowed in the room were the conferees. It was closed doors and that is it. 
I said to Congressman Burke at the time, `Look, I'm not going to cause a fuss here, but this is wrong. It is just not right that this is not open to the public, certainly to Members of the Congress.' 
That afternoon, I stood before the House, along with Congressman Ab Mikva, who also did not like that process, and we voiced our disagreement and displeasure. Next year, things opened up because it was the right thing to do. 
Perhaps I have too much of a personal investment in this, but I do believe the people are much better served the more the process is open and the more the process is not corrupted as, in my judgment, this process is. 
Again, about half of the U.S. Government bills, which did not pass the House or the Senate or go through committees in the full light of day, which did not pass the floor of the House, some of which were not even brought up on the floor of the House or the Senate, were put in this huge bill, then sent back to the Senate and the House unamendable. No amendments are in order, Mr. President, in this process; none. 
I suppose there is a reason for that because none of us know what is in the bill. How can we offer an amendment if we don't know what is in the bill? I asked the Parliamentarian not long ago: How much of this is authorization, how much is appropriations? He said, `Senator, we just don't know; this huge stack here is too big for us to have gone through it by now. We just don't know.' 
As I said, Mr. President, I am in an anxious position here because a lot of good is in this bill. But the process, in my view, is wrong. That's why I voted no on the bill. 
The provisions that are in this bill I would have worked for in separate bills, in separate agriculture bills or Agriculture appropriations bills or in other authorizing bills that would ordinarily come before the Congress. 
Again, I am not going to be a purist about this, I just want to be practical. We have done this 2 years in a row, dumping so much in such a very undemocratic way into a huge bill written behind closed doors, written by only a few Members of the House and Senate and the administration. This process dangerously disenfranchises most Senators, House Members and American voters. 
We, as Senators and House Members, don't have an opportunity to go back to our people and say, `What do you think of this provision?' They don't have an opportunity to say to us, `We don't like what is in there, vote this way or that. They are disenfranchised, cut out of the process. 
This is not legislation by representative democracy, Mr. President. It is legislation by a very few, by oligarchy. 
At a deeper level, what does that do? It further undermines the people's confidence or belief in Government. This process does that. It confirms some of the worst views a lot of Americans have; namely, oh, those guys back there in Washington are just out for themselves; they don't care about us. 
Mr. President, we must draw the line. Enough is enough. We all know that the more issues are actually fully debated--and I mean debated--the more the public has a chance then to see what is going on, and they themselves get more involved. To the extent we do that, this country will be stronger. We know that. We also know that the less the people are involved, the less they know what is going on, and the weaker this country is going to be. 
Mr. President, we are the world's oldest democracy. We have a form of government where the people elect their representatives to do their nation's business. We are not a kingdom, we are not a monarchy. And we will be the leader in the next century if people are more involved in government. And they will be more involved in government the more we, as representatives, respect them, respect their views, want their views, want them to be able to comment on what we are doing or not doing. 
But on the other hand, the more we disrespect people by hiding behind closed doors, in the dark of night, the more we will cause a further deterioration of our government and weaken the United States role as the world leader that we want to be in the next century. 
Finally, Mr. President, let me say that this is a sad moment for me. I cast my vote with reservation, fully aware of the good that this bill contains. But vote no I must, simply because I think that to vote yes would be to cast a vote for exclusivity and against the democratic process. I worked very closely with some individuals who made a few of this bill's important provisions reality, and I do not want now to be voting against their reference. They made a good effort and did a very good job, given the situation they were in, given the circumstances they faced. They were helpful to those of us who were working for our States and had nothing else to do--no alternative--but to try to work with this abominable process. 
In closing, Mr. President, I want to say that next year it is critically important that we prevent this process from happening again. We have done this two years in a row, and each year more and more and more is getting dumped into this omnibus conference report process. If this trend continues, then within a year or two maybe three-quarters of Government is going to be in there; maybe everything is soon going to be in there, which means I might as well not report for work until the final 3 weeks of the Congress, because that is where it is all done, with those few people behind closed doors. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I want to join my colleagues in supporting tax incentives for alternative fuels. Our country has assumed a leadership role in the reduction of greenhouse gases because of the global importance of pollution reduction. As my colleagues have also pointed out, promotion of alternative fuels is not just an environmental issue, but an issue important to our domestic economy and independence as well. We cannot afford to slip back toward policies which will leave us dependent upon foreign sources of oil for our economic growth. 
With the huge reserves of coal and lignite in the United States and around the world, as well as the tremendous potential for use of biomass, wind energy, and other alternatives, it is particularly important to our economy and the world's environment that new, more environmentally friendly fuels are brought to market here and in developing nations. 
But bringing new technologies to market is financially risky. In particular, finding investors to take a new technology from the laboratory to the market is difficult because so many technical problems need full-scale testing and operations to resolve. Few investors are prepared to take on the risks associated with bringing a first-of-a-kind, full-sized alternative energy production facility on-line without some level of security provided by a partnership with the federal government. 
Tax incentives represent our government's willingness to work with the private sector as a partner to bring new, clean energy technologies to the market. These incentives demonstrate our country's commitment to the future.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of Title X of the FY 1999 Omnibus Appropriations bill. I drafted this provision as a substitute amendment to S.1913, the Montana Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act of 1998, a bill that I sponsored and Senator Burns from Montana co-sponsored. I am pleased that this provision has been included in the Omnibus Appropriations bill. 
As amended, the Montana Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act of 1998 (now Title X) creates an exciting opportunity to exchange lands at Canyon Ferry Reservoir for other lands in Montana to conserve fish and wildlife, enhance public hunting, fishing, and recreational opportunities, and improve public access to public lands. 
Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to thank my good friends and colleagues from Montana--Senator Burns and Congressman Hill. Together, we have worked long hours on this project. We certainly would not be where we are today if not for this team effort. I would also like to take a moment to thank their staffs as well--especially Leo Giacometto, Ric Molen and Ryan Thomas from Senator Burns' office and Mark Baker and Kiel Weaver from Congressman Hill's office. These staff members have logged long hours on this project and this accomplishment belongs as much to them as to anyone.

 Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, Butte, Montana has a long history of excellence in sports and the cultivation of champions. On Sunday, October 11, 1998 in Christchurch, New Zealand, a young champion from Butte won a gold medal in the 200-meter individual medley at the Paralympic World Swimming Championships. At age 13, Erin Popovich obtained a gold medal with her personal best time of 3:32.45, shattering her previous mark of 3:37.18 which had been a world record. 
On Thursday, October 15 Erin significantly added to her trophy case by winning gold medals in the 50-meter freestyle and 50-meter butterfly races. The Butte Central Junior High 8th Grader improved on her United States record time in the 50-meter butterfly with a time of 45.63. She also recorded a personal best in her 50-meter freestyle with a time of 37.54. In the freestyle Erin was in second place until the final 4 meters when she went on to win the gold. Erin also won a bronze medal in the 100-meter freestyle and helped win a gold for the women's 200-meter team freestyle relay. 
The most amazing aspect of this is that Erin only started competitively swimming 10 months ago when she joined the Butte Tarpons Swim Club, under the direction of Swim Coach Marie Cook and Assistant Coach Bill Sever. She is a natural athlete, but her true strength lies in her dedication. `Her determination is her strength,' Coach Cook says. `Her mental attitude is just tough.' Erin's focus provides an excellent example for her teammates, Coach Cook says. `The kids on this team don't think of her as disabled . . . when she gets on the blocks with taller kids you can see it--she's such an inspiration to everyone.' 
Erin, who is the daughter of Dr. Keith and Barbara Popovich, is only one of 30 swimmers to qualify for the United States Disabled Team. The Paralympics features 585 swimmers from 55 countries. 
I want to join with her family and friends and all the Butte Tarpon Swimmers in congratulating Erin on her tremendous success. Erin has proven herself as a World Champion and as one of Butte, Montana's finest.

Mr. BAUCUS. I agree. In fact, many areas of the country, including Montana, face similar situations. We included that phrase intentionally to ensure that such distress may be addressed by EDA programs. It is our view, and it is a view shared by EDA officials, that such communities should be eligible to apply for EDA aid.

Therefore, in his efforts to ensure that EDA assistance go to the communities of greatest distress, the Secretary is allowed some flexibility in making determinations for awards of assistance under this Act.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I want to talk about something very simple. It is about post offices and particularly small town or community post offices. Our first Postmaster General was Benjamin Franklin, 200 years ago. And, obviously, at that time post offices were very important to Americans. It was a local gathering place; it was a meeting place, in addition to sending and receiving mail. And the same is true today in small town America, in some of our smaller communities and even some of our larger communities. 
For example, in my State of Montana, let's take Livingston, the post office is where people meet to compare notes, talk about what the fly hatch is on the Yellowstone so they will know what to go fishing with. And maybe Red Lodge, MT--collect the mail and talk about what happened at the most recent track meet. The same is true in Plains, MT, a post office that has been there for 115 years. 
The problem is this: The Postal Service recently, in my judgment, has not treated communities fairly because it has come in and closed local post offices and often rebuilt them outside of town to essentially destroy the local character of the community. 
Senator Jeffords and I offered an amendment on the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill. It passed the Senate by a vote of 76 to 21. A similar version passed the House. Essentially, we are just providing for notice so that local communities, when the Postal Service decides to come in and close a post office or move it, would have a chance to have a hearing, would have an opportunity to have notice, would have an opportunity to have some say in their community. 
Today, under Postal Service regulations, local people don't have a say. They don't have the ability to influence, in any meaningful way, where their post office is located or whether it should be closed. 
I think that is wrong. I regret saying this, but the conferees on the bill stripped our amendment, even though it passed the Senate 76 to 21, and even though it had very large support in the House. 
That is just not right. It is not fair. It is not fair to those folks in communities who very much rely on their post office. We are just asking for a fair process so the local people have the opportunity to have some say in their community so that Uncle Sam, Uncle Postal Service, doesn't ram down their throats a solution that doesn't make sense. I regret to say the conferees did not include it, and next year I will reintroduce the legislation, I am sure, along with Senator Jeffords. That provision, unfortunately, is not in the bill. 
Again, I thank my good friend from Utah, and I yield the floor.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, all Americans deserve access to primary health care and emergency treatment. But in rural America the delivery of these services is often difficult, given the vast distances and extreme weather conditions that typically prevail. Just as small communities' transportation, education and housing needs are different than those of urban areas, so too are their mechanisms for delivering health care. 
That's why Senator Daschle and I are introducing the Promoting Health In Rural Areas Act of 1998. PHIRA would, among other things: reformulate the Adjusted Average Per Capita Cost for Medicare payments to managed care; direct Medicare payments to tribally-owned hospitals; rebase provisions for Sole Community Hospitals; revise the underserved criteria used by the Office of Personnel Management; and allow recently-closed hospitals to be designated on a Critical Access basis. 
As you know, 1997 reforms went a long way towards ensuring the viability of the Medicare program, including its use by rural Americans. For example, under Section 4201 of the 1997 BBA, Congress established a rural-friendly hospital program. Modeled on a demonstration project conducted in my state of Montana, the new program allows a rural hospital to convert to a limited-service hospital status, called a `Critical Access Hospital,' or CAH. These hospitals are given flexibility and relief from Medicare regulations designed for full-size, full-service acute care hospitals. By giving these smaller hospitals greater latitude on staffing and other cumbersome federal regulations, it is easier for rural hospitals to organize their staffs and facilities based on patient needs. 
If the demonstration project on which this new program is based is any indication (and I certainly hope that it is), Congress can be proud of this new law. And rural folks across the country will benefit. They will receive access to quality care in a way that meets their unique needs, and they will be assisted in preserving a way of life that is increasingly threatened by the urban- and sub-urbanization of America. 
Yet despite many positive developments, it has become clear to the Minority Leader and I that much still needs to be done to facilitate the delivery of rural health services. In order to meet those needs, the Promoting Health in Rural Areas Act will do several things. First, it will change the Office of Personnel Management's underserved designation criteria by changing the way the Office of Personnel Management designates rural areas. Back in the 1960s, underserved areas were designated on a state-by-state basis. Now, the Department of Health and Human Services has the sophistication to designate areas by county, or even sub-county. The bill we are introducing today would require OPM to designate underserved areas on a county-by-county, not state-by-state, basis. 
Second, PHIRA would direct Medicare payments to tribally-owned hospitals. As you know, Mr. President, a demonstration project conducted in Alaska, Mississippi and Oklahoma allowed four tribal health care providers operating Indian Health Services hospitals to bill Medicare and Medicaid directly. The demo project increased efficiency and, by allowing providers to directly bill Medicare, provided badly-needed revenue. Our bill would expand the demonstration project nationwide and make it permanent. 
Mr. President, our bill would also allow recently-closed hospitals to be designated as Criticala Access Hospitals. Under the 1997 law establishing the Critical Access Hospital program, a closed or downsized hospital does not qualify. Our bill would allow a hospital that had closed within the last five years to qualify for conversion to CAH status. 
Our bill also addresses rural needs for Medicare Graduate Medical Education (GME). As you know, BBA mandated a cap on the number of residents a teaching hospital is allowed to train. Because this provision threatens to exacerbate an already serious shortage of physicians in rural America, our bill would allow programs training residents targeted for rural areas to be exempt from the cap. 
Mr. President, by reforming the way health care is delivered in rural areas, we are not only making government more efficient, we are making agencies more accountable. And we are preserving a way of life that American pioneers established long ago and that rural Americans continue today. It is in many ways a simpler lifestyle, uncomplicated by traffic, smog and a desire to get everything done yesterday. But it is also a difficult way of life, characterized by harsh weather, long distances, and the historic tendency of the Federal Government to view all areas--rural or urban--through a one-size-fits-all lens. I invite senators to join the Minority Leader and I today, to ensure that our rural residents are given proper access to the health care they need. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support for the nomination of William A. Fletcher to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Mr. Fletcher has proven himself superbly qualified for this position. A man of deep personal integrity, of sound judgement and a well respected legal scholar, Mr. Fletcher's nomination is certainly deserved and given that five judgeships remain vacant on the Ninth Circuit, his confirmation is well past due. 
Mr. Fletcher's qualifications for this position are truly remarkable, Mr. President. He is a graduate of Harvard University and a Rhodes Scholar. William Fletcher earned his law degree from Yale, clerked at the United States Supreme Court, and has dedicated himself to a career of exploring legal theories as a professor and as an esteemed author. 
Fletcher has been a professor at Boalt Hall since 1977 where he was awarded the Distinguished Teaching Award in 1993, an honor bestowed annually upon the five finest faculty members on the Berkley campus. Fletcher has also served as a visiting professor at the University of Michigan, Stanford Law School, Hastings College of Law, and the University of Cologne, and he has served as an instructor at the Salzburg Seminars. 
Professor Fletcher's scholarly works include influential law review articles that have been immensely useful to both academics and practitioners. His works include published articles relating to the topics of civil procedure and federal courts, such as standing and the Eleventh Amendment, sovereign immunity and federal common law. In exploring the law and authoring these esteemed articles, Fletcher demonstrates his uncanny powers of analysis and steadfast objectivity. 
In addition to my support Mr. President, William Fletcher's nomination enjoys broad support across political and ideological spectrums. He has been endorsed not only by an extensive array of his peers throughout the country, but also by a number of non-partisan observers and the American Bar Association, all of whom comment on the centrist, pragmatic approach he brings to the law. I am completely confident that Mr. Fletcher is the best possible candidate to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
So again Mr. President I would like to express my unequivocal support for William A. Fletcher as a highly qualified nominee to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. I will conclude by quoting one of Mr. Fletcher's colleagues in saying `If Willy Fletcher presents a problem [for the Judiciary Committee], there is no academic in America who should get a court appointment.'

 Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate a small business in my state, Big Sky Airlines, on their 20th Anniversary. 
Big Sky Airlines commenced scheduled passenger service on September 11, 1978. The initial flight flew from Billings to Helena with continuing service to Kalispell. The aircraft was a Hadley-Paige Jetstream with a seating capacity of 19. 
Today, Big Sky operates a fleet of six nineteen-passenger Metro III aircraft, with service to 12 cities in Montana and Spokane, Washington. The company operates out of its hub in Billings and provides connecting opportunities from Eastern and Central Montana to it's markets in the west. The Montana cities are Glasgow, Glendive, Miles City, Wolf Point and Sidney in the east. Havre and Lewistown in central Montana and Great Falls, Helena, Missoula, Kalispell and Spokane in the west. All of the eastern and central Montana service is operated under the Essential Air Service subsidy contract with the Department of Transportation. 
Big Sky Airlines has been through a lot in their 20 years of providing service in Montana. They've had their good times and bad. However, through it all they continued to provide service to remote areas that would have been further isolated from the Nation's economic centers without them. The Essential Air Service program is critical to these communities. Without this service, these communities would be seriously hampered in their efforts to attract new business or even to retain those they now have, resulting in further strain on local economies and loss of jobs. 
In my visits to the state, I frequently fly on Big Sky Airlines. In our state, to many cities, it's the ONLY way to fly. I've had lots of experiences, I could tell you about. However, I'd rather talk about the many families I've seen reunited as the Big Sky plane lands in those rural communities. 
I'd like to congratulate the Board of Big Sky Airlines and their chairman, Jon Marchi for their foresight and perseverance. I'd also like to congratulate the officers of the company: Kim Champney, the President and CEO, and Craig Denney, the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating officer. Kim has only been there a short time, but is moving the company in exciting new directions. I've personally seen Craig load the luggage, check in the passengers and send the airplane on it's way. He knows how to do every job in the company and do it well. 
I'd also like to congratulate John Rabenberg and the other members of the Essential Air Service task force for the hard work they do in their communities for this program. 
Big Sky Airlines currently employs 103 people throughout its system (all in Montana). And you can tell it's a good company to work for. Whether you are checking in at the counter, or watching the pilots get ready to take-off, they are very customer service oriented. It's a pleasure to fly with them, and Mr. President, it's a pleasure for me today to congratulate them on their 20th Anniversary and to wish them many more years of flying the big sky of Montana.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to support the adoption of S. 2131, the Water Resources Development Act of 1998. This legislation is our usual biennial authorization for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. It includes authority to construct projects for navigation, flood control, hurricane and storm damage reduction, emergency streambank and shore protection, water supply storage, recreation and ecosystem restoration and protection. These projects range from harbor improvements in Nome, Alaska, to shore protection at Little Duval Island in Florida. 
Since this historic Water Resources Development Act of 1986, when project cost-sharing was established, the Corps of Engineers has established a successful working relationship with the local sponsors of these projects. This partnership has proven to be beneficial for all involved, and we have continued it in this bill. This important principle, combined with technical soundness, environmental acceptability and economic justification guided the selection of projects in this legislation. 
The legislation also contains several changes to the Corps' program. It established new continuing authorities program that would allow the Corps of Engineers to undertake nonstructural flood control projects. It changes the periodic beach renourishment cost-share from the current 65 percent Federal, 35 percent non-Federal, to 50 percent Federal, 50 percent non-Federal. And it allows the Corps to use recreation fees collected above the current baseline to remain at the park where they were collected to be used for maintenance. 
The legislation contains 2 provisions that are very important to my State of Montana. One provision would allow the Corps of Engineers to provided needed emergency streambank stabilization in Billings, Montana. Another provision directs the Secretary of the Army, in cooperation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the U.S. Geological Survey, the Natural Resource Conservation Service, the State of Montana and all local interests to conduct a comprehensive study of the cumulative impacts of activities on the Yellowstone River. This study will give us a better understanding of how the natural flow and the man-made structures can best protect the river and its habitat. 
I thank Senators Chafee and Warner and all members who worked with us. 
I urge the passage of this bill and swift consideration by the House in order to enact this legislation in the Congress.

Mr. BAUCUS. I will use some of my time to praise you because that is very generous of the Senator from Mississippi, and it is typical of his generosity and his graciousness. He is a very, very fine man. 
Mr. President, sometimes we have to disagree with one another, and I am about to say that as much as I respect and admire the Senator from Mississippi, I have a different view than he has on this issue. 
Mr. President, I rise toady to express my profound disappointment in the conference report before the Senate. 
The words of our forefathers speak volumes about many topics, including this one. `Blessed is the man who expects nothing, for he shall never be disappointed.' These words were written in a letter from Alexander Pope over 270 years ago. They paraphrase biblical verse. I believe they speak to rural America today about the farm relief provisions included in this conference report. 
But more accurately they speak to the matters excluded from this package. 
This package should include meaningful relief for farmers in the worst economic crunch of this decade. 
Instead, it includes a pittance. While the conferees could have adopted a package that provided roughly 60 cents per bushel on wheat in addition to what farmers get now, which is virtually nothing in the market, the conferees did not provide that 60 cents. Instead, the bill provides 13 cents per bushel. That is how it works out. 
Frankly, I am stunned. I assumed that when the conferees met they would work out some kind of compromise. The Democratic package had eliminated the loan caps, it had the country of origin labeling, a provision providing for price reporting on a pilot project basis of fat cattle bought by packers. It included several provisions which would have helped farmers just a little bit. 
On the other side of the aisle, on the Republican side, there was not much at all; as I said, 13 cents as opposed to 60 cents, with respect to wheat. 
Mr. President, this package could only satisfy a farmer who expects nothing. I fear, as I hear from disillusioned producers across Montana, far too many producers expect this Congress to fail in the effort to help out. 
They believe instead that their pleas are falling on deaf ears. Their disaster is being seen in academic terms. Their future--the survival of their farms and ranches has become little more than a laboratory test of the farm policy enacted a couple years ago. 
I still believe in our producers--the top industry in our state. But that very industry that generated about $2 billion in sales last year will lose nearly $200 million this year. The Republican package will short Montana producers another $100 million. Then multiply it by our treacherous rank--46th in the Nation for per capita income--and you get a grand total of $300 million that Montana can't afford to lose--not on the farm and not on Main Street. Thus, what we do now portends what will happen in the next year in our rural communities. 
I think it is very irresponsible to end this Congress without meaningful relief for our farmers and ranchers. We need to eliminate the loan rate cap for this year and provide the funding to make it work. 
We need to mandate country of origin labeling on meat. And we need to require price reporting on the livestock sold each day. 
We need to treat this situation like the crisis it is to producers across Montana and across our country. 
Mr. President, I assumed the two sides would get together and work out some kind of compromise. That is not what happened. Instead, the majority party--I do not like being partisan about this stuff but I just have to be accurate--the majority party did not compromise at all. They just stuck with their 13 cents and also stuck with rejecting country of origin labeling on beef, stuck with rejecting entirely the pilot project on mandatory price reporting, instead replacing it with a study--essentially totally agreed to a pittance to farmers. 
I must say, Mr. President--this is no exaggeration, I am not exaggerating--farmers find this an insult. They find it a slap in the face. They cannot believe that the U.S. Congress is sitting here in many respects worried more about Ken Starr--certainly the majority side--than they are about paying attention to farmers and what is happening in the country. 
I have to tell you, Mr. President, it is really a bad situation in farm country. Bankers are not going to be able to extend loans. Worse than that, they are going to begin to call in loans. Implement dealers, car dealers, grocery stores, hardware stores in farm communities are finding their sales way down. That means they have to start digging deeper into their pockets. This is the worst situation I have seen in at least 10 or 12 years. And 10 or 12 years ago, in the late 1980s when farmers were facing about the same situation--again, through no fault of their own, because of drought and because of world conditions--Congress spent about $16 billion to help farmers. 
Mr. President, 10 or 12 years ago we spent $16 billion. Today the Democratic side is asking for, not $16 billion, $7 billion; and the Republican side said no, no, not even $7 billion, but $4 billion. We are saying, we on our side of the aisle: Hey, $4 billion is an insult. It is a slap in the face. 
I plead with Senators to go back again and see if we can figure out some way to agree, if not to the full 7, to virtually the 7. 
Another point: I have been in the Senate a few years. I voted for the New York City bailout, I voted for the Chrysler bailout, I voted for California disaster assistance. Guess what. All those efforts have been repaid--in spades.

Mr. BAUCUS. When we loaned money to New York City a few years ago, New York repaid that loan with interest, ahead of time. When we loaned Chrysler Corporation money to get its feet back on the ground, that loan was repaid ahead of time. I am just saying, today, if we can help farmers a little bit today with the conditions they face through no fault of their own, because the world market supply is so large and the price is so low, and the Asian economic crisis, at the very least that will be repaid back again in spades. 
I urge my colleagues, please show a little bit of statesmanship and vote to help this part of our country. It is going to come back and help all of us as a nation. 
I thank very much my very good friend from Mississippi, again, for his very generous offer to give me some time.

Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, in my 20 years in the Senate, I have scarcely experienced a more politically trying time than this. As the nation decides how to cope with an unprecedented political crisis, Congress must not only consider impeachment proceedings but pass spending measures to keep our government running. 
More important, a number of serious foreign policy crises demand our attention. From Kosovo to Iraq and Tanzania to Latin America, the need for American leadership has never been greater. 
To the extent that we can deal with these issues in a reasoned, bipartisan fashion, the world and the United States stand to gain. 
AMERICA'S ROLE 
Mr. President, we Americans have a unique role. More than at any time since the early years of the cold war, the world looks to us as a guarantor of peace in regions from Kosovo to Central Africa to Cambodia and the Persian Gulf; as a leader in the quest for prosperity, as we look toward more fair and open trade and an effective approach to the financial crisis; as the pace-setter in science and technology; and as an example of effective democratic government and respect for human rights. 
This is a demanding role. We may not have sought it. Some of us may not entirely welcome it. But it is a role that in this post-cold-war world nobody else can fulfill. 
Japan is in the midst of a deep financial crisis; Russia and China still in the process of economic reform; Europe concentrated on deepening and expanding the EU. Only the United States can lead. 
As the world's largest economy and most trusted trading partner, the United States is unique. I find this sentiment continually reinforced as I travel to Asia, Europe and South America. My counterparts there tell me that there is no one with whom they would rather do business than Americans. 
Our openness, respect for the rule of law and willingness to innovate mark the United States as the global leader. It's why we won the cold war, and it's why we are viewed as a relative safe haven in these times of global financial instability. 
Mr. President, we are also the world's foremost cultural power. America is the birthplace of the Internet and more than 80 percent of World Wide Web material is in English; our movies dominate over 70 percent of the European market, more than half that of Japan; and there are increasingly few countries where one cannot order a Big Mac in English, pay for it in U.S. dollars and wash it down with a Coke or Pepsi. 
Mr. President, I may sound biased, but I think it appropriate that if there is to be a world superpower, the United States should be it. We are not an imperialist country; we respect human rights; we have open markets; and we are the foremost example of this experiment called democracy. 
It has been said that our Founding Fathers envisioned a governmental system that is fragmented and dispersed of power. Our Founding Fathers succeeded. Neither the President nor the Congress nor the Judiciary has an inordinate ability to effect change, and that sets us apart from parliamentary systems of government. 
But this is the system we have, and while we must accept its limitations, we must also praise its virtues for making us the wealthiest and most powerful nation in the history of the world. 
We must also work especially hard to facilitate more contact between Congress and the Executive, and between the parties that make up our unique political system. 
And we must accept that despite the current political crisis, Bill Clinton is still our President. Whatever the outcome of impeachment proceedings, crises the world over will not wait. 
Americans have a duty--bipartisan, bicameral, and bi-institutional--to lead. 
Like or not, this is a role we must fulfill--for the sale of our own people, because if we do not lead, Americans will pay the price in a more turbulent, dangerous world. 
So while we may at times have differences, as individuals or as Democrats and Republicans, we must also at times put these differences aside and remember our larger responsibililities.

Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I stand before you today with a heavy heart. 
Why? Because I am extremely disappointed and terribly frustrated that despite our best efforts, the Agriculture appropriations conference report has completely missed the mark in responding to the crisis in farm and ranch country. 
As I see it, we had four issues that were worthy of bipartisan support in this conference. 
Proposals that would have delivered immediate support to our producers suffering from unusually low prices and natural disasters. 
Disaster assistance is necessary; uncapping those market assistance loans is necessary; mandatory price reporting; and, improved meat labeling--all would have helped just a little but would still have helped tremendously in view of the depths of the situation. 
Perhaps we've come to a meeting of the minds on natural disaster assistance. And, we should. No one can argue that drought, disease, flooding, and now hurricanes have devastated crops across the board and across the country. 
But what brought us to this point in the first place; that is, the crisis facing rural America? Extraordinarily low prices, prices rivaling the disaster of the 1980s, with no end in sight. And what did our Republican ag conferees deliver? Thirteen cents a bushel for wheat. 
To be honest, it is an outrage, it is an insult, it is a slap in the face to every hard-working, struggling, desperate grain farmer. And the so-called `relief' is equally inadequate for every commodity. 
The agriculture conference committee looked at the options, including a package offered by Senators Daschle and Harkin that would have lifted loan caps and extended the term of the marketing loan. But they shot it through the heart. 
We should have laid aside our partisan politics and done what was right for folks back home--giving them relief enough to make it through the crisis so they don't lose their family farm this year. The Daschle-Harkin plan to lift loan caps would give our producers roughly 60 cents a bushel--not 13 cents but 60 cents--a far cry from the pittance included in the conference report. 
I think we can do better. We must do better. In the 1980s we spent nearly $16 billion in just 1 year to get through that agriculture crisis. Now we are asking for half of that on a one-time, 1-year bases. Is that too much to ask? Too much to ask to help provide some relief? 
In Montana, the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that the Daschle-Harkin plan would provide Montana producers with $100 million more than the plan of 13 cents proposed by the other side. Every precious dollar counts to those in Montana's largest industry. 
What happened to the other parts of the package that passed the Senate--price reporting and mandatory imported meat labeling? We lost the fight to the House--an easy fight, a bipartisan fight. The result now is that we have a 6-month study on both price reporting and meat labeling--just a study. 
You tell me how I can tell folks back home that they have to wait for a report when they already know things aren't right in the market. They see it every day. I hear it every day in telephone calls I make to home. When I go home and talk to producers worried about holding onto the farm, or the ranch, or passing it on to their children, these people aren't complainers, they are hard workers who believe in the land and doing what is best for their community. 
If we do not help them, no one will. We don't need to study the problem more. Rather, we need to fix it. What will this conference report send home? It will send home rhetoric, not help them as they need help. 
Madam President, we still have time. The clock is ticking. But I say let's get to work. We have to work together on both sides of the aisle to help people in our country, people who are not Democrats, people who are not Republicans, people who are not Independents--people who are America's farmers. 
A decent cash influx for bad prices should be part of a bipartisan package; adequate disaster assistance and real price reporting and meat labeling. That is not asking much at all. That is what we should together agree to. Then together we can send a message from both sides of the aisle that we won't go home emptyhanded; that we are here to help our people; that this Congress did something right. It is simple. We should have sent this bill back to conference and crafted a package that would have really done something to halt this crisis. That is no longer an option. 
I encourage my colleagues to vote against the conference report which will be before us. If the report is not adopted, that is, the vote is not successful, then I say let's go back to work and do the right thing. On the other hand, if the vote on the conference report is successful, as it may well be, then I expect the President will veto it, as he should. Maybe then we can sit down and roll up our sleeves and figure out a way to adequately help our people. 
I thank the Chair. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join today with Senator Chafee and a bipartisan group of our colleagues from the Finance Committee including Ms. Carol Mosley-Braun in introducing the Structured Settlement Protection Act. 
Companion legislation has been introduced in the House (H.R. 4314) by Representatives Clay Shaw and Pete Stark. The House legislation is co-sponsored by a broad bipartisan group of Members of the House Ways and Means Committee. 
The Treasury Department supports this bipartisan legislation. 
I speak today as the original Senate sponsor of the structured settlement tax rules that Congress enacted in 1982. I rise because of my very grave concern that the recent emergence of structured settlement factoring transactions--in which factoring companies buy up the structured settlement payments from injured victims in return for a deeply-discounted lump sum--completely undermines what Congress intended when we enacted these structured settlement tax rules. 
In introducing the original 1982 legislation, I pointed to the concern over the premature dissipation of lump sum recoveries by seriously-injured victims and their families: 
In the past, these awards have typically been paid by defendants to successful plaintiffs in the form of a single payment settlement. This approach has proven unsatisfactory, however, in many cases because it assumes that injured parties will wisely manage large sums of money so as to provide for their lifetime needs. In fact, many of these successful litigants, particularly minors, have dissipated their awards in a few years and are then without means of support: Congressional Record (daily ed.) 12/10/81, at S15005. 
I introduced the original legislation to encourage structured settlements because they provide a better approach, as I said at the time: `Periodic payment settlements, on the other hand, provide plaintiffs with a steady income over a long period of time and insulate them from pressures to squander their awards.' (Id.) 
Thus, our focus in enacting these tax rules in sections 104(a)(2) and 130 of the Internal Revenue Code was to encourage and govern the use of structured settlements in order to provide long-term financial security to seriously-injured victims and their families and to insulate them from pressures to squander their awards. 
Over the almost two decades since we enacted these tax rules, structured settlements have proven to be a very effective means of providing long-term financial protection to persons with serious, long-term physical injuries through an assured stream of payments designed to meet the victim's ongoing expenses for medical care, living, and family support. Structured settlements are voluntary agreements reached between the parties that are negotiated by counsel and tailored to meet the specific medical and living needs of the victim and his or her family, often with the aid of economic experts. This process may be overseen by the court, particularly in minor's cases. Often, the structured settlement payment stream is for the rest of the victim's life to ensure that future medical expenses and the family's basic living needs will be met and that the victim will not outlive his or her compensation. 
I now find that all of this careful planning and long-term financial security for the victim and his or her family can be unraveled in an instant by a factoring company offering quick cash at a steep discount. What happens next month or next year when the lump sum from the factoring company is gone, and the stream of payments for future financial support is no longer coming in? These structured settlement factoring transactions place the injured victim in the very predicament that the structured settlement was intended to avoid. 
Court records show that across the country factoring companies are buying up future structured settlement payments from persons who are quadriplegic, paraplegic, have traumatic brain injuries or other grave injuries. That is why the National Spinal Cord Injury Association and the American Association of Persons With Disabilities (AAPD) actively support the legislation we are introducing today. The National Spinal Cord Injury Association stated in a recent letter to Chairman Roth of the Finance Committee that the Spinal Cord Injury Association is `deeply concerned about the emergence of companies that purchase payments intended for disabled persons at drastic discount. This strikes at the heart of the security Congress intended when it created structured settlements.' 
As a long-time supporter of structured settlements and an architect of the Congressional policy embodied in the structured settlement tax rules, I cannot stand by as this structured settlement factoring problem continues to mushroom across the country, leaving injured victims without financial means for the future and forcing the injured victims onto the social safety net--precisely the result that we were seeking to avoid when we enacted the structured settlement tax rules. 
Accordingly, I am pleased to join with Senator Chafee in introducing the Structured Settlement Protection Act. The legislation would impose a substantial penalty tax on a factoring company that purchases structured settlement payments from an injured victim. There is ample precedent throughout the Internal Revenue Code, such as the tax-exempt organization area, for the use of penalties to discourage transactions that undermine existing provisions of the Code. I would stress that this is a penalty, not a tax increase--the factoring company only pays the penalty if it undertakes the factoring transaction that Congress is seeking to discourage because the transaction thwarts a clear Congressional policy. Under the Act, the imposition of the penalty would be subject to an exception for court-approved hardship cases to protect the limited instances of true hardship of the victim. 
I urge my colleagues that the time to act is now, to stem as quickly as possible these harsh consequences that structured settlement factoring transactions visit upon seriously-injured victims and their families.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am delighted that the Senate has taken up and passed S. 1719 and H.R. 3381, the Gallatin Land Consolidation Act of 1998. S. 1719, a bill that I have sponsored and that my good colleague Senator Burns has cosponsored, is identical to H.R. 3381, a bill sponsored by Montana Congressman Rick Hill that has already passed the House. These bills complete the Gallatin Land Exchange process--an effort that began almost ten years ago. 
In 1993, I had the pleasure of sponsoring the Gallatin Land Consolidation and Protection Act that completed phase 1 of this exchange. Like S. 1719, that bill was co-sponsored by Senator Burns. The House companion in that case was carried by my good friend and colleague, former Representative Pat Williams from Montana. 
Together, these bills represent a bipartisan effort where members from both sides of the aisle have worked in a cooperative spirit for the good of Montana. And these bills represent a broad community consensus in Montana about the needs of the Gallatin area for today and for tomorrow. 
Mr. President, let me tell you why these bills are good for Montana and good for America. In the early 1990s when we first began this process, the federal government owned every other section of land in the Gallatin Range. As people in the area were fond of saying, you could play checkers from Bozeman, Montana to the Yellowstone border. 
And while this pattern might be good for checkers, it was bad for just about every other purpose. The Forest Service could not manage this unwieldy land ownership pattern. Imagine the frustration of trying to manage every other section of land for elk habitat as houses and subdivisions spring up in the middle of your forest. And this pattern kept the public from even being able to access their public lands. 
Mr. President, this pattern may have made sense when it was created as part of the railroad land grants over a hundred years ago, but it does not make sense today. 
And that is why I am pleased that we have put our backs into this effort and, after ten years, are finally poised to complete this project. The pending legislation is supported by Montanans from all walks of life. Hunters and fishermen support the exchange because it will protect important habitat for elk and moose and will protect important fisheries. Conservationists support the exchange because it protects important grizzly bear habitat in the Taylor Fork. Loggers support the exchange because it will help deliver trees to the local mill in Livingston, Montana. And local homeowners, from the Taylor Fork to Bridger Canyon, all have endorsed this exchange. 
This consensus did not just happen. It was the result of a lot of hard work. I met personally with representatives from each of these groups and walked the lands involved in this exchange. I heard the concerns of Mike Liebleson from the Bridger Canyon Property Owners Association and I heard the concerns from George and Patricia Leffingwell. And we addressed their concerns. And we addressed the concerns of Montana small mills represented by the Independent Forest Products Association. And we met the concerns of the Greater Yellowstone Coalition, The Wilderness Society and other local conservation organizations. And last, but certainly not least, we worked closely with the Forest Service and the Administration to try to make sure that this bill reflected their needs. 
Throughout this process, the private party to this exchange, Big Sky Lumber Company, has acted in good faith. They have made numerous unilateral concessions to increase the environmental benefits of this exchange and to address public concerns. Their attorney, Joe Sabol, has been instrumental in pulling this package together. Without his efforts and those of Bob Dennee, Lands Specialist for the Gallatin National Forest, and Kurt Alt, Wildlife Biologist for the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks, none of this would have been possible. 
Mr. President, this has been a community effort. And, as a result, it reflects a community consensus. This is the way that we should resolve issues in the West.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I begin by first thanking my good friend from Alaska for bringing this up as a freestanding bill. One of the objections I had earlier with some of the riders in the Interior appropriations bill first on the merits of those provisions of the bill which I think in many cases were ill-advised. 
A second objection I had to the riders were just that, they were riders on an appropriations bill; that is, measures which have very significant public policy implications and very significantly affect our country, many of which had no hearings. It is true one or two may have had hearings, but, by and large, the riders did not have hearings. Here we are, taking them up and passing them without an adequate opportunity for debate. 
The American people, rightfully, get a little upset when Congress does not in the full light of day debate the pros and cons of issues, and fully air these issues. They don't like it when riders are slipped into an appropriations bill. I might add, there will be a lot more slipped in before this Congress adjourns in the next 10 days. 
I very much thank my good friend from Alaska for bringing this up as a freestanding bill. That is what we are supposed to be doing here, debating issues, what the pros might be, what the cons might be, and have a debate and see what makes sense and then vote. That is the legislative process, the way it is supposed to work, and certainly the way the American people would like it to work in our democratic form of government. 
Senator, I thank you very much. I want you to know that I very much appreciate your bringing this bill up as a freestanding bill. That is good. I wish, frankly, that the other riders in the appropriations bill would be brought up in the same manner. 
I might say at this point those who are opposed to the riders have not had an opportunity to move to delete them. That is because the appropriations bill has been withdrawn. It is no longer under consideration before the Senate. So at least we have an opportunity to debate one of those provisions, and that is the Izembek Wilderness issue of the King Cove--Cold Bay matter. I thank the Senator for doing that. 
Turning to the merits, on the surface, the argument of the good Senator from Alaska makes some sense. It has some merit. After all, we are talking about two very remote rural communities, Cold Bay and King Cove. They are not very far apart in miles, but they are quite far apart in terms of weather. There is a big bay between the two. They are different also because of the weather. When people are injured in King Cove, sometimes they may need to get to a hospital up in Cold Bay. It is very understandable. I appreciate that. 
In my State of Montana, we face the same problem. Very often in rural parts of my State people want access to medical care. They don't have good access. I might remind my good friend from Alaska he and I cosponsored a bill to grant telemedicine capability to rural States. 
In fact, we have both stated that Montana and Alaska desperately need better rural health care access. We have the same problem Alaska does. 
We also have crashes of medevac helicopters in Montana, just like the Senator from Alaska referred to in his State. We have mountains. Health care access is very important. I deeply sympathize with people in King Cove, as well as those in Cold Bay--particularly those in King Cove, who need access to health care. As I understand it, 11 people have died in plane crashes in the general area. In one case, four people were killed in one emergency medical evacuation. The other people lost their lives due to reasons other than medical evacuation. 
We have the same problems in my State. Many times, in Montana--and I am sure this would be true with respect to the proposed road, and it is true in Alaska where there are roads--the snow drifts. In the State of Montana, we don't get a lot of snow, believe it or not, Mr. President. There is a general myth in the country that, in Montana, it is cold and we get all kinds of snow. Our average precipitation, including rainfall and snow, is about 14, 15, 16 inches a year. We don't get a lot of snow. 
We are not like Buffalo, or like the snowbelt up in northern New York. We don't get a lot of snow. But when it does snow, it very often blows and drifts, as I am sure is the case in the State of Alaska. It is those drifts that stop the traffic, that cause people in smaller communities great difficulty in getting to a hospital. For that reason, we have a lot of medical assistance facilities around the State. They are small facilities to help people get better health care when they cannot immediately get to a hospital because they are so far away, because of bad weather, or whatever the cause. 
Sometimes we try helicopters and the medevac, but often in bad weather that is dangerous; it is not always a sure thing. We are also adding a lot of telemedicine, as many States are, for rural areas. Telemedicine has a very significant role in helping to provide better health care to our rural communities. Is it the sole answer? No, by no stretch of the imagination. But more and better telemedicine will provide better health care to a lot of areas. 
So I want to say to the Senator that I do sympathize with the need for health care in rural areas. It is a problem. But we have to ask ourselves, as almost always is the case, what is the best way to get health care to rural areas? 
In the first place, it is not clear that the road is the only option for providing better health care to the residents in King Cove, or even the best option for providing medical emergency services. 
A few years ago, the State of Alaska began a comprehensive study of transportation between King Cove and Cold Bay. It was a major study. That study is now examining three major alternatives to tie the two areas together. One is improved air transport. Another is better marine facilities. The third is a road. I have a copy of it here. It is the King Cove/Cold Bay Transportation Improvement Assessment, prepared by an Alaskan company in Anchorage in cooperation with Northern Economics, Anchorage, AK, dated November 1997. This is a draft assessment of transportation needs conducted by the State of Alaska, to determine better access to rural areas in Alaska. 
When it comes to emergency medical transportation, I must say that even this preliminary study shows that there is no single silver bullet. There is no panacea that is going to solve the problem the Senator addresses. After all, bad weather is bad weather--whether it is high winds blowing to make air transportation difficult, or whether it is wind blowing snowdrifts over a road. And I must say, many days of the year on this proposed stretch that we are talking about here, it may be impassable; there are snowdrifts. Sure, we have to get more highway equipment out there to open up the roads in the winter. Sometimes that can be done quickly, but sometimes not. An emergency is an emergency. 
Many times, in my State, roads have been impassable for long stretches of time--close to a day--because of snowdrifts. I would guess that the same could probably happen along the road we are talking about here. Indeed, if you talk to residents who live in the area and who have written letters opposing this proposed road, that is just what they say. It is very hard during certain times of the year to get a road open because of drifting snow. I have a letter here.

Mr. BAUCUS. When I finish this letter. This is a letter from a resident of Cold Bay. She says: `As a lifelong resident of this area, I have some great concerns with the proposed legislation . . .' She talks about the 25 mile proposed road. `When we are having inclement weather, are we to believe a vehicle could drive 27 miles in whiteout conditions, drifting snow, and winds?' She says that she lived 3 1/2 miles out of the town of Cold Bay for 4 years with so-called `road access' to Cold Bay. During the winter, she says she spent many months stranded at home, or in town, depending upon where she was when the storm came. She says that the drifting snow would be so bad that it would take days--that is probably a slight exaggeration--to get the 3.2 miles plowed enough to be passable. 
That is not the only letter we have received. Here are some more letters from citizens from Cold Bay, AK. They say that in poor weather conditions, such as blowing snow and freezing rain, road travel becomes equally treacherous. On the Alaska peninsula they could only make the road passable seasonably. That is their view, and they live there. They talk about an alternative, which is mentioned in the Alaska report--a small ferry system--and improving the dock facility at Cold Bay. They go on to say that this has been studied for a while, and with state-of-the-art navigational aids, marine transport is probably more reliable. I might say, that is probably true in one respect. That is because, actually, the weather in the bay is not as locked up with ice or as cold as we might be led to believe. I will get to that in just a second. 
I have now a letter from a doctor. He comments on the road alternative. He is commenting from the point of view of medical services in King Cove. Basically, he says that while flying is obviously potentially hazardous, the proposed road in an Aleutian storm or blizzard could be equally hazardous when one considers nearly zero visibility, the absence of other traffic, the long distance through very isolated country and, of course, the ever-present winter danger of avalanches. 
He went on to say that he is strongly recommending several measures which would result in a marked decrease in the number of medevacs. What he thinks would be more reliable in the event of emergencies necessitating medevac would be, foremost, the implementation of state-of-the-art telemedicine. He goes on to say that another option that would circumvent the hazard of avalanches and of isolated highway transportation would be a state-of-the-art ferry system. 
That is just one view of one doctor who lives in Alaska. I am not saying it is conclusive or determinative, but it is a view of a doctor in Alaska. 
I think we all agree telemedicine helps. I think we all agree that telemedicine is not the total solution. In fact, just in June of last year, I was very proud to have had the Senator from Alaska join me when we introduced the Rural Telemedicine Demonstration Act. We want HCFA to spend up to $2 million, if we can find the funds, for computer-assisted medical information for Alaska and Montana, two rural States that contain most of the remote and frontier health care locations. Senator Murkowski says that telemedicine has already proven to be cost effective and a practical answer to the Alaska dilemma of how to provide modern health care in a vast geographical area, an area completely unconnected by roads and with access only by airplane, snowmobile, or dogsled. 
Telemedicine is helpful. It is not the total solution, by any stretch of the imagination, but it is very helpful. There is no single bullet. There are problems with all forms of health care assistance in very remote rural areas. 
The State of Alaska, I might say, is studying different options right now. They have not reached a conclusion as to what the best option would be between King Cove and Cold Bay. One option is Coast Guard air evacuation helicopter. Helicopters work sometimes; they don't work sometimes; it depends upon the weather. 
Another option is improved port facilities and special marine ambulances. This doesn't always work, but it works very well sometimes. And another is telemedicine. We all know that advanced telemedicine is going to be quite helpful in more rural areas. 
I want to underline that this study by the State of Alaska on what the best transportation option would be between King Cove and Cold Bay is not complete. It is underway right now. The State of Alaska is trying to determine, itself, what the best way would be to provide the best access between those two communities. They are looking, obviously, at effectiveness. They are looking at cost. They are looking at the environmental impact. 
You don't need to pass this bill before us to complete the evaluation process. You only need to pass the bill if you have already decided to build the road. But we should wait to see what the study says before we go ahead and build this road. 
In addition, there is another study going on to address this same problem. In the transportation appropriations bill passed by this body, the senior Senator from Alaska included a provision for another study of transportation access. This is a study that would be done by the Army Corps of Engineers. The Senator from Alaska provided about $700,000 for a study by the Army Corps of Engineers to determine transportation access needs and solutions in Alaska. 
That means we have two studies going on. One is the State of Alaska study, and the other is the Army Corps of Engineers study. At the very least, I think it is premature at this point to authorize a road. Rather, we should wait and see what the studies come up with. Otherwise, I just think we are wasting taxpayers' money, particularly the Army Corps of Engineers money, if we are going to decide what the solution is in advance. 
It reminds me of `It's Your Money' on TV. We spend $700,000, and the State of Alaska spends State money, to study a solution. But, before the studies are done, the money is down the drain because Congress steps in and decides what the solution is going to be.

Mr. BAUCUS. If I might answer the Senator's question, I am not saying that, just because the roads in Montana are often impassable because of snow, the same must be true around King Cove. I am saying that is the opinion of a good number of residents. That is what they say, that very often snow conditions make the roads impassable.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to point out what the State of Alaska study is really all about. 
I have here on this chart the basic purpose of the State of Alaska study--determining what the best solution would be in terms of access between King Cove and Cold Bay. Let me just show you what they are. 
The first purpose of this study is to reduce the infrastructure maintenance and operation burden. It doesn't say anything about medical needs or medical safety. 
The point here is that these are two separate communities, and some folks in both those communities think that maybe they should combine schools and have one school instead of two. After all, there are about 700 or 800 people in one community; that is, King Cove. There are about 100 folks, as I understand it, up around Cold Bay. Why not? It makes sense to maybe have one school, and maybe the same health care facility, and maybe share power generation or the public works facility. The Alaska report says that this will reduce the cost of living in these communities. 
The first purpose of the study is to reduce the cost of living in King Cove and Cold Bay. The second purpose is to improve safety and convenience of travel between King Cove and Cold Bay. That is No. 2. 
We talked a little bit about safety. You might note that point No. 2 says convenience--not just medical safety, but also convenience. 
The third purpose, I might add, Mr. President, is really the most interesting. The third purpose is to strengthen regional economic development. 
King Cove--that is on the lower part of the map--is a major hub of the fishing industry. It has extensive fish processing facilities. But it doesn't have an airport capable of handling large cargo planes. Cold Bay does. That is the big difference between the two. Cold Bay has no deep-water ports. King Cove is just the opposite: deep water, no airport. Therefore, the construction of a road between King Cove and Cold Bay would provide a significant economic benefit to the fishing industry and to the local economy. 
Let me read from the State of Alaska initial study: 
A stronger, more reliable transportation link between the two communities would facilitate the movement of fresh fish between King Cove docks and the marketplace, allowing fresh fish from the processing plants in King Cove to be on a plane bound for anywhere in the world within hours. 
The cost of shipping would decrease as would delays, inconvenience and uncertainty caused by transportation modes that are expensive, inconvenient and dangerous. This would open up new markets and increase the competitiveness of the Alaska fishing industry. 
And later the study notes that commercial fishermen support building the road because the road `will provide the most economic, reliable, flexible and convenient means of moving their product to an airport'--that is up in Cold Bay--`capable of supporting 747 operations.' That is, airplanes, 747s. 
I can understand why the people down in King Cove would think a road is a good idea, to promote economic development. Again, the study says that improved transportation has three purposes--one is improving the infrastructure, the second is convenience and safety, but the third is economic development. Safety is only a very, very small part of the study here. We were led to believe it is about the only reason, but the fact is, the real driving force here is not safety. The real driving force here is to get fish that are processed down in King Cove up to the airport so they can improve market access around the world. 
Now, there is a huge processing plant down in King Cove. It is one of the largest in Alaska. That processing plant processes, I think it is about 38 to 40 million pounds of fish a year. 
The company is Peter Pan, which has the big processing plant down at King Cove. I am reading now from the study, the Alaska study:  
With improved access, major freight movements from King Cove to Cold Bay would likely consist of fresh fish and seafood from the Peter Pan plant. Discussion with Peter Pan's staff suggests that up to 5 percent of their product may move into the fresh market if good access is available to the Cold Bay airport. Although Peter Pan's total production volume is proprietary information, it is estimated their total product volume is in the 30- to 40-million pound range. Employing the 5-percent estimate provided by Peter Pan suggests that ultimately approximately 1.5 to 2 million pounds of fresh fish could move to Cold Bay annually. Packaging and jell ice would add an additional 15 percent, for a total gross weight of about 2 million pounds. 
I don't know how much you can put in a truck. Some say about 10,000 pounds. That means that if this road is built, there are going to be hundreds of trucks full of fish on this road to get out to the Cold Bay airport. 
This report also goes on to say that: 
Forthcoming individual fishing quotas for halibut and black cod, additional market efforts by Peter Pan could increase the amount by 25 to 50 percent within 3 to 4 years. 
So that is what is happening here --and I understand it; if I were in King Cove, I would want the same--a large fish processing plant wants to road-haul their product, about 2 million pounds of fish a year, to the airport. My calculation comes out to at least 200 trucks, maybe more, a year, and add to that all the other folks who are going to be traveling on this road. 
This is no small matter. This is not just emergency medical access to a hospital. That is not the issue at all. In fact, I have other data that show, again from the Alaska study, there have been no fatalities in air evacuation in the period of time studied; 95 percent got to the hospital from King Cove within 24 or 48 hours, 75 percent of the medevac transports from King Cove to Cold Bay had no delay. 
And I only use these dates, these periods, because that is the data in the Alaska study. I don't have any more current data or different data. Again, the data shows that with respect to medical evacuation to King Cove, January, mid-January, 1996 to near the end of June 1997, total medevacs were 20: No delay, 15; 3- to 4-hour delay, 4; 24-hour delay, 1. 
Not perfect but not too bad. And most of the air accidents that occur near King Cove have really little to do with medevac. There are other accidents that have occurred. 
And I might say, too, that Pen Air--an airline, probably a commuter airline, in Alaska--has about 1,800 flights a year between King Cove and Cold Bay--1,800 a year. So planes do fly in and out from the area; that is, King Cove to Cold Bay. 
The study also points out that there is no greater need for air emergency transportation here than in other places in Alaska--no greater need. That is in the Alaska study. Essentially, as I said, Pen Air now makes more than 1,800 one-way flights between these two communities each year, and they have had three accidents over 20 years. The State has concluded that the accident rate is still low and that--this is the State's conclusion--`that the residents of King Cove are in no greater danger than other Alaskans who rely on air transport.' 
So again to review, No. 1, the State is doing the study. There are many alternatives under review, and air evacuation is relatively safe. But there are other driving forces here that are pushing for the road, which brings me to my final point--the environmental impact of building a road through the Izembek Refuge and Wilderness. 
As has been noted, Congress has often adjusted wilderness boundaries. We have done it to correct mistakes. That is usually when we do it. We have adjusted wilderness boundaries because we have passed a wilderness bill and we made a mistake. We go back and adjust a boundary to correct the mistake. We have done it to accommodate preexisting uses that have been overlooked. That has happened a couple of times. We have also adjusted wilderness boundaries to provide access to inholders as required by law. But as far as I know, Congress has never authorized the construction of a road through a wilderness area to connect two points outside the wilderness area--never. 
So the passage of this bill would set a very important precedent. You would say it is OK to construct a road through a wilderness area connecting two points. The argument we are hearing is that this bill will not lead to the construction of a road through a wilderness area, because we'd be taking an area out of the wilderness, transferring it over to the refuge, then building the road through where the wilderness was and saying, gee, we are not building a road through a wilderness. 
Well, that is absurd on its face, Mr. President. 
Of course we are building a road through wilderness. On the map, as presented by my good friends on the other side, there is wilderness. There is a road through the wilderness. So we are building a road through wilderness. It is pretty simple. It is not rocket science. This is about a road through a wilderness. 
It is also through a very, very important wildlife refuge. Again, here is King Cove down here, and Cold Bay is up here. The road would go through this area. The wilderness section is right here. The proposal is to make this no longer wilderness and then build a road through it. Of course it is a road through wilderness. They say, just take these lands out of the wilderness. That is what the bill says. In exchange you get some other area. 
The use of the land in exchange, the net 580 acres, is land that is already restricted under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. So there is no gain here. The net effect of all this is still a road through a wilderness refuge system. That is the net effect here, that is what we are doing. 
Let me just address, briefly, why this is so important. We are now talking about a wilderness and refuge system that is extremely important. In fact, it is critical. It is critical resting and critical feeding ground for migratory waterfowl. It is absolutely critical. 
This is Alaska, Canada, United States and Russia. These are the Arctic breeding grounds. 
Let me back up. This little red dot here is the area we are talking about, the Izembek Wilderness area, the refuge wilderness area now in question. It is the major stopping ground for many, many birds. Why? It is very simple. 
Birds come up from the south. Let me mention what some of them are. One is the Black Brant, 150,000 land here in the spring and fall; the Emperor Goose, 100,000 in the spring and fall. Let me say, all of the world's Emperor Geese land here; all of them. All the world's Emperor Geese stop here at the Izembek Refuge and Wilderness. All the Pacific Black Brant stop there; all of them. Then there are Canadian Geese; 85,000 stop in the fall; Stellers Eider stop in the fall and winter. Shorebirds, 31 species, 300,000. 
`Why do they stop there?' you ask. What is so special about this location, this place? I will tell you what is so special. It is a wetlands. It provides food. These birds, amazingly, have flown, some of them, all the way to Australasia, a long way. And some of these birds go to Mexico. That is the Black Brant. The Canadian Geese go to the Pacific Northwest. Shorebirds fly as far away as Patagonia. Can you believe it? Birds that nest and stop off to feed and fatten up so they can fly, fly as far away as Patagonia and come back to Izembek Refuge. It is amazing. 
Basically, the birds come up, say, in the spring. They stop here to fatten up, to restore their energy after the long flight from the south. Then they go up further north. This is the breeding grounds up in the Arctic area where there is not as much food. It is good breeding grounds area, but there is not as much food. After the birds have bred, they fly south. They have to stop again here in the fall of the year when the summer is over to stock up again, get some food for that long flight to Patagonia, Australasia; these long, long flights. So this refuge is very, very important. 
Essentially, I would like to remind all of us really what is at stake here and what is happening; namely, No. 1, this bill is not needed. Why? Because there is a study going on, a study to try to find the best alternatives, what is right. 
No. 2, the driving force here is really commercial. That is the driving force. There is a very large fish processing plant down at King Cove. They want to get their fish to Cold Bay. I understand that, but it is not emergency medical evacuation. That is not the reason. 
And, No. 3, this road is going to very seriously disrupt these birds' nesting grounds. Why? If there is a processing plant down here and, as I mentioned--you do the calculations. According to the study from Alaska, there may be a couple of hundred trucks, at least added on, traffic back and forth, and then you could have more 747s. The Alaska study says the purpose of this is to fill 747s. That is what the Alaska study says, the 747s in Cold Bay. I might be wrong, I say to the quizzical look of my friend from Alaska, but that is what the study says: 747s. They may be wrong, but that is what the Alaska study says. 
So it is really to connect these two towns commercially, for convenience and so forth. That might be a good thing to do. It might not. Let's wait until we get the study and see what the study says. 
Remember, this is very serious business here. It is potentially setting the precedent, building the road connecting two areas outside of a wilderness area; that has never been done before. In addition to that, disrupting a very sensitive population of birds with 747s and other airplanes of that size flying in and out much more frequently, because of all the trucks going back and forth and often in very impassable conditions, because of snow conditions, it is going to cause a very significant effect on the wildlife there. 
I will just sum up and say I thank my friend from Alaska for bringing this up as a freestanding bill. These riders are a bit of a problem because they are riders, but as a freestanding bill we can talk about it and debate it. I appreciate the Senators taking good care of their State. This is something that some people in Alaska want. I understand that. But this is a national refuge. We are talking about a wilderness area. We are talking about a refuge area which belongs to all of us in the United States. 
I know the sensitivity that Alaskan Senators have. `Here comes Uncle Sam all the time, here comes Secretary Babbitt, here comes the Fish and Wildlife Service. We in Alaska are told what to do by these outsiders.' I understand a good bit of that because in my State of Montana, 30 percent of our lands are public lands and most of it is Federal. I understand that. So we have to find the right balance here, the right balance between the wishes of the residents of the State of Alaska as well as the national interest. 
My conclusion is the best balance between the two is let's wait for the studies. They will probably come up with some better ideas than we have already come up with so far today. We do not have to wait that long. The medevacs are working. There are all kinds of ways to address this. Let's let discretion be the better part of valor here and not adopt an amendment at this time. Wait a while and then get the best result there. I yield the floor.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I very much appreciate the comments of the senior Senator from Alaska on the bill. His State and the people in King Cove and Cold Bay mean a lot to him, and they mean a lot to us. The junior Senator from Alaska mentioned, and perhaps even some of the residents of King Cove wonder, if we are concerned. I say to these King Cove residents, who are either in the gallery watching or listening elsewhere, all of us are as concerned about your safety--your medical safety and medical health--as the two Alaska Senators are. Obviously, we are; we are all Americans. 
It is my feeling that maybe the best way to achieve better medical evacuation and better safety for the residents of King Cove is to complete the study--the two studies, actually. One is by your State, the State of Alaska, which is vigorously trying to figure out the best way to address better access between King Cove and Cold Bay. They are looking at various options--air options, marine options, road options. They are looking at telemedicine. They are looking at all the various logical ways to try to solve the problem. 
We all know there is no silver bullet, no one alternative that is going to be the total solution to make sure that if anybody is ill or in an emergency situation in King Cove that he or she can immediately get the best possible care at a hospital in Anchorage, or even as far away as Seattle. There is none. So we have to find the right thing. 
The other study that will be conducted is a $700,000 study of Alaska access issues by the Army Corps of Engineers. The study is at least now in the transportation appropriations bill. 
So we have a lot of alternatives here. I think really it behooves all of us, including the residents of King Cove, to find the best option. We don't know yet what the best one is because it is a very difficult problem. It is difficult because of the residents' inaccessibility to Cold Bay and other parts of Alaska. The Senator from Alaska mentioned that I suggested helicopters. I did suggest that as one option, but not all the time. Many times, helicopters make no sense; for instance, when winds are blowing 85 miles an hour. I would not get in one then either. That is not a silver bullet. It is probably a combination of a lot of different things. 
No. 1, let's get the best solution and not rush to judgment and waste taxpayers' money by throwing two studies down the drain. 
Another point I want to make is that the effect of this bill would say we are going to build this road. Some say it is a dirt road, some say a gravel road. Well, it is a dirt road, a gravel road. But they are trying to convey the impression that it is pretty small, no big deal. Actually, it is a pretty big deal. According to the Alaska Assessment Study of Needs the road is intended to be used year-round, with an average of fewer than 400 vehicles per day, including tractor-trailers carrying freight. 
The Senator from Alaska questioned my assertion that freight could be hauled on this road. Well, I don't know. All I am saying is there is the contention, according to the State of Alaska study, that tractor-trailers would be hauled. The reason that is mentioned, frankly, is because of the fish processing plant--a very large one--in King Cove. It is one of the largest in the State of Alaska, where 30 million to 40 million pounds of fish are processed. Obviously, they would like to have this road to send the tractor-trailers on. This road would be designed for two-way traffic; it is not just a cow path. Again, at least the fish processing company would like to have this road. 
Some have suggested this is not the only time we have adjusted a wilderness boundary. Several references have been made to the State of Montana, where there was a road--well, there wasn't much of a road, I say to my good friend who is now on the floor. It was for 4X4s to go down to the lake to go fishing. And then Congress enacted a wilderness bill, and it included the road in the wilderness area. It was a mistake. 
Why did that mistake occur? I say to my good friend, probably because it wasn't much of a road. But it was a mistake. There was a preexisting kind of a road. Wilderness was created in the area, so the net result was that the road was in the wilderness area, that is true. But after we in the Congress recognized our mistake, we changed the designation so that the road could still be there. That is far different from this case we are talking about on the floor today. 
We are talking about the creation and building of a new road through wilderness--building a road through wilderness. That is a totally different situation. Now, I call it sleight of hand to say, oh, no, this is not a new road to the wilderness because we are taking this area out of wilderness and building this road through it. Obviously, if you look at the maps, there it is. The map says `wilderness.' You can see where the road would be, and it would be through a wilderness. 
I don't want to get too bogged down in all this, Mr. President. The fact of the matter is that our minds are pretty well made up. I think it is important to make it clear for the record what is happening here, what some of the other reasons are for what we are doing here. 
Here is a photo. For example, this is a road--if you can see it. It is the kind of road that would be constructed in this area. It is a typical, good-condition road in Cold Bay, AK. As you can see, two vehicles can get by each other. As you can see, trucks could travel this road; tractor-trailer trucks could certainly travel this road. 
On the other hand, this is the kind of road, if you will, that now exists in the wilderness. It has been mentioned that there are already roads in the wilderness. There really isn't much of a road. It is the kind in this photo here that exists in the wilderness. As you can tell, it is not much of a road. You could not travel on that year-round. Very few cars could travel on it. 
We are talking about the construction of a pretty good road, up to certain specifications, which is not a highway, it is not paved, but as you can tell by the map here, it is a pretty good, decent road. In my home State of Montana, that is a highway. It is not an interstate, but that is a pretty good road.

Mr. BAUCUS. That is a photograph of the so-called road here on the map. Cold Bay is down here, and there is a road that goes up here. It is sort of a road trail that would connect with the proposed construction road. This is a map of this road provided by the Fish and Wildlife Service. That is all I can tell the Senator.

Mr. BAUCUS. There may be a difference in the road. I don't know. One more point, in case folks haven't been listening to the entire debate: My view is there is a medical need. That is clear. 
According to the State of Alaska, it is no greater, or no worse, than the needs of other similar communities in Alaska. There are several studies. Two are going on to try to address the best solution. The studies are looking at not only determining the best of three routes--air, water, road--but also trying to figure out how to increase the commercial viability of these communities. The real purpose here is to economic development. That is the driving force behind this road. 
To sum up, let's wait until the studies are completed. When they are completed, my guess is that we will find a better way to help the people in King Cove, and in a way that does not disrupt a very sensitive national wildlife refuge wilderness area where hundreds of thousands of birds stop over in the spring and in the fall to feed and store up food for the breeding grounds in the northern part of Alaska, or to fly south. 
The present occupant of the Chair wasn't here when I mentioned this earlier. These birds fly great distances. Some fly as far as Patagonia, if you can believe it, to the Izembek Refuge; to Patagonia and back again and up north to the Arctic regions in the summer to feed. 
I urge Senators, the better option is to wait for the study. This is a very serious matter--building a new road in a wilderness area. It might not be the best option for the area. But we should wait for the studies. 
I yield the floor at this time.

<TEXT>
Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this has been a good debate. A lot of facts have come out. I might just note parenthetically, I chuckled a little bit. Here we are at the late stages of this debate. I concede to the Senator he has won the chart war. I have never seen so many charts in a debate in all my life. I acknowledge to the Senator he has a lot more charts than I have, and they are pretty good charts. 
Also, he has all that staff there. I see the army--there are about 10 back there on his side. He has won the staff war. We have only a couple or three on our side. He has won the chart war. He has won the staff war. And he has also won the time war. He has used a lot more time than we have. I will be very brief. 
Basically, there are a couple of points I want to make for the Record, for the Senator. He asked, very interestingly: Nobody has answered the point that the Secretary of the Interior, the refuge manager, basically controls this road. 
The fact is, in the bill itself there are provisions that the refuge manager--that is, the Secretary of the Interior--works with--I think it is the Aleutian Boroughs--to try to come up with a Joint Plan for the operation of the road. But the bill further provides, if no agreement is reached, that the borough controls. The borough can just decide within 24 months that that is what it wants to do. 
So it is not quite accurate to say this road is under the control of the Department of the Interior. The fact is, as a practical matter, maybe earlier, but certainly within 24 months, this road is under the control--if there is a road--of the State. 
The second point: The State of Alaska is not for this road. The State of Alaska takes no position on this road. We do not have any correspondence from the State of Alaska, particularly from the Transportation Department of the State of Alaska, saying we want this road, we support this bill. There is nothing that says, `We support this bill.' Rather, the State department takes no position. 
Let me just read what the Transportation Department of Alaska says: `You have inquired about the status of our study efforts, etc.' I will not read the whole letter. 
Basically, the letter concludes on page 2:  
Until the Transportation Needs Assessment and the Facilities Concept Report have been completed, we will not be in a position to propose the preferred alternative nor will we know how the King Cove-Cold Bay project is rated against other transportation projects. Therefore we have no position on the legislation currently pending in Congress. 
I think that is because that is a sound conclusion. That is why the State of Alaska, at least the department of transportation, takes that position because it makes sense. There is the basic study that is going on. It is an Alaska study. My good friend from Alaska says, `Gee, we have enough studies here.' My answer is, light a fire under the State; get them to conclude the study.

<DOCNO>105-baucus-mt-17-19981001</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. BAUCUS. When I finish I will. Let them conclude the study so the State can recommend what alternative makes the most sense. 
He also said, `I don't know where the $700,000 is.' It is in the transportation appropriations bill right now. It passed the Senate. The language is there. 
I don't want to get in tit-for-tat business. It is not productive. He made the statement implying maybe this Senator has no idea about bottom fishing in Alaska and what the economics are. 
I am actually getting my view--it is not my view, but I am reporting what the Alaska Intermodal Transportation Plan says. It has a statement on page 13 of its plan. This is dated October of 1994. I grant it is a few years old. 
Essentially, it says King Cove's economy is almost exclusively dependent upon fishing and fish processing. It has been a major fishing center in southwest Alaska for over 75 years. The salmon cannery has operated since 1911; crab processing since 1958; fish roe processing since 1960. In the seventies and eighties, the bottom fishing industry expanded. Peter Pan Seafoods is the largest employer, employing 250 to 300 persons in its cannery operation in King Cove. Commercial fishing accounts for approximately 100 jobs. 
It goes on to say that because of limited access, today the seafood market in King Cove is restricted. I am reporting from the Alaska report. It further provides that most product is sold directly to Peter Pan. Peter Pan now moves some fresh fish--fresh fish--into niche markets they have identified with low volumes. Without alternatives, commercial fishermen must settle for the going rate of about 35 cents to 40 cents a pound. 
It goes on to say it is estimated that with better access--that is most probably the road to Cold Bay--to fresh fish markets, the same fish could be sold at a price of upwards of 70 to 80 cents a pound, nearly double what fishermen now receive. 
It goes on to say essentially that this access would provide for a lot more fresh fish access in addition to the frozen. Basically, 5 percent of their processing production, which would be close to 2 million pounds a year, will be moved by road to an airport to fly directly to fresh fish markets. 
I am just answering the Senator by saying this is what the State of Alaska says. I take the Alaska Intermodal Transportation Plan at its word, but if they are incorrect, then I stand to be corrected. 
The point about whether this cuts into a wilderness area or not, it is pretty clear that this road we are talking about does. By the way, when the Senator showed a picture of the tundra, he said, `Oh, there are no avalanches here.' What he was not showing is sections of the road down here which bisects streams and mountain areas, that is where the avalanches would occur. They would not occur up closer to Cold Bay. But this road does cut this wilderness in half. 
This is the whole area, basically, we are talking about, where the waterfowl feed. This is the road that would go up here and down back around to Cold Bay. With truck traffic from the processing plant and the other traffic on the road, it is pretty clear it would bisect the area. 
It is constructing a new road in a wilderness. The Senator says that is not true. I think it is true, and I will let people decide for themselves whether it is true or not. I say it is true because here is the wilderness right now and there is the road. It looks like to me there is a road in the wilderness area. 
The response is, `We will just take that out of wilderness and put the road there, and because we take the wilderness away, it is not a road in wilderness.' That is too clever by half, Mr. President. We know what is going on here. It is a road in the wilderness. We have never done that. We have not constructed a road through wilderness from one point outside wilderness to another point outside wilderness. We have never done that; never. 
I recognize that we may have to do that. If the only option to provide medical care and emergency services is a road, but we don't know that yet. There are a lot of options being studied. I say let's let the State of Alaska complete its study, or the $700,000 the senior Senator from Alaska put in the appropriations bill to study rural access, then we will see. If it turns out we have to have this road, I will be one of the first Senators to stand on this floor and reconsider my position, but we are not there yet. I don't think we should take precipitous action today and prejudge by saying we have to build this road. 
Finally, on another point, the President will veto this bill if it passes. I hope it doesn't pass, but if it does pass, he will veto it.

Mr. BAUCUS. In summation, I thank the Senator for the debate. It has been a good debate. We have been here, what, almost 5 hours. The Senator from Arkansas, the Senator from Massachusetts, the Senator from Tennessee, both Senators from Alaska have argued this issue. I thank the Senator, again, for taking this issue up on the floor and not as a rider on the appropriations bill. That is the better way to make public policy. 
Mr. President, I don't think there are any more speakers on our side. We are ready to accept the amendment and at the appropriate time vote on the bill.

Mr. BAUCUS. Thank you. 
Mr. President, first I will chime in and praise the Senator from Minnesota. He is a fighter. As all the residents of Minnesota know and people across the country know, if there is anybody who is fighting for people's interests and to help people in America--it is the Senator from Minnesota. 
He is particularly right, in this Senator's view, when it comes to the action taken last night by the agriculture appropriations committee and their failure to report out legislation that in some modicum way, in a bipartisan way, helps give some encouragement to American farmers. As the Senator knows even better than I, costs facing our farmers and ranchers have just continually risen over the years. Pickup trucks, combines, farm equipment is out of sight and so expensive. 
At the same time, the price that farmers get for their products, commodities has just plummeted. In fact, at least in my State of Montana--I am sure it is the same for the Senator's State in Minnesota--we face wheat prices of $2, $2 a bushel, with freight rates sometimes $1 a bushel, which has to come off of the $2, so that means the farmer is only receiving about $1 a bushel for wheat, which is nowhere close to breaking even. You need about $5, $6--at least these days--just to break even in farm country. 
I just want to again thank the Senator. He is a real champion when it comes to helping people. And I just want to let people know, who might be listening, just what a fine Senator he is and how he works so hard for people and people's interests.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, at some point soon the Senate must either return to the consideration of the Interior appropriations bill or else consider an omnibus bill that includes provisions relating to the appropriations for the Interior Department or, dare I say, at a time when perhaps the Interior appropriations bill would come to the Senate, not directly to the floor, but via a conference report, where the conference report is not debatable. But when any of those events occur, we are going to face the issue of antienvironmental riders which are currently in the Senate Interior appropriations bill. In anticipation of that debate, I will take some time this afternoon to explain why I and several of my colleagues intend to offer an amendment that would delete many of those riders. 
Three years ago, there was an attempt to fill appropriations bills with various riders--you know, those attachments that go on to appropriations bills that have virtually nothing to do with the bill--riders that made very controversial changes to our Nation's environmental laws: riders that would weaken, for example, the Clean Water Act, weaken the Clean Air Act, slow down the cleanup of hazardous waste sites, and prevent the protection of any more endangered species. 
We all remember what happened. The President vetoed the bills, demanding that the riders be deleted. Congress refused. There was a standoff. The Government was shut down. A fierce public backlash occurred, not only against the Government shutdown, but also against the effort to lace appropriations bills with antienvironmental riders. 
After that, we seemed to have learned our lesson. Chairman Stevens urged us to `get on with our work' and get the appropriations bills passed. We pretty much did, keeping controversial riders out of most of the appropriations bills. 
A few weeks ago that changed. When we took up the Interior Department appropriations bill it became, as Yogi Berra said, `deja vu all over again.' The anti-environmental riders are back. The Interior appropriations bill that the Senate was considering just a short while ago is replete with controversial provisions that would weaken the protection of our environment and environmental laws, our water, our forests and parks, and our wildlife. 
The administration objects to about two dozen of the riders in this bill. It says it is an attempt to roll back environmental protection. The amendment that I and several other Senators plan to offer is much more focused. It strikes only eight of the most egregious antienvironment riders. Let me describe them. I will be brief because I and perhaps some other Senators will discuss each of these at a future date in more detail. 
The first rider locks in new and existing rulings for commercial fishing at Glacier Bay National Park, AK. It jeopardizes the protection of one of the crown jewels of our national park system. 
The second rider grants a right-of-way to build a road through the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge and Wilderness, also in Alaska. For the first time ever, Congress would allow a road to be built through a wilderness area. 
The third rider prevents the Forest Service from decommissioning any of its authorized roads until it has dealt with every mile of unauthorized roads, the so-called ghost roads. This, in effect, would make it impossible for the Forest Service to manage the National Forest/Road System to protect public safety and the environment. 
The fourth and fifth riders prevent the Forest Service from revising any more forest lands until the Forest Service publishes comprehensive new planning rules. What is the effect of this? It would lock in old, outdated plans that no longer reflect how our citizens want their forests to be managed. 
The sixth rider requires the Forest Service to sell 90 percent of the allowable sale quantity of harvestable timber from one national forest, and one only. That is the Tongass, in Alaska. This would create a unique entitlement to take public timber from that one forest. 
The seventh rider prohibits the reintroduction of grizzly bears in Montana and Idaho, disrupting a locally oriented public process designed to answer the very question of whether and how reintroduction should occur.

Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Chair. 
The eighth rider prohibits changes to the management and operation of any dam in the Columbia River Basin without congressional approval. That would override environmental laws, make it impossible to protect the salmon and other endangered species, and establish congressional micromanagement of one of the largest river systems in the world. 
I have been in the Senate for about 20 years. I like to think that I understand the appropriations process pretty well. And in some cases it is perfectly acceptable to make policy changes in an appropriations bill, for example, where there is a broad consensus or an emergency. I have supported provisions like that, and every Senator here has probably done the same. But that is not what we are talking about here. 
We are talking about a slew of riders that go way too far, making dramatic and controversial changes in our environmental laws. In some cases, the riders micromanage the agencies. In other cases, they substitute a one-size-fits-all Washington, DC, decision for a decision that balances national concerns with the concerns of local residents. In still other cases they improperly favor special interests at the expense of the national interests. 
Some Senators will no doubt disagree with my characterization of these riders. They will argue, well, this or that rider is good public policy, justified on the merits. As with most issues that we debate around here, there will be serious arguments on both sides. But that is part of the problem. There are serious arguments on both sides. 
Each of the riders involve important and complex natural resource issues. These issues require close attention and careful consideration as part of the regular legislative process. But instead, they have been tucked away in a 200-page appropriations bill, or what probably will be a much, much longer omnibus bill, that we are rushing to enact before the end of the fiscal year--only days away. And if rumors of an unamendable omnibus appropriations bill conference report are true, the Senate may never get to the debate or vote on any of these riders. 
It is, to my mind, not the way to do business. We all know what is going on. These riders cannot stand up on their own merits. They cannot stand up on their own merits in the full light of day. The public does not support them. And the President does not support them. So the advocates resort to an appropriations rider. 
This is not what people expect of us. Time and time again, folks back home tell us how upset they are with these kinds of riders. I hear it all the time. I am sure other Senators do, too. You know what? People are right. They certainly are in this case. 
There is another problem with these particular riders, and that is that they are a poison pill. They will kill the Interior appropriations bill. Let us not forget the Interior appropriations bill is an important bill for all States, but particularly for Western States like Montana. It provides funds for our national parks, our forests, wilderness areas, and other public lands. 
Senator Stevens, Senator Byrd and Senator Gorton have done a great job with all the other parts of the bill. I do not want to overlook that, not for a moment. They have worked very, very hard. And I commend them for it. Frankly, I do not understand how they do it, how they find the time or the patience of balancing all the competing interests--funding our natural resource agencies, funding tribal programs that are so critical to Native Americans, resolving the controversy over the National Endowment for the Arts. 
They have done too much good work for us to allow these riders to sully and probably sink the bill. 
But that is what is going to happen. 
Let me talk a little bit about the official version of what the administration says, the bureaucratic version. The administration's statement on the bill says that because of inadequate appropriations levels and because of various riders, `The President's senior advisers recommended that he veto the bill as represented to him in its current form.' 
Now I will relate the practical version. We all know what this means: Unless this bill is cleaned up, it will be vetoed. And we will be back where we were 3 years ago, facing a veto, gridlock, political shutdown; furthermore, if these riders find their way into an omnibus appropriations bill they will only compound the mayhem, which will be an affront to open, responsible, representative government. 
I have great respect for my colleagues from Alaska and the State of Washington, the chairman of the committee and the subcommittee. They are good friends. They are good Senators. They are very good advocates. On the issues critical to the West, I am honored to work with them very closely. 
With due respect, however, I believe these riders go too far. They weaken environmental laws. They undermine sound stewardship of our natural resources. For that reason, these riders don't belong in the Interior appropriations bill. They don't belong in the omnibus bill, either. They should be deleted. 
When the time comes, I will offer an amendment to do just that. 
Mr. President, one of the riders that my amendment would delete is section 120 of the Interior Appropriations bill, which prevents the Park Service from limiting commercial fishing in Glacier Bay National Park in Alaska. 
I have a map of Glacier Bay National Park. Where is Glacier Bay? It is northwest of the Tongass Forest, in the southeastern part of Alaska. Glacier Bay National Monument was established in 1925 by a Presidential proclamation, expanded in 1939, and in 1980 it was redesignated as a National Park and Preserve by the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. 
Now, I haven't been there, but I understand it is one of the crown jewels of our National Park System. The area is basically all that is included within this pink line. This is all Glacier National Park and Preserve--one of the largest national parks, encompassing 3.3 million acres, including Glacier Bay here and the surrounding waters. 
Thousands of visitors come to the park each year for its tidewater glaciers, its abundant marine life, its scenery and outstanding wilderness qualities. A lot of tour boats come up here to visit the Johns Hopkins inlet here. It is hard to see this small photo in the upper right corner, so here is a larger copy of it. This is a photograph of Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve. This is a tour boat down here, and this is to give you an example of the spectacular scenery that occurs up in Glacier Bay. 
It also provides tremendous opportunities for scientists to study the marine environment, including the humpback whales. These creatures--here is a photo of one in Glacier Bay--feed in the bay during the summer months. 
Commercial fishing has been illegal in the park since 1966. For many years that prohibition was not enforced, largely out of concern for the commercial fishermen. As a result, commercial fishing still occurs in and around Glacier Bay. 
Let me add that this issue is not about subsistence fishing in the Park. Fishing for personal use, whether by Natives or other local residents, is allowed in the park; the proposed rule by the Park Service would not change that. The real issue here is commercial fishing. 
Since 1966, there have been growing concerns about the effects commercial fishing was having on the Park, its unique natural resources, and on the hundreds of thousands of visitors to the Park each year. For example, in the late 1970s, the Park Service noticed a sharp decrease in the number of humpback whales that used the Park during the summer months. To help protect them, the Park Service prohibited commercial fishing in the bay for shrimp and other species on which whales feed. We will get the map of Glacier Bay up here again. It prohibited commercial fishing here within Glacier Bay. 
The Park also provides a unique refuge for hundreds of thousands of people who visit Glacier Bay each year. In the last 10 years, the number of visitors to the Park has doubled. Many of those visitors come to experience solitude and quiet and escape from modern civilization. Commercial fishing is inconsistent with that wilderness experience. 
In 1997, the Park Service tried to balance all the competing interests in the Park and proposed regulations that would allow commercial fishing in some areas, phase it out in other areas, and prohibit it altogether in a few other areas. 
More than a thousand written comments have already been received. I will tell you where it is allowed and where it is prohibited. Basically, commercial fishing will be phased out in the bay. It will be prohibited in several small inlets, and there are about five of them. It will be allowed just outside of the bay here, still within the line; that is, coastal fishing would still be allowed. 
At this point, I might say, Mr. President, that 70 percent of all the commercial fish are caught outside the bay, not inside the bay. So what I am really saying is, even though in 1966 commercial fishing was prohibited--and it has not been enforced since 1966--the new rule proposed by the Park Service would phase out commercial fishing over 15 years within the bay only, and it would allow fishing outside the bay, in the coastal area right along the land here. And a full 70 percent of the fishing is outside the bay. 
In the meantime, more than a thousand written comments have been received since the publication of the proposed rule. The comment period doesn't close until November. Final rules are due out next year. 
That is where the rider comes in. Section 120 of the appropriations bill prevents the National Park Service from finalizing the proposed rule. Worse, it even prevents the Service from enforcing existing prohibitions against commercial fishing in the Park, such as the prohibition adopted in 1985 to protect endangered humpback whales, as long as the fishing complies with State laws and regulations. 
I understand the concern that the Alaska Senators and others have that the fishermen and their families will be affected by these limitations on commercial fishing. But I believe the rider takes the wrong approach, for four reasons: 
First, Glacier Bay National Park is a very special place, like Yellowstone National Park and Glacier National Park in Montana. In fact, Glacier Bay National Park is our country's largest marine protected area, with over 600,000 acres of marine waters. That is nearly the size of Rhode Island. So we have to make an extra effort to protect the Park, its whales, seals, and sea lions, and the wilderness experience many visitors are seeking. 
Second, there are serious concerns about the effects of commercial fishing. For example, commercial shrimp harvesting can reduce the food supply for humpback whales. The Park is also an important laboratory for studying how natural marine ecosystems can function. But it is very difficult to study a natural system if it is being fished commercially--in this case, to the tune of 4 million pounds of fish each year. If the Park Service cannot finalize the new rules or even enforce the existing prohibition, then this rider will put at risk the Park's marine resources. 
Mr. President, I have a chart here that is a little wordy, and I apologize for that. It says, `The Effects of Proposed Moratorium.' First, the effect on natural resources. It will prevent the Park from achieving its purpose as a marine-protected area; it won't be protected anymore. It would also allow trawling and other commercial fisheries that have been prohibited since 1985. It would allow commercial fishing in a congressionally designated wilderness area. Second, it will also adversely affect scientific research because the park is a laboratory for scientific study. Finally, the rider prevents the Park Service from completing a fair and open planning and rulemaking process. It just says: This is it, folks. No rule. This is it. The rider will stop the Park Service from implementing a proposed rule to balance local, regional and national interests. 
The third reason I am opposed to this rule is that I think we need a balanced approach. We will have to see what is in the final regulation. We don't know what is going to be in it. But the proposed rule tries to balance the need to protect the Park's resources with the need to treat commercial fishermen fairly. Again, commercial fishing would be allowed outside the bay where 70 percent of the fish are caught. 
The proposed rule is balanced, I think, because it divides the area into three parts. It allows commercial fishing to continue in marine waters outside the bay itself. As I have already mentioned, that is out here. It does, though, phase out commercial fishing inside the bay over 15 years. And it closes five wilderness areas--including Beardslee Islands, Adams Inlet, Rendu Inlet, Hugh Miller Inlet Complex, and part of Dundas Bay--to commercial fishing in order to comply with the Wilderness Act because these areas, I believe, are within the wilderness system. 
On the other hand, I must point out the rider will allow commercial fishing anywhere in the Park, as long as it complies with State law. In effect, the rider would turn over management of the Park's fish resources to the State. 
Finally, the best way to get to a balanced solution, I think, is with lots of public input and review. The proposed rules have been developed through a fair, lengthy and open process, and with ample opportunity for public input. I will put up a chart that shows that. 
Since April 1997, this chart shows all of the procedures that have been followed to allow people to comment on the proposed rule. The public comment period has been extended several times, I might add. Over 1,200 written comments have been received to date, and there are still 2 months to go. Furthermore, there have been numerous workshops, open houses and hearings on the proposal. 
Again, were it not for the rider, the final rule would probably be in effect sometime in 1999. There have been many, many opportunities for people to comment. 
Putting all of this together, I believe the best approach is to delete the rider. That way the process of developing a balanced solution can continue and we can protect Glacier Bay National Park for future generations. 
Mr. President, I would now like to turn to another section of the Interior Appropriations bill. This is section 126, which authorizes a right-of-way for construction of a road through the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge and Wilderness. Let me explain why I believe this rider should be deleted. 
The Izembek National Wildlife Refuge is on the Alaska peninsula, approximately 625 miles southwest of Anchorage. It is a major stopover on the Pacific flyway. The Refuge was established in 1960 and is an internationally recognized refuge that provides vital habitat to hundreds of thousands of waterfowl, shore birds, and other migratory birds. It also serves as a key denning area for the Alaska brown bear, and a primary migration route for the southern Alaska Peninsula Caribou herd. In 1980, Congress designated most of the refuge as wilderness. 
This is a map of Alaska that gives you a sense of where the Izembek Refuge is located. We are talking about the Alaskan peninsula, and it would be basically right in here. This is a blown-up area of this part of the Alaskan peninsula. There are two communities in the vicinity of Izembek: Cold Bay up here and King Cove in the lower right of this map. 
King Cove has a population of about 800 people, and Cold Bay, a population of about 100. They are separated by approximately 20 miles of marine water. They are linked by commuter air service and by boats. However, in bad weather, emergency transportation by air from King Cove to Cold Bay is limited. 
The State of Alaska is currently evaluating various alternatives to improve transportation between these two communities, especially transportation for emergency medical treatment. That is going on right now.

Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, as I mentioned, the State of Alaska is currently evaluating various alternatives to improve transportation between these two communities. One of the alternatives being studied is construction of a 30-mile road that would cut through 8 miles of the Izembek Wilderness and 3 miles of nonwilderness refuge lands. 
You can tell from the map here, this is where the road would be. And this is the area of wilderness that would be affected. From King Cove, around the bay, up to Cold Bay. That is one alternative to be considered. Again, it would cut through 8 miles of wilderness and 3 miles of nonwilderness refuge lands. 
Section 126 of the bill establishes a 60-foot-wide swath through the refuge for this road. In exchange, the bill adds 664 acres of adjacent lands to the refuge. 
The avowed primary purpose of this rider is to improve public access to emergency medical services for the residents of King Cove. It is a serious problem, one that affects people's lives and health. I do not deny that. But this is also about increasing convenience for local residents and enhancing regional economic development. 
My State also has vast distances and remote communities, although not as large a scale as in Alaska. So I am very sensitive to the concerns of the people of Alaska and certainly of the views of the Senators from Alaska. 
However, I believe that the Izembek rider is the wrong solution to the problem that occurs between King Cove and Cold Bay. First of all, the rider establishes a very troubling precedent. Congress has never authorized the construction of a road through a wilderness area, certainly not as a rider to an appropriations bill. If we do so in this case, it will be more difficult to hold the line in the future. 
Second, this road would have serious environmental consequences. The importance of the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge is internationally recognized. It provides vital habitat to hundreds of thousands of waterfowl, to brown bears, and to caribou. Its location on the Alaska peninsula makes the Refuge a critical resting and feeding ground for migratory waterfowl that pass through Izembek each spring and fall. 
This is a map which shows the migratory patterns of various waterfowl and other birds, such as the Black Brant--the purple line here. They stop here at Izembek. 100,000 Emperor Geese stop here in the spring and fall; 150,000 Black Brant, 85,000 Canadian Geese, 150,000 Steller's Eider, and about 31 species of shore birds. These are the Arctic breeding grounds in the summer, and parts of the year they go south to winter. It is a very important refuge. 
This rider, I might say, would cut this Refuge in half. It would fragment the coastal wetlands and tundra that are considered essential to many of these species. It would destroy the character of the wilderness area. 
This, Mr. President, is the picture of a typical road in Alaska that would be contemplated by this amendment. You can see what condition it is in. This is a very good road. In comparison, this is a road that now exists in part of the wilderness area. This is what is there now. This is what would be contemplated. As you can tell, it is a pretty good size road. It is no small little cow path. 
Third, and perhaps most significantly, there are many ways to address the legitimate transportation problems at King Cove without violating the Izembek Refuge: Coast Guard air evacuation is one; better port facilities and special marine ambulances are another; as well as telemedicine and other medical advances. After all, in bad weather, with high winds and blowing snow, a road can be very risky and often impassable. 
In fact, I might read a letter from the Anchorage Daily News. It is a citizen, Tara P. Fuller, who is from Cold Bay. I will put it in the Record, but her basic point is that this is ridiculous, this amendment, this rider, which would allow this road. Because, she says, often this road would be totally impassable with snowdrifts. When storms come, the road would have to be plowed.

Mr. BAUCUS. The State of Alaska is already evaluating various alternatives and there is provision in the current transportation appropriations bill, that the Senate passed in July, that adds $700,000 for the Corps of Engineers to study rural access issues in Alaska. That is already in there. Alaska is now studying various alternatives that affect rural access issues. 
With these two studies out there, one by the State of Alaska and the other by the Army Corps of Engineers, now is not the time to jump to conclusions and pass a rider which authorizes the construction of a road through a wilderness area. 
I say, let's let the studies examine the evidence, let the studies weigh the alternatives. Let's see if the road is, in fact, the best way to meet the stated needs. It may be and may not be. But the fact of the matter is, when you look a lot deeper into this, the real impetus behind the road may not be emergency medical evacuation. That is not the real driving force here. Really, it is that the folks there have an economic interest in having a road. 
I might say, too, that is true of many communities--not only in Alaska, but other parts of the country. I understand those needs. People move to and live in King Cove because they want to live there. That is their home. That is their choice. There are ways to deal with the medical needs that may arise, but I do not think it makes sense to put in an appropriations bill a requirement that a road be built when there are two outstanding studies looking at this issue to see what the best way is to solve the access issue, particularly with respect to emergency medical services. 
Mr. President, with that I yield the floor. I see my good friend from Missouri on the floor. I cannot, for the life of me, have any idea what he is going to talk about, given the State he is from and given the magnificent feat of one of his local citizens in the last few days, with the number 70 behind it. 
I very respectfully yield the floor so my good friend from Missouri can address the Senate.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to mention another anti-environment rider in the Interior appropriations bill. I have already discussed two of them. One is Glacier Bay and the other is Izembek. This will be the third. 
Mr. President, this amendment deletes the rider that limits the Forest Service's ability to close roads on National Forests that threaten public safety or the environment. 
Let me explain. The Forest Service has constructed over 370,000 miles of roads on National Forests across America--370,000 miles of roads. These roads, the ones that Forest Service has constructed, are called authorized roads; another name given to them is systems roads. Most of these are single-lane roads. They are relatively low quality, often built to harvest timber. They are just basic roads built to meet basic needs. 
Many of these roads, though, have outlived their intended purpose. They are no longer needed. That is, they are built essentially to harvest timber, a lot of them, or built for a specific purpose and that purpose is no longer in use. So the roads therefore are no longer needed. 
About 40 percent of the 370,000 miles of authorized roads are maintained to public safety and environmental standards. The remaining 60 percent are in poor condition and in many cases are a threat--a real threat--to the public safety or a threat to water quality or often a threat to wildlife habitat. 
In addition to these authorized roads, the Forest Service estimates that there are at least 60,000 miles of additional roads. These unauthorized roads are sometimes referred to as ghost roads. 
This is a photograph, Mr. President, of typical ghost roads. These are created when somebody decides that he or she wants to drive a pickup, a car, or a four-wheeler to a stream, or whatnot. After a while, a few people drive back and forth and we end up with an unauthorized road or a ghost road. 
Another example is here. Here is a young fellow on a bicycle. It is close, perhaps, to a stream. It is hard to tell from this photograph, but basically after a bit more use it becomes kind of a road--a ghost road. There are about 60,000 miles of these kinds of ghost roads that the Forest Service thinks exist out in the National Forests--roads caused by people, not roads that the Forest Service has planned or built. 
Again, Mr. President, just to recapitulate, there are about 370,000 miles of roads the Forest Service has planned on building. Most of these are deteriorating. Many of these roads were intended to be used as logging roads to harvest timber, and the timber harvest is gone; that is, the timber has been harvested so they are no longer in use. 
Then there are 60,000 miles of ghost roads not planned by the Forest Service and which are created by people who drive around in pickups or other off-road vehicles. 
Mr. President, the Forest Service cannot safely manage all of the authorized and the unauthorized, so-called ghost roads that cover our National Forests. It just cannot do it. There are too many roads. Too many miles of roads. As a result, many of these roads are safety hazards, and some cause significant environmental problems. 
Mr. President, let me show you these two photographs. These are photographs of authorized roads, of system roads, of roads the Forest Service planned--not the ghost roads. In this top photograph of this road, you can tell the road is washed out. It is just washed out. 
Here is another photograph of another authorized road, the kind the Forest Service plans on. What happened here? The bridge went out. Some poor unlucky fellow did not realize the bridge had gone out until he caused it to go out. The bridge just collapsed. This guy's pickup went down on the collapsed bridge on the authorized road. Obviously, the bridge has rotted out. 
In other cases, the authorized roads create environmental hazards. I might tell you what the top road is. This is a road on the Mount Baker/Snoqualmie National Forest that has washed out. These types of washouts often clog streams, as you might guess. They kill fish. That is pretty obvious. And in the middle of the night, they can be one heck of a pothole. 
When roads such as these are unsafe, or cause environmental problems, we have two options. One is to fix the road; and the other is to decommission the road. Just a fancy way of saying closing it. 
In deciding which roads to upgrade or close, the Forest Service sets priorities, obviously, based on public safety, based on environmental concerns, on a forest-by-forest basis. 
Let's face it, road closures can be a big issue in some parts of the country. I know that is very much the case in my State of Montana; people have strongly held views as to which roads should be closed and which roads not. 
These are not easy decisions for the Forest Service to make. But the Forest Service personnel by-and-large do the very best they can. And they do so after talking with the public. And they make their decisions based on what they think the public wants and based upon safety and based upon environmental needs. 
Well, this is where the rider comes in. This rider prevents funds from being used to remove any authorized road until the regional forester certifies that all the ghost roads have been either upgraded to U.S. Forest Service standards or closed. That is, the Forest Service cannot look at any of the authorized roads in a region until it looks at all the ghost roads and either closes or upgrades each of them. 
What does that mean? That means the Forest Service could not close any authorized road no matter how great a safety hazard it is until the Forest Service can certify that every single mile of the ghost roads, that is these kinds of roads--the little pathways--who-knows-where-they-are in the forest, have been either upgraded to either system standards or have been removed. 
For starters, this is virtually impossible. The Forest Service does not even know where many of these ghost roads are. More important, this rider does not take into account whether these roads pose the greatest immediate threat to public safety or the environment. 
In sum, this simplistic one-size-fits-all approach would wreak havoc on the ability of the Forest Service to sensibly manage roads in our National Forests. 
As I mentioned early, the Forest Service now sets priorities for closing roads on a forest-by-forest basis, based on what the public wants, based on public safety, based on environmental protection and restoration needs. A whole host of considerations go into it on a forest-by-forest basis or perhaps a district-by-district basis, 
not a one-size-fits-all national standard imposed on a Washington, DC, basis that you can't do anything with your system of roads until you either upgrade or close the ghost roads. 
This rider would force the Forest Service to inventory thousands of miles of ghost roads and spend limited taxpayers' money upgrading or removing the roads, even if they are not causing safety or environmental problems. 
Here is an example. Assume that the Deer Lodge National Forest in my State of Montana has an authorized road built to harvest timber, a very common occurrence. The timber has been harvested and the road is no longer needed, also very typical. Soon, the road is sliding down the mountain and it is unsafe for travel because of slippage and erosion and the road is clogging a stream, choking the fish in that stream, which often happens, too. 
If this rider passed, the forest managers could not remove that road until it had inventoried the entire forest and found where each of the ghost roads were located and then either closed all those ghost roads or upgraded all to system standards. Let me repeat that. If this rider passed, the Forest Service could not remove the road I mentioned that is clogging up a stream until it has inventoried all ghost roads, and either upgraded the ghost roads--that is, the paths--to road standards, or closed them. 
Plain and simple, this rider does not make sense. It does not meet the `common sense' test. It prevents the Forest Service from closing roads that now pose a very significant threat to public safety and the environment. It would prevent the Forest Service from doing its job. I believe the Forest Service should be able to close roads based on public needs, not on an arbitrary distinction of whether the road is authorized or unauthorized. 
To protect public safety and the environment, I believe this rider on the Interior appropriations bill should be deleted.

Mr. BAUCUS. One last rider I will mention. This rider is section 343 of the Interior appropriations bill which limits Federal and State actions to manage the Columbia/Snake River system. 
I note that the chairman of the subcommittee is the present occupant of the Chair. In dealing with this subject, I have the utmost respect for what he is doing, particularly the great job he did in the Interior appropriations bill, which has many, many good features in it. He has worked very, very hard. It is a very complex bill, with NEA, the Forest Service, and Indian lands. I compliment the Chair. 
With respect to this provision, we have a difference of opinion. I state that with all due respect. 
The Columbia/Snake River basin covers about 259,000 square miles, including large parts of the State of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, and British Columbia. It is home to several endangered fish species, including several stocks of salmon. The number of salmon has fallen dramatically from an estimated 10 million fish in the historical runs to about 1 million today. 
For several years, we have been trying to bring salmon back, in part by improving the operations of the river system. 
We have improved fish screens; we have improved fish ladders. We have barged salmon around dams. We have modified water flows to help juvenile salmon migrate downstream and adult salmon migrate upstream. 
These modifications have been controversial because they sometimes restrict other uses of the river, such as power generation, irrigation, transportation, and recreation. 
Like many others in the Northwest delegation, I have not been particularly happy with every decision that has been made. In fact, I supported a cap on the amount of fish-related expenses that is passed along to BPA ratepayers. We had to have that cap or else I believe the Federal agency would have gone too far. I also oppose some of the drawdowns at the Libby dam and Hungry Horse dams in northwest Montana because of the effects on recreation and the adverse effects on the bull trout. 
I have maintained, however, that we should work within the framework of our environmental laws. There are a lot of competing considerations, and one is the framework of our environmental laws. The rider that I am referring to, section 343 of the Interior appropriations bill, would change that. It would override the Endangered Species Act, it would override the Clean Water Act, the Northwest Power Planning Act, and the Federal Power Act. 
To put the issue in perspective, let me briefly explain how the Columbia/Snake River system is managed now. In 1995, under the Endangered Species Act, the National Marine Fisheries Service issued a biological opinion describing the actions that the Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation, and the Bonneville Power Administration must take, consistent with their other obligations, to save the wild salmon from extinction. The biological opinion includes both short and long-term measures. 
In the short-term, it requires several changes. For example, it requires increased flows during fish migration seasons, better use of spills, improved methods of barging fish, limits on ocean fishing, and the use of more effective fish screens and fish ladders. 
By 1999, it requires the Corps to assess the effect of a major drawdown of dams on the lower Snake River. This could include the breaching or removal of up to four dams. Those four dams are Ice Harbor, Lower Monumental, Little Goose, and Lower Granite. They can be seen on this map of the Columbia Reserve Basin. 
What does this rider do? How would it affect current operations? It would have two main effects. The rider provides that the National Marine Fisheries Service, the Corps of Engineers and other agencies must receive specific congressional authorization before breaching or removing any federally operated or licensed dam on the Columbia/Snake system. In addition, the rider says that Federal and State agencies must get specific congressional authorization before taking any action that would `diminish below present operational plans the Congressionally authorized uses of flood control, irrigation, navigation and * * * energy generating capacity of any such dam.' 
Let me address these effects one at a time. The first issue is breaching or removing dams. As I said earlier, the Corps is studying the breach or removal of four dams on the lower Snake River--Ice Harbor, Lower Monumental, Little Goose and Lower Granite. 
I understand the argument that over time, over the long term, breaching or removing the dam is the best way to protect and recover salmon. After all, if you return a river to its natural condition, you don't have to manage water levels to mimic the river's natural condition when fish migrate up or down stream. 
But we are not living in the abstract. In most cases, removing a dam is a big step with major consequences for power production, for irrigation, for transportation, and for recreation. For example, breaching or removing the lower Snake River dams would most likely eliminate Lewiston, ID, as a river port. Many farmers from Idaho, Montana and elsewhere ship grain by truck or rail to Lewiston and barge to Portland for export to Asia. 
I believe an action of this kind should definitely require congressional approval. But that is already the case. In testimony earlier this year, the Commander of the Corps' Northwest Division said, 
It is our opinion that the Corps cannot use its existing legal authority to remove lower Snake projects . . . New statutory authority would be required to undertake these actions since the proposed actions would eliminate or significantly affect specific project purposes provided for in the authorizing legislation. 
That is the commander of the Corps' Northwest Division. 
So there is not an issue here with respect to removing or breaching dams. The rider is unnecessary in that respect. Congressional approval already is required. 
This takes us to the second part of the rider. It requires congressional approval before an agency can take any action that will `diminish below present operational plans' the congressionally authorized uses of any dam on the Columbia/Snake system. 
As I read the amendment, there would have to be specific congressional approval before a Federal or State agency makes any operational or management change that would reduce power production, irrigation, flood control or recreation. I believe that goes too far for three main reasons. 
First, it is impractical. It would tie the management of the river system in knots. The management of the Columbia/Snake system is a very complex undertaking. It involves at least four Federal agencies: Bonneville Power, National Marine and Fisheries Service, Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation. It also involves the Northwest Power Planning Council, the States of Montana, Idaho, Washington, Oregon, the government of Canada, many Indian tribes and scores of public and private utilities. There are hundreds of people involved. 
To coordinate operations, the Federal agencies develop at least three operational plans each year: A flood control plan, a hydropower plan and a water management plan. During the spring and summer, a technical management team meets each week in Portland to review operations and make any necessary changes. 
By locking everything in and providing that Congress must approve any action that diminishes other uses of the system below `present operational plans,' we would be micromanaging one of the largest and most complex river systems in the world. 
The second problem is the congressional management may put several endangered species at risk of extinction. If changes are necessary to protect a newly listed species or further protect a species already listed to prevent it from being wiped out, the change would require congressional approval. Even minimal changes to provide specie protection may require Congress to act. 
For example, new scientific evidence indicates that spills are more effective at protecting fish if they are conducted gradually over a 24-hour period rather than only at night. This approach slightly reduces power-generating capacity. So under the rider the agencies would need to get congressional approval before they can make a change. 
The rider would not only threaten Federal efforts to protect the environment, but it would also threaten State efforts to protect the environment. Under section 401 of the Clean Water Act, when a Federal dam is being licensed or relicensed, States can impose conditions on the license in order to protect water quality. Many States do. For example, several States in the West have imposed conditions necessary to prevent dams from generating elevated levels of dissolved oxygen which can harm fish. 
Utilities have questioned whether States have this authority, but the Supreme Court has held that they do. 
The Gorton amendment would change all that. As I read it, a State agency could not impose any license condition that diminished power generation, unless it received the approval of the licensee or Congress. 
That would, in effect, eliminate the section 401 authority that States have fought so hard to maintain. 
The directors of the Western Governors' Association and the Western States Water Council share this view. In a joint letter, they say that, although their organizations do not take a position about breaching or making operational changes at any dam, the rider `appears to clearly have the potential of diminishing State prerogatives under section 401, with regard to the rivers and streams identified in the amendment.' 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission also takes this view. In a letter, the FERC Chairman says that the rider `would bar, absent specific congressional approval, State and Federal agencies from requiring or authorizing certain actions affecting the authorized uses of any Federal or federally-licensed dams on the Columbia or Snake rivers or their tributaries.'

Mr. BAUCUS. Third, the amendment will have some unintended, and perhaps dangerous, effects. 
Not all changes to the operation of the Columbia/Snake river system are made for the purpose of protecting fish and wildlife. Often, there are other reasons. 
Recently, there were concerns about sabotage of the Grand Coulee dam. The water levels were lowered, so that emergency repairs could be made. This reduced power generating capacity, probably worth a few million dollars. Under the rider, the reduction in water levels would have had to be approved by Congress. 
Another example. In some situations, it may be appropriate to provide more water for irrigation, at the expense of power production. Or vice versa. 
Or to set more space aside for flood control. Each year, the planning process starts by measuring the snowpack and predicting the runoff. 
In a particularly wet year, like 1997, operational changes may be needed to prevent downstream flooding, by setting aside more storage space in upstream reservoirs. 
In a particularly dry year, operational changes may need to be made to allocate scare water among competing uses. 
In many of these cases, under the rider, the agencies could only act if they received specific Congressional approval. 
Mr. President, we all know how hard it is to get anything passed around here. Any change that is at all controversial can be at least delayed, and maybe stopped completely. 
Do we really want decisions like this, that may need to be made quickly in response to constantly changing circumstances, to require specific Congressional approval? 
To sum it all up, this is no way to run one of the world's largest and most complex river systems. That's why we have expert federal and state agencies, like the Northwest Power Planning Council and BPA. 
Congress should set clear legal standards. When necessary, we must improve those standards. That's why I support S. 1180, a bill to improve the Endangered Species Act. 
Congress also should conduct careful oversight. 
But we should not require Congressional approval of the complex decisions that managers must make so that the river system functions smoothly. 
By requiring Congressional approval of any changes that diminish the use of the system below `present operational plans,' the rider goes too far. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

 Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to address an issue the Senate addressed yesterday, amendment #3616 by Senator Harkin. While I cast my vote against tabling this Sense of the Senate, I must admit I did so with great personal reluctance. I respect the independence of the Federal Reserve Board, and I particularly respect the judgement and ability of its Chairman, Alan Greenspan. 
Our country has experienced an unprecedented period of economic growth and stability. Congress took the politically difficult step of putting our financial house in order by enacting the 1994 budget reconciliation legislation. But the steady hand of the Federal Reserve Board and its Open Market Committee has helped that seed grow. With the able leadership of Alan Greenspan, the Fed has helped guide our country from the brink of recession to an unprecedented period of economic growth. 
But even the Fed is looking at the current economic conditions and re-evaluating its interest rate policies. We have a problem with liquidity of capital in this country, which makes it harder for other countries to stabilize their currencies. As they try to acquire dollars, two things happen. 
First, our foreign trading partners find it increasing more difficult to purchase American goods. Just ask any farmer in Montana whether this has negative economic consequences for our country and you will get an earful. If farmers can't sell their products in the export market, they cannot survive economically. Communities that are economically dependent upon farmers find themselves in their own downward spiral, as businesses who rely on farmers to buy their goods are also squeezed economically. This same pattern can be repeated in other communities around the country, whether their economic health is tied into farm exports or any other kind of exports. 
The second consequence of tight capital is that it can lead to what is known as deflation. It has been a long time since we have had to worry about a deflationary spiral in this country, but it certainly seems to me that this time has regretfully arrived. Our foreign trading partners need dollars desperately because of the devaluation of their own currencies, so they try harder to sell their goods to American consumers. The lower price of these goods drives down the price of domestically produced goods too. American companies cut production, which forces them to also cut employment. As unemployment begins to edge up, consumer confidence and purchasing drops, which causes further drops in price. 
So whether we can't sell our products abroad, or too many lower-priced foreign goods are being sold here, the result is the same--a deterioration of our own domestic economy. 
I believe the signs all point to an inevitable lowering of interest rates by the Fed. Whether it is done at this next meeting or at some future one, I cannot see another alternative. So while this is a hard vote for me, because of my natural inclination to defer to Mr. Greenspan and the other members of the Federal Open Market Committee, I truly believe it is the right answer not only for our domestic economy but for our global economy as well.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to report briefly on the effort to bring up the Endangered Species Recovery Act, S. 1180. 
When we were debating the Interior appropriations bill on Wednesday, Senator Kempthorne, the Senator from Idaho, indicated that he planned to offer an amendment that would largely embody the substance of S. 1180. 
I strongly support S. 1180. But we are no longer considering the Interior appropriations bill, and it is not clear whether we will again. I think the far better approach is to take up S. 1180 as a freestanding bill. After all, that bill was reported on October 31, 1997, almost 1 year ago. It is a solid bill, it is balanced, it is good for endangered species, and it is good for private landowners. It has bipartisan support. The vote in the Environment and Public Works Committee was 15-3. The bill was supported by every Republican member of the committee and by a majority of the Democratic members. The bill is also strongly supported by the Clinton administration. 
To my mind, there is no good reason why we cannot bring up S. 1180 for debate on the Senate floor. Moreover, that approach has two important advantages over trying to attach it to the Interior appropriations bill. 
First, we do not have the Interior appropriations bill. That is one big difficulty. In addition, bringing up S. 1180 as a freestanding bill assures full and fair debate and an opportunity for amendments. We are likely to get amendments from the left, from the right, from the middle, and who knows where. I am sure that we can work out most of them. 
Of course, I will oppose amendments that would disrupt the balance of the bill. That is the agreement I reached with Senator Kempthorne and Senator Chafee, Interior Secretary Babbitt, those of us who put this bill together; that is, oppose amendments that would disrupt the balance achieved in the bill. But every Senator should have a shot. In the end, such a process, I believe, will increase support for the bill. 
In addition, this approach--bringing it up as a freestanding bill--assures that the bill will be taken up under the leadership and jurisdiction of the Environment and Public Works Committee, and that includes any conference with the House. 
Members of the committee have worked long and worked hard--over several years, I might add--to develop this legislation. We should follow through rather than hand the bill off to an Appropriations Committee that is already bearing such heavy burdens as the fiscal clock winds down.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by the Senator from New York. First let me say that I have a great deal of sympathy for the problem that the Senator is attempting to address. When banks first began to install ATM machines, I remember the reluctance many consumers expressed about this new technology. They were worried about whether their deposits would be safe, whether strangers would find it easier to get into their bank accounts and steal their money. The banks initially sold consumers on the use of the machines by calling them a cost-saving measure--ATMs were supposed to help banks cut costs by allowing them to serve more people for longer hours, without the need for high employee salaries or costly new branches. 
In those early years, it appeared that these claims were paying off. And consumers became addicted to the convenience. No longer did you have to spend your lunch hour at the bank's drive-in window to deposit a paycheck--you could do it after work at the ATM instead. Consumer demand also led to an unexpected growth of ATM machines located in businesses other than banks. Now you can do your banking at the grocery store, the convenience store, the airport--any other place where there is demand. 
But the economics of operating ATMs in those remote locations are not the same as operating them in the bank building itself. It is a lot more expensive to service the machines, collect and process deposits every day, or to provide security. And the networking banks have provided means more consumers are using ATM machines at banks other than their own--again with higher operating costs. 
The convenience of banking virtually any place at any time has its cost. ATM fees allow banks to recoup at least some of those costs from the consumers using the services. 
I know that ATM fees rankle those of us who don't appreciate having to pay a fee to have access to our own money. And I also understand the arguments of the Senator from New York and others who claim big banks are making large profits from their fees. 
However, I also believe that ATM fees represent the purest form of user fee. If consumers don't want to pay the fees, they don't have to use the ATMs. But for those who are willing to pay, the fees allow banks to provide ATMs in more locations, making it more convenient to do our banking. 
If the D'Amato amendment is approved, two things will happen. 
First, banks will immediately re-evaluate the economics of all their ATMs, and those that are the least cost-effective will simply be removed. Rural areas, like those in my State of Montana, will be particularly hard hit. The low volume of usage, combined with the higher cost of maintenance because of the distances involved, will make many rural ATMs unaffordable for the sponsoring banks. 
Let me give you just one example sent to me by the 1st Bank of Sidney, Montana. Sidney is a town representative of a lot of towns throughout Montana and other rural parts of our country. 1st Bank has an ATM machine at a 24-hour gas station and convenience store located on the main street through town. Even with the current ATM fee, 1st Bank lost almost $8,000 on that machine in 1997. Now $8,000 doesn't sound like a lot of money, but in states like Montana, believe me it can be. 
I don't know whether 1st Bank will close this particular ATM if they are not allowed to recoup at least part of their costs by charging a fee. I do know that right now, hundreds of Montanans who used that machine in 1997 had a choice--if they didn't think the convenience of the machine was worth the $1.00 fee, they didn't have to use the machine. 
If the ATM is removed because the bank decides it isn't worth the cost, we have legislatively taken from these consumers the ability to make that choice. They won't be able to decide on their own whether the convenience is worth the cost. We will force them to find other ways to do their banking. 
Approval of the D'Amato amendment will also have a second consequence, that I believe we need to consider. Right now, those who use ATMs pay for the convenience. In places where the fees don't cover the costs of operating the machines, those of us who don't use ATMs, or don't use them frequently, help subsidize those who do. Eliminating the ability to charge those who benefit from the convenience of an ATM simply makes it that much more difficult for the rest of us to avoid these charges. 
The old adage `there is no free lunch' is very applicable here. Someone has to pay the cost of operating an ATM. If we prohibit banks from charging those who use ATMs, it simply means everybody else will end up picking up the tab. And it won't matter whether we discipline ourselves to do our banking inside the bank, through the drive-in window, or electronically in order to avoid the fees. Every transaction will carry part of the cost of operating that ATM, because it will be built into the banks' operating costs. 
Mr. President, I don't think those of us here in Washington, DC, should be dictating to consumers how to do their banking. I believe consumers should be allowed to continue deciding for themselves whether the convenience of an ATM is worth the cost. If enough consumers decide the answer is no, the marketplace will correct itself. Banks will be forced to reduce fees and cull out less profitable locations. 
But this will happen in response to consumer demand, not legislative fiat. I believe this it the right answer. 
I urge my colleagues to vote against the D'Amato amendment.

 Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Public Buildings Reform Act of 1998. Let me start by expressing my thanks to the Chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, Senator Chafee, and the Chairman of the relevant subcommittee, Senator Warner, for their support of this bill. 
Mr. President, the Public Buildings Reform Act will go a long way to helping Congress make wise decisions on public buildings construction. It will help Congress achieve some discipline with respect to the cost of new Federal buildings and courthouses. Specifically, the bill will bring some sanity to the Federal building and courthouse construction program. 
I have been working on Federal building issues for a number of years. And the more I have learned about the issue, the more concerned I have become. It is very important that we reform the Federal building and courthouse construction program. This bill will do just that. 
Why do we need reform? Because of the amount of funding that is devoted each year to new courthouse and other Federal building projects. We need to spend this money wisely and only on those projects that are truly needed. 
The Public Buildings Reform Act will help do just that. It accomplishes two major goals--prioritization of courthouse projects and other Federal buildings projects; and gaining control of the courthouse construction design guide. 
The Public Buildings Reform Act of 1998 is similar to legislation I introduced a few years ago. At that time, the Environment and Public Works Committee unanimously passed this legislation--which then went on to pass the entire Senate. 
However, the House failed to act on this legislation. So we find ourselves in the position of trying again. I and my colleagues introduce this legislation at this time so that the debate on public buildings reform will continue. 
I have been pleased that GSA and the Administrative Office of the Courts have made numerous improvements to the public building approval process since 1995. But these improvements must be codified so that there is no question that they will be continued in the future. Also, there are further steps that need to be taken in the area of Federal Government asset management. 
It is my hope that in the coming months, Congress will look hard at the public buildings approval process and will prepare legislation that can be enacted in the next Congress. 
Working with GSA, the Courts and others, I am confident we can take the steps necessary to assure the taxpayers that there are appropriate cost controls in place. That is our job.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank my leader from South Dakota. 
Mr. President, I think many minds on this amendment are already made up. I, just for a couple of minutes, would like to speak to those Senators who have not yet made up their minds. The point very simply is this: There are a good number of farmers and ranchers. I daresay most of them are in dire straits through problems and conditions that are no fault of theirs. They didn't cause them. 
Prices for their products are way below cost of production, whether it is wheat, cattle prices, whatnot. For example, in my State of Montana, farmers are getting $2 a bushel. They subtract from that $1 a bushel for freight costs and that ends up $1 a bushel. The price of a loaf of bread in the supermarkets is pretty close to that. There is no way in the world a farmer can begin to make ends meet in these conditions, and that is true for most farmers. 
The amendment before us is very simple. It just says take the cap off the loan rates just for crops that are harvested in 1998--not for next year, just 1998--to put a little bit of cash in farmers' pockets to help them pay the loans, to help them make the payments to the bank, to help them just a little bit. I must tell you, raising the caps is nowhere close to solving the problem. It is just a little bit. 
Why are prices so low? Very simply, because of worldwide production, countries are subsidizing producing wheat. 
Second, we are in dire straits because of the Asian crisis. Asia is not buying anymore. 
Third, because the U.S. dollar is so high. Farmers didn't cause those problems, but farmers are facing those problems, and in some parts of the country, there is a drought, there is flooding, there is infestation of insects. They are stuck. 
The only argument of any credibility I have heard against this amendment----

Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Senator. The only credible argument I have heard against this amendment is it breaks open Freedom to Farm and it might raise worldwide prices because you are raising loan rates. The short answer to that is we are not opening Freedom to Farm. This is just a 1-year, temporary payment to meet an emergency. And secondly, we have no idea what the prices are going to be next year. We have no idea. 
We can't let perfection be the enemy of the good. At least adopt this amendment to help farmers right now. We will worry about next year, next year. This amendment is very much needed. 
Mr. President, I very much thank the Senator from South Dakota for yielding this time.

 Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today I introduce the Lisa De Land Financial Protection Act. The bill that I am introducing would allow the families of disabled persons to keep the money that they put in trust funds to care for their family members. Individual states would have the option of whether or not to recover those funds. 
Recently, Virginia De Land, a concerned Montanan contacted me regarding a problem that her family was facing. The De Land family is from Missoula, Montana. Their daughter, Lisa suffers from a genetic disease that has affected her since birth. It is called Williams Syndrome. Williams Syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects about 1 in 20,000 births. Those who suffer from the syndrome are missing genetic material on their seventh chromosome. They are excessively social people. They have low to normal IQ's, however they are often gifted musically and have great social interactions skills. People who suffer from Williams Syndrome are almost always extroverts. 
From the time that Lisa was small, her parents wanted to be able to assume some responsibility for her healthcare. At one point the family tried to buy an annuity. In order for Lisa to qualify for programs such as medicaid and SSI, the family's lawyer advised them to disinherit Lisa. If Lisa had other money set aside for her, she would have access to medicaid. For middle income families, it is virtually impossible to support a child with a disability on their finances alone. 
Self Sufficiency trust funds allow families to use money in a variety of ways. The money can be used for reasons as varied as the disabilities that individuals have. For example, if an individual has to live in a group home, money can be used to provide that person with a separate telephone in his or her room. In Montana, these trusts are great mechanisms that allow families help support loved ones. These trusts let families provide support without disinheriting a child and allow them to have ongoing participation in the healthcare process. For example, if Lisa had a self-sufficiency trust, she would still qualify for medicaid and her family would still be able to provide some assistance for her. 
With the implementation of the Medicaid Recovery Act, any trust that was set up would be recovered by the federal government when the medicaid recipient turned 55, or when that person passed away. Lisa's parent's had hoped that when she no longer needed the money from the trust fund, that money would go to the rest of their children. Current law requires the Government to recover that money, denying the other children access to it. Many people with disabilities have a short life expectancy. In this case, these families would not be affected by this law. However, Lisa has a normal life expectancy and with this law, the money that is set aside for her health care will be recovered by the government. 
It is important for individual states to have the option to choose whether or not these funds are recovered. Families across the country and in my home state of Montana are seriously affected by this problem. It is time to make a change in the system that will help out average families in extreme circumstances.

 Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks regarding efforts to amend the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act as it relates to remediation waste. The Majority Leader and the Chair of the Environment and Public Works Committee recently concluded that there is not enough time to complete legislation in this area this Congress, due to the press of other business and the limited time remaining. 
I would like to commend both the process and the progress that has been made this year in discussions concerning remediation waste legislation. I also would like to commend Senators Lott, Chafee, Smith, Lautenberg and Breaux for their roles in this process. I believe that the RCRA hazardous waste cleanup program could be improved through responsible reforms that tailor certain provisions of RCRA to hazardous waste that is generated during cleanup. Targeted amendments in this area could promote cleanup, ensure meaningful opportunities for community involvement, and reduce cleanup costs, without sacrificing protection of human health and the environment. Republican and Democratic staff of the Environment and Public Works Committee, together with representatives of the Administration, have for several months been engaged in productive, bi-partisan negotiations to reach agreement on targeted RCRA amendments in this important area. Despite these efforts, there are still a number of issues yet to be resolved, which I had hoped we would resolve in the time remaining this Congress. 
The Administration contributed significantly to the progress made this year. We also received valuable input from representatives of various interests that would be affected by the legislation, including industry, the environmental community, state and local governments and communities in the vicinity of hazardous waste cleanup sites. We need to continue close coordination with a range of interested persons. 
I hope that next year we can resume this bi-partisan process. This year's work creates a foundation for efforts next year to achieve responsible reform.

 Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senators Chafee, Graham, Lieberman, and Specter in introducing the Promoting Responsible Managed Care Act of 1998. This bill will provide needed protections for all patients, while omitting the most polarizing aspects of the two major managed care bills designed by Republican and Democratic leaders. This bill seeks to establish a middle ground so that patients can be guaranteed quality health care this year. 
Mr. President, this legislation provides improved quality health care for all 161 million Americans enrolled in private health insurance plans, including managed care plans. The measure will protect the doctor-patient relationship, make information readily available, create quality standards, insure a timely appeals process, and provide patients with better access to care. 
By offering report cards on health plans, patients will be given the opportunity to make informed choices when selecting a health plan. This bill will also guarantee patients access to their specialists, and ensure that people have needed emergency treatment available wherever they are. Patients will not just receive stabilization in the emergency room, but will be guaranteed care afterwards as well. 
The bipartisan bill gives women direct access to obstetrician-gynecologists, and children direct access to pediatricians. Prescription drugs which doctors deem necessary to patient care, whether on provider formulary lists or not, will now be made available. Routine costs associated with plan-approved clinical trials will also be guaranteed. Gag clauses, which undermine the patient-doctor relationship by penalizing doctors for referring patients to specialists or discussing costly medical procedures, will be prohibited. 
Mr. President, under the bipartisan bill, independent parties would be given the authority to rule on managed care denials through an appeals process, guaranteeing that each patient has a chance to appeal HMO decisions. Enforcement laws will help guarantee these provisions. This legislation will allow the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Labor to levy civil monetary penalties to managed care plans which do not abide by the bill's provisions. Also, self and fully-insured patients will be granted access to federal courts to claim compensatory damages. 
Mr. President, in health care, quality patient care should be the bottom line. I believe that the bottom line is achieved by Democratic plan. But with a Democratic plan that is unlikely to pass in this Republican-controlled Senate, and a Republican measure which would likely be vetoed by the president, this proposal stands as a fresh start to significant managed care reform. This bipartisan and balanced measure will ensure that quality care prevails over political differences, and I urge the Senate to pass it.

Mr. BAUCUS. In the spirit of cooperation, although I have been allotted 20 minutes, I will be very brief, hoping I can pick up a vote or two. It is a good amendment, anyway. 
Very simply, the matter is this: In my State, and I know various other Senators in various other States, ran into a problem with the Postal Service. Namely, when the Postal Service wants to properly close, relocate or build a new post office, it has been, frankly, not the most sensitive operation in the world. That is, just close a post office, announce a closure, and that is it--giving the public and communities no say and no opportunity to comment on the closing, no opportunity to work out some accommodation with the Postal Service. 
There are many examples of this. Let me give one in Livingston, MT. The Postal Service decided they were going to close the post office in downtown Livingston, just announced that they will build a new building on the edge of town. The community was up in arms because they had no notice of this, they had no opportunity to try to work something out with the Postal Service. This is a very, very, very, popular part of town. It is the center of a small town. People go to the post office, linger, talk to their friends. It is basically kind of a commons. To have this willy-nilly moved out of town is quite disruptive to the community. 
So one day when I was in Livingston, I decided to walk over to the post office to see what was going on there. The Postal Service might have a good argument, but the folks also had a pretty good argument. So I walked over to the post office. They said I couldn't come in. They said, `Sorry, Senator, you can't come in. We have to check in with headquarters to see if you can come in or not: So I say, `OK.' I cooled my heels for 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 20 minutes; 45 minutes later they got OK and approval from the headquarters someplace--maybe the Denver office, I don't know--that I could come to the post office, walk around and see why they needed to move the post office. 
I wasn't being arrogant. I wasn't being unreasonable at all. I was just being a person. This is one example of the arrogance that we run up against. As it turns out, as a consequence of this, they are very embarrassed and sat down and worked out a solution with the community. 
My amendment is very simple. Basically, it says whenever the Postal Service wants to close a post office, and I am sure there are needs to close post offices, and there are needs to relocate. Whenever they close or decide to relocate, they have to do several things. 
No. 1, give notice. Give notice to the public, 60 days' notice to the communities being served. No. 2, have a hearing. No. 3, that they abide by the local zoning requirements of the community. 
It is quite simple. I know the Postal Service will object, saying, gee, Congress shouldn't get into managing the Postal Service, and we are not getting into the managing of the Postal Service. We are saying give the communities an opportunity to be heard. If the Postal Service and the Commission reject the community's demand, that is it. There is no right of appeal or judicial jurisdiction over any decision made by the Postal Commission after the public has an opportunity to comment. 
It is my experience that sometimes when a Government agency sits down with a community, in advance, and talks it over with the community and asks their opinions about things before making a decision of what they will do, that usually things work out pretty well. 
On the other hand, if an agency doesn't in advance go talk to the community, but just announces a decision arbitrarily, the community feels like it has not been consulted and it hasn't been consulted. The committee feels like they are taken for granted. The fact is that we are talking about the public. They are the employers. The employees are the Postal Service. I just ask Senators to support this amendment because it does give communities a little bit of a say in where the facilities are located. It is as simple as that.

Mr. BAUCUS. Simply, Mr. President, this is already in the law. A person may already appeal a decision to close a post office. The Commission then decides whether that is reviewable. We are not changing that. That is in the law today. Any person can appeal the decision made by the Postal Service to close a post office. That is in the law today. We are saying, at least give the community notice that they are going to close. If that is done, then fewer people are going to appeal. That is all this is. 
I just urge Senators to vote for something which is just common sense and reasonable. It is not going to be an excessive burden on the Postal Service. It is just asking for people up front to have an opportunity to be in on the process.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I appreciate the issue that is up before the Senate, and I have the deepest respect for the author of this amendment, Senator Hutchinson. 
I must say, however, that this is a very bad amendment. It is a profoundly bad amendment. It is a sound bite amendment. It is a feel good amendment, and if it were passed, I guarantee it would have profound adverse consequences upon our Nation. 
Why do I say that? I say it because there is a reason why the Tax Code is the way it is. We have to raise revenue somehow, obviously, to pay our bills. But the reason the tax code has gotten so complicated is because the American people over the years have come to Congress--to Members of the House and the Senate--and have said `here are some tax provisions we would like.' Members of Congress, by and large, don't lead. That may be news to some of us, but by and large, Members of the Senate don't lead. We tend to follow the American people. I'm not saying this is bad. We should follow our employers, the people we work for--the people who elect us. And it is the American people who, by and large, ask us to do the various things we have in our Tax Code. 
The home mortgage deduction has been mentioned many times because it is such a good example of what I mean. While it makes the code more complicated, there were very good reasons it was enacted and has continued over the years. There are a whole host of other reasons why the code has the reputation it has. We are an extremely large, extremely complicated country. More so than I think any one of us here realizes. There are so many different people in our country pursuing so many different economic opportunities, so many different business combinations. Our nation is even more complex as our economy becomes more global, and we develop more opportunities overseas. And various people in our country or its businesses have come to Congress and said these are some of the things that we would like because we think they will help the economy. That is why our code is the way it is. 
There is no doubt about the fact that the code is complicated. It is excessively complicated. We know that. We hear from our constituents all the time that it is much too complicated. But I think it is important to remind ourselves that there is a reason why, to date, we don't have a flat tax, why we don't have a value-added tax, why we don't have a national sales tax. It is because the American people have not decided which, if any, of the alternatives they want.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the second problem with this amendment I would like to mention is that it begs the question of what our current Tax Code is going to be replaced with. 
I must say there is something to the old adage that the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence. It is part of human nature to think that something else is always necessarily better than what we have. That somehow a sales tax, or a value-added tax, or a flat tax is necessarily going to be better than the current code. We all know, if we stop to reflect a little bit, that sometimes you get what you ask for and you don't like it because it didn't turn out the way you expected it to be. So all of us who, in my judgment--and I must say this sounds a little harsh--are being pandered to with this amendment and are listening and are somewhat tempted to believe in this amendment, should ask ourselves, realistically, how does life really work? When people promise something great on down the road, is it usually nearly as great as it is promised to be? Or to make the same point a little differently, if we are going to accomplish something that is good, generally it is through hard work and through rolling up sleeves and dealing with the difficult details. Not demagoging, pandering, or playing to the grandstand or to the crowd. That is basically how we get something done that makes sense. 
If this amendment is adopted, it is going to cause deep uncertainty in America. We are proud in our country of the economic growth of the last 4 or 5 years--low inflation, low interest rates, generally low unemployment rates, high economic growth rates, and the stock market has generally done well, although not so well in the last week or so. But if this amendment passes, just think of all the people and all the institutions that are not going to be able to plan very well for the future and all of the uncertainty this is going to create. The list goes on forever. 
You can begin with business. Business has all kinds of tax provisions. We can argue over the merits of these provisions, but they are part of current law and businesses include them in their planning. Let's take the business expense deduction that business now has. Are we going to keep the deduction for ordinary, necessary business expenses, or not? If you are a business person, you want to be able to deduct your costs. Businesses aren't going to know if they are going to be able to deduct those costs anymore. They don't know what the next law is going to be. What about the farm provisions? They won't know what the deductions are going to be for depreciation. They will have no idea. So what is a business to do? 
Let's take an individual with a home mortgage interest deduction, which has been mentioned many times. What does this amendment do to the real estate market, to home builders, carpenters, and electricians? What does it do to people who depend on homes or are building or buying new homes? They don't know if the mortgage deduction is going to be there in a new tax system. You say it might be. That is what the sponsors say, but they don't know that. Nobody could say with any certainty whether any single tax provision will exist in a new system. 
Then let's think a little bit about retirement. We have 401(k)s. What about this new Roth IRA we passed last year? A lot of Americans are worried about their retirement security. They are worried enough about Social Security. They want to be able to invest in IRAs and 401(k)s to save some money so they can have a comfortable retirement. This amendment says, no, we might not have those tax deferred savings plans anymore; they might be gone. So what is a person today to do? Should he or she invest in a Roth IRA or something else, independent of the code? Maybe real estate. But we have already pointed out that real estate might be in jeopardy because of what we might be doing here. Maybe they can invest in gold. But we also don't know what the commodity markets are going to be as a consequence of this amendment. 
This amendment causes such uncertainty. Let's take the President's budget--whoever the President is after the year 2000. He or she doesn't know what kind of a budget to propose to Congress, doesn't know how much revenue is going to be raised. Not only do we not know the provisions and how we will raise revenue, we have no idea how much total revenue we are going to raise--none, zero, nullity, no idea. How is a President to propose a budget to Congress under those circumstances? How is Congress to pass a budget resolution under those circumstances? How is the Appropriations Committee going to know how much money to spend? They won't know. 
This is a kind of Russian roulette; it is a gun at your head. OK, imagine this amendment is law and we are getting close to the deadline in 2002. Yet we still don't have agreement on what to replace the current code with. The proponents say this amendment will force the Congress to act. But there is an old saying that `haste makes waste.' All too often we in Congress pass something very quickly that we haven't thought about very much when we are under the gun, and we don't fully understand the consequences of what we have passed. 
I see the Senator from Maine sitting over there. I ask the Senator from Maine, what is she going to be thinking when the years have gone by, and here it is 2002 and, despite our best efforts, we haven't enacted a replacement code yet? We have a choice--are we going to pass an amendment to extend the deadline another year, another 2 years, another 3 years? Doesn't that cause even more uncertainty? 
Or say we are not going to extend the deadline, instead we are going to push something through at the last moment. It ends up a hodge-podge of proposals. Something like a value-added tax, with a little bit of sales tax mixed in maybe. What will its impact be on the American people? Nobody knows. I guarantee that the Senator from Maine is not going to know and the Senator from Montana is not going to know. That is probably what would happen. 
There is something else we haven't talked about--Y2K, the computer bug problem. We are very nervous in this country, and around the world, about what is going to happen on January 1, 2000. Are the computers going to work or not? I think it is a little foolhardy right now to start to contemplate tax sunsetting in the year 2002 when we don't know what is going to happen in the year 2000. 
I must say, Mr. President, this is a sound-bite amendment. This is a feel-good amendment. I have bent over backwards to try to see the merits of this amendment; believe me, I have. I tell you that I am disappointed, frankly, that an amendment like this is on the floor of the Senate and apparently is being taken seriously--because if this were to pass, it would cause just tremendous uncertainty in this country. Americans' incomes would fall. America would be laughed at by countries overseas. That might be a little strong, but they will certainly wonder what the United States of America is doing; no country would do something like this. Mr. President, I very strongly urge that this amendment be defeated. 
Let's talk about kids for a minute and HOPE scholarships. What is going to happen to them? I don't say this as a scare tactic at all. I am saying to the Senator from Arkansas that these are real concerns of real people that I have mentioned. Say the Senator from Arkansas is a student, and there is no income in his family, and he really depends upon a HOPE scholarship to go to college. He wonders, gee, is it going to be there or not? 
To take a more definite provision, say he is going to buy a home, but he doesn't know whether to buy a home or not. That is a real question, Senator. It is not a scare tactic; it is a real question--if he or she doesn't know if there is going to be a home mortgage interest deduction or not, it is hard to tell whether he can afford to buy a home at all. Say you are a homebuilder. Are you going to build homes? How many, and at what price ranges? Those are real concerns of real people. 
Let's talk for a moment about what this does to American companies. Let's just look at fringe benefits, as one example. Employers generally are allowed a deduction for fringe benefits, whether it is health benefits or retirement benefits. What is going to be in the labor contract when a labor union wants to negotiate a labor contract? Negotiators won't know because they won't know what the Tax Code is going to be. They won't know what to negotiate. The better solution, obviously, is to address these real issues more calmly. 
I think that is what we need here--something that is rational, that is collective, that is out in the public spotlight, out of the hothouse of Washington, DC, politics. And that is what is driving this right now--Washington, DC, politics. 
I am really mystified as to why this amendment came before us, and why it is being taken seriously. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Ms. COLLINS addressed the Chair.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, last week's deadly violence in the Halls of the United States Capitol touched the conscience of a nation. From coast to coast, Americans gathered to talk about the shootings. The coverage has dominated television, has dominated our newspapers, as well it should. There has been much discussion about who the assailant was, where he was born, where he lived, what might have caused him to do this dreadful deed. 
I must say, Mr. President, with deep regret, that this assailant spent a part of his life in my home State of Montana. We in Montana are even more grieved, even more touched, and find this tragedy even more tragic than others in the Nation--if that is possible. 
This man was not from Montana. We pride ourselves that those of us from our State have a great sense of honor, pride, duty, sense of family, sense of community. This person, unfortunately, spent some time in our State before he perpetrated this dreadful, violent, evil act. 
We are deeply grieved. We are very deeply sorry. I am speaking for the people of my State of Montana. 
Mr. President, there has been some conversation, too, about why things like this happen. Did somehow the system allow a person like this with some mental illness to fall between the cracks? The system we have for treating mental illness, was it somehow not adequate? 
Frankly, I believe that the system is inadequate. That is, there are many people who are homeless. We are not properly treating people who are mentally disturbed, some of whom are paranoid schizophrenic. They are not receiving medication. They are not being properly treated, because our system is not paying enough attention to people who have this illness. I think if we do not remedy the situation, we will have continued troubles on our hands. I hope we do remedy it very quickly. 
Remember more than anything else the real heroes here. The real heroes are the officers who were shot performing their duty. Talking about the assailant and talking about how we correct the system is meaningless--because the real lesson here is the lesson of Jacob Chestnut and John Gibson. 
All of us here personally know many of the Capitol Police. We live with them. We see them daily. We talk with them. They talk with us. We know many by their first names. We know something about them personally. 
Tony, for example. Tony D'Ambrosio was a plainclothes detective, first a uniformed policeman, on Capitol Hill for many years. It wasn't too many years ago I received several death threats--regrettably, in my home State of Montana. Tony came out to Montana with me and we ran a marathon together. I got to know Tony quite well and have the highest regard for him. 
There is Steven out there. Many know Steven. Steven stands by the door to the entrance of the Senate. We talk with him, we joke with him. He is part of our family. 
Then there is Henry. Henry Turner. Henry Turner is a policeman originally from Alabama, who is also stationed out here at the front door. I often talk to Henry about legislation on the floor. `This is a good bill to vote for,' or `This is not a good amendment to vote for.' Henry would know more about the legislation before the Senate than a lot of Senators, on occasion. A great man to talk to. Very wise. A very wise, very thoughtful man from Alabama. 
The same is obviously true for John and for Jacob. I did not personally know them nearly as well as I know other Capitol Police, but they are men, they are fathers, they are parents. They have family just like all of us do, all of us in the Senate, all of us in the country. We are all bound together by the community of brotherhood, the community of sisterhood, the community of family. We are all together. 
Many people have said it in many, many ways, and I want to share my deepest sympathy for them, John and Jacob, for their families, and I want them to know that we all are with them. We are now and we will always be.

 Mr. BAUCUS. Mr President, I rise today to celebrate a true Montanan and a great friend on his 70th birthday. 
Anyone who has come to know George Ostrom through his radio broadcasts, his photographs, his writing, or who has been fortunate enough as I have to spend time personally with him has come away with a better understanding of the American West and Montana in particular. 
I've known George for too many years to count. Among other things, he and I share a passion for hiking in general and for hiking in Glacier National Park in particular. You see George has spent most of his 70 years in and around the Park. To this day, he hikes with a group that he affectionately calls the `Over the Hill Gang.' They hike once a week when the weather permits, usually between 30 and 40 times a year. 
For years, George has invited me to join his friends for a hike. But you know how it is. Our schedules are busy and somehow I just never got around to it. Until last August. During our summer recess last year I joined up with George and his Over the Hill Gang. And what a day we had. We told stories (all of them were true, of course), shared water bottles and talked about our families, our hopes and our dreams. Mr. President, it was a day I will not soon forget. 
Over the years, I had heard all about George's many awards including the honor bestowed on his weekly column `The Trailwatcher', which in 1996 was selected as the best weekly humor column in the United States by the National Newspaper Association. And I had seen many of his photographs of the Park in local and national magazines including Sports Afield, Field and Stream and Sports Illustrated. 
But on that hike I came to know George Ostrom the man. A funny and engaging gentleman who will not quit until he gets where he is going. That spirit is Montana's spirit. An ideal that defines all of us. A common bond that all Montanans share. 
Sadly, just a few days later, one of our group, Roger Dokken, fell to his death while hiking a different trail. Because of our time together, he was my friend--automatically. No politics, no agenda. Just two people doing together what they enjoy. 
Through the triumphs and tragedies of life, George and his Over the Hill gang continue to hike on. They continue to embody what is good, what is right about Montana. 
So Mr. President, as George and his family celebrate his 70th birthday, I send my congratulations confident that George Ostrum is still well shy of being over the hill.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, most people my age have known the heartache of having to watch their parents grow old. It is a sad day in a person's life when they see their father get his first gray hair. Or the day you notice lines in your mother's face where previously, there were none. 
This aging process is made worse by the scary and very real possibility that too many people who will become senior citizens in the next several years are not at all prepared for the transition from work to retirement. 
To be honest, it isn't our parents who we need to worry about so much. They survived the Depression. They know what it takes to get by during the lean years--it takes planning and saving. Putting money aside, when it might be easier to spend it in the moment. 
Those are the values that our parents live by. They are the values we would do well to heed. And even better to teach those who will follow us. 
We as a nation have lost our imperative to save. Personal savings rates have dropped to 3.8 percent of our Gross Domestic Product, the lowest in 58 years. 
Fifty-one million Americans in our nation's workforce have no pension coverage. But statistics like those don't tell the whole story. They don't do justice to the hardscrabble struggles that real people go through every day. Struggles that involve agonizing questions like: `Should I eat today or take my medication?' or `Will I be able to heat my house this winter?' 
Make no mistake, our nation's lack of saving for retirement is a tragedy in the making. 
That is why I am so proud to join my colleagues in introducing this legislation. 
A bill that will make it easier for Americans to put money aside, and a bill that will help move pension issues to the forefront of Americans' minds. A bill that will: 
Expand coverage for small businesses because they have a harder time affording health care and retirement plans; 
Enhance pension fairness for women because they fall into categories that have a harder time saving; 
Increase the portability of pension plans so that when you change jobs you don't have to worry about where your savings will go; 
Strengthen pension security and enforcement so you can rest easy at night, knowing your money is safe; 
Reduce red tape so it's easier for employers to give their workers retirement options; 
And encourage retirement education so that husbands and wives, parents and children, talk to each other--make plans for their future. And know what to expect tomorrow and down the road. 
One aspect of the bill I am particularly proud of are the small business provisions. Thirty-eight million of the people in this country who do not have a pension plan work at small businesses. Eighty percent of all small business employees have no pension coverage. 
In my state of Montana, more than 95 percent of our businesses are small businesses. And almost 9 out of 10 offer no pension plans. We cannot let these hard-working Americans down. 
Currently, most small businesses can't afford pension plans. They would like to, but they just can't make ends meet. 
Our bill makes it a smart business decision for small business owners to offer retirement plans. 
I have made it my priority to work with members of the small business community, both back in Montana and nationally, to identify legislative solutions that will most readily enable small businesses to offer pension plans to their employees. While this bill does not include every recommendation we received, it does represent a collection of high-priority proposals which we believe could be supported by a bi-partisan majority of Congress. 
The major provisions in this bill which would help small businesses start and maintain pension plans include the following: 
To help make pension plans more affordable we have included two new tax credits: one to help defray start-up costs and the other to defray the cost of employer contributions to pension plans; 
In addition, we provide for the elimination of some fees. 
To address the problems the small business community has identified as a major impediment to establishing pension plans, we make significant changes in the top-heavy rules that limit employer contributions to plans. 
To address concerns of our smallest businesses, who want to provide pensions but can only afford `start-up' plans at first, we provide increases in income limits that apply to SIMPLE pension plans, along with a new, salary-reduction SIMPLE plan; 
And for those employers that want to provide the security of a defined benefit plan for their employees but cannot because of the increased regulatory burden, we create a simplified defined benefit plan for small business. 
These provisions are designed to address the problems of cost and complexity that are a barrier to so many small businesses. They will help small employers establish a pattern of saving for themselves and their employees. 
Mr. President, I hope the Pension Coverage and Portability Act will spearhead a national debate on how to improve employer-provide pensions in this country. 
This debate is essential if we are to achieve our goal of making America in the next century, not only strong as a nation, but strong as a community of individuals confident in the security of their financial futures. 
This is a good, bi-partisan bill. It takes the positive steps we as a nation need to put our future in safe hands. 
I am eager for the coming debate on this bill. 
I hope it sparks a debate in the coffee shops and kitchen tables all across the country. Working together, and with this bill, we can turn a nation of spenders, into a nation of savers.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill, along with Senator Grassley, Senator Rockefeller and Senator Breaux, the Home Health Access Preservation Act of 1998. Essentially, our legislation is geared at reforming the home health interim payment system. 
Several years ago, because home health care costs were rising at such a rapid, alarming rate, Congress, in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, decided to do something about it. What did we do? We passed a provision called the interim payment system as a transition interim system for home health care agencies to live under until we move to a prospective payment system. 
What does all that mean? It is this: In the first 15 years of Medicare, home health care constituted about 2 percent of the total Medicare budget. Medicare, as we know, is the program that is financed almost entirely out of payroll taxes. Those dollars go to Uncle Sam, and Uncle Sam then pays hospitals and doctors for health care for senior citizens. Part A is hospital care; Part B is doctor's care for senior citizens. Again, only 2 percent of Part A of Medicare--that is the hospital part--was for home health care. 
In 1997, however, the total amount of Medicare Part A dollars--that is, the hospital dollars that go out to senior citizens--was about 15 percent. That is a rise from 2 percent up to 15 percent, a staggering increase in home health care. 
Why did that happen? Basically, because hospitals were moving patients out of hospitals. They were moving some of the patients into home health care settings. In addition to that, it was a lot cheaper to provide some services out of the hospitals. And, on top of that, seniors prefer to have care at home rather than sometimes in the hospital or perhaps in a nursing home. Home health care has risen dramatically. 
Well, as a consequence, there has been extra pressure on the Medicare trust fund. And that is why Congress, in 1997, decided to pass this provision, changing the way we reimburse home health care and moving to a system to try to get a handle on all this rising cost. 
The old way that Medicare paid home health care was called cost-based reimbursement. Essentially, a home health care agency would get reimbursed, get paid, for the costs that that home health care agency incurred in treating patients--basically cost-plus; that is, the agency would get whatever it cost and was able to add on just a little bit to stay in business. 
As a consequence, several phenomena developed. 
In some States, there was a proliferation of home health care agencies. They just sprung up all over because they are cost based. In addition to getting more patients to get reimbursed more, they provide more services to the public. 
In some other States, home health care agencies were very efficient; that is, they did their work, and they did not try to provide extra services, nor did they get extra reimbursement. 
We are in a position now where the interim system that Congress passed in 1997 is causing problems, and significant problems, for all home health care agencies, in particularly those rural areas. Why is that? It is because the provision we passed, the interim payment system, provided that home health care agencies would be paid on whatever their costs were in 1994. 
Well, that means that those home health care agencies that were very efficient in 1994, compared with those who were very inefficient in 1994, are adversely affected. Why is that? That is because, if the payment is based upon 1994 levels, and it is locked in at 1994 levels, and you are a very efficient home health care agency--you are cutting costs--then you are paid less. 
On the other hand, if you were a very inefficient home health care agency in 1994, and you are locked into whatever Uncle Sam was paying you in 1994, you can continue to be inefficient. Well, that is obviously not fair. It is not fair to those home health care agencies who were doing a pretty good job. 
In addition, there is another problem. The movement from cost-based reimbursement over to what is called a prospective payment reimbursement--that is, paying home health care agencies a certain payment for a given procedure regardless of what else is going on with the agency--is based on the assumption that the efficient home health care agencies, the efficient providers--hospitals are also paid on a prospective payment system--that is, the efficient ones will survive, they will do well; the inefficient, those that are getting the same dollars but are inefficiently run, poorly run, will fail, they will not be able to make it. 
That is good--the theory is--because the efficient survive and the inefficient don't. The theory goes on to hold that, well, that is OK for patients, for people, because when the inefficient fails, there is a nearby efficient hospital, or nearby efficient home health care agency in this case. So patients are still well served. They just go to the other, nearby, efficient home health care agency. 
That is a false assumption, Mr. President, for rural areas, because in rural areas of America, when an inefficient fails--or for some other reason that home health care agency cannot make ends meet--when it fails, there is no other nearby home health care agency, there is no nearby alternative provider because they are just too many miles apart. 
We, Mr. President, are introducing legislation designed to fix this problem until we finally move to a more permanent compensation system for rural health care agencies. Essentially, what it does is, we say to a State, we are going to have a single rate per State, not differential among States, but per State. We also get rid of the cap on agency-specific costs, because we move to a 50-50 blend of regional as well as national averages. 
That is, I think, a fair compromise between those who want fixed costs based on a national rate and those who want the rate to be based upon the particular characteristics of the region. 
I think this helps. I think it goes a long way to solving the problem that many home health care agencies have. This, by the way, is in addition to the surety bond problem facing home health care agencies, another matter which we are addressing separately. 
But I hope this interim measure that we are now reforming will be reformed along the way to provide for, in the bill, making sure that a lot of people get health care who otherwise would not have it available.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to discuss my amendment to the Agriculture Appropriations Bill, number 3150. This amendment would provide increased funding for research activities to improve counter-narcotic efforts. 
I realize that the Subcommittee faced a very difficult challenge with the level of the funding allocation this year. While I am disappointed that it has been impossible to fund this project at this time, I wish to call the attention of the members of the Subcommittee to this important proposal. I believe it makes sense for the future of the agriculture industry. 
This project would increase efforts to use biotechnology in the control of narcotic plants. This research would also enhance traditional agriculture production practices, supplying an important tool in weed control. Biotechnology research promises an economical solution to the spread of noxious weeds and other pests that threaten both public and private land across the nation. 
I believe this type of research holds great potential for success in the war on drugs. Related efforts are underway in private industry, but there is great need to increase our efforts. This project would be an important step in that direction. 
Finally, I would like to thank the Subcommittee Leadership, Senator Bumpers and Chairman Cochran for their efforts to find funding for this program. And I hope it will be possible for the Subcommittee to give this project strong consideration in the future.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of the American farmer. 
Mr. President, Montana's farmers and ranchers have suffered from an extraordinary turn of events that is driving people off the family farm. Low prices, shrinking Asian markets, drought and the adjustments to a new farm bill have left our producers with an inadequate safety net. For many, this is disaster. 
First, we have to deal with price. And we have to deal with price today. Our producers can't survive another setback. Montana farmers have already planted the smallest spring wheat crop since 1991--down 17 precent over last year and down 8 percent from what they intended to plant March 1. As I recall, we were talking about low prices as far back as December, And now, in mid-July we are talking about the same issues. We are simply farther down the rocky road. It's high time to act. 
I am sure many of you will recall last spring--nearly 6 months ago--when our producers were desperately reaching out for help. So, we brought an amendment to the emergency supplemental appropriations bill that would extend marketing assistance loans. Unfortunately, we faced a brigade of opponents who wanted to push an aggressive trade agenda instead of an emergency price fix. 
Now I find it ironic, that despite all of our best efforts, the many hearings held about the `Crisis in Agriculture,' and the promotion of the sanctions package as the cure-all for our price dilemma--that we are exactly where we started--at ground zero. We've seen no improvement on price. In fact, we've lost ground: Montana's winter wheat average price decreased 22 cents from April 1998 to now, dropping to $3.06 per bushel. 
Beef prices also are lower--down $3.10/cwt. And sheep have dropped by $8.40. And still, we want our producers to believe that we should look for brighter days in the international market--without congressional intervention. 
Some would argue that this situation can be blamed on over-production, alone. I wholeheartedly disagree. While it is true that wheat stocks in Montana on June 1 totaled nearly 60 million bushels, up 80 percent from the same quarter last year, but our exports are down considerably. I think we can also make the argument that extending the market loans an additional six months is but a step in resolving the problem. 
It is true that we must move our wheat, our beef, and all other `crisis commodities'--and now. We can't view this measure of extending loans and lifting the loan cap to become a last ditch-policy. But as an emergency matter, I would call on my colleagues to consider the ramifications of letting this disaster go another day. And encourage them to lend their support. 
That will solve the short-term issue of price. Then, we must address the long term. We did just that by stepping up our efforts on the trade front by passing a bill last week removing GSM ag credits from our sanctions package on India and Pakistan. 
Next we need to review those sanctions still pending on nearly 9 percent of the world and re-evaluate whether they are current, necessary and proper. If not, let's remove the sanctions and move our wheat into these markets and help our producers. Food should not be used as a weapon. And our policies should not hurt our hard-working producers. 
We should also support the country of origin labeling amendment for our livestock producers. Consumers in America can examine the label on any given product to make an informed shopping decision. But that is not the case with our imported meat. I am a cosponsor of Senator Johnson's efforts to require meat labeling. It makes sense. It costs little. And the benefit extends, not only to producers, but also consumers. 
And finally, we cannot ignore the force of Mother Nature. No one can argue that our farmers have been subject to an adverse and often hostile market. But this year marks a series of natural disasters that are beyond our control. Drought still plagues many counties in Montana. In fact, twenty-two percent of our crops are in poor condition because of lack of moisture. That is bad news for our livestock industry, as well. Fifty-nine percent of our pasture--used for forage--is in less than good condition. Clearly, efforts targeted at replenishing the disaster reserve would be hailed as relief for those victims of annual disaster. 
And finally, Mr. President. I urge my colleagues to support these measures--not on a partisan basis--but because it is the right thing to do for our producers back home. Our feet--and those of our producers--are being held to the fire. Will we take action--or spout rhetoric? Will we show our constituency that we are here in Washington fighting for them--not amongst ourselves? I would hope we can take the higher ground and send a message to America--we need and support our farmers and ranchers--by lending our support.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I first thank my good friend, the Senator from Delaware. 
Mr. President, we are now embarked on a very significant policy change with respect to sanctions. Over the past several years, it was simple for the U.S. Congress to slap sanctions on an offensive country. We could also give the President the authority to grant sanctions. We could do this because we believed this power was free. That is to say, we in Congress freely used sanctions to express our sentiments about issues of particular concern, and we passed several pieces of legislation giving the President sanctions authority because it didn't cost anything. And we made our statements loud and clear by doing so. Good statements, for example, that tried to curb proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. And at that time, these efforts were necessary in steering certain countries away from a course contrary to world public policy. 
Unfortunately, despite our best intentions, most of these sanctions bills have been ineffective. Many have not accomplished the purpose for which they were intended. We may ask ourselves why? I believe one important reason is the fact that the world has become so global. In addition, this global marketplace is not conducive to the imposition of unilateral sanctions imposed by the United States. Quite simply, the sanctioned country can very easily avoid the purpose and penalty of our sanctions by going to other countries to get the products that they would otherwise obtain from the United States. 
So, by and large, unilateral sanctions have not worked very well. On the other hand, multilateral sanctions tend to work when a majority of countries in the world join together with the same purpose and to help accomplish the same objective. The legislation that we are considering today, and will pass today, recognizes that phenomenon. 
That being said, I believe that there is definitely a role for sanctions--unilateral and multilateral. We just have to work together to determine when and where each sanction is most appropriate and effective. 
Over the last couple of weeks, we have seen a demonstrated interest in reforming our sanction's policy. We realize today that it probably makes more sense to pass something narrowly crafted than to use a blanket action to achieve a specific goal. Take for example, the fact that we are considering a waiver with respect to GSM agricultural credits for food shipments to Pakistan. We now believe--and I think I am speaking for almost all Members of Congress--that food shipments should never be used as a foreign policy weapon. Barring a country from a necessary food source is wrong. It is anti-humanitarian. More often it hurts the very people who need it the most. It also tends to inadvertently penalize our producers here in America. 
Food as a weapon simply does not work, and the legislation before us today essentially provides a release valve with respect to food shipments and agriculture products. Today we are talking about Pakistan, but we should also rethink our policy toward India and the rest of the sanctioned countries after this particular vote. We must also devise a way to give the President a little more flexibility when targeting a specific result. These results include the reduction of nuclear tests and weapons of mass destruction in Asia. 
I believe that it is also important to point out that our agricultural producers are currently blocked out of 10 percent of the global market due to sanctions. This lack of market access obviously hurts our producers. It is almost ironic that in many cases we hurt ourselves far more than we hurt or influence an errant country. This is most often the result when we employ the use of unilateral sanctions. Our producers simply cannot afford to bear the brunt of our failed foreign policy endeavors. We simply must oppose and remove trade sanctions that unfairly inhibit market opportunities for our ag producers. 
I might also add that I recently accompanied President Clinton on his trip to China. During this trip, I talked to several Chinese officials and tried to encourage them to open up their markets to American products like Pacific Northwest wheat. Unfortunately, the response I received was to the effect that China would be willing to buy if America was a reliable supplier. Their spin on trade was justified by claiming we in America sanction our food exports too often. Why, then should they depend on us to provide a reliable source of wheat, or beef or any other commodity subject to sanctions? 
Now I'm not saying the sole reason China does not take wheat, particularly Pacific Northwest wheat, is due to sanctions. But I do believe our random sanctions policy is a contributing factor. Again it was obvious that if we stop using food as a tool of foreign policy, we will have an easier time in encouraging market access.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to speak a little bit about the conference report that is before us, the IRS restructuring bill. 
Today, the Senate reaches the end of a journey that has been 2 long years in the making. It is actually a journey that began a couple years ago when the National Commission on Restructuring the IRS was charged with investigating the IRS' repeated failure to modernize its computer systems. There are many stories of the IRS computer systems falling down, crashing, systems not meshing; and essentially the commission felt that it was their charge to try to find the answer to all these problems. 
It became very clear, Mr. President, as the commission began trying to find a solution to the computer problems, that it was just touching the tip of the iceberg, that there are a lot more problems in the IRS that had to be addressed; namely, the abuse of too many agents, too many rogue agents, the insensitivity, too often, of its IRS employees toward taxpayers. Frankly, it led the commission to dig much more deeply into problems facing the IRS. Accordingly, the commission proceeded to look at other areas in addition to computers. The commission probed various problems that the taxpayers face in our country. 
Under the leadership of Senators Kerrey and Grassley and Representatives Portman and Coyne of the House, the commission, I think, produced a series of very good recommendations that have become the foundation of the bill before us. 
Again, it was a restructuring commission. They spent a lot of time looking at the problems of the IRS. They presented their recommendations to the Congress, and essentially, the bill before the Congress today is the manifestation, the outgrowth of those recommendations by the commission. 
In addition, Mr. President, under the leadership of our chairman of the Finance Committee, Bill Roth, with his very extensive hearings, we were able to draw out many more abuses, 
many more problems that our American people were facing with the IRS. As a consequence, I think we have a better bill. We were able to fine-tune some of those Restructuring Commission recommendations. In fact, we were able to add a few more. So altogether, I do think it is a combination of very good effort on the part of both the commission and the conference. And I think, Mr. President, that the result is going to turn out to be quite good for the American people--not perfect, but certainly an improvement. 
Justice John Marshall once said, `The power to tax involves the power to destroy.' We all know that the corollary to that is that the power of the tax collector must be very carefully balanced, because the tax collector, him or herself, has inordinate power when he or she tries to collect taxes. Any tax collection agency must be strong enough to make sure that everyone is paying his or her fair share of taxes, but not so powerful as to trample on the rights of ordinary citizens. 
It is quite clear, through the testimony of our witnesses before our committee and comments from our constituents at home, that the IRS has lost that balance over the years. 
Let me give you one example. 
This is a plea for help from a constituent of mine in Montana. `The problem with the IRS started in 1997. John'--that is not this person's real name--`and I'--in this case it is John's wife--`had just bought a house. I was a semester away from graduating from college, and we thought the [failed] business [that we had] was behind us. The last week in July 1997, I returned home after a day of working at my part-time job to find a nasty note on my front door from [an agent] stating that he had `tracked' us down and expected a phone call or [else] action would be taken. I promptly called him to find out [what was going on]. He was very rude and reluctant to give me any information, [saying he could not talk to me, did not want to talk to me because he was not talking to my husband].' 
The long and the short of it is--and I am paraphrasing the letter here--`. . . he began talking to me in a [very] degrading manner. He said, `. . . I expect to [get taxes] in full,' [and said it in a very rude way]. When I asked him to explain, he . . . [treated me like] a criminal who was running [away] from the IRS.' 
Continuing further, Mr. President, basically, the agent in this case put a lien on everything this person owned, also made many personal comments. He obviously investigated the personal lives of these taxpayers and basically was so rude and so arrogant as to performing almost Gestapo tactics against my constituents. My constituent ends up, Mr. President, in her letter by saying that very clearly the Government was not working for the people, but rather was working against the people. 
I think this letter sums up the issue in a nutshell; that is, to make the Government work much more for people, not against them, that is, put service back into the Internal Revenue Service instead of being arrogant and degrading people as much as the Service has in the past. 
Now, we certainly do not want to tie the IRS' hands so much that tax cheats are encouraged. The rest of us, as we all know, end up picking up the tab when someone else cheats. At the same time, we also can't have the IRS harassing innocent citizens and assuming everyone is guilty the minute they walk into the door. We have to find that balance. It is not an easy matter. I believe this legislation will help the IRS find its way back to that balance. 
What does it do? It creates a board made up chiefly of private citizens, subject to the confirmation powers of the Senate, giving the Senate an opportunity to ask lots of questions of these new board members to see whether or not they fill the bill. 
The board will also keep an eye on the IRS budget, report independently to the Congress its recommendations on IRS budget matters, and not have to go through the regular Government channels. The board will focus on long-term goals. It will also make sure the Service stays on track to meet these goals. 
It will also ferret out problems to help the IRS itself find solutions. 
The bill creates much more personnel flexibility, making it easier for the new Commissioner, with his enthusiasm, who wants to get things shaped up, giving him flexibility to reward employees doing well. I think this flexibility will help the IRS attract competent people, people who are technically competent and management experts. You get what you pay for. If you want to get good people, you have to be able to pay them well and you have to give them the wherewithal to do the job right. There has not been sufficient flexibility to this point in the IRS. 
This bill also reorganizes the IRS, somewhat in the same vein as a major American company, IBM, was reorganized when IBM years ago realized it was falling behind, that it was not serving customers, customers were not No. 1. It made dramatic changes. Mr. Rossotti was part of those changes at IBM, and we are hopeful some of the changes will work here. 
What are some examples? One major example: Currently, when a taxpayer has a problem with the IRS and it involves several kinds of problems--say, income tax or payroll tax or a corporate tax is involved--the agent who handles the case transfers all the files over to the person responsible, say, for payroll taxes; if it is a corporate tax file, it is transferred to a corporate tax person; and if it is another problem, it is transferred to that person, essentially passing the buck. So when an individual taxpayer tries to find out what in the world is going on with his file, sometimes the file is lost, the person he or she calls doesn't know the answer to the question; it is just a mess. 
How do we attempt to solve it? Essentially, the IRS now will be divided into four separate divisions: One for small business, one for large corporations, a third for tax-exempt institutions, and a fourth for individual taxpayers. Now, when you, a taxpayer, have a question for the IRS, one person is in charge of your file--one person, more accountability. If you are a small business person, it is the small business section; an individual taxpayer, the individual taxpayer section--even though you may have questions involving different parts of the code. That should help reduce `buck passing.' 
The bill also adds important new taxpayer protections to help protect citizens against arbitrary actions. There are penalty and interest provisions suspended or reduced. Too often, the IRS has taken advantage of the penalty and the interest provisions in the law to browbeat taxpayers. A number of due process requirements are created. For example, legislation would require the IRS to give a delinquent taxpayer 30 days' notice to request a hearing before property is seized. In addition, the IRS is required here to seize business property only as a last resort. That has not always been the case. It further prohibits the seizure of a personal residence without court approval. That is a major change. 
The bill further makes it easier for an innocent spouse to get relief from tax debts that the guilty spouse may have accumulated. It shifts the burden of proof from the taxpayer to the IRS in court proceedings so long as the taxpayer keeps appropriate records and cooperates with the agency. 
I am not positive this is exactly tailored the way it should be. Currently, in our judicial system, the burden of proof is on the Government when they bring an action against a 
citizen. That is the way it should be. Up to this point, that has not been the case with respect to our tax laws, the theory being that the taxpayer is the one who keeps the books and records so the taxpayer should have the obligation to show that he or she should not have to pay the taxes the IRS is seeking. The burden of proof still is on, probably, the wrong place. We have tried to find the right balance here. I hope this provision in the statute works. Only time will tell. If there are problems, we will have to address them. 
The bill further extends the attorney-client privilege in most cases to accountants and to others authorized to practice before the IRS. Again, I am not sure how good an idea this is. It will make it more difficult for major accounting firms to sign off as to the financial statements of a company they are auditing. They may feel compromised because of this new provision. I hope this works. It may not. If not, we will have to come back and revisit it as well. 
Finally, the bill before the Senate takes a first step toward addressing what may be the biggest contributor to taxpayer problems with our Tax Code; namely, all of us, Congress itself. 
Witness after witness at our hearings complained about the complexity of the code. This bill requires that every tax bill in the future be accompanied by an analysis of whether it will further complicate the code, how hard it will be for taxpayers to comply with new laws. As we strive to achieve fairness in our code, we sacrifice simplicity. With this bill, we will theoretically be able to more clearly understand the extent of that sacrifice. I hope this works. 
We need to address the complexity of the code. I am not certain this will work as well as it is cracked up to. This will only work if the Congress focuses with utmost intensity on this part of the change and focuses on how proposed change adds to the complexity. I worry that this will otherwise be window dressing, that the Service and the administration, Treasury, IRS, Congress, might gloss over this provision. It sounds good right now, but we will not follow up, do the hard work and heavy lifting, when the new provision is before us. It really depends upon us. It is like the Pogo cartoon, `I have met the enemy, and he is us.' This will work, the anticomplexity provision, only if we make it work. Time will tell. 
This bill certainly clips the wings of IRS agents, but we all know that clipping the Government's wings too closely presents its own dangers. The Service estimates that the so-called tax gap, which is the measure of how much legitimately owed tax is not being collected, is now almost $200 billion a year. This amounts to more than $1,600 per year for every tax return filed by the rest of us--$1,600 per return, filed by the rest of us, is not being collected. Addressing this problem, unfortunately, is not in this bill. That has been left to another day. 
I truly hope we have not done anything in this bill which will exacerbate the problem further, because this bill may be sending a message to some American, `Hey, the IRS' wings are getting clipped; I can get away with more; I don't have to report everything so much.' That is not the message of this bill. The message of this bill is, the Service will treat individual taxpayers more like people and provide a service that it should be providing; that is, remembering that people are actually the employers in this outfit and the IRS is the employee. 
We have a second problem not addressed in this bill, and that is the tax gap. I hope that is addressed in the not too distant future because it is a problem that is mounting with each passing day. Partly it is caused by the complexity in the code. 
I am also concerned about how we pay for the lost revenues in this bill. I don't think it is the best result we could come up with. And I have further concern that the bill's provision may result in extended litigation, further slowing down our court system, because these are new provisions; they have to be interpreted. Lawyers are going to try to put one spin on it; another lawyer, another spin. A lot of the problems may end up in the courts. 
I firmly believe we must not let another tax session go by without at least the taxpayer protections in this bill. I am pleased to support the conference report. I am pleased I can go back to my constituents, including the young lady who wrote that letter, to say: We have tried to fix your problem, we have gone a long way toward fixing your problem; it is not perfect, but it goes a long, long way. 
In the end, Mr. President, the effectiveness of these provisions depends very much on the degree to which the White House, the administration, the Treasury, and the Congress continue to oversee the IRS, continue to have hearings into the IRS' operations, praising them when they are doing a good job, criticizing them when they are doing a bad job. 
We are here today, passing this legislation, in many respects because both the administration and the Congress for way too many years have let the IRS drift. 
There has been virtually no oversight. Treasury hasn't paid much attention to the IRS. Congress hasn't paid much attention to the IRS. As a consequence, they have kind of gone off in a direction that has not been as praiseworthy as we would like. So it is up to us, the people's representatives, to continue vigorous, aggressive oversight, if these provisions enacted today turn out to be as good as we all say they are and hope them to be. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague Senator Chafee, the Chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, in introducing the National Wildlife Refuge System Volunteer and Partnership Enhancement Act of 1998. 
This bill will promote volunteerism on our national wildlife refuges. By encouraging volunteers to work with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to improve our national wildlife refuges, this bill will not only benefit fish and wildlife but enhance the outdoor recreation and education experience for thousands of visitors. 
The National Wildlife Refuge System is a sanctuary for our nation's fish and wildlife, many species of which are threatened or endangered. It is a sanctuary for people too, who use refuges for many purposes. Comprising some 93 million acres spread across the country in over 500 individual refuges, the system is an invaluable natural resource. 
To ensure that the resource is conserved for future generations of Americans, the Congress recently enacted legislation to guide the management of the National Wildlife Refuge System. But even improved management cannot make up for the lack of money. The refuge system is underfunded. Without adequate financial and staff resources, we will not realize the full potential of the refuge system, as envisioned by the National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act of 1997. 
One way to address this need is through the use of volunteers, ordinary citizens who care enough about our refuges to contribute their time. 
To encourage volunteers to take a more active role in improving our wildlife refuges, this bill would authorize the Secretary of the Interior to enter into cooperative agreements with partner organizations to undertake conservation and education projects. In addition, the bill would authorize the Secretary to develop refuge education programs and provide for staff to assist partner organizations and coordinate volunteer activities. 
Mr. President, I believe that this is a good bill and that it deserves our support. It will benefit fish and wildlife, provide unique opportunities for citizens to donate their valuable time and expertise to refuges in their local communities, and enhance the refuge experience for the many people who visit our refuges each year. 
I intend to work closely with my colleague, Senator Chafee, and other members of our Committee, to help ensure that it is enacted this year.

 Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join my colleague Senator John Chafee in introducing legislation to extend the Work Opportunities Tax Credit (WOTC). This program was created after extensive consultations between the Congress and the Administration as a replacement for the Targeted Jobs Tax Credit. It was improved in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 with changes designed to make the program more accessible to employers who identify, hire and train welfare recipients and equip them with basic job skills necessary for long-term employment. 
As the June 30, 1998 expiration date for the WOTC program approaches, we are introducing this bill as a statement of Congressional commitment to the future continuation of the credit. WOTC encourages employers to participate in the national goal of moving millions from welfare to work through a hiring tax incentive that helps to offset the costs of recruiting, hiring and training those with few basic job skills. 
Congress enacted welfare reform in 1996. Since that time, employers have utilized WOTC to hire nearly one in four of those coming off public assistance. The time limits that were implemented through the welfare reform legislation are now reaching many of the more difficult welfare cases, those with the fewest job skills that have had the most difficulty finding jobs. As these welfare recipients search for jobs, it is extremely important to continue providing an incentive which will help defray the extra costs experienced by companies hiring these workers. 
The legislation we are introducing today will extend WOTC for three years. The current practice of extending the credit on a year-to-year, or partial-year, basis makes it extremely difficult for employers to use the credit. Small businesses in particular require some time to set up and use the program. All employers need some level of certainty for tax planning, which is not available when the credit is extended on a short-term basis. A multi-year extension will provide that certainty, and will show that Congress is serious about making the program work. 
I thank Senators Conrad, D'Amato, Hatch, Jeffords, Mikulski and Rockefeller for joining Senator Chafee and myself as original cosponsors of this bill. I look forward to working with all of my colleagues to enact a multi-year extension of the Work Opportunities Tax Credit before the end of this legislative session.

 Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am very pleased today to join with my colleague, Senator Hatch, to introduce another in our series of international simplification bills. The International Simplification for American Competitiveness Act of 1998 will provide much-needed relief to American-owned companies that are struggling to compete in the world marketplace by simplifying our overly complicated international tax rules. 
America's economy, and economies of our individual States, are increasingly interlinked with the success of our businesses in the international economy. As the economies of previously less-developed countries around the world begin to expand, and the economic boundaries between our countries become more blurred, it is increasingly important for our businesses to be able to operate abroad from their most competitive position. Restraining American companies through redundant and unnecessary complexity in our own tax code dampens their ability to compete for foreign business. This only hurts our own economy. 
I have worked through the Trade Subcommittee to lower barriers to foreign markets and encourage agreements to keep trade free and fair. I have sought to open foreign markets for many Montana products, from beef to wheat, because of the positive impact on Montana's economy, and on the economy of our country. While we have made much progress on the trade front in opening barriers, our tax code remains mired in antiquated provisions that have not kept pace with the rapidly expanding global economic frontier. We must simplify our code, remove duplicative or outmoded provisions, and provide incentives for trade whenever possible, if we are to ensure continued U.S. success in the world economy. If we miss this opportunity, we risk the erosion of U.S. international competitiveness as countries with simple, favorable tax treatment of businesses lure away our foreign customers. 
There is a strong correlation between American corporate competitiveness overseas and the ability of those companies to continue providing jobs at home. According to a report prepared by the accounting firm of Price Waterhouse, United States exports in 1996 totaled over $600 billion and supported almost 7 million direct and indirect jobs. Exports alone account for over 11% of our Gross Domestic Product, and when combined with imports, total about 17% of GDP. Even in Montana, a state which is struggling to expand its foreign markets, exports totaled almost one-half billion dollars and supported 58,000 jobs in 1996. 
This bill does not by any means cure all of the problems in the international tax arena. But it is a good starting point which simplifies existing law, reduces the cost of compliance, and begins to rationalize the rules that need to be drafted with the competitiveness of U.S. businesses in mind. There are a lot of important international issues that this bill does not deal with. The problems associated with the interest allocation rules, for example. But Senator Hatch and I feel that these are larger issues that need more time to resolve, so they have not been included in this bill. I look forward to working with him, the Treasury Department and industry groups in an effort to find solutions to these bigger-picture issues over the next months. 
We live in a global economy. And we must help make American companies competitive in this economy, while fairly taxing their profits, if we are to keep this unprecedented period of economic expansion going. The `International Tax Simplification for American Competitiveness Act of 1998' is a major step in that direction, and I look forward to working with Senator Hatch and my other colleagues on the Finance Committee to have its provisions enacted into law.

 Mr. BAUCUS. Mr President, as the first chapter of the Analects of Confucius says, `is it not a great joy when friends come from far away?" 
This week we have had the pleasure to welcome two good friends to Washington--President Kim Dae-jung of the Republic of Korea, and Chief Secretary Anson Chan of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. 
And today, as President Clinton prepares to make the first visit of any sitting President to Hong Kong, I would like to offer some thoughts on the events of the past year in Hong Kong. 
Let me begin with some context. When we speak about Hong Kong, we are really talking about three different Hong Kongs. 
One Hong Kong is Hong Kong itself: a city of six million people on China's southern coast. It is a place of hard work, good humor and open debate; one of our major Asian trading partners; the site of $15 billion in direct American investment and the base for much of our business in China; a site for 60 Navy port calls a year; a place many of us have visited and where our country has many friends. 
A second Hong Kong is part of China. This Hong Kong, emerging from 150 years as a Crown Colony to become the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, can play a unique part in China's future history. It combines a living western intellectual and legal heritage with a Chinese identity, and as such offers Chinese reformers a model for the rule of law and an open society, as well as for economic and financial management. And of course Hong Kong also plays a unique part in our own broader relationship with China. 
And a third Hong Kong is the financial and management hub of a vast productive region which extends from southern China to Southeast Asia. And so Hong Kong is also bound up with our economic and trade relationship with most of Asia--and in particular the financial crisis which afflicts so many Asian nations this year. 
In summary, history has placed a very heavy responsibility on Hong Kong and its people--for the management of their own city; for China's future; and for Asia's prosperity. 
How have they managed these responsibilities since the Union Jack went down and the Bauhinia went up last July 1st? 
Here I will quote the very succinct view of an American businessman based in Hong Kong, who came to see me back in February: 
`Everything we thought might be a problem is not a problem. Everything we assumed would be fine has become a problem.' 
He was referring, of course, to politics and economics. Last year at this time, many were worried about Hong Kong's political future, asking whether Chinese sovereignty would mean a controlled press and repression of political debate. Few saw any threat to its economic future. And what have we seen since? 
Hong Kong residents retain and exercise their rights. The Hong Kong Alliance holds regular commemoration of the Tiananmen Square massacre. Han Dongfang's China Labor Bulletin and the Human Rights Monitor operate just as before. All are freely and widely covered in the Hong Kong press--as are American China policy debates, the recent interview given by the Chinese political reform advocate and former political prisoner Bao Tong, and much more. 
Hong Kong's elections of May 24th went off more freely and its results were more interesting than anyone might have expected. Turnout rose from 35% in 1995 to 55% this year. The Democratic Party, along with the other parties which opted out of the Provisional Legislature, participated and did brilliantly. Equally interesting, the success of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong, traditionally identified as a `pro-Beijing' party, may point toward the eventual establishment of a two-party system in Hong Kong. 
And China has, as far as I can tell, kept its promises to stay out of the Hong Kong government. 
These facts, I believe, disprove two theories. After this election, nobody can now pretend that Hong Kong people are indifferent to political rights and elections and care only about money. Likewise, after the election, the view that China has malevolent intentions and will inevitably crack down on Hong Kong seems naive at best. And although one year is a short time in which to judge, the facts also tend to show that the one-country, two-systems idea may work. And it is a disappointment, but not a surprise, to see that none of last year's doomsayers have stepped up to the plate and admitted they sold Hong Kong--and China--short. 
Unfortunately, what they should have been selling short was not Hong Kong--nor its government, nor its citizens, nor the Chinese government--but the Hang Seng Index. And those of us who were optimistic about Hong Kong's prospects last year should also admit that we didn't get it quite right. The things we felt would not be a problem--Hong Kong's economy--has become not only a problem but a crisis. 
I last visited Hong Kong in May of 1997, as the last stop on a trip that also included Seoul, Pyongyang and Beijing. At that time, the Koreans were worrying about a slowdown in growth rates--maybe to 5.5% or 6%--and some scandals in the chaebols. And The Economist magazine ran a cover story on financial problems in Bangkok. And in Hong Kong, I asked a few people what might show that the transition was going wrong--and a few said that one clue might be a speculative boom in the Hong Kong markets. Not a single person I met--and that includes American diplomats, tycoons, civil servants, Chinese dissidents, legislators from the Democratic Party, the Citizens Party and the Liberal Party--predicted that the economy might go wrong. 
What has happened since? 
We need no longer worry about a speculative boom in the markets. The Hang Seng is down from nearly 16,000 then to below 8,000 this week. 
Hong Kong is in its first recession ever, with growth at negative 2% so far this year. Some predict that the contraction could be 5% or worse. 
Unemployment is already at 4% and will rise in the months ahead. 
This, ironically enough, has overshadowed the political divisions in the new Legislative Council, to the point that the Democrats, the DAB, the Liberals and other parties have come together to criticize the government's budget and push for emergency economic relief. 
Why has this happened? The answer is obvious. The problem is not the Hong Kong economy per se--its properties may have been overvalued, but the real problem is the crisis affecting every country around Hong Kong. When a typhoon blows, everyone feels the wind and rain. 
In summary, Hong Kong is a territory whose politics are in better shape, and whose economy is in worse shape, than anyone guessed last year would be possible. And with that let me now turn from the lessons of the past year to the issues we must address, together with Hong Kong, in the next. 
Our interest is clear: a prosperous, healthy Hong Kong whose politics are free and open, which integrates peacefully with China, and which continues to play its part as the center of a prosperous Asian economy. And to secure this interest, we need three things: first, a solution to the Asian financial crisis; second, a working relationship with China, especially in the field of economics and trade; and third, a continued good relationship with Hong Kong's government, political leaders and people. 
And let me begin with the first of these. When a typhoon blows, people feel the wind and the rain. But they also tend to see, perhaps more than they might in easier times, that they need to work together. We see that in Hong Kong's Legislative Council today. And we see it on a larger scale, as the crisis has brought together the countries hardest hit by the crisis, Hong Kong and China, Japan, and we ourselves. 
The affected countries--particularly Thailand and Korea--have acted with a great deal of courage and good sense. And as bad as the times may be, their approach is working. In the last few months their currencies have stabilized and capital flight ended. The task now is no longer stopping a panic, but restoring financial health, enduring recession and protecting the most vulnerable people. Indonesia, with an even more difficult economic situation and a weaker political system,thus far, has weathered an even more difficult situation with a weaker political without descending into violence. 
China and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region have responded admirably. Hong Kong's refusal to devalue the dollar last October did more than any single other action, anywhere 
in the world, to prevent the crisis in Southeast Asia and Korea from becoming a meltdown. And China's refusal to devalue the yuan since then has allowed markets to recover and begin acting more rationally. The proof is that the revolution in Indonesia, as earthshaking an event as that is, has not created a new currency panic. And continued commitment by China and Hong Kong will make sure that the worst-affected countries can get back on their feet. 
This will impose tremendous strain on China in the months to come, because China is in no way immune to the crisis itself. The Central Bank Governor, Dai Xianglong, said yesterday that while China will stick to its commitment not to devalue: 
`The economic adjustment in Southeast Asia and the sluggish Japanese economy, particularly the depreciation of the yen, have all produced a very negative impact on China's imports, exports and inflow of investment funds, and increased pressure on the restructuring of our country's economic system.' 
This points to the need for rapid action in Japan to pass its fiscal stimulus package and perhaps to go further to prevent recession. In this crisis, Japan should be importing and growing; if it slumps and devalues its currency we can expect the situation to worsen. 
And we in the United States must act sensibly and seriously. Our open market is as important to recovery as the currency commitments by China and Hong Kong. So far, we have not given in to fears or temptations to reduce imports as our exports to Asia have fallen, and that should continue. We must pass our IMF replenishment, as the Senate has done. And we should give a strong endorsement to China's MFN status. As Ms. Chan said on arrival to the United States, revoking MFN status: 
`[W]ould not only deal a devastating blow to business confidence in Hong Kong when we are grappling with the fallout from the regional turmoil, it would also undermine our ability to continue to play the role of firewall in the Asian financial crisis. Eventually it would take away a powerful line of defense in the economies of the region. None of us, including the United States, can afford another wave of uncertainty.' 
As this comment indicates, our annual debate over MFN status has become a pointless and essentially destructive affair. It does nothing to promote human rights, political reform or better security policies in China; instead it threatens jobs here and economic stability in Hong Kong and China. And that brings me to the second point: our economic relationship with China, and in particular to China's accession to the WTO. 
As Governor Dai's comments indicate, China is by no means immune from this crisis. Its growth rate has fallen; its export growth rates dropped by nearly half; and foreign investment in China is off. These are some of the early warning signs we saw in Southeast Asia two years ago. And that should worry us--because today's China is not so different from yesterday's Southeast Asia. 
China has some advantages that its neighbors lacked. It has more fixed investment, less short-term debt, and larger foreign currency reserves than its neighbors. But it also has many of the problems they had before the crisis. We see a level of bad debts about the same, or even higher, as Thailand had before a year ago. We see nepotism, corruption and intimate ties between big business and the state; politically directed loans to unnecessary industrial policy projects in fiber optics, semiconductors, autos, and other areas; property bubbles in the big cities; foreign investment dropping; and early signs of an economic slowdown that could worsen if the Asian crisis deepens. And all this is combined with a brittle political system, intolerant of opposition and with only a weakly developed rule of law, that in the event of crisis may not offer China the flexibility it needs to get through economic difficulties without a social upheaval. 
Part of the answer must be political reform. China has a good example, inside its own political borders, with Hong Kong's strong rule of law and open society in a Chinese society; and when the one-country, two-systems formula comes to an end in 2047, political development in China may be its most important legacy. but in the short term, the economic reforms WTO accession will bring are equally crucial for China's economic health. 
WTO accession, on the commercially meaningful basis we should expect, will reduce subsides and break the links between ministries and their semi-privatized profit-making offspring. Promote open competition at the expense of rigged markets. And strengthen the rule of law. This will produce a more rational economy which is more open to imports; has less interference by ministries in the market; which is run more by the rule of law than by informal connections; and offers more freedom for ordinary Chinese to determine their own future. And in the long run it will help ensure that China has a stable, sustainable economy. 
So as President Clinton's state visit approaches--and in its aftermath if necessry--we should push as hard as we can to reach a commercial meaningful agreement. We must not accept less than we should; that would be unfair to our own country and it would mean little to China. But we should work hard to get the job done right. And of course, when it happens we should live up to our responsibilities by granting China permanent MFN status. 
Finally, let me turn back to the first Hong Kong--the one that is simply a city. 
A year after the transition, Hong King faces and extraordinary array of challenges. It is at the eye of an economic storm worse that any Asia has faced since the Vietnam War. It is adapting to a political role unique in China and probably unique in the world. And its own government and constitution are very new. 
These challenges might bring a lesser city to its knees. But Hong Kong has handled them about as well as anyone could have. And beyond that--as far as I can tell from ten thousand miles away--it has grown because of them. 
Last May's election, to me, indicates that the ordinary Hong Kong people understand how important a responsibility history has given them this year. The qualities we have always associated with Hong Kong--hard work, good humor, honest government--have been amplified by growing civic responsibility, democratic participation and political maturity. 
In summary, a year after the transition, Hong Kong has defended its rights; acted to good effect in an economic crisis; and can look ahead with confidence. And as President Clinton prepares for the first visit any sitting American President has ever made to Hong Kong, he is going to a city whose future is bright.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we are here to debate one of the most significant components of our foreign relations policy, and that is the Department of Defense authorization bill. 
There is often a great temptation to exploit foreign policy debates for partisan political purposes. We all are tempted. But I believe that when we do--that is, on a foreign policy debate--it is a mistake. Such partisan fighting over critical issues of worldwide importance is both dangerous and counterproductive, and that is why I see engaging in congressional debates over China policy at this time, particularly amendments which are perceived as mischievous, is not a good idea. Although China does not manage its affairs as we would like, it makes little sense to base our relationship entirely on that concern. We should base our relationship, rather, with China on a clear view of United States interests, a foundation of basic American values, and appropriate methods that will secure those interests and advance those values. 
China is the fastest growing country in the world. It is the world's most populous country. 
It has the largest army in the world, is a nuclear power. China is a force to be reckoned with. 
And of all the areas our foreign policy must address--peace and security in Asia, prosperity and open trade, environmental protection, the prevention of climate change, and human rights--we will achieve our goals more easily through a cooperative relationship with China than with a destructive one of confrontation, one that seeks common ground and addresses differences frankly rather than through a policy limited to sanctions and confrontations. That is an approach that has succeeded with China over the past 25 years. 
China is a large country. The most progressive regions of the country are those engaged in trade with the West. That is no accident. Our presence in China has an enormously positive influence--one that would be lost if we cut off trade or cut off discussions with China. 
This relationship with China has grown out of the foresight and the cooperative efforts of those who have gone before us. 
Our modern relationship with China began over 25 years ago with a visit to China by President Nixon. President Nixon anticipated the difficult nature of this relationship. But he also recognized the importance of establishing a sound working relationship with the most populous nation in the world. 
As Envoy to China, former President Bush continued the efforts to open China to the rest of the world. His work set the stage for the U.S.-China relationship we have today. Perfect, it is not. But it is a relationship, and it can be improved. And it calls to mind other relationships which we have encouraged over the years. 
Fifty years ago, we had no relationship with Japan. Since then we forged an enduring alliance with that important nation. It is the work of statesmen like Douglas MacArthur and Yoshida Shigeru after the end of World War II; Dwight Eisenhower and Kishi Nobusuke, who steered the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty through the Senate and Diet in 1960; and Montana's own Mike Mansfield, who served for years as our Ambassador to Japan. 
This relationship was not--and is not--a partisan issue. Its champions came from the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. And we have all benefited from their hard work. 
This relationship has weathered great adversity in the last half century--the Chinese Revolution, the Korean war, Vietnam, and 40 years of the cold war. Through it all, this relationship has helped many of the nations in the Pacific give their people better lives. 
It is important to remember that we spent years engaged in a standoff with the former Soviet Union. But by engaging that nation, we witnessed the end of the cold war, the end of the conflict and the birth of a new relationship with Russia. It took hard work and cooperation to make this new Russia a reality. The same is true in our dealings with China. 
A policy of engagement--tough, frank, hard-nosed engagement--is correct, not because it is in the interest of China, but because it is in the interest of America. 
There are still great strides to be made with China, particularly on human rights. It is a mistake to focus only on our differences and to ostracize China. 
We must ask ourselves whether we should seek to reform China by continuing engagement in a positive manner, or, instead whether we should seek to force the Chinese to change course by isolation. 
I think we ought to pursue the first choice--engagement. 
Mr. President, some have suggested that we are appeasing, even coddling, China, that we are ignoring their human rights abuses and other egregious acts, that somehow they are being given undue special treatment. I disagree. 
Obviously, there are problems with the way China cracks down on political dissent and treats its dissidents. However, I think the insinuation that there is double standard for China is not correct. 
We must continue to speak up when China acts contrary to international norms. Simply put, we cannot and should not look the other way when China disregards its commitments. 
However, we cannot have much say in these matters if we do not talk--if we do not engage in constructive dialogue. After all, China's most repressive periods have occurred when China was isolated from the rest of the world. 
During the debate on this bill, as we consider amendments we should ask ourselves one question. 
Does the amendment strengthen America's hand, and improve our relationship, or will it make things worse? 
If the latter, I would urge my colleagues to vote it down. 
Let me apply this question to the pending, divided, amendment. 
The distinguished Senator from Arkansas has proposed a series of amendments to the DOD authorization bill which aim to change China's behavior through a series of minor but bothersome sanctions. 
I deeply appreciate the Senator's reservations with some of China's policies. We all have reservations with some of China's policies. But, I believe this amendment goes about changing them in the wrong fashion. 
Surely every member of Congress would take issue with forced abortions--I would; we all would--religious persecution the same, and the imprisonment of individuals for the expression of political beliefs. That is clear. 
Americans hold as their most cherished freedoms the right to worship as they please and speak their minds. It is a measure of the country's greatness that we are allowed to speak freely. 
We expect this freedom on this Senate floor and indeed we have it. We expect it in our homes and throughout our workplaces. 
It is therefore natural that we extend these freedoms to peoples in other lands. We object strongly when those rights are denied. Clearly, there are other issues concerning China that Americans can disagree with. 
Despite significant progress, today's China is still too repressive and too restrictive. Those who would speak out against the government still risk imprisonment, house arrest and the denial of political rights. I wish to change that. We all wish to change that, and change that eventually with the right policies we will. 
We must hold China accountable to the human rights agreements it has signed, most notably the universal Declaration of Human Rights. 
But alienating China will not convince China. Ostracizing China will not endear it to the practices we would most like to see implemented. 
We can continue to facilitate China's transformation through engagement and dialogue or we can give in to the isolationist sentiments that these amendments represent. 
As we near the President's departure for China tomorrow, I urge the Senate to express its support for continued engagement of the Chinese Government. 
No doubt about it, the President has much to discuss when he gets to Beijing. But it is both important and appropriate that the discussions occur. They must occur. Frank discussions of necessary improvements in China should be forthcoming. 
The success of the trip will be enhanced with the endorsement of this body. 
Mr. President, today's debate illustrates an even more important point--the need for a bipartisan approach to foreign policy. It has been said that politics ends at the water's edge. When it comes to foreign policy there are no Democrats, there are no Republicans, there are only Americans. 
In this world today, there are many serious, global issues: India and Pakistan exploding nuclear bombs, the expansion of NATO, the collapse of the Asian economy. To the maximum extent possible, we must work together to address these issues. But often, partisan actions hinder progress on important issues of national importance. 
One such instance is the conflict over funding for the International Monetary Fund. 
The attempt to link family planning policy and international financial assistance is an effort to conduct a debate for the benefit of a domestic constituency. If a debate on the IMF is in order, then we should debate the IMF on its merits. But to stall the passage of this important legislation may weaken the hand of the U.S. Government and it may allow real problems to get worse. This is a situation where cooperation is critical. 
Last week, I invited my colleagues to join me in an effort to establish a more cooperative, bipartisan approach to our foreign policy matters. 
I, along with Senator Hagel of Nebraska, am working to focus more energy seeking constructive solutions to American foreign policy problems. We intend to work together, to help reduce the rancor that partisan bickering tends to produce. 
Just as engagement is the proper way of working with China, so too must we engage each other in order to better articulate Americans' interests and needs aboard. 
We are many voices. We represent many ideas. Making progress requires constructive dialogue by all parties, and I encourage my colleagues engage in that discussion. 
One final note, Mr. President. When President Clinton travels--when any American President travels overseas--he is the President of the United States of America. 
He is not a Republican President. He is not a Democratic President. He is the American President. When he travels, we in the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives must give him our full cooperation. There are other times when he returns when we can debate what our foreign policy should be. But when it comes to foreign policy, we Americans will do much better, our stature in the world will be much higher, if we work out these differences among ourselves so that in the end we truly have a bipartisan foreign policy, a foreign policy that the Congress and the President have worked out together so that we stand taller and get more done than we otherwise might. 
There is plenty of room here in domestic politics for partisanship. There is more than enough here for partisanship in domestic politics. I deplore most of it, even in domestic policy, but when it comes to foreign policy, we must stand together. 
I urge Senators who have amendments to think twice before offering them, and perhaps bring up that issue when the President returns from his trip to China, because then the country is much better off. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to address the upcoming summit in China and to stress the importance of this visit to U.S.-China relations. 
Mr. President, as the age old adage says, `A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.' We should begin this journey with the first step--by defining our goals in Asia, and, more directly, in China. 
America's goals are simple: we want peace; we want prosperity and fair trade; and we want a decent world to live in. 
How do we achieve these goals? First, by guaranteeing peace and stability in the Pacific. That means preserving our permanent military presence in Asia. Remaining committed to our alliances with Japan, Korea and Southeast Asia. Defining our interests clearly to China. 
But it also means preventing unnecessary conflicts. And to do that we must find common ground. Remain engaged. Preserve and foster our working relationship with China. We must build and strengthen our diplomatic ties. 
In many ways China remains a challenge--a great wall in and of itself. Its intransigence in many areas of trade, human rights and arms proliferation presents a clear challenge for U.S. policy. Whether the topic is pirated software or the incarceration of political prisoners, China has often proved unwilling to adopt practices that the rest of the world perceives as reasonable and just. And when China behaves contrary to accepted norms, or to the rule of law, we must not look the other way. 
But we also must not fail to recognize China's importance to the United States and the rest of the world. And to engage China, we must understand China. This is a vast and old nation. When Kublai Khan conquered southern China in 1279, he presided over the largest empire the world had ever seen. And at that time the Chinese empire was already 1,500 years old, and Chinese history 2,500 years old. Today's People's Republic of China is the world's most populous nation, accounting for one-fifth of humanity; a nuclear power; and one of the world's fastest-growing economies. 
It is also a diverse nation. China is a mosaic of language, religion and culture. The majority of its 1.2 billion population are Han. The remaining 70 million people belong to 55 different ethnic minorities. China has eight major languages and 600 dialects. Yet we often think of China as one mind, one voice. China has many voices. 
Those who have not traveled to China may find it hard to truly grasp the differences in lifestyles. How many Americans today live without a telephone? Many have two or more. In China, one in four homes has telecommunications capability. And about six out of ten have a radio. 
The average per-capita income in China is estimated at $360 to $700. Yet it is possible that in the next century China will become the world's largest economy. At the same time, it will continue to face enormous problems of unemployment, overpopulation, a low level of education, and poverty. 
Now is the time for the United States to help bring China into the 21st Century. Now is the time to engage China with great expectations. In the areas of weapons proliferation, Most Favored Nation Trading status and the World Trade Organization. And with human rights and the environment. 
Mr. President, Secretary Albright recently stated that `we have an abiding political interest in a region whose cooperation we seek in responding to the new global threats of proliferation, terrorism, illegal narcotics, and the degradation of our environment. And we have an abiding interest as Americans in supporting democracy and respect for human rights in this, the most populous region of the world.' 
Our relationship with China will be essential to all these interests. And we must begin with peace and security, because our diplomatic and security interests in China are critical to maintaining a peaceful and strategic relationship in Asia, as recent events in the Taiwan Strait, South Asia and the Korean Peninsula show. 
China regards our Taiwan policy as the most critical and sensitive issue in this relationship. So while we must treat Taiwan policy with great care, our historic policy, based on commitments to Taiwan's security through the Taiwan Relations Act, and our commitments to acknowledge China's view of sovereignty under our three Joint Communiques, remains sound today. And the events of the past few years show that. China has made its point about how seriously it views independence in the crisis of 1996; and former Secretary Perry made our point about Chinese threats of military force. 
Today the situation has calmed. Taiwan and China are beginning to talk once again. And we can, with caution and foresight from all three sides, expect if not reconciliation, at least stability 
in the Taiwan Strait. We need make no major changes, and in particular should avoid deals at Taiwan's expense as relations with China improve. 
For us, the division of the Korean Peninsula, and the continuing threat posed by the 1.2-million-man North Korean Army just above the demilitarized zone, is equally sensitive. In fact, this is the only issue that ever brought the U.S. and China to war 
And to maintain the peace, we need a cooperative working relationship with China; and on this issue we have it. China is doing precisely what we hope it will do. It offers the North Koreans advice that only a one-time ally can give. It provides food aid. And it does what it can to move the four-party talks ahead, even if that is limited to figuring out seating and handshake arrangements that the two Koreas will accept. 
Then let us look to the spread of nuclear weapons in South Asia. This has created an immense danger for the world of a breakdown in the Non-Proliferation Treaty; an immediate danger of war between India and Pakistan; and a new strategic question for China, as the Indian government has indicated that its decision to test nuclear weapons was due to fears about China. 
China's potential as a positive mediator in South Asia cannot be underestimated. I remain concerned that China may have contributed to the arms race by aiding Pakistan in its development of a nuclear device. It is incumbent on all nations to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, and we must hold China to its signed commitments on this issue. Just as China worked constructively to avert further spread of the recent Asian currency crisis, so too must it be expected to work towards preventing the further proliferation nuclear arms in Asia. 
Mr. President, before I speak about the issue of China and trade, let me say a few words regarding the recent flap over satellite launches. 
First, the concept of allowing China to launch American satellites is sound. It can be done without transferring technology useful for ICBMs. And to suggest that we would willingly facilitate the process of other countries launching ICBMs does not make any sense. 
However, the controversy over this question indicates the large emerging question of a proper approach to the rapid advance of technology from military to commercial fields. This is the basic question not only in satellite launches but in software encryption, technology exports and many other issues. Our country needs a strategic approach to the entire question, and the time to begin is now. With respect to the specific question of satellite launches, if oversight was weak, we should strengthen our policy. If any American companies broke the law they should be punished. But derailing potential progress in U.S.-China relations does not improve the situation one iota. 
The second thing we need is a fair, mutually beneficial economic relationship. And that begins with the most urgent question--the Asian financial crisis. 
I think China's performance--along with that of the Hong Kong S.A.R. government--during the Asian financial crisis has been impressive. With Southeast Asia's currencies suffering, China's competing exports are under intense pressure. A devaluation of the yuan could ease life for many Chinese businesses. But it would start a new panic in the currency market, just as Thailand, South Korea, the Philippines and other Asian nations are beginning to rebuild from last year's collapse. Up to now, China and Hong Kong have remained committed to avoid devaluations. And if Asia recovers this year, it will be in no small part because of China and Hong Kong. 
We also need a stable bilateral trade relationship. And the foundation for this relationship is Most Favored Nation Status. 
President Clinton has just put forth his annual request for renewal of Most Favored Nation status for the Republic of China. Not surprisingly, this request has been greeted with suggestions that the United States should use MFN as a tool. As a weapon, to convince China into making dramatic reforms. It is not. It is the foundation of commercial relations and should be left alone. 
As Winston Churchill once said: `A pessimist sees the difficulty in every opportunity. An optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty.' Those are good words to live by. I stand here today because I believe that we should use MFN as our way of helping China address its internal reforms while preparing for its accession to the World Trade Organization. 
I do not believe that an open trade policy means Americans should be indifferent to human rights abuses in China. The United States should take a strong stand against serious infractions against workers, dissidents, women and children. But restrictions, such as the denial of MFN trading status or the use of sanctions that hurt Chinese people and fail to directly punish the abusers of power, do little to encourage social reconstruction on the mainland. 
In fact we should do the opposite. We should give China unconditional MFN trading status, upon China's accession to the World Trade Organization. I have long promoted this process. And I will do so again as we prepare for this historic summit. The extension of permanent MFN status to China would benefit both of our countries. It would reduce uncertainty in our trade relations. It would increase the chances of China moving to a more open economy. In addition, it would ensure that the U.S. is able to benefit fully from the economic liberalization measures that China must adopt in order to be accepted as a WTO member. 
Finally, we need a fair trade relationship. China's market should be as open to our goods and services as we are to theirs. And today it is not. In this case, the numbers speak for themselves. It may be true that we have a large and growing deficit with China. At the same time, U.S. exports to China have increased from $11.7 billion in 1995 to $12.8 billion in 1997. In the first quarter of 1998, our exports have reached $3.3 billion. My home state of Montana exported $6.2 million worth of products to China just last year. 
Furthermore, our agriculture industry relies on Asia. Ag exports to Asia constitute 40 percent of all agricultural exports. In the United States we produce more than we could ever possibly consume. Our agricultural producers simply cannot survive without markets in China and the Pacific Rim. 
Our economic goals and China's economic goals are not so far apart. China seeks a working market economy for China's people. We seek that as well. We want a fair and open market for our goods and services. Yet we continue to face the startling implications of the trade imbalance between the United States and China--our deficit is almost $50 billion and growing. 
British writer G.K. Chesterson once said: `Do not free a camel from the burden of his hump; you may be freeing him from being a camel.' We cannot change China to make its leaders think like Americans, act like Americans, and participate in the world marketplace like Americans. We should accept our differences. But we must insist on a minimum standard of behavior. 
We must continually push for the elimination of unfair trade barriers, such as the phony ban on Pacific Northwest wheat due to TCK smut. We must encourage private investment over State-Owned Enterprises. We must fight for market transparency. We must insist that President Jiang Zemin and Premier Zhu Rongji open China to more U.S. imports. And the way to do that is a commercially meaningful accession for China to the WTO. 
This is in everyone's best interest. It is good for China and it is good for the United States for the world's largest country to become a member of the WTO. 
But the accession is going too slowly. It is not good enough to wait for China to reach internal consensus on WTO membership. We need to show China that the status quo is not acceptable. I believe that by engaging China, we can help China's reformers balance internal change and global opening. This does not mean delivering WTO carte blanche. Rather, the Administration and Congress should pursue a three-pronged approach to serious engagement. 
First, the United States must give China a material incentive to enter the WTO. The Administration should endorse, and Congress should pass, a law to make permanent MFN status automatic when China enters the WTO. 
Second, the United States should target China's moral incentive to enter the WTO. With our bilateral talks on Taiwan's WTO membership complete, the Administration should push for Taiwan's rapid entry into the WTO, regardless of where talks stand with China. 
Third, the United States must convince China that unnecessary delay in entering the WTO is costly and counterproductive. Distribution and market access are just two issues that farmers and traders want fixed. At the same time, we want to make certain that China will be able to agree to, live with and abide by a signed agreement. If talks remain stagnant after President Clinton's visit to China at the end of this month, we should strongly consider opening a broad market access case under Section 301 of our trade law. It should begin with the areas where China is violating our 1992 agreement. It should set a deadline for sanctions if they do not shape up. 
Let me now turn to our third goal: a decent world to live in. 
President Clinton is right to go to Tiananmen Square when he visits China this month. But he will also be right to speak out on human rights and the rule of law. 
It is a sad fact that those who would speak out against the government are still in danger of being imprisoned or subject to house arrest. Just as China will be expected to abide by the standards of nuclear non-proliferation and the WTO, it also should be expected to live up to the international standards of human rights, beginning with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 
Although I welcome the recent release of political prisoners Wang Dan and Wei Jingsheng, I am disheartened that they are subject to a de facto exile, unable to return to their homeland because of their political activities. Upwards of 2,000 political prisoners remain in China, imprisoned for the simple expression of their beliefs. 
Mr. President, Americans hold freedom of expression as one of their most cherished rights. It is a prerogative that is all too often denied the Chinese people, but one that I view as essential to that country's political and economic viability. Where ideas are suppressed, creativity and innovation are lost. And we need look no further than the world's leading economy to see the importance of innovation and expression. America's economic power is indicative of its political and economic freedom and the extent to which ideas and innovation are exchanged. It is true that China's economic success in the last 20 years is impressive. But how far can innovation and growth proceed in the absence of true freedom to carry out discourse and exchange ideas? The global marketplace grows increasingly competitive every day. China and the rest of the world stand to lose if that great country's people aren't allowed maximum ability to express, innovate and progress. 
Finally, Mr. President, we must also engage China when it comes to environmental concerns. As economies develop throughout the world, they use more fossil fuels. Of course, with increased usage often comes significant pollution. Nowhere is that more true than in China. In the coming years, China will likely burn more fossil fuels, dispose of more chemical and industrial waste and emit more carbon dioxide than any country in the world. As economic growth in China accelerates, demand for electricity and the coal used to generate it will also increase. 
Mr. President, 9 of the last 11 years have been the warmest of the 20th century. If the emissions from China's burgeoning power plants are not subject to controls, our efforts to prevent global warming will be undermined. China is part of the problem, and should be part of the solution. Although this is true for all developing nations, it is especially true for China, its appetite for hydrocarbons being what it is 
When I worked on the Clean Air Act 1990, emissions trading was proposed as an alternative to inflexible, across-the-board efforts to control emissions. Initial reports indicate that the system of emissions trading works. I am interested in possibly applying the concept on a global scale, to include developing countries such as China. 
Again, Mr. President, if we are to minimize the impact of these outputs, the United States must engage China in a cooperative relationship. We must do it in the areas of environmental protection, international security, human rights and trade. Although I agree with the Chinese proverb that says, `It is better to light a candle than curse the darkness,' I also think that the words of that great American Henry Ford are apropos here: `Coming together is a beginning, staying together is progress, and working together is success.' Mr. President, the United States and China have come together. For our benefit and that of the rest of the world, let us continue to work together for success. 
Finally, Mr. President, let me say a few words about the approach I see developing in Congress. 
We have not covered ourselves with glory recently. We have not passed our IMF replenishment. We have not passed our UN dues. We have not passed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. We have not passed fast track. And some have seen the recent satellite launch controversy as an opportunity to make points in domestic politics. 
This is not the way a great power behaves. We have serious responsibilities in our foreign affairs--whether in peace and security, in economics and trade, human rights or environmental protection. And we diminish our institution at home, and our country abroad, if we do not take these responsibilities seriously. 
We have time to fix our deficiencies. But it is not unlimited time, and as we see in South Asia; in Hong Kong; in Korea; events will not wait for us. So as the President makes this historic trip, let us reflect a little more deeply on ourselves, on our responsibilities, and on what we can do for our national, rather than political, interest. 
Thank you, Mr. President, and I yield the floor.  
Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to say a few words about the Bond-Baucus-Grassley Joint Resolution introduced today that nullifies a regulation which threatens to put many of my state's home health agencies, or HHAs, out of business. Our resolution officially disapproves the regulation issued by the Health Care Financing Administration on June 1 of this year. The rule requires each home health agency that receives Medicare reimbursement to buy a costly surety bond. This expensive bond is out of reach for many of the agencies that provide in-home service to Montana's elderly and low income residents. 
Let me say from the outset that I support the provision in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 requiring HHAs to post a surety bond for Medicare and Medicaid. Perhaps we need to make some changes to the statute, but the underlying idea--to protect the Medicare program by requiring home health agencies to post a bond--is a good one. Unfortunately, the regulation HCFA plans to implement requires a much higher bond amount. 
One Montana home health agency based in Butte would have to post a bond of more than $600,000 under the HCFA regulation. That's an outrage. And it will put that company, and many others across the country, out of business. 
I am also concerned that HCFA has incorrectly interpreted Congressional intent by using the bonds to collect on Medicare overpayments, not just fraud. As a result, many HHA owners are being asked to put up personal assets, such as their house, as collateral for the bond. These agencies tend to be non-hospital based and not tied to a larger corporate structure. All have far less than $600,000 in personal and business assets. We shouldn't expect anyone to sign over those assets just to do business in the Medicare program. 
Also, many HHAs are family-owned small businesses. We cannot let any federal regulation force small businesses to close their door. This not only affects businesses, but also their customers--our bed-ridden elderly. 
That is why we have acted here today. The Bond-Baucus-Grassley resolution will invoke the Congressional Review Act to disapprove HCFA's regulation. And I urge quick action in the Senate on this important matter.

 Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to honor an outstanding Montanan, Beverly Gibson. She will retire June 30 after twenty years as assistant director of the Montana Association of Counties and nearly 30 years of outstanding public service to her State. Through her work I believe Bev knows almost everyone involved in county government in the State, and those of us who have had the great fortune to know her stand in awe of this great lady's achievements. 
Montana-born and journalist by training, Bev has been the heart and soul and living history of MACO since its very early expertise have touched many lives. In a State like mine, with its vast area and sparse population spread over 56 counties, local government is the lifeblood of politics. Bev is the real champion in this arena. 
At MACO Bev is known as the person who gets things done. Twice a year, MACO holds statewide meetings and she was always the first to get there and welcome everyone. She would research all the issues, staff committees, act as official photographer, coordinate speakers and agency representatives and was the last to say goodbye. Can you imagine doing that for 168 commissioners of different parties? I honestly don't know how the organization will get along without her, except that she is leaving an incredible legacy that will brighten the way for others. 
As she retires, I want to wish her much joy, health and happiness. And I also want to say thanks, Bev, for a job well done and for a real service to Montana.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I want to first compliment the chairman of our committee, Senator Chafee, who has done, I believe, an extraordinary job. I wish Members of the Senate who were not in the conference committee could have watched the proceedings. They would have seen the chairman set a very civil, gracious, and respectful tone. That was the tone of the conference. Sometimes conferences get pretty acrimonious. This one was not at all. 
Just a brief summary of the bill, Mr. President, on where we are. 
This is truly a historic bill. That is a term that many Members of Congress use somewhat loosely around here. But this one really is. And I think even compared to the last ISTEA bill, this is historic. Let me tell you why. 
For the first time, all the dollars that we as citizens pay in fuel taxes when we put gasoline in our cars, or diesel fuel in our pickups, will go into the highway trust fund. And all the dollars that come out of that trust fund will go back in the form of highway allocation, or mass transit allocation. We are not changing the distribution between mass transit or highways. But, again, all the dollars that come into the trust fund paid for by gasoline taxes will come out of the trust fund through to the State's allocation for their various highway programs, or, in the case of the mass transit account, to the mass transit account. That is a major change from the current practice. The current practice, for those of us who fill the gas tank and put dollars into the highway trust fund through our gasoline taxes and are not sure that those dollars are going to come back in the form of highway allocations, sometimes those dollars at the will of the Congress and the President are used for other purposes. That will no longer be the case. Dollars in, dollars out. 
We also wrote into this legislation a guarantee called a `firewall' to make sure that happens. It is not totally 100 percent guaranteed, but for all intents and purposes, it might as well be. 
After that huge increase, we have a lot more highway dollars coming out, not only because of the guarantee I mentioned but also because just recently Congress enacted legislation to ensure that the 4.3 cents-per-gallon gasoline tax previously used for deficit reduction is now going into the highway trust fund, which means 4.3 cents more than previously was the case. The rule of thumb basically is that 1 penny of gasoline tax--about $1.6 billion, or $7 billion--goes into 
the highway trust fund. This is a big increase. On average, States will receive about a 43-percent increase in highway funds for each of the next 6 years compared with what they have received in the past 3 years. It is again for those reasons. 
I might also say that the attempt of the conferees, which I think was met, was for regional balance. This process started in the Senate about a year ago. Senator Warner from Virginia, myself, Senator Chafee, and Senator Moynihan, also for all intents and purposes, introduced separate bills representing different parts of the country, each part having generally a different point of view. Senator Warner was essentially concerned proportionally more about the donor States; that is, those States which historically have been receiving from the trust fund considerably fewer dollars than they have been putting in. 
Then there are the Western States, and small States which have unique circumstances because of low population density, and sometimes wide spaces, which also have a certain point of view. 
Then, third, there are the Northeast States by and large--I grant you these are very rough estimates and a very rough explanation. But the Northeast States, which are more densely populated historically, receive quite a bit of highway funds as well as mass transit funds. 
We try to give balance in this bill, first by ensuring that the donor States, those that would put so much into the highway trust fund but receiving a lot less, are guaranteed essentially 90 cents on the dollar--90.05 cents. There are some adjustments. That is basically it. 
In addition, small States receive what small States believe would be a fair share. It is true that the Northeastern States don't get the same, on average, percent increase. But that is, to be honest about it, because those States in the previous ISTEA bill got quite a large chunk of money compared with other portions of the country. 
So this is a guarantee to even things out. 
For those who are concerned about the environmental provisions, let me say that this bill is environmentally sound. 
There is the congestion mitigation account, which has more dollars in it than the previous ISTEA bill. 
So the dollars are there for cities which do not meet the Clean Air Act standards--additional dollars--to undertake the various expenditures to reduce air pollution in their cities. That is there. 
The enhancement provision is still fully funded. Those who are concerned about bike paths and trails are also going to be, I think, happy with the provisions in this bill. 
We also rejected in the final hours some provisions which I think would have been very harmful to the environment. 
There has been some talk about the PCB problem in New York. That was rejected. It is not in here. 
I can list other attempts. I know some of the environmental conservation committees are worried about what was attempted to be put in this bill and the conferees rejected. 
I might also just outline and remind us that each of us, as a Senator, is worried about fighting for our respective States. That is our job, that is what we ran for office for, and that is what we hired out to do--to represent our States the best we possibly can. 
As you know, Mr. President, most Senators are not wallflowers. Most Senators are good advocates for their States. They are fierce advocates for their States, which obviously means that it is hard to get 100 points of view all accommodated, particularly when each State thinks it has a unique point of view that makes it a little bit different from other States. Add to that the further complication that there is another body; there is a House of Representatives. We in the Senate pass what we think is the best legislation for our States. The highway bill that passed the Senate passed by a very large margin. Senators liked the bill. It was good for our respective States and was a good compromise for all our States. But House Members have a very different view on the highway program compared to Senators. It is, very simply, because we Senators represent entire States; House Members don't represent entire States, except for a very few. There are about five or six very-low-populated States, like my State of Montana, which has only one Member of Congress. But most Members of Congress, who tend to be from populous States, such as New York, California, and Florida, for example, are really much more interested in their districts; 
what is the highway bill going to do for their districts, rather than for their States? Of course they care about their States. They care deeply about their States. But I dare say they probably care a little bit more about their district. After all, they run for reelection every 2 years. They want to show, legitimately and properly, to their constituents, the people who voted for them--or perhaps didn't vote for them--that they are doing the best job they possibly can for their district, which means the formulas, as the allocations, somewhat clash. 
Senators are worried about Senate distribution. Senators are worried about State distribution. House Members are worried a little bit about State distribution, but quite a bit about how much their districts get. Hence, we have this phenomenon called demonstration projects. It is difficult to meld these two competing points of view together. 
I mention all of this because as we in the Senate are here, now, voting on this conference report which is about to be before us--as we look at it, we might find it is not exactly what we would have preferred. It is not exactly the bill that passed the Senate. But when Members of the Senate look closely at what is in this conference report, I think they will find it is very close to the provisions that passed the Senate and should not be distressed. Certainly, it is important to point out that every State but for one, which is a very, very special case, will receive a significant increase in dollars per year allocated to the State. The average increase, and I must underline the word average, is about a 43-percent increase for all the States. That is not a small number. It is a large number. It means, for example, that it is increased from 28----

Mr. BAUCUS. So it, the current program, is roughly $18 billion, the current ISTEA which expired. This bill is $26 billion, roughly; hence, roughly a 43-percent increase. And a State, on average, will receive that 43-percent increase. So, while there are little `i's' that are not dotted properly according to some Senators, or `t's' that are not crossed properly according to some, I submit this is a good bill. It is good for the country. It repairs a lot of needed repairs. There are a lot of roads in our country that need repair and curves that need to be straightened out--in addition to our very good environmental programs in this bill. I just hope the Senate, when we see the conference report from the House, acts on it very quickly because then we will have finished our business, people home will be proud of what we have done, and we can get on to other business when we come back after recess. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BAUCUS. The bill clarifies that it does not affect EPA's authority to provide for state implementation of the agreements and recommendations set forth in the June 1996 Grand Canyon Visibility Transport Commission Report on a schedule consistent with the Commission's Report. This was a critical issue for the conferees. The conferees recognize that the Commission's Report was the product of several years of debate and analysis, and reflects broad consensus on control strategies and measures that should proceed with implementation. The conferees added specific language so as not to preclude the Administrator from providing for earlier state implementation of the Commission's agreements and recommendations, consistent with the implementation schedules in the Commission's Report.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I agree with my colleague from Rhode Island that the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program has been an effective part of the highway program. It's given construction companies owned by women and minorities a seat at the table. 
I also believe that the program is constitutional. Under the Supreme Court's Adarand decision, affirmative action programs like the DBE program must pass two tests. The first is that the program serve a compelling interest. The lower court decision in the Adarand case held that there is such a compelling interest. The Senate debate reinforced this point. There was discussion of discrimination in the construction industry, and of statistics showing the underutilization of women- and minority-owned businesses in that industry, such as evidence of dramatic decreases in DBE participation in those areas in which DBE programs have been curtailed or suspended. 
There also was discussion of the second test, whether the program is narrowly tailored. As I explained in my statements during debate on the McConnell amendment, I believe that the program is narrowly tailored, both under the current regulations and the new regulations, which emphasize flexible goals tied to the capacity of firms in the local market, the use of race-neutral measures, and the appropriate use of waivers for good faith efforts. 
As I said during the Senate debate, the DBE program is fair. It is necessary. And it works. I am pleased that, in rejecting amendments that would have undermined the DBE program, the Senate has reaffirmed its commitment to equal opportunity.

Mr. BAUCUS. In July of 1997, the Environmental Protection Agency promulgated final rules that set new National Ambient Air Quality standards for fine particle air pollution, known as PM2.5. The standards require three years of monitoring data to be collected before determining whether an area is meeting the standards. 
It is my understanding that under the Clean Air Act, Governors are required to submit designations for attainment, nonattainment and unclassifiable areas within their states within 120 days but no later than 1 year following promulgation of a new or revised standard. The EPA is then required to promulgate designations within two years of the issuance of such final standards. 
For the July 1997 PM2.5 standard, this schedule poses a problem. Monitors are not yet in place and three years of monitoring data will not be available to permit Governors and the EPA to determine whether an area is or is not in attainment. Therefore, the Clean Air Act would require EPA to take the meaningless step of designating areas as unclassifiable in July of 1999 on the basis that three years of PM2.5 monitoring data are unavailable.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in support of the Agricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reform Act of 1998. At long last, this important piece of legislation is before the Senate for consideration and passage of the Conference Report. 
This Act is the result of more than a year of hard work and can boast broad bipartisan support. By providing $1.7 billion in agricultural research and extension activities at institutions of higher learning across the nation, this Act commits the U.S. government to supporting a strong future for agriculture in Montana and across the nation. 
I would like to recognize four areas that affect Montana: 
The Montana State University Agriculture Extension Service. We have one of the finest examples of an ag extension service in the country, centered at Montana State University in Bozeman, Montana. The College of Agriculture, led by Dean Tom McCoy, has produced numerous innovative projects worthy of recognition. Research at Montana State University has led to more pest-resistant, higher yielding varieties of barley and wheat. MSU scientists have improved the value of barley as a feedstock for cattle. And they are using the remarkable power of biotechnology to develop the answers to the ag challenges of the next century. The agriculture research bill provides the funding necessary for our scientists to carry out, continue and build upon their mission to serve our agriculture industry. 
This bill will also continue funding for the good work demonstrated by our country extension agents. Their efforts on behalf of Montana's agricultural industry go above and beyond to provide resources that help our producers meet their bottom line, improve their yield, and enhance their competitiveness in the world marketplace. 
Crop Insurance. Today, while we debate the passage of this bill, several counties in Montana are under severe drought and fire alert. Farmers have waited helplessly for rain while their crops wither and die. This is surely a make it or break it year due to low prices, a dry winter, and unfair grain dumping from our foreign competitors. The mere threat of crop insurers canceling policies is an obstacle that many producers simply cannot overcome. For that reason, I am pleased that this Act contains provisions to strengthen crop insurance--just when our producers need it most. Clearly, we must take the final step and pass this conference report. 
Food Animal Residue Avoidance Database. I would like to thank Chairman Lugar for including my bill, the Food Animal Residue Avoidance Database, more commonly known as FARAD, in this Act. I am pleased that the Conference report authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to make three-year grants to colleges and universities to operate the FARAD program. FARAD is critical in our food-safety regime. Its database provides invaluable information about dangerous residues that affect our food supply. The FARAD program successfully links producers, veterinarians and the general public to an informational resource network that enables us to produce the safest food in the world. 
Agricultural Research Service. I am most proud of the work conducted at the Agricultural Research Service stations in Sidney, Montana and Fort Keogh at Miles City. I strongly believe that their efforts are of tremendous importance to our food industry as well as our agricultural trade. The future of agriculture is in their very capable hands. They enjoy strong support from the agricultural community because they are a part of that community. Whenever I am in these towns, I stop by and visit these facilities because the people that work there, and the community that supports them, are very proud of the great work that they do for our ag industry. This bill will continue the critical work at these locations. 
I would also like to recognize that this bill supports many other worthy projects, including the National Food Genome Strategy, an assistive technology program for farmers with disabilities, the important Fund for Rural America, Precision Agricultural research, and research of wheat and barley diseases caused by scab. 
This Act is worthy of our immediate action. I urge my colleagues to pass the Agricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reform Act of 1998 and recommend that President Clinton sign it without hesitation.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to take a moment to share with the Senate the remarkable accomplishments of some truly `high fliers.' 
All of us in this body travel to schools and encourage tomorrow's leaders to `aim high.' Last week, three Montana pole vaulters did just that and the result was that collegiate and high school records fell. 
Three extraordinary women, all from my hometown of Helena, made a bit of history. 
On the collegiate level, Helena High Graduate and University of Montana freshman Nicole Zeller twice set new Big Sky Conference records in the pole vault, first by clearing 11 feet 10 inches, and then, improving her own record with a vault of 12 feet, 1/2 inch. 
Meanwhile, two Helena high school students--one from my and Senator Roth's alma mater, Helena High, the other from Capital High--were registering the two best vaults in the nation this year. One of them set a new national record for high school pole vaulters. 
Not only did Shannon Agee of Helena High set a new national record. She beat the old one by a mile. She vaulted 13 feet and eclipsed the old record by a full incredible five inches. 
On the same day, Capital High senior Suzanne Krings cleared 12 feet 6 inches, giving her the second-best vault in the nation this year. 
So today, Mr. President, I extend my congratulations to Shannon, Suzanne and Nicole for showing all of us how to soar.

First of all, I hope that the bill to be offered by the Senator from California and the Senator from New York will be brought up quickly and passed. I think every Member of the Senate does. I very much favor it. At the same time, I very strongly believe the Patients' Bill of Rights, the basic protection bill, we have to pass that. It is very regrettable, frankly, that we are at loggerheads. We need to get that bill passed. I think we should work that out fairly soon. Frankly, it is in the interest of the American people we get this passed very quickly. But it is not going to be resolved right now. 
By unanimous consent, the remarks of Mr. Baucus pertaining to `Montana Pole Vaulters' are printed in today's Record under `Morning Business.'

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I have very much appreciated listening to the arguments for this amendment. However, I think it is important for us to step back a little bit and look at this issue a little more broadly. The first point I would make is to remind my colleagues that the IRS Restructuring Commission recommended that the Treasury Secretary serve on the Board, as well as recommend there be a representative of an employee organization. 
The Restructuring Commission spent a lot of time thinking about this. This is not something they willy-nilly recommended to the Congress. Just as we in the Senate voted to honor the Restructuring Commission's inclusion of a representative of an employee organization, I submit it makes sense for us to honor the Restructuring Commission's recommendations to continue to include the Treasury Secretary. The Restructuring Commission spent a lot of time thinking about this, and they did conclude that the Treasury Secretary should be a member of the Board. 
Why did they do that? I think for a number of reasons. First, the Treasury Secretary has responsibility for the IRS. After all, that is a large part of his job. In fact, 80 percent of Treasury's resources and people are in the IRS--over 100,000 employees. 
Second, there is an analogy with corporations. Corporate boards include chairmen. Corporate boards include CEOs. Why do they do so? Because they want communication between the governing board on the one hand, and the operation management on the other. You have to have direct communication; you have to have guidance. If the Treasury Secretary is not on the Board, that certainly diminishes communication between the Board and the Treasury Secretary. It is just obvious and also does something else which is the exact opposite of what we are trying to do here. It tends to create an adversarial relationship between the Treasury Secretary and the Board. 
The analogy which someone alluded to earlier of having `the fox guard the chicken coop' to have the Treasury Secretary on the Board, is totally inapplicable. Why? Simply because the other board members, the six private board members, are going to be pretty strong-willed people if they are going to agree to serve on this Board. Any President who wants to make IRS restructuring work is going to get pretty strong people. These are not people who are going to roll over willy-nilly at the insistence of the Treasury Secretary. 
First of all, they don't work for the Treasury Secretary. These are private sector people. The only working relationships between the Secretary and Board members is with the Commissioner, Mr. Rossotti, and in some indirect way, the employees representative. There are six private sector people on the Board who are going to be strong-willed, strong-minded people. They are not going to roll over and play dead. 
In addition, the Treasury Secretary is going to want to be a two-way messenger, both to and from the Board, to the President's Cabinet, to the President himself. If we want IRS restructuring to work, we want him to participate in the Board's deliberations. He will be able to share information with the other members of the Board that they might not otherwise know about, and that no one else would know. At the same time, he would learn things about the IRS by serving on the Board that he might not otherwise discover. 
Another way to see that we have ensured independence of the Board is that each of the six private sector members is subject to the confirmation process in the Senate. When we are talking to these nominees as they go before our committees in the Senate, we have ample opportunity to insist upon the independence of these board members. We have ample opportunity for commitment from these nominees. They are not going to kowtow to any Secretary. 
To sum up, Mr. President, the Restructuring Commission 
recommended the Treasury Secretary. It makes sense to keep the communication flowing between the Board and the Treasury Department and the President's Cabinet. The private sector Board members are going to be strong-willed people. They are not going to just acquiesce to the suggestions of the Treasury Secretary. In fact, there are provisions in this legislation to help assure that independence. One is having the Board send a separate budget to the Congress, for example, independent of the Treasury Secretary. It makes good sense to follow the recommendations of the Restructuring Commission on this matter. I urge my colleagues to keep the Treasury Secretary on the Board.  
Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I too thank the Chairman for his work on these issues. I am concerned that the Senate bill contains a provision, Section 7612(b)(3) that makes it easier for the IRS to gain access to software source code in the event that a taxpayer refuses to provide his own financial data to the IRS. Since the sofeware publisher can neither provide this data themselves, nor compel a taxpayer to provide it, I believe this provision is unnecessary. The bill should not punish a third-party software company when the IRS fails to use those tools against an uncooperative taxpayer. I hope the Chairman will reconsider this issue in conference.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Senior Citizen Protection Act of 1998. The legislation aims to protect our nation's seniors from patient and elder abuse. The bill also protects our federal health care programs, most notably Medicare, from fraud. 
In the past two years, we have made great strides against fraud and abuse by passing new initiatives. These initiatives include closing loopholes, improving coordination between Federal, State, and local law enforcement programs, and enhancing the powers of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services to combat fraud and recover lost money. 
These measures are helping, but there is another vision which I think will help us stay ahead of those who endlessly scheme to defraud our health care programs. The Senior Citizen Protection Act deputizes Medicaid investigators and enables them to weed out fraud and abuse in our federal health program. 
Currently, when a Medicaid Fraud Control Unit investigates a state Medicaid fraud case and finds a similar violation in Medicare, the Unit cannot investigate the Medicare infraction. Common sense will tell you that an unscrupulous actor defrauding Medicaid will likely do the same to federal health programs. 
In Montana, for example, the Medicaid Fraud Control Unit routinely finds co-existing cases of Medicaid and Medicare fraud in patient records. While the Unit has the documents right in front of them, they can not pursue the Medicare abuses. 
Federal authorities must conduct a new and separate investigation. Unfortunately, these violations may be too small to justify a federal investigation. The majority of health care fraud recoveries, 62%, are more than a million dollars. Even more striking, only 6% of federal fraud recoveries are in an amount lower than $100,000. Thus, the Federal Government is doing a good job of weeding out the big actors in the anti-fraud war, but the smaller actors--which still cost money--continue to ride scot-free. 
That is where our legislation can help. If a fraud Unit is investigating a fraudulent doctor, for example, and finds some Medicare claims that look false, currently the investigator has to call the Inspector General's office and report their suspicions. 
In many cases, however, they hear back from Washington that the claims may be fraudulent, but the fraud is not widespread enough to justify the expense of a federal investigation. Under our legislation, the Units will now be able to wrap the Medicare case into their own investigation and the Federal Government will be able to continue spending their resources on larger fraud operations. 
The Senior Citizen Protection Act allows state Fraud Control Units to investigate federal violations which come to their attention during an existing state Medicaid investigation. By giving the Units this discreet authority, we can take another step toward reducing fraud and abuse. 
While most fraud cases are the result of overbilling, false billing, or a provider performing unnecessary services, almost 25% of health care fraud cases are due to poor quality of care or care not provided. And that is when these problems cross over from health care fraud to actual patient abuse and neglect. It alarms all of us when we hear stories of older individuals being harmed by unscrupulous persons. What upsets me so much about elderly abuse is how vulnerable these victims are, especially since they depend so much on their health care providers for actual daily activities. 
Some Senators may have heard about the egregious case in Arizona where two defendants pled guilty to three counts of aggravated assault for sexually assaulting, intimidating and abusing patients. Their crimes included spitting at and kicking patients, and threatening to give a pill to a patient so he would never wake up. Some patients were so afraid they would not eat or drink. This is a modern tragedy. 
Other stories include incidents of physical abuse, verbal ridicule and mockery, and neglect, such as depriving patients of food, water and the opportunity for communication. 
Under current law, state Medicaid Fraud Control Units can only investigate and prosecute cases of elder abuse in state-funded facilities. However, more and more seniors are moving into assisted living and residential treatment settings that receive no state funds. Let me be clear: I support this trend, as it gives seniors more choices about the type of long-term care they receive. I am concerned, however, that assisted living facilities have little oversight to prevent patient neglect and abuse. Local authorities often lack the resources and skill to investigate health care cases. 
In Montana, our state Medicaid Fraud Control Unit routinely receives calls from local law enforcement agencies, local public health departments, and even Adult Protective Services requesting assistance with elder abuse cases. However, the Fraud Unit's hands are tied; they lack the jurisdictional authority to offer help. 
The Senior Citizen Protection Act will enable state Medicaid Fraud Control Units to investigate cases of patient abuse and neglect in residential facilities that do not receive state reimbursement. Medicaid investigators have the experience and expertise to assist local authorities with this job. Allowing the Medicaid Fraud Control Units to lend their expertise to cases in non-Medicaid facilities makes good sense and is right for our seniors.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Nebraska. 
I strongly support the Kerrey amendment for several reasons. First, the funding mechanism provided for in the manager's amendment to the underlying bill, while creative and it meets the technical requirements of the budget rules, it is also very misleading. The rollover provisions in the managers' amendment do raise $8 billion in the first 5 years that the provision will be in effect, but that same provision loses $7 billion in the second 5 years--a clear revenue loss. 
Here we are in the underlying amendment saying, `OK, early on, we'll raise the revenue,' but we don't tell the rest of the world, particularly the Congress and Senators who are voting on this, that we are going to lose $7 billion in the next 5 years. 
Part of our efforts in the Congress, I hope, have been truth in budgeting not just in the first 5 years, but also beyond, in the next 5 years. Too often, this Congress has, unfortunately, hoodwinked people--the President has been part of it, both administrations, in the last 10 to 15 years--by saying, `OK, we will meet the budget requirements in the first 5 years, but we won't tell everybody what we are doing in the next 5 years,' and often in the next 5 years, if not disastrous, it is inimical to the American people because it tends to increase deficits rather than decrease. That is a fact. To the credit of this administration, it has tried to be truthful not only in the first 5 years, but also the next 5 years, and so has the Congress. 
Here we are with an underlying amendment which goes totally against that effort on the part of good, solid statesmanlike Senators to be truthful not only in the first 5 years, but the next 5 years. 
This amendment increases the deficit because it costs $7 billion more in the next 5 years. That is not right. We shouldn't be doing that. That is what this amendment does. This is a gimmick. It is purely and simply a gimmick, and that is why it is a bad idea. 
The Kerrey amendment, on the other hand, raises revenue in several ways. One is by postponing some of the effective dates of the provisions. Why is that important? Not only because it raises revenue, that is only of minor importance, but the major reason is because we all know, Mr. President, this country faces a massive problem in the next year or two with the fancy term Y2K. It is computer conversion to the next millennium. 
We know that most computers in our country, whether it is in the IRS, whether it is in the companies, have a system where they have two digits for the date, two digits for the month, and two digits for the year. What is today? Today is May 6, 1998. So it would be 05-06-98. 
That is how the computers record today's date. All computers do that. So we get to December 1999--12-30-99, 12-31-99, and next is 01-01-00. Now, we like to think that is January 1, 2000, but most computers today will record that as January 1, 1900, because two zeros are treated as 1900, not 2000. Massive problems. 
It is going to cost the IRS, to convert these computers just to meet this conversion problem, $1 billion--$1 billion just to convert. That is to say nothing of all the other costs to comply with new changes in the law. 
So the Kerrey amendment is very, very logical. It is safe. Maybe a little on the conservative side. It says, let us delay the effective dates of some of these new provisions. Why? Because we do not want to further complicate the conversion problem. 
This IRS restructuring bill is going to further complicate the conversion problem--further complicate it--not lessen, but further complicate it. So Senator Kerrey says, well, let us not do the gimmick, let us delay the effective date a little bit, and let us also delay the effective date to take care of the Y2K problem, the conversion problem. 
The underlying amendment, the manager's amendment--I have the highest regard for my friend from Delaware, the chairman of the committee--does not delay, therefore, further causes a problem for the IRS to convert and is much more expensive. It also comes up with a way to get revenue, which is a gimmick. 
Some on the floor have said that extending the Superfund tax will prevent the enactment of Superfund. That is not true, just basically is not true. What is the advantage of using the extension of the Superfund tax? I will give you several. 
One, it is not a gimmick. It is straight. It is right there. People know what it is. It is not a gimmick. Second, it is a tax that everybody knows about, is comfortable with. Sure, it expired a couple years ago, but everybody knows who pays the tax, what the tax is; and it would be extended I think to the year 2000, which means that the revenue is there. 
Let us say Congress does enact Superfund. And I sure hope it does. I say, Mr. President, we have been working on Superfund for a long time. Let us say we enact Superfund. I hope we do. That does not mean it cannot be enacted because previously we extended the Superfund tax. Not at all. The Superfund tax we talk about here is not offset against the Superfund. It is not offset against--it is there. It is revenue and held in a pot to pay for the bill. 
We can still enact Superfund. And, frankly, the underlying tax bill still pays part of Superfund. The Superfund bill will still go to the Finance Committee. The Finance Committee is pretty creative in figuring out ways to find the additional revenue, which will not be very much, basically to pay for the orphan share, the effect of the later date. There is no rocket science in the choice of the standards we have before us. 
On the one hand it is the underlying amendment, which is a gimmick, which is deceiving the taxpayers, which will require this body to come up with $7 billion more revenue than otherwise is the case because we are widening the budget deficit, not decreasing it in the second 5 years. 
Also, on that amendment--let me say it again. First is the underlying amendment. It further complicates the conversion problem. It is a gimmick. That is one choice. The other choice is to enact a revenue measure which is not a gimmick and 
which will not further complicate the conversion problem. That is the case. 
Mr. President, I think the choice is pretty simple. I think it is pretty straightforward. I think, accordingly, we should put politics aside. I know the majority party is going to vote for the amendment because that is what they are told to do. That is the drill. You vote for that one. But if you step back and think a little bit about what is really going on here, I hope both parties can find a way to come together, find a way not to further complicate the conversion problem and to pass a revenue-raising measure that is not a gimmick. 
Believe me, Mr. President, the Kerrey amendment is certainly the beginnings of that. Maybe with further modifications we can come together to finally get this thing passed.  
Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, during the last couple of months, in every household across the country, Americans went through an annual rite. They sat down at the kitchen table, pulled all their financial records together, and figured out what they owed the Government in taxes. 
Nobody likes doing their taxes. And people dislike paying them even more. Yet the vast majority of our citizens do pay their taxes. And they pay them honestly. 
In short, Americans expect their money to be used to pay for all of the things that help make this nation great. In return, though, the American people want their Government to do two things. 
First, the American people want their Government to treat them with respect and dignity as the revenue is being collected. They expect to have their privacy respected, and to be treated fairly. 
Second, Americans expect that everyone else who enjoys the benefits taxes pay for will shoulder their share of the burden. That their neighbor down the street isn't hiding part of his income, and thus avoiding paying his fair share of the tax. That everyone is filing returns, and that the amounts claimed on those returns are accurate and true. 
Mr. President, I truly believe the American people have the right to have both of these expectations met. And I believe we here in the Senate shoulder a great deal of the responsibility for making sure of it. 
Chief Justice John Marshall said: `The power to tax involves the power to destroy.' It is our duty as Senators to make sure this country does not use its power in that fashion. 
Running the IRS is a study in careful balances. And I believe that the IRS has somehow lost its ability to maintain one side of the equation over the years. 
Many tax collectors, in their zeal to catch those among us who don't pay their taxes, seem to have lost sight of the most important truth about our tax system--that citizens have rights that must be protected. 
Anything less undermines our ability to make a system of voluntary taxation work. 
Here's a graphic example of how the system has gotten out of whack. It's contained in a recent letter from one of my constituents. It's a plea for help: 
The problem with the IRS started in 1997. John [not his real name] and I had just bought a house. I was a semester away from graduating from college, and we thought the [failed] business was behind us. The last week in July 1997, I returned home after a day of working at my part-time job to find a nasty note on my front door from [an IRS agent] stating that he had `tracked' us down and expected a phone call or action would be taken. I promptly called him to find out the reasoning behind the note. He was very rude and reluctant to give me any information, because I [was not my husband]. I explained that I was his wife and he began talking to me in a degrading manner. He said, `Your husband owes tax, and I expect to collect it in full.' When I asked him to explain, he very quickly said it was for [my husband's failed business] and began treating me as a criminal who was running from the IRS. 
We feel we have not been treated fairly in this situation. We have attempted to make good on all other situations regarding this [failed] business and have not been hiding from the IRS. [The IRS agent] has been extremely rude and unsympathetic toward us. He has put a tax lien on everything we own. He has also made comments to our accountant indicating that he has been tracking our personal lives and mentioning purchases and other personal matters. In [the IRS agent's] eyes we are criminals cheating the government. In our eyes the government is cheating us by never giving us a fair chance to make good. This whole situation has cost us over $700 in accounting fees and is still unresolved. We are turning to you as a final attempt to resolve this problem. We hope you can help us in making the government work for the people not against them. 
That letter sums up this issue in a nutshell: Make the Government work for the people, not against them. Make Government responsive to taxpayers' needs. Make service the priority of the Internal Revenue Service. Make the IRS treat taxpayers fairly--and with respect. That's what my constituent wants. And that's what I want. 
We certainly don't want to tie IRS's hands so much that tax cheats are encouraged. The rest of us end up picking up the tab when someone cheats. At the same time, we also can't have IRS harassing 
innocent citizens, assuming everyone is guilty the minute they walk in the door. 
I believe this legislation will help IRS find its way back to the reasonable balance that our tax system requires. 
The IRS has suffered from years of neglect and lack of focus. The spotlight that has been turned on the Service, by the IRS Restructuring Commission and by the series of hearings we have held in the Senate Finance Committee, has already had a positive effect on the IRS. 
The Service is expanding hours and people for its telephone answering service. Taxpayers got 13 million fewer busy signals this year when they called IRS to ask questions about their taxes. Toll-free calls are being answered 91% of the time--a huge improvement. Last year callers only got through 66% of the time, and only 39% of the time the year before. This year, phone lines are being answered 18 hours a day. And for the first time, the IRS is open on Saturdays. 
People answering the phones are also getting better. One group of Baltimore IRS workers gave correct advice to 100% of recent random test calls. Nationally, accuracy scores are up to 93% this year, from only 63% as recently as 1989. 
So more taxpayers are able to get through to the IRS when they have a question, and more of the answers they will get will be the right ones. 
IRS has a webpage where taxpayers can download documents and forms. Now taxpayers don't have to run all over town just to find the right paperwork. 
And the Service has had a series of `Problemsolving Days' around the country, where taxpayers can come in and get their problems taken care of. The last `Problemsolving Day' in my home state of Montana was in Billings in January. More than half of all the taxpayers who participated walked out with their problems taken care of on the spot. Many of the rest have been resolved in the succeeding weeks. 
But there are still problems at the IRS, as our hearings--and my constituent's letter and plea for help--have clearly identified. And many of the improvements planned by our new IRS Commissioner, Charles Rossotti, require legislative action in order to go forward. 
The bill before us is a very good beginning. It addresses the first expectation the American people share--making sure the Government treats them with respect and dignity as the revenue is being collected. It does this through a series of provisions. 
First, the bill creates a board, made up chiefly of private citizens, to oversee the direction the IRS is going. The Board will keep an eye on the Service's budget, to make sure enough resources are being dedicated to customer service. It will help define long-term goals, and make sure the Service stays on track to meet those goals. The Board will ferret out problems at the IRS, and help craft solutions to those problems. 
The bill creates significant new personnel flexibilities to make it easier for Commissioner Rossotti to get his own team on board and reward employees who are doing well. It requires the IRS to submit an employee training plan to Congress, to help employees improve the quality of their work. The bill requires IRS to tell Congress about taxpayer complaints of misconduct by employees, and to take disciplinary action against `bad apples'. The bill also makes it easier for IRS employees to provide confidential information to the Finance and Ways and Means Committees to report allegations of employee misconduct or taxpayer abuse. 
The bill will reorganize the IRS, much as IBM was reorganized when they realized they couldn't compete against newcomers like Microsoft. Right now, IRS is organized horizontally, by function. This means every time a taxpayer has a question or a problem that crosses the Services' functional lines, they are handed off to a different person in an entirely different department. No one has final responsibility to getting the taxpayer's problem solved. 
There is no accountability. 
This bill reorganizes the agency by type of taxpayer. There will be a separate division for individuals, one for small businesses, one for large corporations, and one for tax exempt organizations. Employees within these divisions will be responsible for just about every type of problem their assigned group of taxpayers could have. They will stick with the taxpayer until his problem is solved. 
No more passing the buck. 
The bill also adds important new taxpayer protections to the law, to help protect citizens against arbitrary actions of IRS agents. 
The bill will allow taxpayers to sue for negligent actions by IRS agents. Today they must meet a very high treshold by proving any abuse was intentional. 
The bill expands the offers-in-compromise program. It makes it harder for IRS to turn down legitimate offers. The bill also requires IRS to leave taxpayers with more money to live on when they enter into repayment agreements. 
In our hearings, taxpayers complained about the difficulty of using innocent spouse protections. The House and Senate bills take different approaches to solving this problem. Both make it easier for truly innocent spouses to be protected from the tax debts their guilty spouses have accumulated. 
These are only a few examples of the taxpayer protections built into the legislation. 
Finally, the bill before us today takes a first step toward addressing what may be the biggest contributor to taxpayer problems with our Tax Code--Congress itself. Witness after witness at our hearings complained about the complexity of the Code. Witness after witness complained about how hard it is to keep up with frequent changes we make in the law. And they are right. 
This bill requires that every tax bill in the future be accompanied by an analysis of whether it will further complicate the Code. How hard it will be for taxpayers to comply with the new law. As we strive to achieve fairness in our Tax Code, we sacrifice simplicity. With this bill, we will be able to clearly understand the extent of that sacrifice. 
I believe that one of the hardest things to do when restructuring any agency, and particularly one as sensitive as this one, is to find that delicate balance between giving the Government too much power and giving it too little. 
Give it too much power, and innocent citizens will be abused. This is, obviously, unacceptable in a civilized society. Even one single instance of taxpayer abuse is one too many. 
Law abiding taxpayers should not fear the taxman. 
But clipping the Government's wings too closely presents its own dangers. Americans expect us to make sure everyone is sharing the burden of paying for the services our Government provides. And it is clear some of us are not. IRS estimates the `tax gap', which is the measure of tax avoidance, now is almost $200 billion a year. This amounts to more than $1,600 per year for every tax return filed by the rest of us. 
This, too, must stop. Our entire system of collecting revenue would unravel if taxpayers stop paying their fair share because they believe everyone else is cheating. 
The bill before us today is not perfect. 
It does not address the problem of tax non-compliance. We have left that challenge for another day. 
There are provisions in it that may seem good at first blush, but may cause more harm than good. We should try to fix these as the bill goes through the legislative process. 
But I firmly believe we must not let the perfect be the enemy of the good. We must not let yet another tax season go by without the taxpayer protections this bill provides. 
Passing a solid restructuring bill will do more to get the IRS on track than a hundred hearings where we sit, posture, pontificate and play politics. 
It is our responsibility to the American people to get this job done quickly, and to get it done right. I want to be able to go back to the constituent who wrote me that letter and say, Yes, we fixed your problem. And, Yes, the Government works for you, not against you. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. BAUCUS. I very much thank the Senator from North Dakota for drawing the Senate's attention to the Wall Street Journal article, and, more importantly, to the plight of our farmers in the northern Great Plains. 
The article mentioned Montana and Minnesota. The Senator is absolutely correct. I have never seen it this bad. Just last weekend when I was home a banker pulled me aside and said virtually what you said, Senator; namely, it is getting so bad the bankers are getting worried about their loans and whether they will be repaid. It is true, the farmers can't cash flow. It is grim. 
I urge farm organizations to dig down deep, put their heads together and come up with a solution that we, the Congress, can help with. 
We passed Freedom to Farm. Most farmers in my State supported it at the time because the wheat price was high and the initial payments were high. We all knew the day would come when we would be paying the price for adopting that bill but it has come a lot earlier. It has come this year rather than a couple, 3 years from now and with much more strength. It is hurricane force and will drive more farmers off the land. Small towns in eastern Montana are drying up. People are leaving. You see shops on the main street boarded up. It is because the price of wheat, barley, and 
durum is so low and has been so low at a time when our Government has not done what it should be doing. 
This is true of all administrations--to open up foreign markets, get those countries to reduce their barriers so we can sell more overseas. I am thinking particularly of China. China does not take Pacific Northwest wheat. It has not for years because of a bogus claim. That is one of the many examples of countries erecting trade barriers that make it difficult for us to sell a product. 
I very much thank the Senator for raising this issue. I urge Senators to listen to the Senator's statement because we are going to be facing this issue here in the Senate fairly soon. I hope this is constructive in addressing the problems that the Senator mentions. It is happening in spades, today, in Montana, particularly eastern Montana. 
I thank the Senator and I yield the floor.

Mr. BAUCUS. Essentially, the amendment offered by the Senator from Tennessee is an amendment to take an employee off the board. That is the point. The real question we have to ask ourselves is: Do we want this restructuring to work or not? We create a Board, give the Board certain powers, and the Restructuring Commission, led by Senator Grassley from Iowa and Senator Kerrey of Nebraska, concluded there should be among board members an employee representative. That was their conclusion. They believed that would help restructuring work. 
Why? Because so many of the problems that we have with the IRS, most of the problems that were documented at the Finance Committee hearings, are employee problems--that is, rogue employees, employees who were covering up, employees doing this or that. Also problems with managers--some of them were doing their job, some were not. 
Obviously, an employee who is on the Board will be able to tell the Board what is going on, what is not going on, what the views of the employees are, and so forth. 
Now some suggest that the Board should just consult with employees. That will not work. You need somebody there on the Oversight Board who will be able to not only report to the employees what is going on, but be able to send back to employees what board policy is if we are going to get restructuring to work. 
We need teamwork here. We don't need an adversarial relationship. We are not talking about Board versus employees. We are talking about a Board which will make restructuring work. Just think about it. An employee on the Board will help make this work. 
If you want an employee, you want a good employee; right? You want a good representative on the Board. How do you make sure you get a good, solid employee on the Board? First, you have the President appoint the employee. That is the what the bill provides. Obviously, the President will appoint somebody he or she thinks is a person who will do a very good job because it is in his interest to make IRS restructuring work. 
What is another check? Confirmation by the Senate. I say to my colleagues, if you don't like the employee representative that the President nominates to the Board, you can vote against him or her. During the confirmation process, you have an opportunity to check into the background of this appointee. You can check to see whether this is a good or bad person. That is a real good check which will enable you to get a sense whether this is a person who has conflicts or who will be a public servant--who will be narrowly representing his or her private interests or his or her organization. You can get a sense of these matters through the confirmation hearings. 
In addition to that, the President can remove any Board member, including the employee representative, at will--that is, without cause, at will. 
Finally, the employee representative is subject to the same restrictions as the private life Board members; examples are the 
disclosure requirements and the 1-year restriction after service on the board. 
Now, the main point here is: If you are going to have an employee on the Board, how do you make sure that there are no conflicts of interest? I remind my colleagues, when this bill passed the House 426-4, there were no restrictions; there was no waiver provision in the bill. They just said, OK, have an employee. Well, we have improved the bill by rewriting this provision. 
I remind my colleagues, all the conflict of interest statutes apply to the employee representative, except for the very narrowly tailored situation where conflicts arise because of his status as employee representative. That is, because the employees he represents work for the IRS and he or she is compensated by the employee organization. Otherwise, all conflict of interest statutes apply. 
The comparison was raised about these waivers being like waiving violations for bribery, a criminal offense. Of course, bribery is a criminal offense. That is irrelevant. Murder is a criminal offense too. There are all kinds of criminal offenses in our criminal law. That is totally irrelevant to what we are talking about here. 
The narrow, technical question here is: Are the provisions and the safeguards that are written into this statute, in the committee report, sufficient to make sure that the employee representative does a good job and represents the public interest? Of course, that assumes you want an employee on the Board in the first place. 
Frankly, I do believe that most of those who are arguing to remove the waiver are really arguing to remove the employee. It is a back-door way to get the employee off the Board. That is what is going on here. That is what the argument is really all about. It is just a back-door way to accomplish an objective instead of dealing with it frontally, instead of saying, `We don't want an employee representative on the Board.' 
I feel very strongly that if we want this restructuring Board to work, it makes sense to have an employee representative on it. There are lots of checks to make sure this employee is performing public service instead of some private interest. 
The amendment before the Senate, if it passes, will make it very, very difficult for any employee to serve on the Board. I don't think that is what we want to do. It is not good for the country.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Community and Postal Participation Act of 1998. This legislation aims to preserve the fabric of downtown American communities by giving citizens a say in Postal Service decisions to close, relocate or consolidate post offices. 
Mr. President, the Postal Service is near and dear to the people of the United States. Since its establishment over 200 years ago with Benjamin Franklin as the first Postmaster General, the Postal Service has dutifully delivered the mail to generations of Americans. In many towns across the U.S., the post office is still the center of the community, the very anchor of what we fondly refer to as `small-town America.' Nowhere is that more true than in my own state of Montana. In Livingston, people meet to collect their mail and talk about what flies are hatching on the Yellowstone River. In Red Lodge, folks come together at the post office not only to collect their mail but to discuss last weekend's track meet. And in Plains, Montana, the place where people receive their mail is as important a meeting-spot as it was when the first post office opened there more than 115 years ago. 
But sadly, Mr. President, America has seen a rash of post office closings, relocations and consolidations in recent years. From California to Connecticut, Montana to Maine, the Postal Service has proposed closing post offices located in the very heart of their communities. When the post office goes, often the central business district goes with it. And, more important, the local gathering place disappears. 
Mr. President, today Senator Jeffords and I are introducing legislation to change that. With passage of the Community and Postal Participation Act, downtown communities will have an increased say in their future. They will have input into Postal Service decisions that affect their communities, and they will be allowed the chance to offer alternatives to Postal Service changes. Under current law, communities have little say when the USPS decides to pull up stakes. Our bill would change that by: allowing those served by a post office to receive at least 60 days' notice before the USPS decides to relocate, close or consolidate a post office; giving those affected by the closing a chance to respond to the proposed changes by offering an alternative to the USPS proposals; providing for a public hearing before a final determination is made; allowing those affected by the relocation, closing or consolidation to appeal to the Postal Rate Commission (PRC); and requiring the USPS to comply with applicable zoning, planning or land use laws. 
Mr. President, I believe that with mutual cooperation, the interests of communities and the Postal Service can be served. The nature--indeed the very name--of this legislation is participation. I am confident that with its passage our communities and this important American institution may begin a new era of cooperation for the good of all involved. And we can put the community back in the Postal Service.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the second anniversary of National Erase the Hate and Eliminate Racism Day. Earlier today, I introduced with my colleague from Montana, Senator Burns, along with many others from across the nation, a resolution marking this notable occasion. 
In 1964, Mike Mansfield of Montana, then majority leader of the United States Senate, ushered through this body the landmark Civil Rights Act. It is his tradition of integrity and foresight in both Montana and the nation that inspires us in our actions today. 
In the last several years, however, Montanans of a different generation have come under the microscope of less favorable scrutiny. The reputation of Montana as a state of forward-thinkers and tolerant individuals was marred by the standoff between the FBI and the so-called Freemen outside Jordan, and a series of hate crimes in some of our cities. 
What has frustrated me and many other Montanans, however, is the lack of attention to the vast majority of Montanans--the people who are willing to stand up to bigots and hate groups. It is these folks who provide us with stories of hope and courage and let us know that our communities and our neighbors will not stand for bias and hate-motivated behavior. 
It is important because these encouraging stories are becoming commonplace in Montana. Whether it is a community like Billings that stands up to a group of skinheads, or a Missoula high school class that devotes an entire project to studying the holocaust, Montanans are making a real and positive difference in our society. 
There is no doubt that we have come a long way as a nation. But with 8,000 hate crimes reported to the U.S. Department of Justice each year, it is clear we still have much more work to do. 
In addition to taking this day to recognize the importance of the fight, we must continue to support groups like the Northwest Coalition Against Malicious Harassment, the Montana Human Rights Network, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights and the many other groups and individuals who continue this work every day. 
I know a simple Senate resolution, or even a national conference, will not end the problems we still have. A piece of paper alone cannot teach a child that hate is wrong. But I do believe a piece of paper can make people think. A conference will not end intolerance. But it can make people talk about hate crimes. Designating today as a day to address these important problems is a first step and it can light a spark of hope in people's hearts and minds. 
Again, perhaps our predecessor in the Senate, Mike Mansfield, when speaking about the task in 1964, said it best when he noted: 
What we do here in the . . . Congress will not, of itself, correct these faults, but we can and must join the wisdom--the collective wisdom of this body--to the efforts of others in this Nation to face up to them for what they are--a serious erosion of the fundamental rock upon which the unity of the Nation stands. 
Tolerance and respect are our nation's bedrock. Today we can join together to renew the fight for a better America. And if we continue to look at the good, courageous, decent things our neighbors are doing, the sparks of hope we light just might catch fire, in Montana and all across the country.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, it is with mixed feelings that I rise today to oppose, H.R. 2646, the A+ Education Savings Account Act. I am pleased to see that we in the Senate are discussing educational issues. It is an important debate that the American people need to hear. However, I simply don't believe this bill takes our nation's education system in the right direction. 
One of my highest priorities is preparing Montana's children for the challenges of the 21st Century. 
Education is the only way to improve our economy and keep our kids in-state working at good jobs that help them achieve the kind of future we want for all Americans. 
In the area of education I have taken it upon myself to do more than legislate. Because legislation can only accomplish so much. I have worked hard to put over 350 surplus computers in Montana schools. I've encouraged companies to donate funding for computer hardware and software. I've prepared a comprehensive guide on technology funding which has been distributed statewide. 
My office also conducted and compiled a survey of Montana schools' technology needs. And I hold weekly internet chats with students throughout Montana. 
In working toward ensuring that every child has strong technological, verbal, written , math and critical thinking skills, I have visited over 100 schools during the last year. A lot of these schools are barely making ends meet. Often times teachers and principals are put in the agonizing position of deciding between new books or computers. New desks or a new furnace. While our public schools are in such straits I believe it is unfair to subsidize attendance at private schools. 
These institutions are charged with educating all children, not just those who are able to pay or who meet certain requirements. 
Public education is a mainstay of our democracy. It is the great democratizer of the American people. Ninety-seven percent of children in America attend public schools. Public education is a promise to all children: if you work hard and commit yourself fully, you can receive a quality education. And you can achieve anything. 
Public education is a promise of opportunity--a promise of open doors. And that is a promise which should be our number one priority to uphold. 
Unfortunately H.R. 2646 will not open the doors of educational opportunity for the average American family. 
This bill would primarily benefit those who are already most able to afford a private education. Those making less than $50,000 per year, will receive a tax cut of only a few dollars from this bill. 
Wealthier families who are in a much better position to save money, will have much larger accumulations of tax-free earnings. 
According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, 52% of the tax benefit from this bill would go to the 7% of families whose children attend private schools. The other 48% of the benefits would go to the 93% of the families whose children attend public schools. The average benefit to a family with children in private schools would be $37 while the average benefit for families with children in public schools would only be $7. 
Expanding the definition of qualified education expense will result in revenue losses of $760 million over five years and $1.6 billion over ten years. That's money that could be better invested in improving crumbling school buildings, buying computer equipment, paying teachers more and making classes smaller in our public schools. 
Public education faces more challenges today than ever before. But rather than diverting precious resources and students from our public schools we need to face these problems head on. 
Simply abandoning public education does a disservice to every American--it breaks the promises that our country is founded on. 
By any measure, the schools in my own state are doing a good job. In 1997 Montana continued to top the nation in ACT scores (fourth highest in the country) and our state's SAT scores continued to be 37 points above the national average in math and 40 points above the national average in verbal skills. 
Montana, like nearly half (47%) of the states, has a policy prescribing class size. 
Since 1970 Montana and national student/teacher ratios have stayed virtually parallel, with Montana maintaining a ratio of about two fewer students per teacher than the national average. Beginning in the mid-1990's Montana's statewide ratio of 14.8 students per teacher is only one fewer that the national average of 15.8 students per teacher. Class sizes in most of Montana's middle and larger sized school districts are roughly equal to the national average. 
Unfortunately the salary scale for Montana teachers has not kept pace with the national average. In 1996 our educators were paid 16% less than the national average. 
Federal funding plays an increasingly important role in public education. After stagnating in the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s, Federal revenues now pay more that 10% of Montana's public schools costs; or 2% more than in 1983. Unfortunately, during this period state revenues committed to education have declined. In 1993, state revenues paid for 53.8% of school costs but have now fallen to around 49% of total school expenditures. 
Montana is not willing to rest on its education laurels. Our State Board of Public Education is evaluating new standards for math and reading proficiency. 
The State Superintendent of Public Instruction recently stated that `(i)t's time to raise the high bar on education' by forging ahead with development of new standards for science and communications, English, writing, speech and debate. 
Rather than providing tax benefits for those who can already send their children to the best schools, we need to invest in education systems like Montana's that have a proven record of success while insuring that public schools that do not perform well are held accountable for their performance. 
We are called upon today to discuss our nation's education system. And I welcome the debate that all sides will give. However, I urge my colleagues to support public education--support the promise that we hold out to all children regardless of faith, race, income or ability. 
Oppose the A+ Education Savings Account Act. And hold open wide the door of opportunity for all America's children.

Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I want to join my friends and colleagues in paying tribute to Terry Sanford. I did not serve on any committee with Terry, but in the few years that we served together, he immediately struck me as a wonderful man, a good man, with a ready smile, a very thoughtful, very wise, very good, very deep person, the kind of Senator that not only North Carolina, I know, is very proud of, but the kind of Senator that I think most Americans would want their Senator to be. 
I cannot, as I am standing here thinking of Terry Sanford, think of another person whom I respected more and loved more and appreciated more, going through all the history, Research Triangle of North Carolina, the Governor, president of Duke University. But the main point I want to make is, working with Terry personally, and talking with him, and working through issues, he was a man who will be very difficult to replace. And, as I said, I can think of no Senator whom I would hold in higher esteem or regard than Terry Sanford.

Mr. BAUCUS. 
Mr. President, I rise today to announce the introduction of `The Montana Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act of 1998.' I am pleased to be joined on this bill by my Colleague from Montana, Senator Burns. This bill will help protect important lands in Montana for the use and enjoyment of all Americans. It will protect our hunting and fishing heritage and ensure that our children and our grandchildren can enjoy our great wild lands, just as we do today. 
Canyon Ferry Reservoir sits just east of Helena, Montana. Along the north shore of the reservoir, there are 265 cabin sites that have been leased by the Bureau of Reclamation for over two decades. On these sites, families have built cabins and houses, car ports and garages, and planted lawns and gardens. Many families now live in these cabins year-round. 
These cabin sites have been a constant management problem for the Bureau of Reclamation. In addition to managing the reservoir, the Bureau of Reclamation has been forced to play landlord. Like all landlords, the Bureau of Reclamation has often been at odds with the cabin owners over rental payments and maintenance of the property. This conflict has damaged public good will and created administrative expenses for the government as appeals are filed to respond to the conflict of the day. 
The Montana Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act establishes an equitable means of resolving these conflicts and, at the same time, provide substantial benefit to the public. This Act proposes to sell all 265 cabin sites through a sealed bid process with the minimum bid set at fair market value determined in accordance with federal appraisal standards. All existing lease arrangements would have to be honored by the purchaser of the 265 cabin sites, and each cabin owner would have to be given an option to purchase their cabin site from the successful bidder. In this way, the Act ensures that the public will receive a maximum return on the investment, while at the same time, fully protecting the interests of the current leaseholders. 
The Montana Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act of 1998 would use the proceeds from this sale to establish two funds for the conservation of fish and wildlife and would return 10% of the proceeds to the U.S. Treasury. 
The first fund established by this Act, the Canyon Ferry-Missouri Trust, would be a perpetual endowment fund with 45% of the proceeds from the sale of the cabin sites. It would be used for the public acquisition of property at Canyon Ferry Reservoir and along the Missouri River and its tributaries upstream to the confluence of the Madison, Jefferson, and Gallatin Rivers. 
This trust would be managed by a board consisting of representatives of local and statewide sportsmens organizations and local landowners. The Canyon Ferry-Missouri River Endowment would be used to purchase public access to hunting and fishing sites and to acquire property and conservation easements to enhance public hunting and fishing opportunities at the reservoir and along the Missouri. All property acquired by this trust would be purchased from willing sellers. 
The second fund, Montana Hunter and Fisherman Access Fund would be a state-wide fund established with another 45% of the proceeds from the sale of the cabin sites. It would be used to acquire public access to federal lands in Montana and to acquire property and conservation easements to enhance public hunting and fishing opportunities across the state. This fund would be managed by the Bureau of Land Management, the Forest Service, and Fish and Wildlife Service. This fund could be used to acquire property only from willing sellers. 
The remaining 10% of the proceeds from the sale of the cabin sites would be returned to the U.S. Treasury. 
The Montana Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act of 1998 presents an exciting opportunity for us to ensure that our children can enjoy hunting and fishing just as we do. This bill will improve access to public lands and will protect important fish and wildlife habitat for the benefit of all Americans. It does so by selling cabin sites which currently are providing very few benefits to the general public while causing significant management conflicts and expenses for the Bureau of Reclamation. 
This is a fair bill that is widely supported by cabin owners, local land owners, and sportsmen throughout Montana. There are a number of issues that still need to be ironed out with this bill. In particular, the Canyon Ferry Recreation Association (the association of cabin owners) has expressed concern that they may not financially be able to step into the role of landlord for those leasees who are unable to purchase the cabin sites should be Association be the highest bidder. We'll have to work through these and other issues as this bill moves forward. 
Nonetheless, Mr. President, I believe that this bill is a good start. I look forward to working with my Colleague from Montana and with all the members of the Senate to finalize and pass this legislation for the benefit of America's fish and wildlife heritage. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important bill.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered by the ranking member of the Budget Committee, the senior Senator from New Jersey and my fellow member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, Senator Lautenberg. 
This amendment will allow the Congress to increase funding for important natural resources and environment programs without increasing the deficit or lowering the surplus. That is an important point. 
We would be able to address additional needs in these areas without affecting the overall deficit or surplus. The amendment would do this by allowing the excess receipts from a reinstated Superfund taxes to offset the cost of the programs. 
What kind of programs might be funded through in this amendment? We could hasten the cleanup of hazardous waste sites. We could provide assistance to states to protect waterways from polluted runoff. We also could fund construction and maintenance for our deteriorating national parks, wildlife refuges, and other public lands. 
These priorities were included in the President's proposed Environmental Resources Fund for America, but they are not included in Senate Concurrent Resolution 86. 
The amendment would allow the authorizing committees, including the Environment and Public Works Committee on which Senator Lautenberg and I sit, to set direct spending levels for environmental and natural resources programs. Furthermore, it would allow any excess funds from an extension of the Superfund tax to offset the added costs. 
The Republican budget assumes that if a Superfund tax is reinstated, $200 million would be used to pay for that portion of the cleanup that is attributable to parties that are bankrupt or otherwise cannot pay their share. The balance of $1.5 billion each year could be used to offset the cost of unspecified spending or tax breaks. 
By contrast, the Lautenberg amendment would direct the money from the Superfund tax to needed environmental improvements--investments in the future of our natural resources and sustained health of our environment, not just for us, but for our children. 
Directing more resources to states to help address the problem of polluted runoff will be an investment in the future of clean water. 
Cleaning up Superfund sites is an investment that can protect public health and foster economic redevelopment. 
Maintaining our national parks--our national treasures--is an investment that we must make, or see that part of our heritage fall apart. 
Mr. President, I commend the Senator from New Jersey for his amendment and urge my colleagues to support it for the future health of our citizens and the environment.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the `Chippewa Cree Tribe of the Rocky Boy's Reservation Indian Reserved Water Rights Settlement Act of 1998' along with my colleague Senator Burns. 
This bill represents the culmination of sixteen years of intensive technical studies and six years of negotiations involving the Chippewa Cree Tribe, the State of Montana, local governments, water districts and ranchers as well as the United States Departments of justice and Interior. 
The 108,000 acre Rocky Boy's Reservation is located west of Havre, Montana in the Bears Paw Mountains with portions extending onto the plains between the mountains and the Milk River in north-central Montana. Historically, the area was part of the large territory north of the Missouri and Musselshell Rivers designated for the Blackfeet Nation in the treaty of 1855. 
In 1880 the Fort Assiniboine military reservation was established. In 1916 Congress set aside 56,035 acres for the Chippewa and Cree Bands of Chief Rocky Boy. In 1947 it was expanded by 45,523 acres bringing it to near its current size. None of the land has been allotted although some individual assignments have been made. 
The reservation is home to over 3,000 tribal members and has an annual population growth exceeding 3%. While unemployment is estimated at nearly 70% the tribe has made important progress in economic development. Production of cattle and grain, development of timber and tourism provide solid sources of tribal income. 
The reservation is located in an area of scarce water supply. Studies have demonstrated that the reservation could not sustain tribal membership without additional supplies of water for drinking, agricultural and municipal purposes. 
Since 1992, the tribe, state and federal government have worked hard to reach an equitable water rights settlement. 
The tribe and state reached tentative agreement on the compact in January 1997. The tribal Council passed a resolution supporting ratification of the agreement shortly thereafter. In the spring of 1997, the Montana State Senate unanimously ratified the compact and the State House gave its approval on a 91-9 vote. It was signed into law by the Governor of Montana on April 14, 1997. 
This legislation ratifies the compact and settles the tribe's claims against the United States. The bill provides for:

Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, this amendment is very simple. It is to give the Secretary of Agriculture the authority to extend the marketing assisting loans until September 30 of this year. 
Why are we doing this? Why am I offering this amendment? It is very simple. The northern tier U.S. farmers are suffering dire economic consequences for a lot of reasons. No. 1, the price of grain, particularly wheat and barley, is very low. We have had very depressed prices for a lot of years. Second, a lot of grain from Canada is shipped down to northern tier States. More grain trucks are coming, it is anticipated, and I believe, frankly, that Canada is beginning to fudge on an agreement it reached with the United States several years ago. Prior to that time, Canada shipped about 2.5 million metric tons of wheat to the United States. We brought the Canadians to the negotiating table, and Canada agreed to limit its shipment to the United States to 1.5 metric tons. That was several years ago. It is clear to me that Canada is at least fudging that agreement and is increasing shipments of grain to the United States. 
After that, with the problems we have in dealing with Canada with respect to trade in agriculture, we lost one of the main levers. We had section 22 to say to Canada, `You are disrupting our markets.' That was the purpose of section 22 of the Agriculture Price Stabilization Act, not too many years ago. But we negotiated that away in the last GATT round. In return, all countries promised to reduce their subsidies, particularly their export subsidies. But Canada still retained the Canadian Wheat Board. Not only Canada but other countries--Australia--have their wheat boards, which is a monopolistic control over that country's billing and selling of grain, particularly wheat. 
After that, Americans placed limits on exports that other countries don't have. For example, I cite the various countries. The total amount is about 10 percent. Our exports are limited by the sanctions that we imposed preventing exports to certain countries. 
Canada doesn't have those sanctions, Argentina doesn't, the European Community doesn't. We are limiting our farmers. 
A couple of years ago, we passed the Freedom to Farm Act. You recall under that act we basically decoupled agricultural price support payments from production. From that point on, farmers had more freedom in the production of their crops, the crops they could choose. 
At that time, too, the price of wheat was very high. As I recall, it was around $6 a bushel, almost as high as $7 a bushel. Now it is down, in many cases, below $3 a bushel. At that time, farmers realized that they had a bit of a Hobson's choice here: On the one hand, support Freedom to Farm--at that time, corn was high and the price support payments were decoupled but were quite high at the time even though they had been coming down gradually--so now it is not much less. Farmers could either vote for that--support Freedom to Farm--or keep the present program. Most farmers decided they would gamble on Freedom to Farm, basically because prices were good at the time. 
But in exchange, American farmers expected--in fact, they were promised--that the United States would fight vigorously to open up foreign markets--fight vigorously to open up foreign markets. I might say, I do not think anybody in this Chamber thinks the U.S. has fought very vigorously to open up foreign markets to the sale of wheat and other grains. We have talked about it. There has been a lot of talk about it but not a lot of action. 
So all I am saying is, in exchange for the U.S. Government's failure to fight to open up markets for American products, particularly wheat now--exports of wheat--at the very least, we can extend the loan provisions of the current law 5 months, to September 30, 1998. 
It just seems to me, because the farmers now are suffering so severely, bankers are starting to call in loans, bankers are not giving farmers additional operating capital--at the very least, we can extend the marketing assistance loan period for 5 more months to the end of 1998, to give farmers a chance, a little longer into 1998, before their loan is called and they have to pay back their loan at the current loan rate. 
What you are going to hear is this. You are going to hear: `Oh, gosh, there we go. We are opening up the Farm Act, Freedom to Farm.' That is not true. In no way does this amendment open up or revisit the Freedom to Farm Act. 
We are also going to hear this sets a bad precedent--here we are, after passing Freedom to Farm, where the Government is coming in. 
But I say that, first, our goal here is not to be rigidly consistent and mechanically steel-trap logical and just rigidly sticking to something. Rather, our charge here, our obligation, is to do what is right. I think it is right just merely to extend marketing assistance loans to the end of the year. We are not going back from Freedom to Farm; not any other change. 
I might say, too, it has absolutely zero effect on the budget, and that is because it is not scored. It is not scored because the loan is extended only to the end of September of this year. So this has no budget effect. It helps farmers by letting them decide when they want to sell their grain. If they have held it so far, they can sell at a later date. 
In addition, we are handcuffing farmers because of the limitations we have placed on the export of a lot of our 
products; that is, 10 percent of our exports are sanctioned; we cannot go to various countries. And on top of that, our Government has not fought vigorously enough to open up markets in other countries. 
One example is China. China does not take any Pacific Northwest wheat--none, not one kernel--because they have come up with this phony argument that it has a fungus. It is a phony argument. Anybody who looks at the question knows it is phony, yet they do not buy any. How hard has our Government worked to say, `Hey, you have to play fair. President Jiang Zemin came to the United States. The least you can do is open up your markets a little bit.' Our Government has not worked nearly as hard as I think it should. 
Let me just finish by saying it is a very small matter in terms of what we are doing here on the supplemental appropriations bill. We are not opening up Freedom to Farm. It has zero budget effect. We are just saying give farmers, particularly northern tier farmers, a little bit of a break for the next several months. And the break is only a longer period within which they have to decide whether to sell their grain on the market or not. That is all it is. 
I think it is a very fair amendment and should be adopted.

Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I can't but be bemused by this debate, because the Senator from North Dakota said this isn't just a trivial step. In fact, the Senator from Indiana, the very distinguished chairman of the committee, quietly admitted that he doesn't think it is going to do much, and if that is the case, I don't know why we don't just do it. 
It is also true one of the tenets of Freedom to Farm is more flexibility. I remind my colleagues that we in the North do not have a lot of flexibility, because of our weather and soil conditions, and so forth. There is not near the flexibility in planting different kinds of crops that farmers in other parts of the country might have. 
A major answer to this problem, obviously, is a greater effort to knock down trade barriers. That is clear. A greater answer to this problem, too, is much more executive branch and congressional effort to make sure that other countries are not taking unfair advantage of American producers. 
Mr. President, I will withdraw the amendment, but in so doing, I would like the assurance of the Senator from Kansas and the Senator from Indiana of efforts that we can undertake on a bipartisan basis to actually do something about this. 
We talk a lot about knocking down trade barriers; we talk a lot about GSM programs; we talk a lot about P.L.-480; we talk a lot about NAFTA; we talk a lot about fast track, and so forth. But it is time to do something about this. 
I will not press for a vote, but I do urge my friends and colleagues to make the effort, to be sure, again, on a bipartisan basis and with the White House, that we can finally stand up for our producers and work harder and more effectively together than we have thus far. One example is appropriations, whether it is EEP or whatever it is. We can authorize programs, but we also have to have appropriations. I would like to ask my friends if they could respond.

Mr. BAUCUS. 
Mr. President, today I am introducing the Safeguard of New Employee Information Act of 1998. This bill will ensure that the mechanisms created in the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA) to enhance our child support enforcement system will not lead to a misuse of personal information. I believe that my bill will assure that new employee information is kept confidential without compromising the usefulness of the National Directory of New Hires. The legislation provides clear safeguards against the abuse of personal employee information, and makes sure that the information is erased two years after entry. 
As we all know, child support is a critical part of welfare reform. I strongly support the measures in PRWORA that help states track and crack down on parents who fail to pay court-ordered child support. In response to the fact that over 30 percent of child support cases involve parents who do not live in the same state as their children, a National Directory of New Hires was created to assist states in locating parents who reside in other states. 
Thus far, the new data base has been very successful in enabling states to locate delinquent parents, enforcing payment orders and reducing the number of welfare families. However, many folks are concerned about the confidentiality of the registry, and the fact that this information is never deleted. 
Last year, for example, the Montana State Legislature passed a child support bill to comply with the new federal regulations. I must add, this bill was passed in the final hours of the legislative session and under the threat of losing $52 million a year in federal funds. At that time, the legislature was hesitant to pass the bill because of concerns regarding confidentiality. 
Mr. President, the Safeguard of New Employee Information Act of 1998 makes needed changes to the National Directory to alleviate these fears and ensure the registry's continuation. The bill provides penalties for misuse of information by federal employees. Specifically, it establishes a fine of $1,000 for each act of unauthorized access to, disclosure, or use of information in the National Directory of New Hires. 
The bill also establishes a 24-month limit on retention of New Hire data. This two year limit gives Child Support Enforcement agencies the necessary time to determine paternity, establish a child support order or enforce existing orders. A shorter period of data retention would impede enforcement activities, and a longer period of retention increases the potential for abuse. 
Mr. President, in my state of Montana, 90 percent of families on welfare are headed by single parents. That is why it is so important to require that the absent mothers or fathers provide money to feed, clothe and care for their children. The National Directory of New Hires is a good idea--we just need to ensure new employee confidentiality. I urge my colleagues to protect new hire confidentiality and support this important legislation.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I understand that the USDA is working toward the release of funds relating to the competitively awarded Smith Lever 3(d) Food Safety grants program. An eligible activity of this program is the Food Animal Residue Avoidance Database (FARAD). The American people are demanding higher levels of food safety, and the FARAD program will help develop better methods of assuring the safety of food products from our livestock sector. 
The Smith Lever 3(d) Food Safety program contains a total of $2,365,000, but it has been suggested that only $195,000 would be available for the FARAD activities. However, I understand that FARAD is not limited by the suggested amount of $195,000 and that additional funds under the Smith Lever 3(d) Food Safety grants program could be directed to FARAD as a competitive award. I further understand that no funds under this program have been obligated for the current fiscal year.

But with due regard for TR, no one in this century has done more for our relations with Japan than Montana's most accomplished and honored son: Mike Mansfield. 
Today Mike celebrates his 95th birthday. To honor this occasion, and with thanks for all that Mike has taught me and all of us over the years, I would like to offer some thoughts on our relationship with Japan as we approach the next century.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Emergency Marketing Assistance Act of 1998. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by the rest of the Montana delegation--Senator Burns and Congressman Hill. The Emergency Marketing Assistance Act is the product of cooperation between our Montana delegation, local communities, and agricultural producers in our state. 
Farming is never easy. It is a challenge that requires work, knowledge, faith and courage. But this year has been a particularly difficult time for producers. A large number of wheat growers in our state and across America are facing a bleak market year. 
Many have not even sold their 1997 crop. Instead, they have taken out nine-month USDA Marketing Assistance Loans which will soon come due. But unless there is a dramatic upsurge in our current prices, they will be forced to sell at a low price, inadequate to cover their debts. 
Currently, the total volume of grain under loan in Montana is 43.5 million bushels. This is not an unusual figure during normal marketing years when farmers know they'll get a fair price for their product. 
Two years ago we could get over five dollars a bushel for our wheat. But today the current price languishes under the three dollar mark. Couple that with our abnormally high shipping rates, and it is no wonder our farmers are reluctant to sell. They would a serious hit. And some might lose the farm. 
However, it is important to remember, Mr. President, this difficult situation is temporary. In time, prices will rebound and wheat producers will be able to sell their grain at a fair price. That is why we are asking the Secretary of Agriculture to extend these loans for up to six months. Our producers would be able to weather the storm of these dreadful prices. 
For many of our farmers, this is a make-it or break-it year. They have survived tough winters and dry summers. They compete with the monopolistic practices of the Canadian Wheat Board. They struggle to overcome the high cost of shipping. And they are completely shut out of China's market. 
But we expect them to somehow go into the field day after day, season after season, to make certain that we have an abundant supply of food at a fair price. A six-month marketing assistance loan extension is a partial solution to the problems our farmers are facing. And that is why I am speaking here today. 
We also need to take immediate action to ensure that this price depression does not happen again. As we give our producers this tool to stay on their farms, we must also work to improve markets and stimulate prices. I am constantly reminded that many of our producers got behind the Freedom to Farm bill with the express understanding that the U.S. Department of Agriculture would aggressively seek export markets. 
Clearly, we need to do a better job of moving our products, especially wheat. I believe that by using a combination of the Export Enhancement Program, food aid and credit programs available through the USDA, we can assist our farmers during this difficult period. If we do not take action now, the results will be disastrous in farm country. 
I would like to thank my Montana colleagues for their assistance in this endeavor. I also want to recognize the efforts of our producers back home who have worked hard to make ends meet this past winter and brought this idea forward. You do a good job, and we are pulling for you. 
Mr. President, I strongly encourage my fellow senators to join me in supporting this important effort.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise, with some reservations, in support of the resolution offered by Senator Wellstone and Senator Mack. 
I have been visiting, debating and studying China for some years. And it is quite clear that human rights conditions in China can and should be far better. 
China admits to holding about 3,000 people in prison for `counter-revolutionary' offenses. We don't know the exact figure, but Amnesty International's estimate is similar. And political repression, over the past four or five years, has in some ways become more rather than less severe for the nation's most prominent dissidents. Treatment of religious leaders and labor organizers may be even worse. And repression seems to be at its harshest in some minority areas. 
Independent reports show that rates of imprisonment are higher in Tibet and Xinjiang, and violent response by the authorities is more common. Having visited Lhasa myself, albeit on a highly controlled visit, my personal impression backs up these reports of very severe policies. 
Those things are real. And the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva is the appropriate place for us, for China, and for the other nations of the world to discuss them. 
But we must also recognize something very important. That is, most long-term human rights trends in China are good. The number of people tried for political offenses is down from 350 a year in the mid-1980s to about 200 a year now. If you look further back, you see that during the so-called `Anti-Rightist' campaign in 1957, China arrested 500,000 people. The 1960s--the years of the `Great Leap Forward' and `Cultural Revolution'--were even worse. 
Other indices also show an improving situation. The number of citizen lawsuits against the government is up from 4,600 in 1987 to approach 100,000 last year, showing that more people feel free to challenge the state. Uncensored news is available on the radio, satellite TV or the Internet. Local elections are becoming more democratic, and the National People's Congress is taking up a more confident role in making law and overseeing ministries. 
Likewise, China's economic reforms have created an entirely new world for tens or hundreds of millions of ordinary people. With open trade, they can find their own jobs, choose their own careers, rent their own apartments and listen to foreign news. And if you ask ordinary Chinese, most say without any hesitation that life is better and freer than ever before. 
So I think it is appropriate for the Administration to raise human rights, particularly the question of political prisoners, in Geneva. The Human Rights Commission in Geneva is the place to discuss, debate and if necessary, condemn violations of human rights abroad. But it is also the place to note and approve improvements of human rights abroad. And while I will support this resolution, I believe it is imperfect, because it does not call on the Administration to do both. 
The most effective approach to human rights will be to tell the truth--to point out areas where the government of China, or any other country, needs reform; but also to draw attention to the areas where life is getting better. We should do that in Geneva, and we should do it when we have occasion to debate human rights on the Senate floor.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we are close to wrapping up this bill. I would like to just inform the Senate of the very, very hard work that a lot of my staff have performed, as well as the staff of many others. It is worth repeating every time we manage a bill or are involved with a bill. Each of us knows how very hard and how diligent each of our staffs is. They don't sleep nights. They stay here all night long, and they work very aggressively and diligently, and they struggle home to sleep a little, and they get up in the morning, without complaint, and come back to work. They also work over weekends. It is just incredible. 
I wish the American public could see just how hard our staffs work for the public good. I take my hat off to them. I believe, frankly, Mr. President, that a most noble human endeavor is public service, whether it is service to church, family, friends, whatever capacity each person might feel most comfortable with. But our staffs' dedication to the public service is above and beyond the call of duty by far, and they don't even get any recognition for it. Senators like to get headlines, like to be on TV; they like to get credit for what they do for the people in their home States and to the country. But the staff, I say, work harder and get no headlines, no recognition, no credit. Why are they doing it? They are doing it because they believe in service to our States and service to our Nation. They are just tremendous. 
I would like to highlight my staff, because I know each Senator will do his own. 
Tom Sliter is the minority staff director. Anybody that knows Tom Sliter knows there is none better. There are some as good, but there is none better than Tom Sliter for his dedication. And the same goes for everybody else on the minority side. 
Kathy Ruffalo. Those who work with Kathy, try to clear amendments with Kathy, and go to Kathy for advice on how to work out this or that amendment, also know there is nobody more of an expert on the transportation bill or the highway bill or who finds solutions to problems more than Kathy.

Mr. BAUCUS. That is true about the cooperation among our staffs. It is incredible. It is a joy to behold, frankly, to see Ann Loomis and Kathy and Tom and Dan and Jimmie. We have a real family here, I might say. As closely as we have worked together, it has been done without rancor, without anger, without any testy feelings. It has been a tremendous, seamless web of teamwork, and it has been wonderful. I mean that; I am not just saying it. 
In addition, Mike Evans and Jo-Ellen Darcy, Barbara Roberts, and John Hemphill have all worked just as hard. We may not see them much on the floor here, but behind the scenes they have worked extremely hard and intelligently. I have not worked that much with Ann Loomis until recently. She is a wonderful woman, a very talented young lady. When Senator Warner got up to speak on behalf of Ann, I thought, that's right, she is really good. The same is true with her counterpart, Kathy Ruffalo. They are a dynamo team. If you want to get two people working on a project and you want to win, get the two of them working together. 
In addition, Dan Corbett of Senator Chafee's staff is an expert. Also, there is Cheryl Tucker, Linda Jordan, and Amy Dunathan. I don't know her, but I have heard of her, and she is good. Also, Abigail Kinnison of Senator Chafee's staff. Jimmie Powell did a terrific job as majority staff director. Secretary Slater has been helpful, along with Jack Basso, who has been here to answer questions relating to the Department of Transportation. He is always available and helpful. 
In my State of Montana, Sandy Straehl, who is with the Montana Department of Transportation, has been terrific in working up data, amendments, and ways to help improve this bill. They worked very hard on this bill. I thank them very much. 
In addition, Janine Johnson, with the Senate legislative counsel. It is pretty hard, when you are working for the legislative counsel and putting up with urgent, immediate requests of Senators and staffs, to try to write legislation, write amendments in a way that makes sense, to advance the issues we are trying to proceed with. Janine Johnson has been terrific. 
There is also Ellen Stein with Senator Warner's office. Ellen has been working as hard as Ann and the rest of them. I could go on forever, but I see Senators who wish to speak. I can't speak enough about the staff. They have been first-rate.

I must say to the Senator that it is very important to address hazardous high-speed rail problems. It is also a problem, because tragically 2 days ago there was a bus accident at a rail crossing in my State of Montana where two schoolchildren were killed. It is devastating, as you might guess, to the families and to the school. It is a small school in central Montana. When we write this bill, we need to make sure that we address hazardous rail crossings across the country, as well as high-speed also.

The New England States, for example, the Northeast States, have definite needs, obviously, with relation to the population density; relative donor States. Then, obviously, some of the Western States with public lands, some of the Indian roads. I compliment the Senators who worked very hard for their own States and who worked with the Senate to get a balance. One who comes to mind is Senator Levin, and Senator Abraham from Michigan.

Mr. BAUCUS. The Governor of Michigan, to say nothing of the Governors from some other States--Massachusetts, for example. I thank Senators Kennedy and Kerry for their hard work for their State, along with Senator Lautenberg from New Jersey and the Connecticut Senators. Senator Moynihan, who in many ways is the father of this bill, helped make sure there was a Northeast balance to the bill. And many other western Senators came to me and said, let's make sure this is fair to the West. I mentioned the donor States. 
On our committee, I would like also to thank Senator Boxer--she has pressed California's interests very ably--Senator Reid from Nevada; Senator Lieberman; Senator Lautenberg, who I also mentioned; Senator Graham from Florida--he is tenacious in fighting for Florida's interests, making sure, as a donor State it is not taken advantage of. But, again, it all came together in a very fair way. 
It sounds kind of platitudinous, but it is true. These Senators worked extremely hard for their States and at the same time, in the end, they worked together to make sure we would get a very strong bill. That is quite an achievement, frankly, as we move on to the next century, the next millennium. We are passing a major infrastructure bill--major. Every $1 billion of highway spending accounts for about 42,000 jobs. This bill is about $171 billion, roughly, over 6 years. When we finish with the House, it perhaps could be a few more dollars. 
Also, just in terms of making sure our highways are as up-to-date as possible, as any businessman knows, the better the condition of our roads and highways, the less congestion there is, the more money he is going to make, the more that helps his bottom line. This is going to help us be competitive in the next century. 
Again, I thank Senators for their great work.

The Committee is aware of the importance of the Northern Great Plains states, including North Dakota, in moving traffic from north to south, as well as from east to west. The cooperation among the states in the region and the work being done with the government of the neighboring province of Manitoba will be important in applying for grants in the trade corridor program in the bill.

Mr. BAUCUS. The Senator from North Dakota accurately notes the important link between export opportunities and an adequate transportation infrastructure. The development of the transportation infrastructure is crucial to ensure that export products from not only the Northern Great Plains region but also the nation--and our neighboring countries--are able to reach their destinations in an efficient manner.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this is a balancing amendment to make the bill fair to all regions of the country. When the committee took up the bill in the first place--actually there were several major bills--it was intended to represent different parts of the country. We in the committee melded these bills together. One is a donor States bill; one is a New England States, Eastern States, bill; one is a Western States bill. 
Because of the leadership of the chairman, Senator Chafee, as well as the composition of the committee, which is balanced, we came up with a very balanced bill. Now, balance is in the eyes of the beholder. When we finished, there were some States that felt that although treated fairly, they perhaps could have been treated more fairly. 
The effect of this bill is to make sure that all parts of the country are treated evenly, fairly. The effect of this amendment will help accomplish that. It will also help speed passage of this bill. It is my hope, and even expectation, that we can finish this bill today with the passage of this amendment, because the remaining business before the Senate is various amendments, matters that, as important as they are, are not as much of a consequence as this amendment, which is the one that has been worked out in the last couple, 3 days--actually last week, with the chairman and others and interested Senators. 
So I urge that this amendment be agreed to. It is going to speed passage of the bill and can get some highways built.

I say to the Senator, I appreciate his tenacity. It is always good to see a Senator who fights doggedly for his State, who works very hard to make sure that his State is not taken advantage of. In fact, I say to the Senate, and to the residents of Michigan, the very able Senator from Michigan adds new meaning to `fighting like a pit bull.' Every day, there is Senator Levin, making sure, `Hey, what about Michigan?' What about donor States and so forth?

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Michigan. 
This amendment, which is very beneficial to States, and particularly local governments, frankly, is an extension of the provision in the National Highway System bill. When this is agreed to--and I think it will be--States, and particularly local governments, will be able to use land, or gravel, or building materials as `in kind' contributions for their State's match instead of cash. They can use other assets to meet that requirement. This will be particularly helpful for local communities that want to build bike paths, or some other similar use of State highway funds, which is provided for in law. If the local community comes up with the gravel, and the work efforts, that will be the match that will allow the Federal funds to then be used for either enhancement, like a bike path, or some other project allowed under the underlying bill. 
So I commend the Senator. This is an extension. It goes beyond what is currently allowed in the National Highway System legislation. 
I very much thank the Senator for bringing this to the Senate's attention and for building upon an idea which I think makes sense in the first place.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, it is my understanding this amendment has been worked out. I thank the Senator for his cooperation. I regret I must say that when we informed Senator Bumpers, who is the ranking member of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, the committee that has jurisdiction over this amendment, we were informed by his staff that he wanted to come over and look at exact language and make sure it was the same language that was agreed to. I do not expect that to, A, take long or, B, to be a problem. In fact, they told us they were on their way over about 10 minutes ago. 
We cannot clear it pending that resolution. I suggest to the chairman, perhaps if we lay this amendment aside, we can take up another amendment. But I expect it to be cleared very quickly.

The fact is, the more we talk about this and commend the Senator, the more likely we are going to kill two birds with one stone. If people realize what the Senator is doing, by that time maybe the staff will be over here to get this thing cleared. I do not see them yet.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Senator is correct; this is acceptable. Frankly, I think it is important to point out that there is, in some cases, an increase of fuel tax evasion. This amendment allows States to use a portion of their surface transportation funds to combat fuel tax evasion. So we are adding a new eligibility to surface transportation accounts. 
I mention that also in part because the whole point of this underlying bill is to give States more flexibility compared with the current law, and this provision, in fact, will add even more flexibility than that contained in the underlying bill.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this sounds good, repeal the 4.3-cent gasoline tax. Nobody likes paying taxes. We all know that. We also know we want our highways. 
If this amendment were to pass, we would be going backwards. Why do I say that? I say that, first, because it would, as the Senator from Delaware said, kill this bill. This is a killer amendment. This amendment would take about $6 billion a year away from the highway bill, $6 billion that would not be spent on highway construction, maintenance, et cetera. 
In addition, it is inadvisable because we are now at this point, with the passage of this bill and the defeat of this amendment, spending the money that comes into the highway trust fund back out on to highways. That is, the revenue coming in as a consequence of this bill will be used to finance spending on our roads and our highways. 
I might say, Mr. President, that polls confirm that Americans support the gas tax so long as the funds are being used on our highways. That is what this bill does. This amendment says, sorry, folks, we are not going to repair the roads and highways, not to the degree we should, and we are going to be derelict and not live up to our responsibilities. 
Today, all levels of government spending on highways and roads and bridges is about $34 billion a year. The Department of Transportation says we need more than that. It says we need $54 billion just to maintain current conditions, just to maintain. We need about $74 billion a year to improve. If this amendment passes, we are going to take $6 billion a year away from what we otherwise would be spending. That is, today I say we spend $34 billion, and it is true with the passage of this bill we spend more than $34 billion, but I might say I think it is obvious to Senators who are listening to this that it sounds good but it is a bad idea. I urge Members to yield back time and get on with the vote. We all know where the votes are in this, and we are just wasting our time by debating this further.

Mr. BAUCUS. If I could very briefly say to my good friend from Florida, I think it is important for us to look at our national motto: E pluribus unum. We are different States. Florida is a very densely populated State. Western States are very thinly populated. There are large expanses. Western States have high State gasoline taxes to match the Federal funds. I can't speak for all the western States, but I know my State of Montana has a 27-cents-a-gallon State gasoline tax. I don't know what it is in Florida. 
The assumption that, with the passage of the amendment, States themselves can spend their own money that they otherwise send to Uncle Sam, that money would be spent on highways may work in more densely populated States where the present gasoline tax is a little lower and where those States can finance the spending of the additional highway dollars, but I say to my good friend, in the West that is much more difficult. In fact, if Montana were to spend the same dollars that it sends to Uncle Sam and spend it at home, the State of Montana would have to raise the gasoline tax 12 to 15 cents. So we would be up to about 42 cents a gallon State tax on top of Federal. That is typical of a lot of western States. It just can't be done. 
So, it is the nature of the beast that the very densely populated States, the smaller, densely populated States similar to the State of Florida, are by definition going to have to probably pay a little more into the trust fund so that the very thinly populated States that already have very high State gasoline taxes trying to make their State match can have highways built in their States so we have a truly national system. 
If you follow the logic of the amendment of the Senator, and I understand it, it is essentially moving toward 50 nations, 50 States. We had that argument about 200 years ago when we scrapped the Articles of Confederation. We decided under the principles of federalism--it is complicated, I grant you--that we are a nation and we are 50 States--not 50 then but today 50. 
It is not an easy matter. It is complex. We have to find some rough justice here. The effect of the amendment of the Senator, I submit with all graciousness, would have put an unfair burden on the thinly populated States because they couldn't raise the money, frankly, to have a truly national interstate highway or primary road system. It is for that reason, in addition, that I do not think the Senator's amendment is good for our country.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I wonder if I could engage the distinguished chairman of our committee in a colloquy about the status of the bill. 
Mr. President, I ask the chairman: Isn't it true that we are pretty much wrapped up with our bill, but we are waiting on two major amendments? They are from two other committees, and we are waiting for those committees to come to the floor and offer their amendments so we can get them agreed to and then get on with this bill and get this bill off the floor so we can, hopefully following the House action, have a bill to go to conference. 
Isn't it true that we are about wrapped up here but we waiting on two committees?

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, might I ask the distinguished chairman of our committee, isn't it true that the Finance Committee amendment is very important to this bill because that is the amendment which will extend the current gasoline tax that is going to transfer the funds into the trust fund and, therefore, to other trust fund States? So we definitely need to get this Finance Committee amendment agreed to.

Mr. BAUCUS. My office called, and there is no answer. They are out to lunch. The lunch hour, I am sure, is over by 2:30. I hope the Finance Committee comes over quickly so that we get their amendment offered. 
I also ask the chairman--there is no reason why we even have to take the Banking Committee amendment. It seems to this Senator that we can just as soon go to third reading, and, if the Banking Committee does not come over with its amendment by tomorrow or the next day, then there is no transit amendment to the bill. There will be other opportunities for them to bring up their transit amendment sometime later this year, I would think. We don't have to wait. We don't have to have the transit amendment in this bill.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I might also note that last week when we were working out an arrangement to allocate dollars in the Byrd-Gramm-Warner-Baucus amendment the mass transit folks were going berserk; they were all upset that they were not `taken care of'. 
As we all know, the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee and the chairman of the Banking Committee and others have reached an agreement of the amounts that will be in the transit title. So there is no reason why they can't quickly put this bill together with the amounts that are contained in that agreement and offer their amendment. I hope they will do that very quickly. 
Again, we are here waiting for the Finance Committee. We are here waiting for the Banking Committee. Once those two committees come over with their major amendments to different titles to this bill, we will by and large be able to pass this bill and urge the House to take up and pass their ISTEA bill so we can meet the deadline of April 30. A lot can slip between now and April 30--passage here and in the House, then conference, and we have to have all of that done by April 30, and signed by the President by that same date so we don't have to worry about the possibility of another extension, which I certainly don't want, and so that States can rest assured that the highway program is in place. We have to move here. I hope the Finance Committee and the Banking Committee will help us out.

Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I support this amendment. There are no objections I am aware of on our side. 
A critical feature is State discretion. The States will have the authority, have the discretion, under this amendment, to change the alcohol content to a level that they so choose. That is, this amendment does not prescribe specifically what the alcohol content should be with respect to the repeat offender law. And because the States have that discretion, that choice, I support the amendment.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I consume. Mr. President, we had a good debate yesterday. I want to emphasize a couple of points. 
First, with all due respect, the argument that the Supreme Court has ruled that this program is unconstitutional and that we now have a duty to expunge the program from the statute books is a red herring. It is a bogus argument, a diversion, a smokescreen, as was so ably stated by the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Specter. 
If there was any doubt, it should have been dispelled by the letter that Senator Domenici received yesterday from Attorney General Reno and Secretary Slater. 
I urge my colleagues to read that letter. 
In Adarand, the Supreme Court did not hold that the DBE program is unconstitutional. It held that the program is subject to strict scrutiny. And it emphasized that this is not equivalent to holding that the program is unconstitutional. 
The case was remanded to the district court. Judge Kane held that the program furthers a compelling governmental interest. But he also held that the program was not narrowly tailored. 
So we have one district court judge, holding that the program is unconstitutional. Not the Supreme Court. Not an appeals court. But one federal district court judge, out of the 647 federal district court judges in the country. 
The Justice Department disagrees with the decision. So do many others. And the federal government has appealed the decision. 
There are, moreover, strong arguments that the program passes the strict scrutiny standard. 
The district court itself held that the DBE program furthers a compelling governmental interest in overcoming discrimination in the construction industry. 
With respect to narrow tailoring, as the letter to Senator Domenici explains, the DBE program is not a mandatory set aside or rigid quota. It's flexible. It's negotiated with each state. It can be adjusted, lower or higher. It can be satisfied by good faith efforts. No penalty has ever been imposed on a state that has not met it's goal. 
And the proposed rules would make the program even more flexible and narrowly tailored. 
So I believe that it is very clear that this program is constitutional. 
But there's another question. 
What's right? What's the right thing to do here? 
We all wish we lived in a world that was free from discrimination based on gender or race. 
We don't. Discrimination is still with us. I think we all know that. 
Women earn about 75 percent of what men earn for comparable work. 
Women own one-third of all small businesses, but women-owned businesses only receive 3 percent of federal procurement dollars. 
Minorities make up 20 percent of the population, but own only 9 percent of the construction businesses, and those businesses receive only 4 percent of construction receipts. 
So what do we do about it? 
Sometimes, Mr. President, equal opportunity means more than outreach. It means more than mailing out brochures and holding seminars. 
It means giving people an opportunity to prove themselves. 
It means giving them a seat at the table. 
That's what the DBE program is designed to do. 
And, as I said yesterday, it works. 
In 1978, 1.9 percent of federal highway construction dollars were going to firms owned by women or minorities. 
Today, under the DBE program, it's 14.8 percent. 
That's progress. 
I, for one, am proud that the percentage of women and minorities participating in the federal highway program in Montana has risen to 20 percent. That's good news. Not only for women and members of minority groups. But for all of us. For our communities. 
The program has worked. And because it has worked, people are still counting on it. 
About 20,000 companies have qualified as DBEs. They've grown their companies, taken out loans, hired more employees, in the expectation that the program would continue. 
If we look at the experience of Michigan, Louisiana, and other states that have repealed their state DBE programs, repeal of the federal DBE program will result in a sharp drop in the percentage of contracts going to businesses owned by women and minorities. By half, or more. 
If that happens, all across this country, small businesses women and minority entrepreneurs will be left high and dry. 
I, for one, will not vote to let that happen. 
Mr. President, the DBE program is constitutional. 
It's fair. 
It works. 
And it builds more inclusive communities and a stronger economy. 
It's good for America, and it brings us together. That is what America is all about. 
Again, I urge that the McConnell amendment be defeated. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this amendment that I am offering on behalf of Senator Kerrey from Nebraska adds another goal to the intelligent transportation system's research program in the underlying bill. It would add the achievement of national transportation safety goals, including at-grade railway-highway crossings to the ITS, intelligence transportation system program. 
I think it is a good idea to enhance the ITS program. We all know the problems of rail crossings. There are a lot of accidents and deaths, regrettably, at railway-highway crossings. This added language will help in the development of the ITS to try to find ways to minimize these types of things. 
I urge that we agree to this amendment.

Mr. BAUCUS. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I might say to my good friend from Alaska, my State of Montana has the same problem Alaska has, being a thinly populated State. We have very much experienced a lot of these same problems with border crossings and what not. One of the issues the Senator mentioned was the border crossings, and maybe there is a way we can work that out in this bill. The mass transit provisions, though--the ferries, for example--are not within this committee's jurisdiction. That is within the Banking Committee's jurisdiction. We expect to have an amendment soon. The Senator makes a basic, good point. It is similar to one I have made many times. I appreciate his coming to the floor.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Senator from Oregon has brought a very valuable addition to the NEPA process. Most of us, when we deal with the National Environmental Policy Act with respect to projects, believe that the policy is right; that is, that environmental alternatives should be considered fully. But we also experience delays, sometimes so long that we begin to wonder, what is going on here? Is there a better way of doing this? All of us have been there. 
This is the very first very serious effort to try to solve that problem; that is, on the one hand, keep the protection of the National Environmental Policy Act, which I think we all want --this Senator certainly does--but, on the other hand, make sure that the process is streamlined so that it doesn't take quite so long, so the decisions can be made, and so there is a little more confidence amongst the public in what these various agencies are attempting to do. 
It is simple. It just makes the review process not sequential but concurrent. It should have been concurrent in the first place. 
Second, it sets up a schedule of review at the start that the agencies must agree on so each agency knows kind of what it is doing first, if that is the theory, and, beyond that, it sets up a consultation process when there is disagreement among the agencies. 
But it is a very good amendment. In fact, I think that this is going to go a lot further--the effect of this amendment--and help many, many more people than is realized. We often have these grandiose amendments and bills around here, and they sound like they are going to do a lot and end up not doing much at all. This is a little bit the opposite. It is the process; it is streamlining. Some may think that it is not a big deal, but it will be a big deal--a huge deal--certainly if it is implemented in the spirit in which the amendment is intended--and I expect that will be the case. As a consequence, we public servants will be serving our people a little bit better than we would have otherwise. 
I compliment the Senator very much on his amendment. It is a very good idea. I thank him for it.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I apologize. I neglected to mention the hard work of the Senator from Florida. He spoke earlier. I know both he and Senator Wyden from Oregon worked very hard on this, as did Senator Smith, who is not on the floor with us. But the three of them worked together to put this together. 
I might say it is another example of the cooperation and compromise. Often Senators stand up on the floor, and, I might say, speak rhetorically, knowing that they are not going to get the results but trying to score points back home. These are Senators that worked together to accomplish something solid. And it is worthwhile. I compliment the three of them for being cooperative in compromising and getting the work done.

Mr. President, this obviously is a very important debate. It is the first civil rights debate we have had in a long time. It is very important that the Senate take this extremely seriously because it is such an important matter. It goes to the heart of what it is to be an American. 
I begin by emphasizing a fact which puts us into a bigger context, and that is all of us as Americans want to expand the economic pie. We all want to encourage more American entrepreneurs to start new companies, start more companies, create new jobs. That is especially true for women and for minorities. 
We, as Americans, will all be a lot better off and the country will be better off if there are more successful businesses owned by women, more owned by African Americans, more owned by Native Americans. All Americans, as a consequence, will have more jobs, will have more community leaders and will have more positive role 
models for our daughters and our sons. We will be a more cohesive country, a better country. I don't think there is any doubt about that. I think there is a consensus about that. 
The question, of course, is how we can best accomplish that goal. The so-called DBE Program, the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program, takes an important step to accomplish that objective by giving women and by giving minority groups a fair shot at that economic opportunity. It gives them a seat at the table. 
I will take a few moments to explain the program. First, it was created in 1982 as part of the highway bill signed by President Reagan. It began in 1982. It was then expanded in 1987 when the Senate added women-owned construction businesses to the category of businesses that are presumed to be disadvantaged. 
Let me emphasize this point: The program we are talking about is based on the small business program usually referred to as the section 8 program. But it is broader than section 8. In 1987, we expanded the highway Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program to include not only construction companies owned by members of minority groups but also construction companies owned by women. The expanded program was continued without change in ISTEA. That is, in the highway bill passed in 1991, and the committee has here proposed to continue it again in ISTEA II, the highway bill before the Senate. 
How does the program work? The law says unless the Secretary provides otherwise, at least 10 percent of the money expended on highway contracts under the official highway program should go to small businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. So who qualifies? First, you have to be a small business within the meaning of the Small Business Act. Beyond that, you have to be socially and economically disadvantaged. There is the presumption that women and members of certain minority groups are in fact disadvantaged. It is only a presumption, a presumption that can be overcome primarily in two ways. One is that a person who is not a member of one of the presumptive groups can show he or she is socially or economically disadvantaged. That can be shown. The other way is for a third party to challenge the eligibility of a particular contractor, such as a competitor, by showing that the person is not, in fact, disadvantaged. 
Under our Department of Transportation regulations, each State--let me underline the word `State'--each State highway program must take various steps to reach out to disadvantaged businesses. In addition, each State--underline again `State'--must establish an overall goal for the percentage of federally funded highway construction dollars going to women and minority-owned businesses. Once that goal is established--again, it is a goal; some States have more than 10 percent; some States goals are lower than 10 percent. It is a goal depending on the State. Once the goal is established, the State highway department establishes another goal for each particular contract. The goal doesn't have to be 10 percent; instead the State can look at the type of work, and the pool of available subcontractors and decide to set a higher goal for certain contracts and a lower goal for others. 
Once the goal is established for a contract, each contractor must make a good-faith effort to meet the goal--not mathematically required, not quota required, but a good-faith effort to meet it. That is all that the program is. If the contractor does make a good-faith effort but finds the qualified subcontracts are not available or that their bids are too high, the contractor has satisfied his obligation. In a nutshell, that describes the program. 
So how has it worked? What are the results? The program has been in place now for about 15 years. During that time, the percentage of Federal highway expenditures going to disadvantaged businesses has risen from barely 8 percent in 1992 to almost 15 percent today. In my State of Montana, 1996, the State expended $133 million on ISTEA or highway projects. Of that, $27 million--slightly more than 20 percent--went to DBE's. 
To companies like Omo Construction in Billings, MT--Ron Omo started out with a pick up, that is all he had, and the will to be his own staff. He was certified as a DBE in 1986. In 1997 his company received $4 million in prime contracts and subcontractors. 
Or Greenway Enterprises, in Helena, which is run by Dee Hoovestall, who started out with a backyard seeding company and now runs a large construction company in my State. 
There are others, people who have created jobs and improved our communities. With that as background, I would like to respond to the principal criticisms that have been made of the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program. 
Three points: First, the program is constitutional; second, the program is fair; and third, it works. 
It has been argued that the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program is unconstitutional. I disagree. There are important constitutional questions, and they deserve careful attention, but when you look at the decision of the Supreme Court, the decisions of the district court, and the new proposed regulations, the program passes constitutional muster. 
Let's start with the decision of the Supreme Court. In the Adarand decision, the Supreme Court held that a Federal affirmative action program is subject to what the lawyers call `strict scrutiny.' In other words, to pass constitutional muster, the Government must show that the program furthers a compelling interest--and that is a given in this case; the lower court even found that--and also uses a narrowly tailored means to do so. Strict scrutiny means compelling Government interest and, second, that the program is narrowly tailored. 
The Supreme Court did not hold that the program was unconstitutional. Again, the Supreme Court did not hold that the program was unconstitutional. Nobody can refute that statement. 
In fact, the Court went out of its way to say that subjecting the Federal affirmative action program to strict scrutiny was not equivalent to finding that the program is unconstitutional. 
In a majority opinion, Justice O'Connor said:  
We wish to dispel the notion that strict scrutiny is `strict in theory, but fatal in fact.' . . . the unhappy persistence of both the practice and the lingering effects of racial discrimination against minority groups in this country is an unfortunate reality, and government is not disqualified from acting in response to it. . . . 
The Court gives some examples and then it says: 
When race-based action is necessary to further a compelling interest, such action is within the constitutional constraints if it satisfies the `narrow tailoring' test this Court has set out in previous cases. 
Having established that strict scrutiny applies, the Supreme Court remanded the case so that the lower court could consider whether the program furthers a compelling interest and is narrowly tailored. 
The district court judge issued its opinion in June of last year. It is a mixed bag. 
After reviewing the legislative history, the judge found that `Congress had sufficient evidence, at the time these measures were enacted, to determine reasonably and intelligently that discriminatory barriers existed in Federal contracting.' 
Therefore, he concluded that `Congress has a strong basis in evidence for enacting the challenged statutes' and that the program was justified by a compelling Government interest. That was the district court speaking. 
Then the judge turned to the second part of the test, narrow tailoring. 
Looking at the details of the Federal lands highway program, he concluded that it was not flexible enough or sufficiently related to past discrimination to meet the narrow tailoring test. Therefore, because the program did not pass both parts of the strict scrutiny test, he held as a district court judge that it was unconstitutional. 
Let me make three points about this decision. 
First, the decision itself applies only to the Federal lands highway program in Colorado. 
Second, a single district court's decision that a Federal statute is unconstitutional is, obviously, not the last word. Such decisions frequently are reversed on appeal, and this decision has been appealed. 
In fact, there are many law professors who have written that, in their view, the district court decision that the statute is unconstitutional is in error. 
Third, the court was looking at the current program. But that program is changing. 
A few years ago, President Clinton ordered a review of all 
Federal affirmative action programs. In response, Secretary Slater has proposed significant changes to the DBE Program, designed to make the program more flexible, more targeted, and, in a nutshell, more narrowly tailored. The proposed new rules would make several important changes. 
First, they replace the 10 percent goal with a new goal that's based on an estimate of the extent to which discrimination has affected construction contracting in each State. Again, no numerical goal. 
Second, they give more emphasis to incentives like outreach and technical assistance. 
Third, they confirm that contract goals are not binding. If a contractor makes a good-faith effort to find qualified women or minority-owned subcontractors, but fails to meet the goal, there is no penalty. If you do your best, that is good enough. 
Moreover, the regulations allow the Secretary to waive the requirements if a contractor comes up with an alternative approach that is as good or better then the approach in the rules. 
Putting all this together, the Supreme Court held that the program is subject to strict scrutiny, but emphasized that it does not mean that the program is unconstitutional. 
The only district court to consider the question held that there is a compelling interest, but not narrow tailoring. The proposed new rules directly address narrow tailoring by making the program even more flexible and targeted. In light of this, I believe that the DBE Program is constitutional. 
My second point is that the program is fair. It's fair because it helps women and minorities get a seat at the bidding table--not the only seat, not the best seat, but simply a seat at the table, an opportunity to compete against equally qualified contractors. 
Let's face the facts. We all wish we lived in a society that does not discriminate based on gender or race. Well, we don't. Women and members of minority groups do face barriers that the rest of us do not. That is why the DBE Program was created. That is why it was expanded in 1987 to include women. 
Let me give you an example. In 1984 the Transportation Subcommittee held an oversight hearing to review the implementation of the 1982 highway bill. A woman named Wendy Johnson testified about the discrimination in the construction industry. She said: 
Few, if any, of the major contractors of State departments of transportation are making aggressive, affirmative efforts to recruit women . . . Yet, we have documented that many women want and need these jobs. 
Let me make a point about discrimination another way. Look at the statistics. Women still earn only 72 percent of what men earn for comparable work. Women own about one-third of all small businesses. But women-owned businesses only receive 3 percent of Federal procurement dollars. Minorities make up 20 percent of the U.S. population but own only 9 percent of the construction businesses, and those businesses receive only 4 percent of construction receipts. 
According to the General Counsel of the Transportation Department, `Minority and women-owned firms report that they are routinely unable to secure subcontracts on private work where there are no affirmative action requirements and that white-owned prime contractors reject minority or women-owned firms even when they offer the lowest bid.' 
The DBE Program helps women and members of minority groups overcome these barriers. That is why, to my mind, the program is fair. 
My third point is that the disadvantaged business----

<TEXT>
Mr. BAUCUS. That is a very good point, particularly as to how much this has helped women become an equal force in this society--or 
getting there. 
Third, the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program works. After the program went into effect, the percentage of highway expenditures going to disadvantaged businesses rose significantly, from 8 percent in 1982 to 12.9 percent in 1983. It has remained pretty stable ever since. 
The percentage of expenditures going to women-owned businesses has risen steadily, from 3.1 percent in 1983 to 6.7 percent in 1996. That is still pretty low. After all, women make up more than half of the population and own one-third of all small businesses. Maybe 6.7 percent is nothing to crow about, but it's more than double the percentage of expenditures that went to women-owned businesses in 1983, before women were added to the DBE Program. 
We can look at it another way. What would happen if this program were repealed? In recent years, several States have eliminated their own disadvantaged business enterprise programs, and the results have been dramatic. 
In 1989, Michigan repealed its disadvantaged business enterprise program for State highway contracts. Within 9 months, the percentage of highway dollars going to minority-owned businesses fell to zero. The percentage of highway dollars going to women-owned businesses receiving highway contracts fell to 1 percent. 
By 1996, the total percentage of women and minority-owned businesses receiving State highway contracts was still about 1 percent. At the same time, for Federal highway contracts in Michigan, operating under the Federal program, women and minority-owned businesses received 12.7 percent of the contract dollars. 
In other words, on Federal highway construction projects, operating with a DBE program, women and minority-owned businesses received a 12 times greater share of contracting dollars than they did on State projects operating without such a program. Mr. President, that is because the program was repealed in Michigan. 
There have been similar results in other States and cities, and this obviously tells us something. It is obviously a warning. That is, if we repeal the Federal program or cut the Federal program way back--which, in effect, the McConnell amendment does--opportunities for women and minority-owned businesses are likely to suffer a sharp decline. 
Think about what that will mean for hundreds of new, startup companies all across our country. 
In many cases, women and minority group members have worked for years to build up their companies. They have borrowed thousands of dollars for expensive construction equipment, all based on the expectation that in America they will have a fair shot, a fair shot at highway construction contracts. 
If now, in this bill, we eliminate the DBE Program, a lot of small businesses will be left high and dry. 
Pulling all this together, the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program is constitutional, it's fair, it works, and it is good for America. We should maintain the program, not weaken or repeal it. 
That brings me to the McConnell amendment. The amendment repeals the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program and replaces it with something called the `Emerging Business Enterprise Program.' This program requires each State to establish a program for outreach, education, and technical assistance for small businesses. But that is about it. 
I am all for outreach and I am all for education and technical assistance. Who isn't? But by eliminating contract goals--not quotas, but goals--the McConnell amendment dilutes the program down to almost nothing. And by doing so, it really misses the point. 
Women and minority group members who own small construction companies often do need outreach, they often do need education and technical assistance, but in many cases that is not enough. 
Even when they have the information and the technical skills, they often find that they just can't crack into the market. That is why we need to do more, why we need to establish goals, goals that should be flexible and should be based on the specific circumstances of each State--and they are. But without goals against which we can measure progress, our commitment to expanded opportunity is nothing more than an empty promise. 
Fifteen years ago, we made a commitment. We told women and minority-owned businesses in this country that we would give them an opportunity to compete, we would give them a seat at the table. 
The program has worked. It has created more opportunity, not less, and it's still necessary. 
As President Clinton has said, `In the fight for the future, we need all hands on deck, and some of those hands still need a helping hand.' 
Mr. President, I urge that we maintain our commitment to opportunity, to inclusiveness, and to lending a helping hand. I urge that the McConnell amendment be defeated.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I see the Senator from Maine on the floor, so I will be brief. I want to just make a couple of points here. 
One, I will reiterate a point made by Senator Chafee. We, in the Senate, have received a letter from the Secretary of Transportation, Rodney Slater, who said he would find it difficult to recommend to the President for signature ISTEA legislation that did not include the DBE Program, which has been noted in a statement that he would recommend the President veto this bill if the DBE Program is taken out. 
I don't want to belabor this constitutionality argument, but it's clear that the Supreme Court did not rule that the Federal highway DBE Program in Colorado was unconstitutional. The Supreme Court did not rule it unconstitutional. It is clear. All Senators who have studied this know that. The Supreme Court said that program, like all affirmative action programs, must be subjected to a strict scrutiny test. That is what the Supreme Court held, that the Colorado public lands DBE Program had to be subject to the strict scrutiny test. That is all they held--nothing more, nothing less. The strict scrutiny test has two parts, compelling interest and narrow tailoring. Even the district court in Colorado said it looks like a compelling interest. So the only question is whether the program was narrowly tailored. A district court judge found, in his judgment, that it was not narrowly tailored. Well, that is one man's opinion. That is a district court judge's opinion. District court judges declare statutes unconstitutional all the time, only to find them overturned by the Supreme Court. 
There is only one body that determines whether a statute is really constitutional or not, and that is the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has not ruled up or down on the constitutionality of the program in Colorado. They have not ruled. In fact, the U.S. Government has filed an appeal on the district court decision. I have a letter from Associate Attorney General Raymond Fisher to Senator Daschle, which states that:  
As we discuss further below, we believe that the ISTEA program is narrowly tailored to meet this compelling interest and is constitutional under the Adarand standards.

Mr. BAUCUS. Here is another letter signed by many law school professors. I see 40 or 50, I don't know. They have the same conclusion--that the district court's decision in Colorado was wrong; that is, that the program is narrowly tailored and is constitutional. 
Now, if that is not enough, the Department of Transportation has new regulations, which go even further, and with more flexibility, to make it even more clear that the program is narrowly tailored. Some Senators spoke up and said, gee, wealthy people are, under this definition, socially disadvantaged. Not true under the new regs. They have a net worth test. If you are wealthy, you don't qualify. There are lots of new provisions in the new regulations that will go into effect. They are in the drafting stage now. 
Again, just because a district court judge says it is unconstitutional doesn't make it so. The only thing that does that is a decision by the U.S. Supreme Court. They haven't ruled on this. 
Second, many think the judge is wrong--many. Finally, there are new regs which are much more flexible and which clearly make this narrowly tailored. For that reason, this is not unconstitutional because it is fair and helps people and it works. It should remain in the bill.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes. 
Mr. President, I want to ruminate about this concept of quotas and goals. First of all, nobody likes quotas. They are rigid, they are unforgiving, they are almost insulting. The DBE program does not use quotas; it uses goals. 
Now, some say the goal is 10 percent, 15 percent, or 20 percent, or what not; so is it really a goal? To be honest with ourselves here, it is a goal, but it does have a number associated with it. For example, the number is 10 percent. Some States ask for a lower goal--not a quota, but a lower goal. Some States are granted those lower goals. Some States ask for higher goals and they are granted those higher goals. Some States say, `Our goal is going to be 10 percent,' and lo and behold, it turns out that the disadvantaged business enterprise program does not meet 10 percent, it is a lower percent. That has happened in a couple of States. In 1996, in Arizona and in Alaska, the goal was 10 percent, but those two States did not reach the 10 percent goal. In Alaska, it was 8.6 percent. In Arizona, it was 8.9 percent. You might ask: What happened? Why didn't those States meet their goals? As far as I know, nothing has happened, which is further evidence that this is not a quota; it is just a goal. 
We all know that goals are important. We know that if we want to achieve something, it is good to have a goal. If you don't have goals, often we slip, we rationalize, and things fall between the cracks and they don't happen. Sometimes it is helpful to have numerical dates or to quantify your goals, again, to help assure that you reach them, like benchmarks. We all know that sometimes 
quantifying a goal helps make it happen. In this case, we are not talking about a rigid goal. It is a goal that has a lot of flexibility to it in a lot of different ways. 
I was a bit bemused when I heard Senators chafing at this concept of goals, I guess the same way Senators resist unanimous consent agreements. A unanimous consent agreement is a kind of a goal. It is a statement that, within 2 hours we are going to vote or something, or within an hour and a half we are going to do something else. We have to have limits sometimes to make something happen. Look at newspapers. Newspaper reporters know they have a deadline to get the paper out. 
So if we do want greater inclusion of minority groups participating in highway contracting, and if we want more women enterprises to participate in highway contracting, it is good to have a goal to help make that happen. That is what we are attempting to do here. It is not unconstitutional because it is very flexible. It has a lot of give. I might say that the proposed regulations that the Department of Transportation is working on and, in fact, will probably finalize in a couple of months, make the program even more narrowly tailored. For example, the regulations include further emphasis on good-faith efforts. All a contractor has to show is good faith, not a numerical number. Also in the proposed regulations is a broad waiver allowing States to come up with their own program that will replace the Department of Transportation's program if the State can show that its own program will effectively redress discrimination. That is a broad waiver. 
In addition, the proposed regulations would add a net worth cap. That is, if your net worth exceeds a certain amount, you are not eligible, even if you are a woman or a minority. So all those statements about the Sultan of Brunei are irrelevant. The proposed regulations make it very clear that the Sultan of Brunei, with all his palaces and gold-plated Rolls Royces, and so forth, would not even begin to be eligible for the DBE Program. I might say that it is not only the Sultan of Brunei; it is a bunch of other folks whose net worth is significant and who should not be part of the DBE Program. 
So the basic point is, again, that this is very narrowly tailored, it is flexible, it is based on good faith efforts. It is not a quota. And the proposed regulations will be even more flexible and narrowly tailored, with more emphasis on good-faith effort.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to announce the introduction of the Gallatin Land Consolidation Act of 1998. I am pleased to be joined in this introduction by my fellow members of the Montana delegation--Senator Burns and Congressman Hill. The Gallatin Act is a bipartisan bill that is the culmination of years of hard work and unheralded cooperation between the Montana delegation, local communities, conservation and user groups, and all levels of government. 
The consolidation of this area makes sense on many levels. In the Gallatin area, the Act will consolidate the historic checkerboard ownership that has muddied the waters of land management for years. This bill will establish logical and effective ownership and management of these lands. In the long run, consolidation will substantially reduce the cost to the Forest Service--and ultimately the taxpayer--of managing the Gallatin National Forest. By eliminating this checkerboard ownership pattern, the bill improves public access to Forest Service lands and reduces the disputes that currently arise over the proper location of property lines. 
Perhaps most importantly, this bill will protect these areas so that our children can enjoy them just as we do. The checkerboard ownership pattern invites sprawling subdivisions. Whether those occur across the Taylor Fork, or north in the Bangtails, the effect is the same. The Forest Service lands will be diminished in value for wildlife and recreation as every other section of land is developed. This checkerboard development would also diminish the pristine vistas that make this area so special. By consolidating these lands, we can protect recreational opportunities, wildlife herds, our famous fisheries, and the area's beautiful scenery. 
While consolidation benefits the entire Gallatin area, in the Taylor Fork alone, the benefits are awe-inspiring. This area is critical winter range for elk and moose and helps to sustain the largest contingent of grizzly bears in the lower forty-eight states. The conservation of the Taylor Fork, the Gallatin roaded area, and the Bangtails will allow for the continued historic uses that define the character of Montana such as hunting, grazing, recreation, and wildlife habitat protection. 
I would like to take a minute to thank the Montana delegation for their hard work that has led to introduction of this Act. I also want to recognize and applaud the efforts of all the folks in Montana who have been instrumental in crafting this consolidation. 
Local conservation and wildlife groups in Bozeman and in Butte have worked long and hard to ensure that this bill protects the fisheries and wildlife that make these lands unique. In response to their suggestions, we have crafted the bill to ensure that the public will be involved in planning the timber-for-land component of this exchange. In response to their suggestions, we have also provided for a fair and public process to determine the management direction for the acquired lands, and have included a restoration program to improve the environmental health of these lands. Together, these changes will ensure that these lands will be enjoyed by sportsmen and by all Montanans for generations to come. 
And I would like to thank those in the timber industry who have worked to ensure that this exchange will protect Montana mills. The Independent Forest Products Association, who represents many of Montana's small mills has been ever vigilant to ensure that the Forest Service small business provisions are respected. In that vein, I would especially like to thank Al Kington, whose last-minute advice allowed us to craft the bill to provide extra protection for Montana's small mills. 
I would also like to thank those who have worked so hard to ensure that the Taylor Fork is protected. The Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation has worked tirelessly to raise funds to purchase one of the sections in the Taylor Fork. Local land owners including the Kelsey's of the 9 1/4 Circle Ranch and the Patton's of the Black Butte Ranch and the other members of the Upper Gallatin Community, helped with those efforts and have been vocal advocates for conserving these lands for all Montanans. 
I would also like to thank Gallatin County Commissioners Jane Jelinksi, Phil Olson and Bill Murdock. My staff met with the commissioners individually and as a group as we crafted this exchange. I appreciate their input and look forward to working with them in the future. 
Big Sky Lumber, the private party to this exchange has negotiated the terms of this agreement in good faith. They have provided a number of concessions to make this exchange more responsive to public concerns. These include agreements to providing public recreation access across their lands, protecting viewsheds in the Bridger Canyon area, and providing options to local landowners to allow them to purchase some of these lands following the exchange. 
Last, but certainly not least, I would like to thank two public employees, Bob Dennee with the U.S. Forest Service, and Kurt Alt with the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks. These two individuals have logged long hours on this exchange over the years and have been an invaluable resource for me and my staff. 
However, it should be clear to all that our work is not done. As the bill moves through the legislative process, I will continue working to make sure that this consolidation is responsive to the people that it serves. I look forward to working with the Montana public to finalize this exchange and to protect these important lands. 
Every once in a while, we are blessed to work on efforts for which we know our children will thank us. And the Gallatin Consolidation is one of those efforts. If we do not take this opportunity to address the problems that were created by the railroad land grants a century ago, we may never have another such opportunity. If we do not act now, these lands will be broken into smaller and smaller pieces--all to the detriment of our fish, wildlife, and cultural heritage. If we do not act now, it will be to the detriment of our children. However, if we succeed, our children and our grand children will be forever grateful. 
Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting this important effort. And I thank my colleague from Montana for his continued hard work and cooperation on this bill.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, may I say, as chairman of the Transportation Subcommittee, that the answer is yes. In fact, currently there are a good number of States--so-called `donor' States--which contribute more to the highway trust fund than they receive in terms of highway allocations. They receive actually less than 90 percent. There are some States down around the 80s. One, I think, is 76 percent. I am not sure about South Carolina. But the bill that passed the committee made sure that there is a floor of 90 percent--that donor States get at least 90 percent. Through the able efforts of the Senator from Virginia, and others--Virginia is often a donor State--that was then raised to 91 percent. 
This was one of the areas of concern that we on the committee had when we considered additional money under the Byrd-Gramm-Warner-Baucus amendment; that is, there are some States that felt they needed additional money because of high density, and others because they are donor States. There are 
some Western States that felt because they are public land States they should get some, too. And then the Appalachian Regional Commission felt that there was not enough money in the underlying bill. So the amendment would give a little more to Appalachia. 
But the long and short of it is that South Carolina, and all donor States, will, under the amendment now pending, combined with the underlying bill, receive at least 91 percent. Technically, it is 91 percent of the percentage of their contribution of the funds that are allocated, but for all intents and purposes, it is raised from 90 percent to 91 percent. 
Mr. President, while I have the floor, I would like to follow on the points made by the very distinguished and able chairman of the committee, Senator Chafee, very generally. Several of us--Senator Chafee, myself, Senator Byrd, Senator Gramm, Senator Warner, Senator Domenici, and, most particularly, the majority leader, Senator Trent Lott, met many, many times over the last several weeks to find a fair way to distribute dollars that would be raised in the act transferring 4.3 cents of the gasoline tax to the trust fund, and then back to the States. 
Essentially, we came up with a program dealing first with States that had legitimate concerns as a consequence of the committee bill and then distributing the rest back to the States according to the percentage share that they were receiving under the bill so as not to give any favoritism to anyone in place. 
That is what we did. It is an agreement that was agreed to by all the main parties. We, at the same time, talked with many other Senators who were not part of this conversation in order to have a result that reflected fairness to regions in all parts of the country. 
It is also an agreement agreed to by Senator Domenici, the very, very able chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. He said he would find a way with these increases to come up with a balanced budget resolution that does not exceed the caps in the budget resolution so that those who are concerned that this additional money might `bust the budget' may rest much more assured that is not the case. If anybody can find a way to not balance the budget and not bust the caps and get the rest of the additional money because of this amendment, certainly Senator Domenici can do that. 
I might add, Mr. President, that these issues are never easy. Every State feels that it should have a few more highway dollars, and every State feels that its share is not quite as fair as the share of other States. There is no magic in this. It is just a matter of looking at all the claims, all the equities, and all the differences in different parts of the country. Some States are donor States and some States are donee States. Others have completed their interstate highways later, rather than earlier. Some States have real bridge problems that need to be addressed. Some States, like in ours, in the West, next to public lands, count on a lot of tourists who visit our States. For example, in the State of Montana, there is tourism with tourists going to visit Yellowstone or Glacier Parks. Some tourists pay a little bit of Montana tax to the degree that they travel in our State. But we in Montana have to pay a lot to maintain those highways. So it is adding all of those equities together as best we possibly can. 
On the numbers again, just so everyone is clear, the underlying bill spends about $145 billion in contract authority over 6 years on the highway program. The amendment that we are now addressing, that is before the body, adds $6 billion for a total $171 billion in contract authority that would be spent allocated among the States. 
I do not want to get too technical about this, but contract authority is not exactly the same as obligation limitations or outlays, which is to say that the Budget Committee will determine what those obligation limitations are. The Appropriations Committee will then decide how much of the total it can spend. The Appropriations Committee will not be bound to spend the full $171 billion unless it wants to. The Appropriations Committee can spend a little less, if it decides in its determination that it is more appropriate because it will have to find some offsets to spend this additional money. Obviously, there will be some compelling needs with the Budget Committee with other ideas and other programs, but still with the contract authority set at $171 billion over 6 years, there is a tremendous incentive for the Budget Committee and the Appropriations Committee to spend--allocate outlays--the actual dollars going to the States to build highways at a level very close to $171 billion--not entirely, but very, very close. 
This underlying bill, Mr. President, I remind Senators, is much, much more flexible than the current highway program. The current highway program has 11 separate categories that are pretty rigid; somewhat inflexible. 
They give State highway departments gray hairs sometimes, because one State's needs--say that were Arkansas--is a little bit different from another State's needs--let's say Montana or Rhode Island or Virginia or South Carolina. 
So we collapsed those 11 categories into 6. And the six are now much more flexible, very flexible. For example, one of the main categories is called `surface transportation account.' You can take money out of that for Amtrak, if you want. You can take money out of that for mass transit, if you want. You can spend more on enhancements, if you wish. There is a lot of flexibility here, flexibility that the States have, much more flexibility given to States than is the case under the current highway bill. The departments of transportation commissioners wanted this. It makes sense to the committee that much more delegation of flexibility be given to the States. 
For those who are concerned about the Congestion Mitigation Air Quality Program, CMAQ, actually there are more dollars in this bill than the current CMAQ program. CMAQ is important because we want to make sure that building more highways is consistent with improving air quality. We passed the Clean Air Act in 1991, telling States and cities that are not in attainment to undertake certain actions to bring their air quality standards into compliance. Obviously, if you build a lot more lanes, have a lot more traffic in the city, more cars, more auto emissions, sometimes it is inconsistent with the goals of air quality improvement. So, basically, the CMAQ money is there to help deal with that problem. 
And, I might say, in the first category, called `interstate maintenance,' called `national highway system money,' there is a restriction: You cannot build additional lanes for single occupancy. You can for HOV lanes, again to address congestion and air quality problems, but you cannot build lanes just for single-occupancy cars. Again, we are trying to merge two competing programs together. 
I might say, this is particularly important, this amendment, to my State of Montana. We are a big State. We don't have a lot of people. In fact, we have more miles per capita of highways than any other State in the Nation. Our State gasoline tax is the third highest in the Nation. We are paying for our highways as best as we possibly can. We are not a big industrial State. In fact, we are a relatively poor State. I am embarrassed to say this, but Montana, today, ranks 46th in the Nation for per capita income. We were 35th, 36th, not too many years ago. We are now down to 46th. 
It is tough. We don't have the money in Montana to pay for our roads, and this is going to go a long way. Mr. President, 90 percent of the households in Montana make multiple trips of over 100 miles each year, and that is compared with a national average of 80 percent. As I say, tourists come to Montana--actually it's 8 million visitors who come to visit our State. It is beautiful. Glacier National Park in the summertime--a lot of people come to fish and camp out and bring their families from all over the country. In the winter, of course, there is skiing, whether it's downhill, cross-country, or snowmobiling, which is very popular in our State. 
I will just sum up by saying, as much as it sounds like we spend a lot of money on highways, in the larger context this really is not enough. Today, the United States spends, State, local and Federal combined, about $34 billion a year on our highways. The Department of Transportation did a needs study, what is needed to be spent just to maintain the current condition of our highways, recognizing winter and summer things get beat up and so on and so forth. They concluded that about $54 billion a year should be spent just to maintain the current level of maintenance of America's highway system. So if we want to do better, we should spend, according to the Department of Transportation, maybe $70 billion a year, so as to improve our highway system, to keep up with the highway system in Germany, for example, and some other countries that spend a lot of money on their highways. 
Of course, their gasoline taxes are much higher than they are in the United States, but those dollars go to improve their highways. That is a decision that those countries have made. We are spending $171 billion over 6 years. That is a far cry from $60, $70 billion over 1 year. It is just an example of what other countries are doing compared with what our needs are, to explain that the current bill, as important as it is, is probably not enough if we wanted to improve upon our current system. 
I am going to yield the floor to whoever wants to speak here. Again, I thank all those who worked very hard on this and hope we can conclude this bill very quickly, because we have to go to conference on the House-passed bill whenever they pass their bill. By May 1, the bill has to be signed by the President. By May 1, that's when the current program expires. We were a bit derelict last year in the Senate when we did not pass the highway bill even though the program expired June 30 of last year. We got tied up on campaign finance reform, and we agreed to move the transportation bill up to one of the first orders of business in 1998. That slipped a little, but fortunately here we are. 
It is very important that we move expeditiously to meet our Nation's needs and satisfy Americans who want to be assured that we have the highway program in place, a solid 6-year program, so contractors can plan and State departments of transportation can plan ahead and we do not have to worry about this on-again/off again problem that we are currently facing with our program. So I hope we do move very expeditiously to pass not only this amendment but the full bill so we can get on to work with the House in the conference and pass the bill. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BAUCUS. I answer the point of the very distinguished Senator from Virginia that I very much do. I might remind the Senator of several facts which substantiate his point. 
No. 1, the current highway program is based on very dated data. It is based on the 1980 census. We even have in here the 
1916 postal road formula--that is in the current law. Of course, the bill we are passing today brings it up to date.

Mr. BAUCUS. Once we get this legislation passed, we are out of the pony express era because we will have current data, data reflecting how many miles people travel in their State, lane miles, vehicle miles, et cetera. That is a formula based on the actual usage and needs in the State, which is critical. 
In addition to that, I might add to my distinguished friend that there were earlier separate competing bills. There was a STEP 21 bill sponsored by the Senator from Virginia; there was a STARS 2000 bill, which had a little Western influence; there was ISTEA-Plus, I think the name of it was, or the ISTEA bill which was sponsored by the northeastern Members of the Senate. 
With the leadership of Senator Warner we were able to bring the three bills together. We didn't favor one region over another. On a very bipartisan basis, you on your side and I on my side, along with Senator Chafee, had to come up with a bill which is fair to America, fairest to the country. 
We passed our bill out of committee. Even though we did the very best we could, there were still some Senators who had some concerns. Some of them were off the committee. We dealt with those concerns with this amendment on a very bipartisan basis.

Mr. BAUCUS. That is exactly right. In fact, in a nutshell, we believe it is only fair to the American people that a portion of the gasoline tax that goes to the trust fund be allocated to the States. We took that amount, 3.45 cents, and essentially allocated it according to the provisions of the underlying bill without changing the formulas, making a couple of minor changes to accommodate some legitimate concerns of Senators. That is basically what we have done. Frankly, I cannot think of a fairer way to do it. 
I am also reminded there is sort of a feeling in the room, and also the feeling in the committee when we acted on this in the room where we put this together--you can tell when it's fair or not fair. Everybody was happy and felt good. It felt good. Also, in the committee, when the committee reported out this amendment, you could tell, too, it passed unanimously with Senators all around, as the Senator well knows.

He is absolutely right. I mean, he represents his State and wants to represent it to the fullest. And he believes, correctly, that he would like to have more information.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I chime in with the remarks of the distinguished Senator, chairman of our committee, Senator Chafee, and encourage Senators who do have amendments on this underlying amendment to come on over. I am going to encourage the chairman to go to a final vote on this amendment in the next 25 minutes, by a quarter of 3. Senators have had more than ample notice all day long, certainly this afternoon, and having heard from the chairman and from myself, all the offices around, they have about 25 minutes to get here. That is more than fair. I think it is, frankly, in fairness to other Senators who want to get on with this bill, move on with it--it's in fairness to them that we vote by a quarter to 3 on this final amendment. Unless Senators come to the floor with their amendments where we can work out some kind of time agreement in some expeditious manner, I really strongly encourage the chairman to vote at quarter to 3 if there are no pending amendments.

Maybe one solution might be to vote on this amendment, and Senators who have concerns about this amendment can state them, that is, they are voting for it kind of on reservation or something like that, pending information that they get, and reserve the opportunity to offer amendments at a later time. I say that because this amendment, I suspect, is going to pass. Therefore, that will have passed and we will be done with it. Then we can still address the concerns that the Senator from Florida may or may not have, and having passed this amendment doesn't put him in a disadvantageous position.

Mr. BAUCUS. The Senator is correct. However, let me make an important point. In the underlying bill, 10 percent of the money is used for things such as research, emergency relief for natural disasters and administrative costs. That 10 percent is not counted in the calculation of the State's share. But this is not a new concept. These are national programs. It is the approach that has been taken in the previous ISTEA program as well. It is not new. In the amendment, I say to the Senator, we have given Michigan actually a better deal. 
In this amendment, we calculate the dollars needed to give you a 91-percent share. This calculation, for the first time, includes other programs. Included in the calculation under the amendment are the additional amounts apportioned to the States, that is $18.9 billion, plus the $1.8 billion in the new density program and the $1.89 billion in the Appalachian highway program. The result is that 91 percent is now calculated on a larger universe of funds than in the underlying bill.

Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, this is a happy day, because it was not too long ago here that, after the EPA announced new standards for ozone and small particulates, there was going to be a huge uproar in the Senate and there would be a big battle over whether or not the EPA should be allowed to go ahead with these new standards. 
Frankly, however, as Senators have looked at this issue--and I take my hat off to the Senator from Oklahoma, Senator Inhofe, who has come up with this amendment--the effect of this amendment is not to delay those standards and not to in any way impede those standards, but rather set up a procedure which helps, frankly, assure the process will continue on a fair basis; namely, that the monitoring costs--and they will be quite extensive; that is monitoring the air in various parts of the country, particularly nonattainment areas--will be paid for by the Environmental Protection Agency. That is not by States. The States will be fully reimbursed for their monitoring costs. So that helps establish a solid program because we know where the money is going to come from and it will be fully paid for. 
A second major change here, at least a clarification, is that States will not be faced with new nonattainment designations under the Clean Air Act for PM 2.5--that is the small particulates--without 3 years of monitoring data. That at least makes sense, that we have 3 years of monitoring data. In fact, the EPA-proposed standard was based on a 3-year average anyway. So as a practical matter, this is a measure which will help assure that the standards will be addressed fairly, comprehensively, and also in a timely manner. So this version of this amendment, unlike earlier versions that had been filed, does not delay implementation of the new air quality standards. 
This version also has no language in it which revokes the standards. There was some concern that these standards might be revoked. That is not in here. Also, there is no provision that proposes a moratorium on EPA. 
In short, the new standards will go forward as envisioned. I might say to Senators, this is a long, involved process. It could take 10, 12 years before some of these standards actually ever go into effect, if they ever do. If they do go into effect, they are at the behest of and designation of States. That is, States, under what is called State implementation plans, would designate what actions various entities, whether they are powerplants or automobiles or what not, would have to do in order to qualify. And that would take a long time. 
So I finish where I began. This is a happy day. This is a resolution. It is a compromise. And I think it is going to help people be more assured, on a more solid, fair basis, that our air will be cleaner in those parts of the country where it needs to be cleaned up. I think it is a good amendment, and I thank the Senator very much for his amendment.

Mr. BAUCUS. If I might ask my good friend, the chairman of the committee, Senator Chafee, wouldn't it also be a good idea for Senators who are interested in an amendment that might be offered by Senator McConnell, with respect to the disadvantaged business enterprise, to also have their staffs come over to the floor so we can potentially begin to work on it, an agreement on that amendment? That is another amendment that is going to take some time. It is contentious. The more we start working on the provisions of the debate, the more quickly we can reach a time agreement. I guess that would be another subject we should address as well.

Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I rise to discuss the President's request to provide new support for the International Monetary Fund. 
Last December I spent two weeks in Southeast Asia, visiting the Philippines, Brunei, Thailand and Indonesia. 
Two of these countries, Thailand and Indonesia, are among the nations hardest hit by the currency crisis. They, along with the Philippines and South Korea, are working with the IMF to reform their financial systems and promote an early recovery. 
I believe it is very much in our interest to help them through this crisis, and to provide insurance against a new one by supporting the full request for IMF replenishment.

Mr. BAUCUS. I can only but add to the remarks that have already been given, first, on the substance of the agreement and, second, in my thanks to all the Senators who have participated so intensely, so vigorously in the last week, or so. 
The amendment that has been agreed to, first, is a significant amendment. It is an increase of about $26 billion in contract authority over 6 years, from $145 billion to about $171 billion for highway programs, plus about $2 billion for safety programs. So the agreement is very significant. It increases highway spending by roughly 20 percent over the committee-reported bill. 
Now, the actual spending by the States, that is, the outlays, may be a little less than that. I hope not, but that amount is up to the Budget Committees and the Appropriations Committees. 
Where did we come up with this money? Well, it started with Senator Gramm's amendment last year, which transferred the 4.3-cent gasoline tax to the highway trust fund. That solved the first problem, namely putting that revenue in the Highway Trust Fund. But the second problem was that the Environment and Public Works Committee, which has jurisdiction over highways, could not increase the contract authority in order to spend that 4.3 cents without an agreement on the budget. 
I am pleased that the agreement we reached today allows most of the 4.3 cents, namely the 3.45 cents that goes to the highway account, to be spent on highways. So the agreement provides for an increase from $145 billion in contract authority in the committee bill, to $171 billion. There is an additional $2 billion that goes to safety programs under the jurisdiction of the Commerce Committee, for a total increase of $173 billion. 
This agreement is fair to all regions of the country. I know a lot of Senators were thinking, `What are those Senators doing in Senator Lott's office? What have they agreed to? Aren't they just taking care of their own States? And are they being fair to us, too?' The fact is that Senator Chafee and I made an extra effort since the committee reported the bill out last fall, to talk to Senators who have had specific concerns with the bill--and meritorious concerns, I might add. This agreement, which will be incorporated into a committee amendment tomorrow, by and large, addresses those concerns. 
Now, I cannot say it totally accommodates everybody. No amendment on highways can totally accommodate everybody. In fact, among the group that have been working on this agreement--Senator Gramm; myself; Senator Byrd; the leader; the chairman of our committee, Senator Chafee, certainly; and Senator Warner--each of us would have fashioned this agreement a little bit differently if left to our own devices. But when the Senators see what is in the amendment and reflect on it and on the competing interests of other Senators, I daresay they are going to realize that this is fair. I would like to also add what this agreement will mean to the economy. It will give it a big boost. The Department of Transportation statistics indicate that for every billion dollars in additional highway spending, there are 42,000 more jobs in 
America--a billion dollars equal 42,000 jobs. That is in addition to the benefits derived from relieving congestion and helping America's competitive place in the world with better transportation systems. Furthermore, there is investment in intelligent transportation systems, new technologies which are going to further improve our transportation capabilities. 
Let me add too that this agreement is within the budget. It is very important that this increase be within the budget, within budget caps. And I say that, Madam President, because this morning one of the newspapers had a headline, page 1, saying, in effect, `Uh-oh, there goes Congress again. It is going to bust the budget.' 
I appreciate the concern about busting the budget. I think all of us in the Senate do not want to break the budget caps or the provisions and the amounts that are in the budget. This amendment is consistent with the budget. We do not break the budget. It is true there is an increase in highway dollars as a consequence of this amendment, but it is also true that we are within the budget. 
Senator Domenici, the very able chairman of the Budget Committee was very clear: We have to live within the budget. And we do. 
I have the highest regard for him. He is a tough fighter. He is a very intelligent opponent. In fact, I learned a lot, Madam President, watching Senator Domenici, Senator Gramm, Senator Byrd, and Senator Chafee. And what I learned is not only how tough and intelligent and fair-minded they are, but how committed they are to the legislative process. At the end of the meeting we all said, `Hey, this is within the ballpark. It may not be perfect. Each of us would probably prefer to do it a little differently. But it's a good outcome for all.' 
I am, frankly, very honored to be a part of the process. I will not belabor the point, but Winston Churchill once said that--and let me paraphrase here, Democracy, with all of its delays and inefficiencies and faint starts, is absolutely the worst form of government, except there's none better. 
I think that the meetings we have been having over the last week or so are a good example of that. And I only hope now that we can get this adopted, finish with the highway bill, get on to conference, and, most importantly, put it on the President's desk so that all of our work will come to fruition. 
I thank all Senators.  
Mr. CAMPBELL addressed the Chair.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we all want to protect wetlands, and we know when highways are constructed that wetlands are often in jeopardy. It is in the law that when a highway is constructed which does jeopardize a wetland, an offset must be provided for; that is, the developer or the contractor has to find some other way to enhance or improve the wetland. 
This is another step in that direction. It is a step toward greater efficiency, namely, where someone may enhance, develop a wetland, get credit for it, and the contractor comes along and goes to the bank which already has the credit for the wetland. It is a much more efficient process for getting the job done. I compliment the Senator from Missouri for coming up with this idea. We accept the amendment.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join my good friend and colleague, the chairman of the Public Works Committee, Senator Chafee. We have been friends for many, many years, have been on the committee for many, many years, and here we are again with the highway bill. I compliment the chairman for his graciousness, his hard work, his dedication to public service. I think the citizens of Rhode Island already know this, but for those who may not know it, or are wondering, I would like, to them and the rest of the country, to say they could not have a finer Senator than Senator Chafee.

Mr. BAUCUS. I would also like at this point to thank our leader, Majority Leader Trent Lott, who has worked hard, particularly in the last several weeks, with various Senators, various groups, to assure we could bring this bill, the highway bill, the ISTEA bill, up earlier than it looked like would be the case. 
At the end of the last session of Congress, the leader indicated he would like to bring this bill up as one of the first orders of business in 1998. Other factors intervened and made that difficult, extremely difficult. But, through his hard work, he was able to work out a way to bring this up very soon. One main reason is because of the tremendous need in our country. The current highway program expired several months ago. It expired the end of September. We don't have a highway program. We did pass a short-term extension until the end of April--it expires April 30--but there are not many weeks left between now and April 30. It is, therefore, incumbent upon us to take up this bill early because it is so complex, there are so many Senators who have such interest; let alone Members of the House, the other body; let alone taking it to conference. Again, I tip my hat to the majority leader for bringing this up very quickly. 
The current ISTEA legislation, as I mentioned, expired the 30th of last September, and, as I mentioned, it means we are currently operating under a 6-month extension which expires May 1. I might say that is just 9 weeks from now. I might also say that after this May 1 date, States will no longer be able to obligate any Federal funds. That means we have to finish this bill very soon. By that I mean, after May 1 a State may not obligate, that is, may not contract, funds to contractors, to designers, for rights-of-way or whatever is part of the highway program. 
That is not true for other bills around here, other laws that are passed here in Congress as a general rule. Sometimes an authorizing program expires and the Congress appropriates dollars for the program. That is not the same for the highway program. The highway program has to be in place in order for States and highway departments to contract dollars to people in their States to build highways. 
Since it has been a little while since we debated this bill, I would like to just add a few points to those made by the chairman of our committee, Senator Chafee. I want to begin by saying that we have tremendous infrastructure needs in our country. It's a big, fancy term, infrastructure. It's roads, highways, it's telephone lines and power lines--all of the basic structure that is the foundation for the rest of the country to operate on. You just can't let it deteriorate. 
Other countries spend more on infrastructure than we do, more on a per capita basis of their gross domestic product. Japan, for example, spends about four times what we do on infrastructure per capita; Germany spends a couple of times more than we do per capita. I might say that the Germans spend a lot of money on their highway program, and a lot of it goes into research. They have researched highways so much, when you build a highway in Germany now it lasts forever, virtually. They have a whole new technology, ways to bring their highways up to date. They spend a lot more on research and development than we do. We are a bigger country. We have to spend the dollars on our roads. 
Once we spend more dollars on our highway programs, it will go a long way, obviously, to reduce congestion. There are more cars every year, not fewer. This will also help increase highway safety. It will mitigate the impacts of transportation on the environment. 
Some people think of this only as a highway bill. This 
isn't only a highway bill. There are lots of other parts of this bill, and one of them is it helps improve the air quality in our country. The bill will also improve our mobility, our efficiency as a nation. That's a cost of doing business. A businessman knows, a company knows, the more efficient the transportation system, the more he or she is able to reduce the costs of doing business. So it's not just pleasure. It's not just convenience. It's a matter of doing business. 
The bill also increases the dollars for research and for the deployment of new transportation technologies. That is very important as we move into the next millennium. 
Some may ask, why is transportation so important? I have given some very obvious reasons already, but let me just amplify them a little bit. Transportation really affects us every day. Certainly when we get in our cars and drive, if we get in a taxicab, or try to move from one place to another, it very much does affect our quality of life. It also means investment. It means jobs. Over 42,000 jobs are created for every $1 billion of Federal spending. Stop and think about that for a moment. Mr. President, 42,000 jobs in America are created for each $1 billion of Federal spending. And most of those jobs are good-paying jobs. They are operating engineers, or they are laborers, they are with companies making the asphalt, concrete, highway resurfacing aggregate--those are good jobs. That's income. It helps our economy. 
Transportation and related industries employ almost 10 million people overall each year. Again, transportation and related industries employ about 10 million people every year. Transportation is one of the largest sectors of our economy; about 11 percent of gross domestic product. There are only three other sectors that have a higher percentage of our national gross domestic product; that's housing, that's health care, and that's food. Highway ranks No. 4. 
In addition to the economic implications of transportation investments, we cannot overlook the impact of our quality of life. The United States has the largest transportation system in the world. We enjoy the premier system of highways: a 45,000-mile interstate system; about 4 million miles of other roads. 
To put that in perspective, these 4 million miles of roads in the United States would circle the Earth 157 times. Just think about it, 4 million miles of basic roads in the U.S. would circle the Earth 157 times. In a population of about 265 million, our people drive over 2.4 trillion miles each year on these highways. 
I was trying to think of an example of what 2.4 trillion really means. It is such a staggeringly high number. No example immediately comes to mind, but if people just stop and think a little bit, we are not talking about millions, not billions, but trillions, 2.4 trillion miles each year on our highways. 
Obviously, it causes us to repair them more. They get more beat up by trucks and cars. Some roads in our part of the country, Mr. President, thaw, freeze, thaw and freeze again. They get cracks in the pavement and fill with water and freeze again. They get bigger and cars and trucks pound on them. It is a problem. 
Not only does it cause highway repair bills for our cars, but it causes us to rattle our teeth a little bit and utter a few words about our highways, roads and potholes. The Transportation Department estimates that we need about $54 billion every year just to maintain our current highway system --$54 billion every year just to maintain. If we want to spend $74 billion a year, we could improve our system. That is the needs assessment of the Department of Transportation, $54 billion to maintain. If we want to improve our system to a level that makes sense for America, it would be about $74 billion. I must say, at all levels--State, local and Federal--we spend about $34 billion a year. So just to maintain the current level, it would cost $54 billion. If we want a premier system, it would be $74 billion. But we in America spend not $54 billion to maintain to stay even, we spend $34 billion. That is a total of Federal, State and local spending on our highway system. 
That means we are challenged in the Congress to come up with legislation that is very efficient, that does what it can with what we have. 
I think this bill does that. It is not perfect. No legislation is perfect. We are 100 Senators; we are not one. We have to compromise. Again, I think this is a good compromise. Why? 
First, it builds on the successes of its predecessor, the highway bill, otherwise known as ISTEA of 1991. That was authored by my good friend and colleague from New York, Senator Moynihan, in the Senate. That was a landmark piece of legislation because it recognized the intermodal nature of transportation in America, much more than previous highway bills, and how connected we are for a more fluid flow of traffic and commerce and people, more of a seamless system. 
Our transportation system is more intermodal now. Also, State and local governments will be able to choose transportation projects that meet their diverse needs. We are one country, but we are also 50 States with many, many localities. This legislation gives local municipalities more control in making decisions for themselves. No longer are we restricted in our mode of transportation. States can build highways, transit facilities, bike paths. Different communities certainly over the last 2, 3, 4 years have been more and more interested in, the fancy term is enhancements, but basically it is more concretely things like bike paths, pedestrian walkways. Again, that is a local decision hopefully covered enough in this bill. 
It also continues, as I said, along that path, no pun intended. We have some improvements, and I think we will be able to have even more improvements, that is, even more dollars added to this bill in the next several days. 
Let me talk a little bit about what we have attempted to do to make this bill more efficient and user friendly. The current highway program, again the fancy term is ISTEA, has about 11 categories from which dollars are taken to spend on various projects, whether it is interstate maintenance or whether it is interstate construction enhancement, bridges, whatnot. We have reduced those 11 categories down to five. 
They are: the Interstate National Highway System, that is one category; the Surface Transportation Program; the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Program; and then two other equity accounts essentially to make this all fit. Yet, we have maintained the integrity of ISTEA. 
What do I mean by that? Six years ago, Congress declared the end of the interstate era. Essentially, the interstate system had been completed. We are now in the process of combining the interstates with other key, most important primary highways in our country. We call that the National Highway System, or NHS. This National Highway System is a system of 
about 170,000 miles of roads and bridges, and they carry the vast majority of our traffic--commercial and passenger. These are the roads which provide access to rural and urban areas. They are the ones that connect farms to markets and homes to jobs. Mr. President, 170,000 miles, that is the interstate system, plus the other major highways in our country. 
This legislation before us today recognizes the important role of that National Highway System and its key component the interstate system. Under the bill, about $12 billion a year will be spent on the National Highway System and at least half of that, about $6 billion, will be spent to maintain the interstate system of roads and bridges. 
While we have eliminated the current bridge program, and I won't get into details except to say a lot of communities have abused the current bridge program; that is, they say they need all this money for bridges and then they take the money and don't spend it on bridges but spend it on something else. Obviously, we want to reduce that dodge but yet maintain the quality of our bridges. So we have folded the current bridge program into other categories. States will receive about $4.2 billion under certain bridge apportionment factors, and they will be required to spend at least what they are spending on bridges today. This will help ensure improvements in the conditions of our bridges. 
The second category, the Surface Transportation Program, is retained. That is a very flexible funding category. It is very important to give State highway commissions flexibility because, after all, they know what their needs are. This STP, Surface Transportation Program, provides this flexibility for all kinds of transportation projects from new construction to improvements in current highways, just to name a couple examples. 
In addition to this second program, Surface Transportation Program can be used for bike paths or pedestrian walkways or transit capital projects, transportation enhancement projects, rail highway crossing safety improvements, hazard elimination projects--again, a lot of flexibility to the highway commissions. 
We also maintain a very important program to improve air quality and reduce congestion around the country. That program is called the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Program, otherwise known as CMAQ. This program provides dollars to nonattainment areas so they can undertake projects to improve their air quality. 
What does that mean? Mr. President, as you well know, under the Clean Air Act that was passed in 1991, certain regions and certain cities of our country are `not in attainment' of air quality standards which they are working toward. We want to make sure that the highway program doesn't make attainment or air quality worse, because sometimes if you have a lot more traffic in a certain city that is having a hard time meeting its level of air quality, that is going to make it even more difficult for that community to meet air quality standards. We are trying to figure how to work the two together. 
The solution, as in last year's bill, is the CMAQ Program. States then will use these dollars on certain projects that help reduce congestion in certain areas, therefore, to help that community meet its air quality requirements. 
I must say, the past 6 years have demonstrated terrific benefits which CMAQ has contributed to many areas reaching attainment. It has helped areas reach attainment and helped reduce traffic flows and reduce congestion. Most important, we have updated the formulas. These factors are much more current in helping calculate what a State will receive. The bill recognizes the diverse transportation needs of our country, from large southern States to donor States to the densely populated Northeast. The bill uses transportation factors and measures the extent of the use of the highway system. 
Use of these factors ensures that the funding is directed to the States based upon their need for highway funding. Just as a sidelight, I must say that the last ISTEA bill, the one we are operating under, uses very dated data. It is based on the 1980 census, for example, even though it was a 1991 bill. The ISTEA program, when it was passed in 1991, used the 1980 census data. It also uses 1916 postal roads requirements. There is a lot in there that doesn't make sense for 1998 and particularly as we move into the next century. 
So we have used and changed the formulas, brought them up to date based upon the needs of a State. Just as transit program formulas measure ridership in the extent of an area's transit system, it only makes sense that highway formulas do the same. That is what we have done in this bill. 
In addition to providing funding to improve infrastructure, the bill before us today also pays for more research, more development of new transportation technologies. We are not saying we are as up to date and as fancy with new technologies on our highway system as the Internet is with all the advances in computer technology, but we are developing intelligent transportation systems--shorthand ITS technologies--that will help increase the capacity of existing transportation systems without having to add new lanes and make this more 
efficient with the use of technologies and increase safety on our roads with new technology. 
An example I might give is transponders on cars which could read the ownership and the distance a car is traveling going through a toll so you don't have to stop and pay the toll every time. 
In addition to that, in my State of Montana, and I know yours, too, Mr. President, in Colorado, sometimes we drive along and there are deer and elk on the road ahead, livestock in my State. Sometimes in the southern part of the State we have bison on the road, or winter range. We are developing technology to warn cars ahead of time that there is livestock on the road, there is bison, deer and elk on the road. It is not fully developed, but it is an example of the kind of things we are working on just to help improve and update our highways. 
Let me sum up by saying that I think this bill is very balanced. It passed the committee by a unanimous vote. It is a fair bill. It is good for the country and for our future, and I think it is very important we begin work today so we can meet our May 1 deadline. 
I strongly urge Senators who have amendments, and under the agreement we are operating right now, as you know, we are providing only for nonfunding amendments; that is, amendments that don't deal with money in the bill, and there are a lot of them. So I ask Senators who have those amendments to come to the floor now today because we all know that when we get up to the deadline--a weekend--that things get pretty tight. It is far better to bring your amendments up earlier than later if you want them to be considered, otherwise they will not be fully considered and will go down the drain most likely. 
Mr. President, I also want to mention and give tremendous credit to the Senator from Virginia, Senator Warner, chairman of the transportation subcommittee of our full committee. 
He has worked very, very hard. He has many, many responsibilities around here with everything under the Sun, frankly, yet he has diligently, with his staff, worked to come up with this compromise, and I might say, also, with tremendous grace and style and class. And it has been a real pleasure to work with the Senator from Virginia. 
In addition, we are here today in large part, Mr. President, because of the efforts of Senator Byrd, from West Virginia, and Senator Gramm, from Texas. There was a problem as to whether--we did not know whether we were going to get this bill up before the budget bill. But Senators Byrd and Gramm have offered an amendment. It is very simple. The amendment is not before us now. It is part of the matrix of this whole highway bill. 
It is a very simple amendment which says, essentially, of the 4.3 cents of Federal gasoline taxes, which we last year transferred from general revenue into the highway trust fund, that money should also be spent back on highway programs, at least that portion dedicated to highways. 
That is the amendment. And because of that amendment, and because of the urgency of making sure that our motorists in our States get what they pay in taxes, we are here now today, before the budget resolution is before us, and again it is Senator Byrd and Senator Gramm who in large part are responsible, in addition to the leader and Senator Warner and others as to why we are here. 
So I close, Mr. President, because I see my good friend, Senator Warner, standing over here ready to speak. And I thank him for what he has done.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to once again make the case for comprehensive campaign finance reform. 
Today, the Senate has a great opportunity. The McCain-Feingold legislation is a step in the direction of campaign finance reform. Make no mistake, despite what anyone here tells you today, the American campaign finance system is broken. And the American people know it. 
Spending in all levels of federal campaigns--from Congress to the Senate all the way to the White House--increased from 1992 to 1996 by over $700 million. With all that money, people should have known the issues better, and had a clear sense of the candidates. They should have received a comprehensive and well funded message why their involvement in the political process was crucial. All that money helped increase voter participation, right? 
Wrong. Spending increased by $700 million and fewer people voted. Down from 55 percent in 1992 to 48 percent in 1996. Less than half of the American populace voted and some in Congress want to say the system is fine, everything is okay. 
Mr. President, the American campaign finance system is not okay. Over and over Americans tell pollsters, elected officials, and their neighbors that the system needs major repair. People are becoming more and more cynical about government. People tell me they think that Congress cares more about `fat cat special interests in Washington' than the concerns of middle class families like theirs. Or they tell me they think the political system is corrupt. 
I have simple tests on which to base my support of versions of campaign finance reform. First, it must be strong enough to encourage the majority if not all candidates for federal office to participate. 
Second, it must contain the spiraling cost of campaign spending in this country. Finally, and most importantly, it must control the increasing flow of undisclosed and unreported `soft-money' that is polluting our electoral system. 
McCain-Feingold is not perfect. I have a long track record of voting for bills that go further. I have voted for bills that took a closer look at PACS, increased FEC enforcement capabilities, and regulated both hard and soft money. But McCain-Feingold is a start. 
I support this legislation because I believe it represents the right kind of change. While not a perfect solution, it will help put our political process back where it belongs: with the people. And it will take power away from the wealthy special interests that all too often call the shots in our political system. 
WHAT'S RIGHT WITH THE BILL 
While I must admit this bill is not perfect, it will take several crucial actions to reign in campaign spending. First, this is the first bi-partisan approach to campaign finance reform in more than a decade. 
Second, the bill establishes a system that does not rely on taxpayer funds to work effectively. 
The McCain-Feingold substitute would prohibit all soft money contributions to the national political parties from corporations, labor unions, and wealthy individuals. 
The bill offers real, workable enforcement and accountability standards. Like lowering the reporting threshold for campaign contributions from $200 to $50. It increases penalties for knowing and willful violations of FEC law. And the bill requires political advertisements to carry a disclaimer, identifying who is responsible for the content of the campaign ad. 
Let me spend a moment discussing the Paycheck Protection Act. Mr. President, I oppose cloture on this bill today because it simply doesn't go far enough. Instead of comprehensively reforming campaign finance laws, it does very little. It doesn't deal with soft money, or PACS, or the costs of campaigns. Nor does it help to identify negative, attack ads that do nothing for the process except to drag it down. 
Instead, the majority alternative attempts to regulate only union contributions, a clear case of political payback. I believe we should look at union contributions, Mr. President, if we also look at corporations, non-profits, and independent expenditures. But just targeting one piece to the puzzle won't solve the problem. That's why I will vote to oppose this measure. 
To close, Mr. President, America needs and wants campaign finance reform. The Senate should pass comprehensive legislation right now. Let's be clear of our goal today: we must ensure that political campaigns are a contest of ideas, not a contest of money. We need to return elections to the citizens of states like Montana and allow them to make their own decisions, rather than letting rich Washington DC groups run attack campaigns designed to do nothing but drag down a candidate. 
I remain committed to this cause and will do everything in my power to ensure that the Congress passes meaningful Campaign Finance Reform, this year.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the important campaign finance reform legislation that is before us today. 
Today very wealthy special interest groups can pump unlimited amounts of money into a political campaign. In fact, one individual or group can attempt to buy an election. After this bill passes, that will not longer be true. This is the one reform that will do the most to give an ordinary person an equal say in who they send to Congress. 
I support this legislation because I believe it represents the right kind of change. While not a perfect solution, it will help put our political process back where it belongs: with the people. And it will take power away from the wealthy special interests that all too often call the shots in our political system. 
Let's be clear of our goal today: we must ensure that political campaigns are a contest of ideas, not a contest of money. We need to return elections to the citizens of states like Montana and allow them to make their own decisions, rather than letting rich Washington, DC groups run attack campaigns designed to do nothing but drag down a candidate. 
Yet, ironically, by failing to act; by failing to pass this legislation; we will also be opening the door to change--the wrong kind of change. Our political system will continue to drift in the dangerous direction of special interests. 
Since the 1970s, when Congress last enacted campaign finance reform, special interest groups supporting both political parties have found creative new ways, some of questionable legality, to get around the intent of our campaign finance laws. Things like soft money, independent expenditures, and political action committees all came about as a consequence of well-intended campaign finance reforms.

Mr. BAUCUS. I join my colleague in congratulating our friend, Senator Specter from Pennsylvania, on his 68th birthday. I have watched Senator Specter over the years, and I can say I do not think there is a Senator with a finer legal mind than the Senator from Pennsylvania, particularly from a criminal law perspective, constitutional law perspective, and a prosecutorial perspective as a former prosecutor in Pennsylvania. 
He brings to this body tremendous experience and tremendous judgment. And I join my colleague in wishing our colleague from Pennsylvania the very best returns on his 68th birthday.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my colleagues, to urge the Senate to begin the debate on the ISTEA reauthorization bill. 
That is important for a number of reasons, that I will get to in a moment. But first let me comment on why we find ourselves in this position. 
As my colleagues know, the current ISTEA legislation expired on September 30th of last year. 
The Environment and Public Works Committee, under the leadership of our chairman Senator Chafee and our subcommittee chairman Senator Warner, reported the 6-year reauthorization bill on October 1. 
About that same time, the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee reported a stop gap 6-month extension. Unfortunately, as we all recall, the Senate bill got caught up in an unrelated debate over campaign finance reform. 
So, regrettably, last session ended with the Congress--both House and Senate--unable to complete action on a long-term bill to reauthorize this important legislation. The best we could do was to extend the funding until May 1 of this year. 
Now, there is plenty of blame to go around for this unfortunate situation. Whether it was the failure to invoke cloture, or the filling of the amendment tree, which prevented Senators from offering amendments, there were lots of reasons for our failure last year. 
But that was then, and this is now. And the plain fact is that pointing fingers at one another about what did, or did not, happen last year will not help us move a reauthorization bill this year. 
So let us stop blaming one another for last year and let us start figuring out how to get the ISTEA legislation reauthorized quickly this year. 
Now, Mr. President, let me talk about why we need to move quickly with ISTEA. The simple fact is that without quick action, highway projects, safety programs, and transit projects will begin to lose the ability to meet our country's transportation needs. 
Already State highway officials tell us that they are beginning to delay projects. Why should this be so? 
Why are States slowing down, or stopping, some projects--even though there are still 42 days of funding left until the May 1st deadline? 
The reason is that most highway projects take a long time to complete. It is not unusual for even relatively simple projects to take three, four or five years to finish. Sometimes even more. And complicated or controversial projects, such as the Central Artery in Boston, can take a decade or two to go from conception to completion. 
In the highway business, you don't start a project unless you know you will have the funds to complete it. 
After all, these projects cannot be turned on and turned off like a faucet. Doing so wreaks havoc on the construction itself, on the neighborhood, on traffic congestion, and so on. 
Because these projects extend over many years, they require a certainty in funding that extends over a comparable period. That is why highway bills need to last for several years. ISTEA ran for 6 years. The Senate-reported bill also lasts for 6 years. This time provides a good sense of stability to the financing of projects and allows states and communities to plan their transportation programs efficiently. 
But a short-term extension gives you uncertainty, not stability. Especially for large projects, if states cannot assure that Federal matching funds will be available to finish it, they won't even start it. So they delay projects, even if there may be a few weeks of funding left. 
At the end of my remarks, I will list a few of the States that are beginning to delay projects. I hope my colleagues will pay close attention to it. Because the longer we delay a reauthorization bill, the longer this list will grow. 
Now, let me talk for a few minutes about how the highway program works on the ground. And the process I will describe is essentially the same in every State. 
Each project normally has three distinct stages--planning, development, and construction. Each stage can last from weeks to years, depending on the specific project. The charts I have here today focus on the project development stage, that is, the process of taking a project proposed by local government and getting it ready for construction. 
As my colleagues can see, it is not simple. A highway project goes through a very complicated process. 
The chart on my right shows the first phase--the `survey phase'. 
This is the part of a project where State Departments of Transportation do such things as prepare for public hearings; begin to draft environmental documents; collect soil samples; begin preliminary engineering; assess traffic noise impacts; begin subsurface utility relocation; and assess wetlands and water quality impacts. 
The second chart, on my left, shows the `design phase'. Here, States must prepare the design documents for a project. These documents include traffic access plans; wetland mitigation plans; review of soil samples for hazardous materials; and applications for water quality permits. 
Of course, it also includes preparation of final construction drawings, route alignments, schedules of materials, and the like. 
The third chart covers the `right-of-way' phase. In this phase, States prepare the final environmental documents; determine where rights-of-way must be acquired; determine utility relocations; determine final traffic access controls; obtain wetlands permits; and review all of the documents from the previous design phase. 
And as I said before, all this must be done before one shovelfull of dirt is turned. 
Now, Mr. President, I explain this process to my colleagues so that they can begin to understand the complicated nature of the highway program. Every project in every State must go through this type of process. In Montana, we have over 450 projects going through it. In States with larger transportation budgets, there can be as many as 1,500 projects in the pipeline. 
No project can be ready to go to construction if it has been held up at any point in the development process. And States will not obligate funds to prepare a project for construction if they are uncertain they will actually be able to construct it at some point. 
For some projects that are large and complicated, the project development process can be longer than others. But the typical development time for a major construction project can range from five to seven years. That is, it can take five to seven years for a project to reach the point that it is ready for construction. 
Once a project is ready for construction, States must still advertise the project--which can take 3 to 4 weeks. Then States must receive bids, open the bids and award the contracts. That can take an additional 4 weeks. And workers, equipment and materials must be mobilized and brought to the construction site. More time. 
Finally, there is the time spent on actual construction. 
With such a complicated, time consuming process, it is important that Members of the Senate understand that even brief interruptions during project development can cascade into lengthy delays in construction. 
That is why the ISTEA bill runs for six years, to give the States some assurance they will not face wasteful delays and disruptions caused by funding uncertainties. That is also why a short-term extension, or worse, a series of short term extensions, is so disruptive. 
I have heard many Members ask `what does it matter if we wait until late March or April to do this bill?'. I hope that once Members and staff become more familiar with this program, that will be a simple answer. 
If we wait to begin the debate until `later', this bill will not be done by the May 1st deadline. That means more projects will be delayed. It means thousands of workers will lose jobs. And I am afraid that such job losses will begin to happen soon. 
I have heard of one contractor who plans to lay off his construction workers on May 1st and will not rehire them until at least 30 days after the final conference report is agreed to. 
That same contractor will not be placing any orders with his suppliers until 45 to 60 days after a new bill is in place because he is uncertain he will have construction contracts to work on. And I am confident there are more contractors throughout the country making the same business decision. 
Mr. President, the hardworking Americans who lose their jobs because of these delays will do so through no fault of their own. These folks will be ready to show up for work every day and do a good job. And yet they will be told they must find other work because Congress couldn't resolve its differences and get the ISTEA bill reauthorized in time. 
Every State will feel this pain. Yes, some will hurt more than others. But every State will have to delay projects. 
As I mentioned earlier in my remarks, some States have already listed the projects that will most likely be delayed if a reauthorization bill is not signed into law by May 1st. These are real projects. 
These are projects that communities were counting on. These are projects that are important for the safety and mobility of drivers and pedestrians and to relieve congestion in these States. 
The States that have already made plans to delay projects include: Kentucky, South Dakota, Maine, Wyoming, Georgia, Nevada, Texas, Missouri, Oklahoma, Indiana, New Hampshire, Indiana, North Dakota and Utah. 
More States are expected to announce their plans soon. 
Mr. President, let's not treat the reauthorization of ISTEA as a political football. The consequences for all of our States are very real. For those Senators who doubt the impacts, I simply ask that they call their State Department of Transportation. Ask them what they plan to do in the coming weeks. I can assure you that it will not be good news. 
So we have a very important job to do--to reauthorize ISTEA. Let's get to it. 
I stand ready to work with the Majority Leader, with Senator Daschle, with my committee leadership, with Senators Byrd and Gramm, with the Budget Committee and all my colleagues to find a way to bring this bill up as soon as possible.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Senator from North Dakota is much too kind in his compliments of this Senator. The real credit goes to the Senator from North Dakota. We have seen many task forces appointed by various leaders on both sides of the aisle. I think we know that most task forces basically do their work. They meet, they have several meetings, and are earnest in trying to come up with a good solution assigned to them by the leader. 
In this case, the Senator from North Dakota added new meaning to the definition of task force. First of all, they tasked; they worked very hard. I have not seen any effort since the days I have been in the Senate where a task force, a group worked so hard at so many meetings, called in so many outside experts in such a wide variety of fields to make sure they came up with a very solid, comprehensive, near bullet-proof proposal in an area that is as complicated as this, whether it is taxation issues, whether it is health issues, whether it is judicial issues, whatever they may be. 
All of us who have any knowledge of the degree to which the Senator from North Dakota put this group together salute him. I have never seen anybody work as hard, as diligently and come up with such a fine product as the Senator from North Dakota. I hope that future task forces use his as a model, because if they do, the people of our country will be very, very well served, just as the Senator from North Dakota's task force has served America with his efforts and his work. He has done the best job of any Senator I have ever seen on any kind of task force or group effort trying to come up with a solution to a very complicated problem. Again, I salute him. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following letters of support for the Healthy Kids Act be submitted into the Record following my remarks.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to reauthorize programs within the Economic Development Administration. It is with great pleasure that I am joined by my colleagues, Senators Snowe, Lieberman, Kempthorne, Daschle, Dodd, Durbin, Lautenberg, Collins, Johnson, and Kennedy. 
Mr. President, programs under the jurisdiction of the Economic Development Administration have not been reauthorized for almost two decades. Despite the uncertainty and instability this has created, EDA has become the cornerstone for efforts to strengthen and diversify the economies of our nation's communities. 
Since its inception in 1965, the EDA has established an impressive track record of helping communities help themselves. These `bootstrap' efforts have allowed communities to meet economic challenges in a variety of ways--making public works improvements to attract new businesses and providing technical assistance and planning grants that allow a community to plan for their future for example. 
In my home state of Montana, EDA has been a powerful force in responding to the changing economic conditions in communities that have relied on one industry--only to see that industry shut down and move away. EDA's planning and public works assistance has allowed these communities to attract new companies, retain companies already in place and diversify their economies. 
EDA has also been instrumental in responding to and assisting areas affected by natural disasters. In Florida and Louisiana, EDA was there to help businesses affected by the devastation of Hurricane Andrew. And EDA is still working with those areas of the Midwest devastated by the disastrous floods of 1993 and those areas recently impacted by floods in the Pacific Northwest. 
The programs within the EDA have become even more critical to Congress' efforts to alleviate and address job losses due to the closure and realignment of military bases around the country. 
The EDA's programs are effective tools that are used on the local level--working hand-in-hand with local governments and businesses to develop future economic investment strategies. By acting as a catalyst, economic development funds are used to attract significant private contributions and support. 
Despite efforts to dismantle the EDA, the agency has matured in its approach to local economic development efforts. But the lack of authorization has not allowed Congress to make necessary changes to the statute and mission of the EDA. As with any program, there are some areas that are working well and other areas that need to be refined. The lack of authorization has left some aspects of EDA's programs outdated or unnecessary. That is why I am introducing this bill today--a bill to streamline and advance EDA's successful programs. 
Mr. President, our country is faced with many challenges. Many of our communities are in economic transition and need to strengthen the diversity of their economies. We need to reauthorize EDA. It is high time we recognize the important role that EDA plays in the future of this country. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the Congressional Record, along with a brief section-by-section.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce a Bill that would provide the Secretary of the Interior with the authority to exchange oil and gas leases in the Badger Two-Medicine area, in the State of Montana, for credits that could be applied toward bidding or royalty payments in Montana and the Gulf of Mexico. 
The area involved in this legislation is located along the Rocky Mountain Front, an area whose rich natural beauty I care deeply about. It lies south of one of the `Crown Jewels' of the National Park system, Glacier National Park. Also adjoining this area is the Blackfeet Indian Reservation and the uniquely wild and pristine Bob Marshall Wilderness Area. The Badger Two-Medicine area is undeveloped wilderness and contains many sites sacred to the Blackfeet Nation. The location of this area, its cultural value, and its undeveloped natural condition has been the focus of the decade-long debate over whether or not the oil and gas resources of the area should be developed. I myself believe that we should protect this special place for our children and grandchildren, and I have fought to do just that. 
We are no closer today to resolving the question of development of the resources of this area than we were a decade ago and it is time to resolve these conflicts. During this time the ten leaseholders in the area have made investments in anticipation of being able to exercise the option of developing wells under their leases. The time has come to break this stalemate that only costs the leaseholders, the citizens concerned with protecting the area, and the government time and money without resolution. The bill that I am introducing today is fair for the landowners, the citizens of Montana and the Nation, and fair for the leaseholders. 
Chevron, the largest leaseholder in the area, stated `While we would have liked to have developed our well in the Badger Two-Medicine area, we understand that the public had concerns about our proposal. Senator Baucus' bill breaks the deadlock and allows everyone to get on with their business'. 
Today I am introducing this legislation, a common sense solution to a long-standing controversy, to allow all the parties to leave this dispute as winners. The Secretary of the Interior would work with leaseholders, who have made investments over the years, to determine credits for their expenses. These credits, allowing for reinvestment in Montana, can be applied to lease bids or royalty payments in other locations where they already have active wells or where development is more likely to occur. The citizens who are concerned about the cultural and resource effects of development would see the integrity of this area maintained. The government would be able to refocus the use of its limited financial resources on management activities that have a more direct positive result than continuation of the current disputes. 
This bill focuses on resolving Montana problems while looking out for the economic and natural resource interests of this State. Creating and maintaining jobs in Montana is very important to me. This bill helps save jobs. As Richard Jackson, owner of an outfitting business in the Badger Two-Medicine recently said, `This bill isn't just about saving some of our most precious wildlands; it's about saving our wildlands and Montana jobs'. Montana has a unique recreational industry that has sustainable jobs that are dependent on wild untamed lands. We need to care for this wildness. I look forward to continuing work with the Governor and the Montana Delegation on innovative ideas to stimulate appropriate development of the State's rich mineral heritage while protecting its wildness and uncomparable natural beauty. 
I encourage my esteemed colleagues to support this bill and look forward to working with them in their consideration.

Mr. BAUCUS. I might inform the Members there is a process. It is the Environment and Public Works Committee. If this bill had been referred to the proper committee, we would have gone through the proper process. That committee has jurisdiction over public buildings. We have rules as to naming and when not to name buildings after whom and under what circumstances. There is a process. One of the problems with this whole procedure here today is the process was skirted. The process wasn't used. 
Mr. President, this is a very difficult issue for me, but I am going to be voting against the underlying bill basically because I do not think we should displace George Washington, our Founding Father, with what we might be doing here, and a whole host of other reasons which I do not have time to get into. 
There is a process. We are not following it.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, earlier today this body passed legislation to rename Washington National Airport to the Ronald Reagan National Airport. I rise today to express my opposition to that legislation. My opposition is in no way meant to dishonor President Reagan. Recently, we have named the nation's second largest federal building after President Reagan and have named a Nimitz-class aircraft carrier after him as well. Clearly, Ronald Reagan accomplished a great deal during his Presidency, and he deserves to be recognized for that contribution to our country. 
However, I do not believe that we should seek to honor President Reagan by diminishing the honor that we have bestowed upon President George Washington when we named the Washington National Airport--truly one of our nation's greatest founding fathers. Mr. President, I recently finished reading a biography of George Washington. I recommend everyone in this body do so also. It is important to remember and recognize the many contributions that he made to this country. For it is largely through his efforts that the United States is a world leader in every sense of the word. 
Because of his leadership, the thirteen individual colonies united to become the United States--a sovereign, independent nation. 
After the Revolutionary War, George Washington took a lead role in crafting our constitution and in the campaign for its ratification. The success of Washington's campaign was assured by 1797, at the end of his second presidential term, and his legacy continues to be the basis of law today. 
President Washington acted with Congress to establish the first great executive departments and to lay the foundations of the modern federal judiciary. He directed the creation of a diplomatic service. Three presidential and five congressional elections carried the new government, under the Constitution, through its initial trials. 
His policies procured adequate revenue for the national government and supplied the country with a sound currency, a well-supported public credit, and an efficient network of national banks. 
Above all, he conferred on the presidency a prestige so great that political leaders afterward esteemed it the highest distinction to occupy the chair he had honored. His work and leadership as President is a benchmark by which we should measure all those who serve in that high office. 
Most of the work that engaged Washington had to be achieved through people. President Washington found that success depended on their cooperation and that they would do best if they had faith in causes and leaders. To gain and hold their approval were among his foremost objectives. He thought of people, in the main, as right-minded and dependable, and he believed that a leader should make the best of their good qualities. 
As a national leader he upheld the right of everyone to freedom of worship and equality before the law, condemning all forms of bigotry, intolerance, discrimination, and persecution. 
Throughout his public life, Washington contended with obstacles and difficulties. His courage and resolution steadied him in danger, just as defeat steeled his will. His devotion to his country and his faith in its cause sustained him. Averse to harsh measures, he was generous in victory. `His integrity,' wrote Thomas Jefferson, `was the most pure, his justice the most inflexible I have ever known. He was, indeed, in every sense of the word, a wise, a good, and a great man.' 
Therefore, Mr. President, despite the respect and admiration I have for President Reagan, I cannot in good conscience support a bill which will diminish the great contributions President George Washington has made to our nation. 
I yield the floor, Mr. President.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise, with all due respect, to ask the majority leader to reconsider the schedule which he has set so that we take up the Intermodal Surface Transportation Act, otherwise known as ISTEA, right away rather than deferring it as presently seems to be the case. I say this because our States, contractors, all of our people who depend on highways, very much depend upon the Congress to reauthorize the highway bill. Unfortunately, we have yet to do that. 
The current program, as we know, expired last year on September 30. However, despite the fact that the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee favorably reported a six-year reauthorization in October, neither the full Senate or the House considered it. Instead, we were forced to pass a temporary, stopgap, 6-month extension, which expires May 1. 
Mr. President, if the current schedule holds, that is, if the highway bill is not brought up until after the budget resolution, there is a strong possibility that Congress may not pass a highway bill until shortly before it adjourns this year, which is in October. 
That result would be totally unacceptable. It would be unacceptable to our people, to our contractors, and to our highway workers. And it would be unacceptable to me. Frankly, it would not be a responsible way to conduct our Nation's business. Senators should understand just how long it takes a State highway commission and contractors to plan these projects. It certainly requires months and in many cases it takes years. Furthermore, State legislatures must set their budgets so they can come up with the funds to match the Federal highway funds. This takes time, especially if a legislature meets once every two years. Transportation projects are not something you just turn on and turn off like a spigot. Our current course is very disruptive. 
All this is critically important because States cannot obligate funds for highways unless obligation authority is provided by law. Our current 6-month extension expires May 1. After May 1, States will be unable to enter into contracts for their highway programs. That will bring hundreds of projects to a stop, with the resulting loss of jobs. 
We might ask, Why doesn't Congress pass another short-term extension? First, that is an on-again-off-again way of doing business. No business would operate like that. And government shouldn't either. We are playing with people's livelihoods if we continue this `on-again-off-again,' strategy by passing a series of short term extensions. 
Second, there is no guarantee that Congress can easily pass another short-term extension. That's because it would probably take unanimous consent in the Senate so that we limit amendments. We know some states like the current formula and others like the new formula. As we get closer to the election, it will be increasingly difficult to get Senators to refrain from offering amendments to change the formula. I'm sure most of my colleagues can appreciate how incredibly difficult it would be to quickly pass another simple extension under those circumstances. And even if we could, it would be continuing a bad on-again-off-again policy. 
We have only 49 days in session until May 1. The bill is going to take a couple or three weeks in the Senate. The House must pass its version of the bill. Then we have to go to conference. That is a lot to do in just 49 days. So it is all the more reason to start as soon as we can in the Senate. 
Furthermore, we don't have a lot of business before us right now. There is nothing that is so urgent, except the highway bill. The highway bill is urgent. It is just common sense that if something is both important and urgent, we should be devoting our attention to it. Well, the ISTEA legislation is both urgent and important. We should take it up now, not later. 
I know the majority leader has lots of competing considerations here. One is the budget and how to handle the expected surplus. Should we pay off the debt? Lower taxes? Increase spending for priority programs? Secure Social Security and Medicare? Invest in our transportation infrastructure? I understand the argument that some are making: Let's put the highway bill off so we do it all together, all at once. The problem with that is very simple, it means we will probably not have a highway bill until September. And in the meantime, we will be hamstrung with formula fights and other issues on short-term extensions. As I said before, we all know the closer we get to the end of this year, to elections, the more difficult it is because then the formula fights among States become more real. 
I think there are ways to work this out. Basically, we have to sit down with people on both sides of the argument here and find some way to resolve this to get the highway bill up. 
I also might add that this is not just a highway bill. It is a mass transit bill. For those people in our country who live in the more populated States where mass transit is more important than it is in more rural States like Montana where I come from, they must know the transit legislation is an integral part of the ISTEA bill. 
Mr. President, how much time do I have?

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, it is highways that are being postponed; it is transit being postponed; it is all the safety programs that are in the highway bill that are being postponed; it is the intermodal connections. My friend Senator Moynihan is the father of the ISTEA bill. All his good work will be on hold until we can reauthorize the program. Senator Dorgan has been very helpful in this matter, as has Senator Byrd, Senator Gramm, Senator Warner--many of us want the highway bill up now. Our basic point is let's just bring it up now while we have the time. Otherwise we are going to be caught in a situation where delay upon delay means the ISTEA bill is not reauthorized until September or October. 
So I close by asking the majority leader to again look at the consequences of delaying the highway bill and to reconsider his decision, because this is a very, very serious matter and I hope we can find a way to avoid these kinds of disruptions. I am willing to work with the leadership, with Senators Chafee and Warner, and other members to accomplish that objective. I yield the floor.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce an important piece of legislation for Montana. This bill is titled `the Gallatin Range Consolidation Completion Act of 1997.' 
Mr. President, this legislation is similar to a bill introduced earlier today by my colleague from Montana. While I am glad he has at last staked out a public position in favor of this exchange, I believe his approach is too little, too early. So I am introducing a bill which more accurately reflects where discussions on this exchange have progressed since Senator Burns' earlier involvement. 
Completing the Gallatin Land Exchange is a top priority for me. The land considered in this legislation is key wildlife habitat and is among some of the most beautiful anywhere. When completed, this exchange will result in improved habitat and will improve recreation opportunities in the region. But, as with many land exchanges this will not be a simple process. 
The company involved, Big Sky Lumber has been pursuing this matter for nearly 4 years. The Forest Service has collected public comment and has worked to see that concerns of all parties affected, the recreation interests, conservation groups, homeowners, and the business owners are all addressed. I have been working with these groups drafting legislation with the help of the Forest Service. 
I was surprised that Senator Burns introduced a draft bill today without notice. Contrary to an agreement among the State's congressional delegation that no bill be introduced until we reached agreement among ourselves and with other interested groups. The bill I am introducing today is an updated version of the earlier draft I gave to Senator Burns for his review. I look forward to working with Senator Burns and all interested parties to get this process back on track so that we can pass a fair and balanced bill soon after we convene the next session of Congress. 
Over the next 2 months, my staff and I will be meeting with people about this exchange. My goal is to prepare a consensus bill that can be introduced by the entire Montana delegation when Congress convenes come January. Soon after the introduction of that consensus bill, I will hold public hearings in the state to hear what people think about our efforts. I am hopeful that in the future the entire Montana delegation will work together to protect the Taylor Fork and other important Montana lands in the Gallatin.

 Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the achievements and accomplishments of my fellow Montanans and good friends, Dennis and Phyllis Washington. 
Dennis was born July 27, 1934, in Missoula, Montana. As a young boy, he moved to Bremerton, Washington, where he shined shoes and sold newspapers to supplement the family income. At the tender age of 8, he was diagnosed with polio and given little chance of survival. Miraculously, he survived and went back to Missoula to recover and live with his grandmother. From this point on in his life, Dennis has fought and struggled against all odds to survive and succeed. Years later, this struggle and dedication has become Washington Corp., which, according to a recent article in USA Today, `consists of 15 businesses, employs 14,000, and generates $2.5 billion a year in revenue.' 
However, Dennis has never forgotten where he came from. Dennis and Phyllis have strived to make Montana a better place. They have been instrumental in ensuring that the university of Montana maintains its `tradition of excellence.' In her position as chairperson of the University's capital campaign, Phyllis led the 5-year effort to a record level of $71 million, over $7 million of which came from her own pocket. That will mean a higher quality of education for our students helping more of our children to find good jobs in Montana. 
From his humble beginnings in a house next to the railroad tracks to his present good fortune, the drive to help others has characterized Dennis Washington's life. He is a model for America, personifying the American dream that someone with big dreams can make those dreams a reality with a little intelligence and a lot of hard work. 
I have great respect and admiration for Dennis. He is a Montana original whose story provides inspiration to me and many other Montanans. He has overcome tremendous adversity to become one of the most successful businessmen in America. However, the one thing surpassing his business acumen is his generosity to his fellow man. Dennis and Phyllis Washington are true philanthropists that are deserving of our recognition.

 Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the accomplishments of one city in Montana in addressing the issues of gangs, violence and kids. 
On September 29, 1997, a historic town hall meeting took place in Billings, Montana. This cooperative and coordinated effort involved the media, school officials, and community leaders. It also involved a critical component: experts in addressing gang activity from Los Angeles. Together this effort created an hour-long video conference called `Gangs, Violence and Kids' and aired it on every major media outlet in the Billings area. 
This presentation incorporated a panel and studio audience format which brought in a cross-section of the population, including teenagers, represented in the region. Concerns were raised, perceptions were addressed, and issues were confronted in an honest and straightforward manner. 
By no means an end to itself, this town hall meeting has launched a series of follow-up gatherings, a foundation, a mentoring connection and a pipeline of support for ongoing programs like the U.S. Department of Justice's Weed and Seed program for Billings and surrounding communities has been established. 
Beginning last week, a series of 30-second public service announcements were aired to address the issues raised in the town hall meeting. This campaign will contribute to the community's understanding of how these important issues affect all our neighborhoods. I especially appreciate the significant commitment by those who have agreed to continue in their role as advocates for change. 
I am extremely proud of what Billings has accomplished and how its residents strive to respond to important issues. I hope my colleagues will agree that this successful effort in Billings is a model that can be duplicated in their community.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I will not comment on the specifics of the short-term bill. They have been adequately described by the very distinguished chairman of the committee, Senator Chafee, of Rhode Island, as well as the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Warner. 
I do have a couple of points I want to make which I think are very important. No. 1, this is a true compromise. We in this body suggested $500 million in new contract authority. The House originally suggested about $12 billion in new contract authority for next year. We have compromised on $5.5 billion in new contract authority, and we have done it in a way which does not get into new formulas. The Senate has its formula certainly in the 6-year bill it passed. The House has their formula approach. 
This short-term bill is a compromise in the amounts of the contract authority, but in a way that does not get into formulas. I think that is very fair, again reminding Senators that about $9.7 billion will be available May 1. 
The second point is this will allow States to have continuity in their highway programs. Contractors, highway commissions, employees, guys in the various labor unions, men and women who actually do the work here are very worried about whether we will have continuity, whether the program will continue, whether States will be able to let bids and accept bids and set up new projects. This bill, the short-term bill, maintains the continuity until we get over into a full 6-year bill, which I hope we pass early next year. 
Senator Lott suggested that we will take up the 6-year bill as the first order of business after the State of the Union Address next year, and I am very hopeful the House will also act very quickly. 
Another point is that even though we are somewhat congratulating ourselves in working with the other body in passing this short-term bill, we have to remember that the major challenge is still before us. It is passing that 6-year bill. I urge all my colleagues as well as Members of the other body to be ready to roll up their shirt sleeves the beginning of next year to work very hard to get this 6-year bill passed so then States will truly be assured of continuity. 
I particularly wish to thank Members of the other body, the chairman of the House Committee, Mr. Shuster of Pennsylvania, also Mr. Oberstar, who is the ranking member of the full committee, Mr. Petri and also Mr. Rahall. The four of them met with us, and I very much compliment them because they worked very cooperatively with Senators Chafee, myself, and Senator Warner in figuring out this short-term solution. Sometimes negotiations between this body and the other body get a little protracted and unnecessarily so. That was not the case here. The Members I mentioned worked very hard and worked very well together. I thank them very much for all that they have done. This is a good compromise. It provides flexibility and it is something we can proudly pass, so long as we remember that next year we have major work ahead of us. 
I particularly wish to thank our outstanding staff: Jimmie Powell, Dan Corbett, as well as Linda Jordan, and Cheryle Tucker, who are with Senator Chafee's staff, worked extremely effectively and hard, Ann Loomis and Ellen Stein with Senator Warner, and Tracy Henke, the voice of Senator Bond. She is very, very good. I was very impressed with her in these negotiations. And two members of my own staff, of course, Kathy Ruffalo and Tom Sliter. I will not say they are better than the others, but they are very, very good. We have a good team, and we work very well together. I was really struck with just how closely we have been working together. Senator Warner and Senator Chafee have alluded to it, but it is also at the staff level. It is cooperation and it is teamwork which I very much look forward to as we work out the 6-year bill next year. 
I thank the chairman and I thank the chairman of the subcommittee. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the accomplishments of two outstanding Montana cattlewomen, Michelle Tebay and Lisa Schmidt of Whitehall, MT. 
This past year has been tough in Montana and across the West for many cattle producers. They incurred severe losses due to floods and blizzards. But thanks to the hard work and vision of Michelle Tebay and Lisa Schmidt, hope is on the horizon. They initiated a project called `One Good Cow,' and it certainly deserves our attention. 
In Montana, we pride ourselves on looking out for one another--especially during challenging times. When Michelle heard about all the cattle losses Western ranchers were suffering, she contacted Lisa who works as an Ag Extension agent for Madison and Jefferson Counties. Together, the two women formulated a plan. And, that plan was to convince ranchers who survived the storms to help the less fortunate replenish their herds. The dream has become reality. 
Today, the `One Good Cow' project is working to collect and transport 80,000 healthy, pregnant cows to folks who lost significant portions of their herds last winter. And the good news is that their fellow ranchers from across the Nation are donating these cattle. This teamwork has resulted in success for all. It has even gained national media attention and will be featured on national TV network news later this week. 
The `One Good Cow' program is a prime example of how ranchers from all over the United States can work together in times of adversity. That shouldn't surprise anyone. Ranchers have always relied on each other as they face the worst that Mother Nature has to offer. 
But the real credit goes to Michelle and Lisa. Mr. President, it is impossible to count the number of lives that will be touched by their idea. I would just like to add my voice to all the others and say `Thank you, so much, Michelle and Lisa.' 
I encourage all of my colleagues to become familiar with the `One Good Cow' Program and give it their full support. Our ranchers are depending on it.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I join with my colleague from Utah, Senator Hatch, and my other colleagues to introduce this bill, which is so critical to the ability of American businesses to effectively compete in the global marketplace. Companion legislation has been introduced in the House by Representatives Nancy Johnson and Robert Matsui. 
Our Nation is the world's undisputed leader in technological innovation, a position that would not be possible absent U.S. companies' commitment to research and development. Investment in research is an investment in our Nation's economic future, and it is appropriate that both the public and private sector share the costs involved, as we share in the benefits. The credit provided through the Tax Code for research expenses provides a modest but crucial incentive for companies to conduct their research in the United States, thus creating high-skilled, high-paying jobs for U.S. workers. 
The R&E credit has played a key role in placing the United States ahead of its competition in developing and marketing new products. Every dollar that the Federal Government spends on the R&E credit is matched by another dollar of spending on research over the short run by private companies, and two dollars of spending over the long run. Our global competitors are well aware of the importance of providing incentives for research, and many provide more generous tax treatment for research and experimentation expenses that does the United States. As a result, while spending on non-defense R&D in the United States as a percentage of GDP has remained relatively flat since 1985, Japan's and Germany's has grown. 
The benefits of the credit, though certainly significant, have been limited over the years by the fact that the credit has been temporary. In addition to the numerous times that the credit has been allowed to lapse, last year, for the first time, when Congress extended the credit it left a gap of an entire year during which the credit was not available. This unprecedented lapse sent a troubling signal to the U.S. companies and universities that have come to rely on the Government's longstanding commitment to the credit. 
Much research and development takes years to mature. The more uncertain the long-term future of the credit is, the smaller its potential to stimulate increased research. If companies evaluating research projects cannot rely on the seamless continuation of the credit, they are less likely to invest on research in this country, less likely to put money into cutting-edge technology innovation that is critical to keeping us in the forefront of global competition. 
Our country is locked in a fierce battle for high-paying technological jobs in the global economy. As more nations succeed in creating educationally advanced workforces and join the United States as high-technology manufacturing centers, they become more attractive to companies trying to penetrate foreign markets. Multinational companies sometimes find that moving both manufacturing and basic research activities overseas is necessary if they are to remain competitive. The uncertainty of the R&E credit factors into their economic calculations, and makes keeping these jobs in the United States more difficult. 
Although the R&E credit is not exclusively used by high-technology firms, they are certainly key beneficiaries of the credit. In my own State of Montana, 12 of every 1,000 private sector workers were employed by high-tech firms in 1995, the most recent year for which statistics are available. Almost 400 establishments provided high-technology services, at an average wage of $34,500 per year. These jobs paid 77 percent more than the average private sector wage in Montana of $19,500 per year. Many of these jobs would never have been created without the assistance of the R&E credit. Making the credit permanent would most certainly provide the incentive needed to create many more in the future. 
I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and look forward to working with them and with the administration to make the research and experimentation tax credit permanent.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I very much hope that the other body takes up and passes this measure because it has been our judgment that it is about the only approach that is going to allow States to continue the continuity in their highway programs until next year when we pass the full 6-year program. 
This measure that we have just adopted here in the Senate is formula neutral. It is designed in a way to make sure that all of the different States who are in different situations are treated reasonably fairly. Nothing is perfect. But this is a very good effort to deal with various differences among the States. It also will provide enough funds for the Congress next year to take up the full 6-year bill in a reasonable period of time. 
So I very much hope that the other body takes it up and passes this bill because it is in the States' best interests to continue that continuity of funding.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, there are two points that I want to make. 
We are passing this rather significant piece of legislation because we are doing it in a bipartisan basis. I must remind all of my colleagues that when we get into partisan fights often nothing happens. We make political points but don't pass legislation. 
This has been very, very cohesive and bipartisan on both sides of the aisle. 
It has been an honor for me--a privilege for me--to participate with Senator Warner, Senator Chafee, Senator Bond, and Senator Byrd in putting this together. 
My second point is to reaffirm just how lucky we are to have such a dedicated staff who are so able and so talented. I am always in awe in seeing just how right these people are and how necessary they are. 
But, for the record, the one lady who came up with the final solution is on my staff. Her name is Kathy Ruffalo. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I was not present for the cloture votes on October 31, 1997. I would like to record my position, had I been present for the votes. 
Had I been present for the cloture vote on H.R. 2646, the Education Savings Act for Public and Private Schools, I would have opposed cloture. In addition to the many serious public policy implications raised by this legislation, as a member of the Senate Finance Committee I have serious concerns about the virtually unprecedented manner in which it was brought to the floor. After H.R. 2646 was approved by the House it was sent directly to the desk, where it was pulled from and sent to the floor--completely bypassing the Finance Committee where virtually all tax legislation is reviewed. 
The lack of review is particularly distressing given the budget implications of H.R. 2646--it would increase spending by $4 billion over 10 years. It is both shortsighted and unwise to make major modifications in the Tax Code without review by the committee of jurisdiction and without first asking a simple question: Are these IRA's our highest priority for educational funding? To my way of thinking, that question has not been addressed. 
When this bill was immediately considered under a cloture strategy, all ability to make any changes in this policy were blocked. That is simply unacceptable. This legislation should be considered under a less restricted approach. In keeping with the customary Senate approach we should conduct a thorough debate with ample opportunity for amendments. Anything less should be rejected. 
I should also note my absence for the cloture vote on the Defense authorization conference report. Cloture was invoked in an overwhelming vote. Had I been present, I too would have cast my vote in favor of cloture. 
Mr. President, there are many demands made on the time of a Senator. Few are as important or as rewarding as being a part of the life of our school children. And on last Friday, when presented with a choice between keeping important commitments to Montana students or procedural votes in the Senate, I faced a difficult decision. And while I take my responsibilities here in Washington very seriously, I decided that I needed to be with these Montana students on this occasion. And in this particular instance my votes would not have affected the ultimate outcome of either vote.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to express my support for the nomination of Charles Rossotti to be the new Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Rossotti will face a daunting challenge as he takes over the reins of this besieged agency. 
The IRS has suffered from years of neglect and lack of focus. As new Commissioner, Mr. Rossotti will need to repair the damage that has eaten away at the Service's foundation and try to restore some semblance of respect for the IRS among the average taxpayer. 
At the same time, he will need to be preparing the IRS for the challenges of the next century. 
The public expects some essential services from the Government, and most people are willing to pay their fair share of taxes in order to pay for these services. 
Nobody likes paying taxes, but most of us do it regularly and honestly. 
In return, we expect the Government to keep the process fair, make it as simple as possible, and keep our personal information private. 
Running the IRS is a study in careful balances. And I believe that the IRS has somehow lost its ability to maintain one side of the equation over the years. 
Many tax collectors, in their zeal to catch the few people who don't pay their taxes, seem to have lost sight of the most important truth about our tax system--that citizens have rights that must be protected. 
Anything less undermines our ability to make a system of voluntary taxation work. 
We certainly don't want to tie IRS's hands so much that tax cheats are encouraged, because the rest of us end up picking up the tab when someone cheats. 
At the same time, we also can't have IRS harassing innocent citizens, assuming everyone is guilty the minute they walk in the door. Mr. Rossotti will be the one person we will expect to help IRS find its way back to the reasonable balance that our tax system requires. 
I hope and expect that we in the Congress will do our best to help. 
We will be looking at legislative solutions, to give the new Commissioner the tools to encourage the climate of change we need if we are to reverse the past years of decline. 
We will be looking at stable funding, to make sure Mr. Rossotti has the money to pay good people and buy new computers. 
I hope we would also be looking at tax simplification, to make it a little easier for both taxpayers and the IRS to figure out how much our fair share really amounts to. 
Mr. Rossotti has the background and expertise to help him achieve the difficult tasks we expect of him in the days ahead. I wish him every success, and look forward to working with him to make sure the Internal Revenue Service reaches its full potential.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Interior appropriations conference report. I do so with great respect for its managers, Senators Byrd and Gorton and in recognition of the difficult job which they have faced in bringing this bill together. They have done a fine job juggling this contentious bill and I applaud them for their efforts. 
Mr. President, I'd like to talk a minute about worthwhile Federal investments contained in this bill. First, let me talk about the National Endowment for the Arts. This agency makes a real difference in Montana. It allows groups like Shakespeare in the Parks to go to over 50 Montana towns, including Birney, a town of only 17. 
Every year, the cast and supporters of Shakespeare in the Parks clear a spot on Poker Jim Butte and put on a show. Citizens come from the nearby reservation, area ranches, and over the border from Wyoming to see classic Shakespeare works. It's a real community gathering and balloons the size of Birney for the day. And make no mistake, it probably wouldn't happen without NEA funding. This bill funds this valuable program. 
I have been a longtime advocate of preserving the quality of life we in Montana and in America enjoy. This Interior bill also goes a long way toward preserving some of the last, best places for our children. First, it dedicates $1.5 million to help finish the Gallatin II land exchange near Bozeman, MT. Next, it earmarks $1 million for purchasing easements and land in the Blackfoot Valley. 
This area isn't far from where I grew up. I've hunted, fished, and hiked in those hills and I can tell you of its beauty. We can be proud that because of this investment, our children will have the same access to this region that I did as a boy. 
Mr. President, our rivers are under attack by a malady known as whirling disease. This parasitic condition causes the deterioration of fish muscles, eventually causing the fish to die. It has been found in many Blue Ribbon Montana rivers and is slowly spreading across the West. Our critical fisheries are at risk and Western States are faced with the potential loss of millions of dollars in tourism and fish agricultural revenues. Scientists at Montana State University's Fish Technology Center are hard at work today identifying the causes of this disease and potential cures. 
It is cutting edge science and it is making a difference. This bill recognizes that and funds this research at an appropriate level. 
The Interior Appropriations bill also contains $699 million in increased funding for the land and water conservation fund. This will help our Nation to acquire environmentally critical lands including a number of parcels that have been rated as a high priority in Montana. Specifically, the bill provides $65 million in land and water conservation funding to acquire the New World Mine property next to Yellowstone National Park. 
If built, this mine would have harmed Yellowstone National Park. It would have polluted waters flowing into the park and would have harmed the park's wildlife herds. Montanans overwhelmingly opposed construction of this mine. 
Last year, when the Clinton administration, local citizens, and the mining company reached an agreement that would keep the mine from being built, the entire region breathed a sigh of relief. 
And now it is time to finish that agreement. 
The New World agreement provides that the Federal Government will purchase the property from the mining company, thus protecting Yellowstone for our children. But its benefits don't stop there. The agreement also requires the mining company to spend $22.5 million to clean up historic mining pollution in the area. This not only improves the environment, it also creates jobs for Montana. That is truly a win-win solution. 
As this bill moved through Congress, I worked hard to ensure that the money would be included to complete the New World agreement. And I am glad that has been done. 
As part of the New World negotiations, we were able to further protect the local economy in Montana by appropriating $12 million to repair the area's main highway leading into Yellowstone National Park. Charles Kuralt called the Beartooth Highway the most beautiful road in America. With the money contained in this bill, we will be able to maintain that highway, enhance the local economy, and ensure that the American people continue to have access to the treasures of Yellowstone National Park. 
The agreement reached between me, the administration, and House and Senate negotiators is truly in the best interests of Montana and of the Nation. It protects Yellowstone, cleans up the environment, creates jobs, and helps provide public access to our Nation's first national park. 
However, the final version of the Interior appropriations bill also contains a provision that we did not agree to. It requires the transfer of $10 million or more worth of coal to the State of Montana. This provision was outside of the scope of the agreement that we negotiated with the White House and the other Members of Congress. 
I support the development of coal in eastern Montana. But I also understand that the White House objects to the inclusion of this coal transfer. I expect that the White House will attempt to remove this coal either through a full veto of the bill or through a line-item veto of the coal transfer. 
Coal was not included in our negotiated agreement on New World because the White House objected to its inclusion and because of fears that it could jeopardize the New World agreement. Now that Congress has included coal in the final bill, I hope that this issue does not stand in the way of our ability to complete the New World agreement. It would be a crime to get this close to completing the agreement only to have it fall apart--jeopardizing Yellowstone, MT jobs and the Beartooth Highway as well. 
So, Mr. President, we are nearing the conclusion of a long process. I hope that all parties will continue to work with me to complete the New World agreement as expeditiously as possible. And I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure that will achieve the successful protection of this national treasure.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would just like to say a few words about where we are on the highway bill. It is due to internal political discussion and confrontation that we have not been able to move on the highway bill. There has been a bipartisan effort to try to get an agreement on campaign finance reform. We are still at loggerheads. 
Mr. President, it is imperative that we in the Senate find some way to get a highway bill passed. It has been a month now since the authorization expired. It expired on September 30. We in the Senate are derelict by not passing highway legislation. 
I say that because there are many States that are going to run out of money very soon. My State of Montana will run out the first part of February. It takes a long time to let contracts, to bid on contracts, to get the pipeline lined up so dollars are out to the States for jobs. I have been in favor of the 6-year bill. It only makes sense that we have some continuity in our highway program. 
This is not some abstract theory, Mr. President. This is jobs. This is local people, cities and counties and States, that very much depend upon this multibillion-dollar program. So I urge us to find some pragmatic, practical way to get some form of a highway bill passed. I hope it is 6 months. It may not be 6 months. I hope it is 6 years. It may not be 6 years. But we have to pass something so when we go home over the holidays we will at least have built a bridge so next year we take up a full 6-year bill and find a way to get that passed. 
I urge my colleagues to find some way to solve this impasse now so we as a practical matter do our duty to get highway legislation passed.

Mr. BAUCUS. I say to the Senator, back in 1993, it was a very difficult time. The President and the Democratic majority of the Congress were trying to figure out a way to get us on the path toward deficit reduction. 
I might say to my good friend from Rhode Island that I think it worked. That package dramatically set us on a glidepath which has enabled us to begin to reduce our budget deficit. In fact, the budget resolution which was passed this year, which allows us to balance the budget was due in large part to that 1993 package. 
Having said that, I can remember when I cast that vote. At first, some were proposing a higher tax than 4.3-cents per gallon. I think it was up to a nine cents or so. I argued that I opposed using a gasoline tax for deficit reduction. And because of these arguments, the final number was 4.3 cents. So while I didn't like the idea of a gas tax for deficit reduction, I supported it for the greater good of getting the deficit reduced. And again, that package led get down the road to deficit reduction. But I knew at that time, that once the deficit was reduced, we would be working get this money back to the trust fund for transportation uses. 
Indeed, that is what this Congress has done. We have voted to transfer the 4.3 from deficit reduction to the trust fund. That vote passed by a very large margin with a majority of Republicans voted for it. 
Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.

Mr. BAUCUS. I appreciate the good points made by my friend from Rhode Island, but they are really sort of obfuscation. They really don't get to the central point, the central point being should we or should we not pass the Byrd-Gramm-Baucus-Warner amendment which will increase the contract authority or authorization of transportation programs. 
There have been a lot of statements from my colleagues about this amendment already. So I will be very brief. The most important point is one the Senator from West Virginia has so correctly made. We have tremendous transportation infrastructure needs, and that they are not being met. Indeed, the Department of Transportation has concluded under the current highway program we need about $15 billion a year in additional spending to meet our highway needs. 
And these investments help us compete globally. It is this competition that has helped us reach the economic growth we have today. But we have to invest more in the engine of the economy, our transportation network. Other nation's are investing more in infrastructure in order to catch up to us. If you look at what other countries spend on infrastructure, Japan is four times as a percentage of GDP and Europe twice as much as we do. Just look around the D.C. area. Anybody who drives around here, with all the pot holes and congestion, knows how much we need to improve the highways in this country. 
So how do we meet these transportation needs? We begin by increasing the authorizations for transportation spending. We have 
to do that with the Byrd-Gramm amendment because we are faced with a budget resolution which has limited the amount of money that the Environment and Public Works Committee can spend. And these limits are too low. 
So the amendment Senator Byrd is offering is a very creative way to meet the needs of our highway system. It is very simple. It says that if the savings, or a portion of the savings projected in OMB's midsession review are realized and if Congress decides to spend them, then transportation programs should be fully funded. Let me emphasize the key words here. If there are additional savings from the economy and if Congress decides to spend them, then transportation should be fully funded. So nothing is mandated. There is no automatic increased spending. All of that will be decided by Congress next year and in future years. We are only saying that we should authorize these additional funds so that if additional spending is available, the authorization process is complete. We do not mandate anything. We are not mandating the Budget Committee to take action. We are not mandating the Appropriations Committee to spend any additional money. We are just saying they should spend the additional savings if that savings is available. 
Now, the total savings available, if OMB's midsession review is accurate, will be about $200 billion. That is to say that we in the Congress will have $200 billion more than we thought we had when we passed the last budget resolution. That is, the economy has been doing so well that there will be about $71 billion less in spending--that is less in unemployment compensation insurance, for example--and about $130 billion in additional revenues because the economy is doing so well. This is over a 5-year period. It is these savings that we are targeting in this amendment. 
Let me also say what this amendment does not do. Some Senators have said, and I think it is true that it is based on incorrect information--it is not their fault; the amendment has not been available for them to read. Some Senators said, well, this amendment will cut other programs. It is going to cut Head Start. It is going to cut education programs. 
Let me be clear. This amendment in no way cuts funding for any program. Let me repeat that. The effect of this amendment is not to cut any program. That is because we are only authorizing additional spending with the anticipation that future economic savings will be available to fund these authorizations. If we do not do this, if we are locked into the lower numbers in the underlying bill, we will not be able to increase these numbers during the six year authorization. Not unless the Environment and Public Works Committee writes a new bill to do so. We do not want to have to write a new highway bill every year. That does not make sense. But the important point is that increasing the contract authority will not cut the spending for other programs. 
And this amendment does not bust the budget. Again, that is because it only increases the contract authority for transportation programs. 
Another point. If this amendment does not pass, the balances in the highway trust fund will be $71 billion by the year 2003. That is not right. Congress would continue to use this money to mask the true budget deficit. It is phony business. It is smoke and mirrors to let that happen. It just is not right to let these balances accumulate to such a large degree to mask the true budget deficit. That is wrong. And again that would happen if this amendment does not pass. It just happens automatically if it doesn't pass. 
I might also add, Madam President, that I hear some Senators who are unhappy with the formula in the underlying bill. They have asked for more money for their States. I have heard from many States. It is a rare State that doesn't make that plea. 
There is only one way to help States get more money and that is to vote for the Byrd amendment. Every State will receive more contract authority. If we do not have this extra contract authority, there is no way we can help States get more money. So if you need more money and if you feel you are not being dealt with fairly, this amendment will help bring that result. We will not be able to help any States or any programs without more money. 
Madam President, I have more points I want to make, but I think it is probably more appropriate to bring those points up when the amendment is actually before us. But I just wanted to summarize by saying that I ask Senators to read the amendment now that it is available and they will see it does not cause all these problems that some fear it will cause. And on the contrary, they will see that it does not bust the budget and will not cause a funding cut to other programs. 
Madam President, I yield the floor.

Mr. BAUCUS. If the Senator will yield, if I understand the Senator, he is saying under the Byrd-Gramm-Baucus-Warner amendment 
it is true that it is up to the discretion of the Budget Committee and appropriations committees to make these decisions, but that they will be under such pressure that they will not be able to decide responsibly what is right for the country? That is what I understand the Senator to be saying.

Mr. BAUCUS. I think it is very clear. The point of this is we transferred 4.3 cents to the highway trust fund. Those are dollars that Americans expect to be used for highways. And I think the Senator is correct in saying there is a very strong presumption that that contract authority will be spent someday. The Budget Committee and the Appropriations Committee along with the rest of Congress will decide if the contract authority will be spent. But that is only if economic savings are realized. But the beauty of the amendment is if for some reason it does not make sense next year to increase transportation spending, they still have that discretion. That is the beauty of it. 
So, in answer to the Senator, it is very clear. It could not be more clear. Yes, there is a very strong presumption because the amendment says it should be spent. But it does not say it must be spent. It does not mandate that. But I personally feel it should be spent. The cosponsors of this amendment very strongly believe that those dollars should be spent. 
But, still, we can't totally predict the future. I can't. I don't think anybody in this body can. So next year if for some reason the Budget Committee and Congress decides it wants to make some other decision, it can. And the Senator knows, under the terms of this amendment, the Budget Committee can. But the Senator also is correct in saying there is a strong presumption under this amendment that this money should be spent on highways if the savings are realized. Again, the amendment provides `if the savings are realized.' 
I have one question for the Senator. When are we going to see the amendment of the Senator?

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, next week Chinese President Jiang Zemin will arrive for his first State visit, the first State visit by a Chinese leader in 12 years. As this visit approaches, I rise to discuss our China policy and the things we might hope to see from this event. 
Let me begin with the broad goals of our Asia policy. I think they are clear. First, a peaceful Pacific. Second, open trade. Third, joint work on problems of mutual concern like environmental problems and international crime. And fourth, progress toward respect for internationally recognized human rights. 
Generally speaking, our Asian policy has helped move us toward these goals. We have a permanent military force in the Pacific which, coupled with strong alliances with Japan and South Korea, Thailand, the Philippines, and Australia, has helped to keep the peace for 20 years. While we have a lot of work ahead on Asian trade, our work has produced over $100 billion in export growth, an increase of 70 percent. That is since 1991. We are beginning to adopt a more systematic approach to the region's growing environmental problems, and can cite the democratization of the Philippines, Thailand, Taiwan, and South Korea as human rights success stories. 
Where does China fit in? China is the largest country in Asia, the fastest growing economy, the largest military power, and the Asian nation with which our relationship has been most volatile during this decade. If we can establish a stable, workable relationship with China, all of our goals will come closer to realization. If we cannot, both Americans and Chinese, and other Pacific nations, will suffer a great deal. 
Next week's summit offers us a chance to make a start. Following it must be a work program focusing on a very practical agenda. And as we approach the summit, I think we can help ourselves by putting the issues we must address in three broad categories. They are: mutual interests, areas of dispute, and issues we will face in the future. 
First are the areas where we have mutual interests. 
Regional security is one case. We must work with China to maintain peace in Korea. Both countries want to avoid a conflict over Taiwan. We need to ensure that Japan does not feel pressured to become a military power. On weapons proliferation, if India and Pakistan develop nuclear missiles, China will suffer from it a lot more than we would. 
Environmental issues are another matter. We both need to ensure sustainable management of fisheries and to address air pollution and acid rain problems caused by the boom in Chinese power production. We also must work much closer together to do our best to protect biodiversity and prevent large-scale climate change. One concrete proposal that will help in this area, if the public reports that China has agreed to our proposals on nuclear proliferation are accurate, is opening up civil nuclear technology sales. 
A number of domestic Chinese issues also fall into this area. Helping China establish a broad rule of law will contribute to our human rights goals. 
Labor safety is a second case where we could contribute to China's own efforts to improve factory safety and improve the lives of many ordinary Chinese; and helping Chinese farmers take advantage of cleaner pesticides, modern agricultural technologies, and an up-to-date infrastructure is a third. 
We also clearly have some disputes with China. We should not make them the whole focus of our relationship, but neither should we try to duck them. 
At times we will need simply to understand one another's positions and agree to put off disagreements into the future. 
Taiwan policy has been handled reasonably well in this manner for the past few decades. Perhaps with some adjustments in detail, we should continue that policy. 
Likewise, China has recently expressed some unhappiness with our stationing of troops in Asia. They need to understand that the issue is between us on the one hand and Japan and Korea and our allies on the other. It is not on the table for discussion. 
In other areas we should expect to do better. We seem to be doing well in nuclear proliferation. It is my hope that the President will seal that achievement by certifying China as in compliance in the nuclear area, and open up civil nuclear power trade with China. On missiles and chemical weapons, we see less thus far. And while I do not regard sanctions as a tool appropriate for every issue on the table with China--and I do not believe Congress should be passing broad new sanction laws--these are areas where we should use targeted sanctions if necessary. We did this last spring in the case of the sale of chemical weapons precursors involving a Nanjing company. If it happens again, we should use tougher penalties. 
Trade is another example. Despite the optimism of United States business, since 1980 our exports to China have grown more slowly than our exports to any other major market, whether it be Canada, Japan, Europe, Mexico, or ASEAN. Meanwhile, we have been tremendously generous to China, keeping our market to Chinese goods more open than any other in the world. 
This is not acceptable. It is wrong when Chinese shoe companies can sell to Montana but Montana wheat farmers cannot sell to China. We should expect China to be as fair and open to us as we are to them. And we should offer an incentive to do that. Specifically, we should make MFN status permanent when China comes up with a good WTO package. But we should also be clear that we cannot wait forever. 
Our 5-year bilateral trade agreement negotiated in 1992 is about to be completed. 
And if the pace of the WTO talks does not pick up soon, we should use our retaliatory trade law, section 301, to win a broad successor to it. 
On human rights, while we should seek common ground and recognize where China is doing better, we should also not shrink from bringing up the tough issues. The time is past when these questions could be considered strictly domestic concerns. We should bring up individual cases of political prisoners, ask for talks with the Dalai Lama and Red Cross access to Chinese prisons. If the Chinese want us to stop sponsoring resolutions at the U.N. Human Rights Commission, they need to show some understanding of our concerns and the world's concerns on these issues.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I have a lot of sympathy with the remarks of the Senator from North Dakota. Being in a deadlock we are not accomplishing very much. The Senator is suggesting that we get off this deadlock; that we start to accomplish something. And he is suggesting that we vote on one of the amendments on this tree and suggesting under the parliamentary rules that we vote on the first one, which is the second-degree amendment. I am very sympathetic to that. I want to move, too. 
I also would like to get campaign finance reform passed. Why? I can tell you, having just been through an election, that this country has dramatically changed the way campaigns are run and financed from just a few years ago. The present system is so bad. It is so obscene with virtually no limit on the total number of dollars raised or spent on behalf of, or for, or by candidates that it is demoralizing the country. It is causing the American people to think that the whole system stinks and becoming less and less involved in the democratic process and beginning to lose interest. And we run the risk of fragmenting a country--a country where Americans are going their own way; not a country that works together as a whole. 
It is a huge problem. I can tell you, Mr. President. It is a huge problem. And if this Senate and this House does not do something about campaign finance reform very soon, this country, as we know it, is going to no longer be the greatest country on the face of this Earth just because we are going to be so awash in campaign money that the American people are just going to begin to lose interest in the U.S. Government--certainly in the Congress, and in the Presidential campaigns as well. 
That is a vivid exaggeration. I grant you. They will have some interest. But they are not going to be nearly as proud of this Congress and their Federal Government as they would like to be. 
At the same time, I think we have to pass this highway bill. Why do I say so? Because if the Senate does not pass the highway bill very soon--that is, within the next week or so--then the chances of it passing this year are virtually nil. If we do not pass a highway bill--we know the House wants a 6-month bill. The House's 6-month bill is something that is just totally unacceptable, in my view, because every year, or every couple of years, we would be reauthorizing the highway bill. And it makes no sense. We need to pass a 6-year highway bill. It is that simple. 
I have a lot of sympathy for the Senator from North Dakota. He is right. We have to start moving. I hope that leadership on both sides of the aisle sits down and reaches an agreement today, and figure out a way to get off of this impasse so that we can do both--find a way to take up and work campaign finance reform, and also pass this highway bill.

Mr. BAUCUS. The chairman of the committee is accurate. We all know that very often there is the tendency to wait until the last moment, and we do not get an opportunity sometimes to say what we want to say or offer amendments. Now is the opportunity to speak on the bill. Senators may have questions about the bill. This is an excellent opportunity to take advantage of that because there may not be another opportunity. 
So I, first of all, encourage Senators who have an interest in one of the more important pieces of legislation, certainly one of the more expensive bills that this Congress is going to pass this year, to come on over. Tell us what you think. If you may have a problem with the bill, perhaps we can work it out. But now is the time. I urge Senators on both sides of the aisle to do so because this is an opportune time.

Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, while the chairman is waiting for Senators to come over and give their views on the bill, I thought I would explain the main provisions in our bill and how the formula works so that Senators will better understand these items. If at any time a Senator wants to come over and speak, I will be more than pleased to interrupt my statement and let that Senator say whatever he or she wishes to say. 
Mr. President, today we are currently operating under a 6-year ISTEA highway bill. The bill before us is a new 6-year ISTEA bill. This new bill will bring up to date some of the provisions that are in the current law. By up to date, I refer to the formulas. Believe it or not, our current formula uses some historical factors such as the 1980 census data, as well as the 1916 postal road miles. That outdated data is included in the current funding formula to allocate dollars among the States. When writing the new bill, the committee thought it made a lot of sense to dispense with the use of the old data. After all, some of the data are pretty old. The 1980's is old enough, but the 1916 postal road miles is going a bit far. 
The current ISTEA program also has a lot of accounts. Eleven to be exact. It is difficult for States to work with all the different accounts. And it is a bit complex. So the new bill we are debating today eliminates that old historical data and brings the funding formulas up to date. This new bill also reduces the number of accounts from 11 to 5. This provides States with a lot more flexibility. 
Let me briefly discuss how the current formulation works. As I said, the new bill has five major accounts. One is the Interstate National Highway System, which has two components--the Interstate component as well as the National Highway System component. Another is the Surface Transportation Program and another is the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Program, more commonly known inside the beltway as CMAQ. And we have two equity accounts to kind of even things out for States. 
Let me say a little bit about the Interstate National Highway System account. It has two components--the interstate component and the National Highway System component. We all know what Interstates are; that is pretty obvious. Let me say that the National Highway System component is essentially our other principal Federal roads. What do we do with the interstate components? How are dollars allocated to States with respect to the Interstate System that they have? It is very simple. Fifty percent of the formula for interstate use is interstate lane miles. So the more interstate lane miles a State has, the more dollars that State is going to receive under our formula in the bill. 
Well, what about the States that have, say, not quite so many interstate lane miles, but the ones they do have are traveled very heavily? Those States feel they should receive adequate interstate funds because their maintenance costs are higher because they have more traffic on their interstates. We take care of that. Fifty percent of the interstate component is lane miles and the other 50 percent is what we call interstate vehicle miles traveled, otherwise known as VMT. So there is a balance here with respect to the interstate dollars that are sent out to States. Fifty percent of the interstate component is based upon the number of interstate lane miles that a State has. This helps a State like my State of Montana which has a lot of interstate lane miles. For States without a lot of interstate lane miles, the other 50 percent measures congestion as vehicle miles traveled. So my State does not have a lot of vehicle miles traveled. Contrast that with the State, say, of my distinguished colleague from Rhode Island, the chairman of the committee. I suppose he does not have a lot of lane miles, but his vehicle miles traveled is probably high in Rhode Island compared with my State of Montana. That is how we allocate dollars that go to interstate highways. Virtually all of 
that money is for maintenance, because we have completed the interstate construction in our country. Those dollars go to maintenance. And again, we feel we have a fair formula that measures the extent and use of the interstate system. I should mention that about $6 billion a year that goes into the interstate account. 
The other portion of the Interstate National Highway System we call the National Highway System component. That is for non-interstate highways or highways that have a lot of traffic. Again, $6 billion a year goes into the National Highway System component. The formula for dividing this money among the States is also fair. It measures the extent and use of the other highways. Twenty percent of it is apportioned to what we call principal arterial lane miles. Twenty-nine percent is apportioned according to principal arterial vehicle miles traveled. So a larger percentage goes to those States that have more traffic on principal arterials. Eighteen percent is allocated according to what we call arterial bridge square foot deficiencies. That is, if you look at bridges that are deficient and calculate the number of square feet on the bridge, 18 percent of the dollars in our bill in the National Highway System account go to States that have those deficiencies. Twenty-four percent is allocated according to the State's diesel fuel consumption. That is to measure truck use because the large trucks that travel our highways do pound our highways much more than average cars. Those States that have a lot of diesel fuel consumption are probably States that have a lot of truck use and, therefore, need more dollars to maintain their highways. Twenty-four percent of the National Highway System component is divided according to diesel fuel consumption. Nine percent is allocated according to what we call principal arterial lane miles per person. This measures the population density on principal arterials. So that is the first main component of the funding formulas in this bill --the Interstate National Highway System. 
Let me mention the next major portion in this bill. It is called the Surface Transportation Program. The Surface Transportation Program is used for other transportation needs, and it is about $7 billion a year; 20 percent is allocated according to Federal aid lane miles, 30 percent according to Federal aid VMT, vehicle miles traveled--again, congested States--25 percent to Federal aid for bridge square foot deficiency, and 25 percent according to contributions to the Highway Trust Fund. That totals $7 billion. Again, that is the Surface Transportation Program. 
The next major program is the Congestion Mitigation Air Quality Program. This is designed to allow our highway spending to merge, in some sense, with our Clean Air Act. That is, we want our highway spending to be planned to meet our environmental concerns. CMAQ helps States meet the requirements of the Clean Air Act. We don't want our bill to encourage States to be not in compliance with the Clean Air Act. Rather, we would like our bill to encourage cities and States to be in compliance with the standards in the Clean Air Act. 
So this bill spends about $1.15 billion a year, according to the severity of air quality nonattainment for ozone and carbon monoxide, and also for populations living in nonattainment areas. I must say, Madam President, that ISTEA, this bill, led the way on programs like congestion mitigation air quality, otherwise known as CMAQ, and flexibility for States. The person who is principally responsible is Senator Moynihan from New York. When he wrote the ISTEA legislation about 6 years ago, which we are currently operating under, he was the main person that added those provisions in there. 
So I might repeat, Madam President, that our current bill, ISTEA II, uses updated data, not old historical data, 1980 census data and 1916 postal road data. Rather, we use the latest census data available each year. We also use data based upon current fuel consumption because we think that is somewhat of an indication--not a perfect indication--of how much State highways get used, 
therefore, the number of dollars that State would need for maintenance and upkeep. 
I think this is a pretty good formula. It is one that is fair to different regions of the country. We have a very diverse nation. There is a wide variety of transportation needs among the States. From Maine, the State of the current occupant of the chair, to California to Nevada or my State of Montana, every State is different. We have done our very best to try to balance the different needs. I think that passage of this bill out of committee by a vote of 18 to 0 somewhat reflects the views of the Senators on that committee that this is a balanced and fair bill. Those eighteen Senators come from the West, from the East, from the South. We have Senators from so-called donee States and Senators from so-called donor States. I think we have done a good job. 
I hope that Senators who have ideas on how to further improve this bill will come down and speak with the chairman of the committee and with me because we are more than open to ways to improve this bill. 
Madam President, I will pause now to allow Senators to come down and speak. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. President, I join my colleague and chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee in recognizing and praising the intelligence and the vision of the senior Senator from New York. I think I can state without reservation and categorically that the Senator from New York is the most interesting Senator in the U.S. Senate. He is most interesting not because he makes outrageous statements but for a lot of reasons. One is his historical knowledge. The Senator from New York has a deeper historical knowledge of many facets, whether it is American history, world history, technical history----

Mr. BAUCUS. Than anyone else in this entity. Very often he draws upon his vast reservoir to enlighten us and remind us of something that happened in the past and how it is relevant to what we are attempting to do in the future. 
He is also most interesting because he is, I think, the most profound. He comes up with more new ideas, has a broader perspective on what is happening, which enables him to approach a subject from more angles, more ways, and he thinks more outside the box, if you will. 
There are many examples of that but one that comes to mind is what he did in the last ISTEA bill, focusing on intermodality, a big word but very important concept. Not just building concrete highways but all the various ways that transportation has to and should be connected. 
For example, the Senator will remember we had a field hearing in New York. I flew up to New York on an airplane. I didn't drive. I took a water taxi in the Delta terminal over to some pier in New York and then a taxi over to where the hearing was located. The point is that States, under the vision of the Senator from New York, can spend ISTEA dollars on a Delta water taxi. That is permissible. I don't know whether any dollars were spent, maybe, but they can be. 
In addition, in our bill we give States added flexibility. Our bill allows States to spend money on Amtrak if they choose. In some States, Amtrak is a lot more important, or in parts of some States Amtrak it is more important than others. 
The intermodality, that flexibility, is made available here, to say nothing of spending money on transit. Highway dollars can be spent on mass transit. We don't have much mass transit in my State of Montana, but certainly in the State of New York and other States transit is very, very important. Bus lines, bike paths, you name it, States have a lot more flexibility and there are many more uses on the various components of transportation that make up the totality of 
transportation instead of just highways. 
Again, that was a vision of the Senator from New York that put in place that concept 6 years ago and is continued and improved upon in this bill. That is why we named it ISTEA II, and the next one, I am sure, will be ISTEA III. 
There is no Senator who, as I said, is more interesting and can contribute more than the Senator from New York. We deeply appreciate it.

Mr. BAUCUS. If the Senator will yield, I will enthusiastically describe the contents of the amendment so Senators know what it is. 
The amendment, it is true, has not been finalized in its final form but it certainly will be very quickly, and I might say to my good friend from Rhode Island, it is a very good amendment because it is an amendment which does not take money from other programs, as has been said by opponents. It is an amendment that does not require any additional spending, a claim sometimes made by its opponents. 
I might also say that the proposed amendment to be offered apparently by the Senator from New Mexico to be cosponsored by the Senator from Rhode Island which is an amendment that I think will cause much more mischief than is currently realized because under that amendment it gives vast additional powers to the Budget Committee above which that committee now has which would necessarily take it away from the authorizing committees. 
In addition, that amendment the Senator described in conjunction with the Senator from New Mexico would also be very mischievous because it would require reauthorizing committees to go back and at least go to conference with the House every year on the highway bill, which would be the cause of all kinds of disruption. 
I urge Senators to be very careful and not be taken in by the language of that amendment. 
Again, the amendment we will provide will not mandate additional spending this year or any other year and will not take dollars from any other program that are important to people. It only says if there are savings next year beyond those provided for by the budget resolution, and if there is discretion of the Budget Committee and the Appropriations Committee that those committees want to spend on highway, that is their discretion. I think the Senators will find it is a very good amendment and it is good for the country.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join Senators Chafee and Warner in bringing the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1997 to the floor. 
What will the bill do? It will help this Nation meet its growing transportation demands. It will help reduce congestion. Make highways safer. Make our economy more efficient. Ease travel for businesses, farmers, and families on vacation. Develop new transportation technologies for a new century. And protect our environment as we do it.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I first want to give by deepest respects and thanks to the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, Senator Chafee. He has put together a bill that has passed our committee unanimously 18 to 0. Not many committees can come up with a unanimous vote on major bills. 
But since that bill passed the committee, it has become quite apparent that some Members want us to improve upon it. So we are going to try to do that with this amendment. So, I am going to give five reasons why I think the amendment offered by Senator Gramm, Senator Byrd, Senator Warner, and myself is such an improvement to this bill. 
First, as has been pointed out, the dollars we are discussing are trust fund dollars. I would point out that the American motorist who pays these fuel taxes expect those dollars to go into transportation, including highways. 
Second, despite what some are going to state on this floor later, this amendment does not break the budget. Let me repeat that. It does not break the budget. 
Third, despite what some might say later, this amendment does not take one penny--as Senator Byrd mentioned, `not one thin dime'--from any other program. 
Fourth, this amendment is needed to meet our infrastructure needs. We are not spending enough in America to maintain our transportation system and our highways. We certainly are not spending at the level of other countries. 
And fifth, a point which I do not think is fully understood by Senators, the amounts provided for in the committee bill lock the Senate into those amounts for the next 6 years. So it is important that if we are going to increase spending that we do so now. Unlike some other spending programs, this program is funded from a trust fund. 
So this is a much different animal, and therefore this amendment must be addressed and hopefully passed. So let me elaborate on my five points. Mr. President, I think it is clear, when people pay their fuel taxes, they expect those dollars to go to their highways and transportation so we have the best transportation system in the world. There is not little dispute about that. I filled up my gas tank this morning coming to work. I know how expensive it is. Today about 18.4 cents of a gallon goes to Federal taxes, and then there are D.C. taxes and State taxes. There are a lot of taxes that go into the cost of a gallon of gas. All we ask is that these taxes are used for transportation. That is what we want, and that is what we expect when we pay our fuel taxes at the pump. 
I must remind Senators that the balance in the highway trust fund is increasing. Every year it is increasing. American motorists are not getting their money's worth. 
Why is it not being spent? It is not being spent because it is being used to mask the true Federal deficit. That is why it is not being spent. A lot of appropriators and the budget folks around here like those big balances in the trust funds because it masks the true deficit. Again, I say. If this amendment does not pass, the balance in the trust fund is going to continue to grow dramatically over the period of this bill. So Americans should know that when they pay their fuel taxes today, they are not being spent. A lot of it is just accumulating. It is a charade. It is a phony game that is being played with American taxpayers. Using fuel tax revenue to mask the true budget deficit is not right and it is not fair. And I have argued this many times. 
To my second point. This amendment in no way breaks the budget. Now, there are going to be some on the floor later, perhaps today or later, saying, `Oh, this breaks the budget.' It does not break the budget. It does not break the budget at all. 
Why? Because all this amendment does is raise the contract authority or authorizations. It would increase contract authority by $31.6 billion over 5 years. This is the 3.45 cents of the 4.3 cents just transferred to the trust fund on October 1. The amendment would provide new contract authority beginning in 1999. But it does not tell the Budget Committee this year or next year that they have to raise transportation spending. It does not tell the Appropriations Committee to raise budget caps. It does not touch the budget resolution or obligation limitations for highways. Again, it is just contract authority. Therefore, it does not break the budget. It does not require any additional spending. The 
amendment just says that if the projected savings from OMB are realized, and if the Congress decides to spend these savings, then they should be available for transportation. 
It does not require that spending increases. It just says that the Congress may spend more for transportation if there are new savings and if Congress agrees to spend them on transportation. We are just increasing contract authority. That is all. We increase contract authority by $31.6 billion over 5 years. So, again, this does not break the budget. Yes, we will have at least one point of order. But is not a point of order that we have increased spending. It is a point of order that the Environment and Public Works Committee has exceeded its contract authority allocation. That is all. But that is a minor technicality. What really counts is, does it require any additional spending? The answer is no, not one cent of additional spending is required. It does not break the budget agreement in any way. I cannot make that point enough. 
Point 3. Does this amendment take anything away from any other Federal program? Some are going to claim that it does. The answer is not one red cent. Nothing is taken away from other programs--nothing. Now, someone may claim that it will. They are going to say that. Not true. Not true at all. 
Again, because this amendment only provides for raising contract authority. It does not increase spending. I say again, Congress must still decide to spend any new savings, if those savings are in fact even available. It is clear that if today OMB projects a savings, that savings may be greater or lower next year. But if that is the case, Congress may choose not to increase spending at all. That is fine. Again, the amendment will only provide new spending if savings are available and if Congress decides to spend them. 
Again, this amendment takes nothing from any program at all. To my fourth point, the infrastructure needs of this country. I will talk about this in greater detail when we debate the amendment. But I do want to state that the Department of Transportation says that there is about a $15 billion annual deficit in combined infrastructure spending in America. We in America spend far less on highways and infrastructure than other countries do as a percent of their gross domestic product. Japan spends four times what we do. European countries spend at least twice as much. 
I fear that if this amendment does not pass, 6 years from now we are going to find that our highways in America have deteriorated more. We will continue to fall behind. Our highways and transit systems are not all in good shape today. There are a lot of bridges in our country that need repair. There are a lot of roads in our country that need repair. I just cannot emphasize too much how important it is for America to have the best highways and transportation system if we are going to remain competitive. We need to pass this amendment to make progress on our transportation needs. 
And to my fifth point. Let's not lock into the contract authority numbers that are in this bill unless we have to. Let's have this vote and see what happens. I think the case is there to increase transportation spending. We need to do it now and not wait. 
So I will sum up, Mr. President. I want to again thank all who have worked so hard on this amendment, particularly the authors of the amendment. They have come up with a very sound way of solving the problem of needing more money. Again, it does not break the budget in any way. And it does not take any dollars from any other programs. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. BAUCUS. In 1990, we enacted 2.5 cents to deficit reduction. In 1993, the 4.3 was passed. In 1995, due to pressure from the public, we undid the 2.5 cents so that went to the highway trust fund. And right now, because of the public pressure, we are going to put the 4.3 cents in the trust fund. 
In the past, Congress has diverted, but the public is now telling us--and we enacted in 1995 to put 2.5 cents back in the trust fund, and now we are putting 4.3 cents in because the public wants it back in the trust fund.

<TEXT>
Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Senator. This is basically a discussion here on the bill. Obviously, it is the goal of the committee and the Senate to come up with a fair highway bill. That is what the Senator from Rhode Island is attempting to do and the Senator from Virginia, who was on the floor, the Senator from Montana, and the two Senators now speaking seek that same goal. It is also true that we are in a transition. 
This country is changing. The country, in 1997, is not what it was in 1987, not what it was in 1980. The fact is that, in 1991, in an ISTEA bill, the highway bill, this Congress essentially did not update data. It just took the 1980 data. That is, lane and miles traveled, vehicle miles traveled. We even used a postal roads component which was enacted maybe at the turn of the century. We used very old data when we wrote the ISTEA bill that we are now currently operating under. It is just unfortunate. 
At the same time, in the earlier ISTEA bills--not the one before us, but current law and the earlier one--the main effort was to complete construction of the interstate system. That was the main purpose of the program in the first place. 
The current ISTEA bill--not the one on the floor, but current law--based its formula essentially, as I said, on old data and upon completion of the interstate program, and that is what we did. 
In 1991, we just built upon the earlier data, which was data for the completion of the interstate. And in this last ISTEA, we then apportioned more dollars to States which were completing their interstate system, compared with States that were not completing their interstate system. And the current law basically completes construction--not maintenance, but construction--of the interstate system. And so now, in 1997, the new transportation bill we are writing is one that recognizes that the interstate system has been completed. We are now moving toward maintenance and intermodal systems, intelligent highway systems, and other programs to modernize, update, and make sure that the current transportation bill is no longer based upon older data, but rather is based upon current data. 
That means that those States that got a lot of interstate completion money in the last several years are not going to get the same additional dollars in this bill for the very simple reason that their interstates are completed. On top of that, many States built their interstates financed with tolls. That is, Federal dollars were not sent to those States; rather, those States charged their motorists tolls and they built their own interstates, feeling that either they wanted to do it earlier or that way was a better way to do it, et cetera. A lot of these States, after completing construction of their interstate systems, based upon tolls, have now come back to the Congress--in fact, in the last ISTEA bill, they were able to convince this Congress that they should get reimbursed again, even though those interstate systems were paid for by tolls. This Congress paid Federal money again on top of the completion of the interstate. 
So we have some States with lots of dollars in the last several years of the interstate system--that is, States with lots for interstate completion and States with what is called interstate reimbursement dollars going to those States. I know this is not a comfortable position for some of these States to be in when they look at only the dollars because, obviously, those States would like to have a percentage increase again in the current years over the past dollars they have been receiving, even though their interstate construction, which is more expensive in maintenance, is complete, and even though those States got interstate reimbursement dollars on top of interstate systems that were financed by toll roads. 
So here we are trying to write a bill which recognizes, again, the completion of interstate construction and rather moves toward the current new era which, as I mentioned, recognizes the completion of the interstate construction. Now, the Senators make a very good statement and point when they talk about congestion and the number of miles--the amount of congestion on I-95 or on the eastern corridor. In fact, as the Senator from Maryland said, Maryland ranks second in the Nation in urban congestion. That is a fact. The State that ranks No. 1 is California. New Jersey is not too far down the list. 
My thought here is that we have the challenge before us of trying to address what I think are legitimate concerns and that is the congestion factor that the Senators talk about. We are operating under very severe constraints; that is, the amount of dollars in this ISTEA bill is pretty tight, based upon the budget resolution, the President's proposal to Congress, and the increase in ISTEA dollars in this bill is not as much as was the increase in ISTEA dollars in the last ISTEA transportation bill. So it would be my thought that we find a way to amend this bill so that, in effect, if not this year, at least next year, there are potentially more dollars available, and in a way that certainly it may recognize the concerns of the Senators. 
I am not prepared at this point to say what that might be. There needs to be more discussion to determine that. But I think that if the amendment that we know is going to come up is passed, there might be a way to address that. You certainly have the assurance of this Senator to work in the context of that amendment to see if we can potentially address some of the concerns the Senators have. But the main point is that we are trying to work this all out. We hear what you are saying. There are many opportunities: there are amendments, there is a conference, and it is my hope that we can pass a bill which is fair to all regions of the country. You have my assurance that I will do all I can to achieve that goal.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr President, I rise today in opposition to the Treasury, Postal, and general Government appropriations bill. I do so with respect for the managers of the bill, my good friends Senator Campbell of Colorado and Senator Kohl of Wisconsin. They have done a fine job of bringing divergent interests together, crafting a bill that takes care of essential Government functions. Clearly, there is much that is right with this bill. 
One thing that is right is funding for the Global Trade and Research Program at the Montana World Trade Center in Missoula, MT. This vital program is the only world trade center housed in a university. This important link will allow new global business markets to be identified and targeted to create new jobs in Montana. 
But, Mr. President, I will vote against this bill because it contains a pay raise for Members of Congress. Look, I'm not against pay raises. Who couldn't use a few extra dollars in every paycheck. The question is: who needs the raise. Clearly, Montanans do. And I think with this bill we are missing the point and sending the wrong message. 
The message this bill sends is simply `we are going to protect ourselves instead of creating an economy that protects average families.' That just doesn't make sense. 
A vote to raise Members' pay is the wrong priority for Congress. This is not the kind of leadership the Congress needs. I believe that we will be as effective as leaders as the level of confidence vested in us. Clearly, voting to raise our pay will undermine public confidence in Congress. Particularly when we have an economy that isn't protecting average Americans. 
It is clear that income for the average Montanan is not rising. Just Monday, the Census Bureau released consumer income statistics for 1994 to 1996. The numbers are startling and, I hope, a call to action for this Congress. Let's look at Montana. Median household income in Montana from 1994 to 1996 was $28,838. That's household income, money that an entire family has to spend for the year on bills, groceries, education, health care, and all the other expenses that take a bite out of their wallets. Montana's median income for those 3 years is over $6,000 lower than the national average and ranks 43d in the Nation. 
And, compared to our regional neighbors, our median income ranks as the lowest. Now, we have all seen the stock market rise over the last few years. And clearly, a healthy percentage of Americans are making significant money. But it hasn't trickled down, to borrow a phrase, to the average Montanan. 
I grew up on a ranch where it was a day's work for a day's pay. Americans work hard. And we in Congress work hard, but let's not lose sight of who we work for. We work for the citizens of our States and our country. We have a responsibility to protect them and to advance their ability to get a fair wage for a fair day's work. That should be the job of this Congress, not whether we in this Chamber are getting a raise. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, first I want to thank my very good friend and colleague, Senator Bumpers, for yielding the time. It is very gracious of him. He has waited a good period of time to offer his amendment. 
Mr. President, I rise today to call on Congress to complete the New World Mine acquisition and protect Yellowstone National Park. Now that the administration and congressional leadership have reached a budget agreement that allows for the acquisition of the New World lands, we need to move decisively. We have belabored this matter much too long and now is the time to finish the job. 
Yellowstone National Park was created 125 years ago. `For the Benefit and Enjoyment of the People.' Indeed, this is the entrance at mammoth Yellowstone Park. You probably cannot read the inscription over the arch but it says `For the Benefit and Enjoyment of the People.' And of course, immediately to my right is the Old Faithful geyser. 
Every year, Mr. President, 3 million people visit the park, bringing their children and grandchildren to enjoy the unspoiled beauty that is Yellowstone--from the Roosevelt arch, which I am pointing to here on my right, at the original entrance, to the breathtaking grandeur of Old Faithful, to the spectacular wildlife which calls this unique place home. 
During the month of August, I was fortunate to be present to celebrate Yellowstone's 125th anniversary with Vice President Al Gore. As I entered the park, I remembered my first trip to Yellowstone many years ago. The noble and majestic geysers, the boiling paint pots, and the vast scenery were the stuff of magic to a small child--and remain so today. 
These wonders cannot be seen anywhere else in the United States or, for that matter, in the world. I guarantee you there is not one Montanan, young or old, that does not fondly remember his or her first visit to the park, or anybody in our country for that matter. Finishing the New World acquisition is critical so our children may witness the wonders of nature, much as we have over the past 125 years. 
For the past 8 years, America has lived with the threat that a large gold mine could harm Yellowstone, our Nation's first national park. This mine, on the park boundary, could irreparably damage the park by polluting rivers and devastating wildlife habitat. 
In 1996, local citizens, the mining company itself, and the administration, reached a consensus agreement that would stop the proposed mine--they all agreed; the administration, the local community, and the company--and it would protect Yellowstone and surrounding communities. 
This agreement provides for the Federal Government to acquire the mine property from Battle Mountain Gold in exchange for $65 million. The balanced budget agreement calls for this money to be appropriated from the Land and Water Conservation Fund. 
The New World agreement, I think, is very important for two reasons. First, it protects Yellowstone National Park for future generations. What could be more important? 
Second, it protects my State of Montana. It protects Montana's natural heritage, but it also protects Montana's economy. 
Many of the local communities surrounding Yellowstone depend on the park for their economic well-being. If the mine had been built, Yellowstone would have been harmed, and with it the communities and the families that depend on Yellowstone for their livelihood. It is for this reason that a majority of local citizens and businesses oppose the mine and support the agreement. 
In addition, the agreement obligates the mining company to spend $22.5 million to clean up historic mine pollution at the headwaters of the Yellowstone River. This will create jobs and clean up the environment, thereby benefiting the regional economy and improving locally fisheries. 
As a Senator representing Montana, I will fight to ensure that Montana receives these benefits. 
The bipartisan budget agreement provides an increase of $700 million in land and water conservation funding. Of this increase, $315 million has been designated as funding for priority land acquisitions. 
It is my understanding in speaking with the administration and with others that the New World and Headwaters acquisition were specifically discussed as the projects that would be funded by the $315 million designation. It would be unconscionable for Congress to violate the spirit and the intent of the budget agreement by failing to appropriate the funding necessary to complete the New World acquisition. 
In addition, placing further restrictions such as requiring authorization is both unnecessary and unwise. We need no additional authorization. The agreement has been agreed to already. New legal procedures, on the other hand, would just stall an already reached agreement, one that is widely supported and one that protects the park. 
Every year, numerous land acquisitions that are not individually authorized take place utilizing Land and Water Conservation Funds. By attaching strings to this acquisition--it is an authorization--Congress will have done nothing but endanger Yellowstone National Park. Indeed, the President's senior advisers strongly object to attaching any strings to this funding, and if Congress insists on stalling and delaying this agreement, the President may well veto the Interior appropriations bill upon the recommendation of OMB and other agencies. Because Yellowstone is at stake, he would be right to do so. 
I pledge here today to help lead the charge to uphold that veto if necessary. When Yellowstone and Montana's heritage is threatened, I will not sit idly by. We can and we must protect Yellowstone National Park. 
I thank my good friend, the Senator from Arkansas, and I yield the floor.

The bill we are introducing today represents a real victory for bi-partisan, commonsense improvements to the Endangered Species Act. 
The Endangered Species Act has been an important tool in our fight to conserve ecosystems and to prevent the extinction of species. But over the years, experience has shown that the act can be improved, both for the species it is designed to protect and for ranchers, farmers, and other private landowners. 
Senators Chafee, Reid, Kempthorne, and I have been working, along with the administration, for the better part of 2 years to find agreement on changes that will improve the ESA on the ground, where it really counts. 
The bill we are introducing today incorporates several major improvements to ESA. Let me just reiterate a few that I think are particularly noteworthy. 
First, it improves the use of good science in our decisions on listing species. It's important that we elevate the role of scientific information in our decisions on whether to put species on the endangered list. An error at this stage in the process can mean extinction for a species. 
Second, the bill really turns the focus of the ESA to conserving and recovering species. It puts real deadlines on development of recovery plans and gives States a greater role in developing those plans. And it insists that we have benchmarks for measuring progress toward recovering the species. 
Third, the bill opens up the process to the public. More public hearings will be held on critical issues, such as whether to list a species and what actions should be taken to recover the species. And, most important, these hearings can't be just in Washington. They must also be in the States most affected by the issue. 
Fourth, the bill takes important strides in cooperating with landowners to conserve species. It encourages landowners to take voluntary steps to improve habitat and protect species on their property. And it seeks to conserve species before they become endangered, thereby avoiding the need to list them. 
The bill also provides landowners with something they have never had before, technical assistance and financial aid for the new conservation agreements that are created by the bill. 
These are the kind of improvements that will make the ESA work better. That will better protect species and that will help landowners. 
It's been a long, hard road to reach this agreement. And I want to again thank Senator Chafee, Senator Reid, Senator Kempthorne and Secretary Babbitt for their persistence throughout this process. 
I look forward to taking this bill to the committee and to the Senate floor.

Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I rise today to speak on the importance of funding for the National Endowment for the Arts, otherwise known as NEA. This endowment makes a tremendous impact on my State, and it worries me greatly that Congress is considering slashing it, or otherwise killing it through block grants. 
I think President John Kennedy said it best when he said--and I will quote him now: 
When power leads man toward arrogance, poetry reminds him of his limitations. When power narrows the areas of man's concern, poetry reminds him of the richness and diversity of his existence. When power corrupts, poetry cleanses, for art establishes the basic human truths which must serve as the touchstone of our judgment. 
The people of my State understand that. Montana boasts a rich cultural heritage which can be seen in the work of such notable artists as Charlie Russell and Kevin Red Star. Our love of the arts can also be seen in the rich crop of literary talent that blankets the State. 
I had a chance to witness that love of the arts firsthand last year when I worked with the National Symphony Orchestra on their trip to Montana. They broke into many, many groups--I think there were 120 different ensembles spread across our State--and I was fortunate to be able to conduct the National Symphony Orchestra in their encore performance in Billings, MT. 
I think it is even more instructive to look at a smaller, more constructive event where the NEA makes a real difference every year in Montana. Shakespeare in the Park is a group of talented actors who travel around the State every summer offering free productions of Shakespeare to the public. And every July, for over 20 years now, they have come, for example, to Birney, MT. Guess what the population of Birney is. Seventeen. 
The troupe of actors sets up their stage just outside of town on Poker Jim Butte. They perform two nights, and it is a big deal for the people of Birney. They hold their annual Birney Turkey Shoot for Spakespeare in order to help subsidize the productions. Every year they attract crowds of 100 to 200 people. Not bad for a town with a population of 17. The audience usually consists of farmers, ranchers, and native Americans. They are people who, without this event, might have to travel over 100 miles to see a Shakespearean play. This year's productions were Shakespeare's `Love's Labor Lost' and Moliere's `Learned Ladies'--two classic works that everyone should have a chance to see. 
The Shakespeare in the Park program relies on the NEA grant they receive every year, and without it they would have to limit where they can go. That means that Birney might not get to see its yearly productions on Poker Jim Butte. 
I think the responses to the Shakespeare in the Park productions speak for themselves. One parent, for example, said: 
I want to thank you so much for coming to Richey. We are a small community with a total enrollment, grade and high school, of 91. It was great to introduce our children, especially the high schoolers, to Shakespeare and acting. It is rare for them, and us, to attend something other than a sports event. 
Or listen to what another student had to say: 
I have never had an interest in Shakespeare until I saw your program. 
Madam President, I think this last quote is particularly insightful, particularly in this day and age when many people are afraid that the value of our great works has been diminished. Funding the NEA shows our commitment to the classics like Shakespeare, and it helps make sure that our kids can learn firsthand about these valuable works. 
There are some in this body, however, who believe that Federal funding for the arts should end. These people believe that Federal funds can be replaced by contributions from private citizens and corporations. While this might be true in populated areas like New York and California, States like mine would have no way of making up the loss. I make that very clear. It just is not possible. 
Quite simply, without the NEA, there are no arts in places like Birney, MT, or countless other communities across the country. 
There are some who argue that we cannot afford to fund arts programs while we are cutting the budget. But when one looks at the total amount of money we spend in our budget, the figures for the NEA are rather small. The $99 million the NEA received last year was merely a small fraction of the total budget. That comes to less than 40 cents per person. But when one looks at all the great returns from our investment in the NEA, I believe it is money very well spent. 
Finally, there are others who say the NEA should be defunded, eliminated, because it funds obscenity. I believe those are valid concerns, and I have to admit there have been a few poor choices in the past. But I believe that those problems have been addressed, and it would be a shame to focus on a few mistakes when there are so many good, worthwhile projects that the NEA has made a reality. 
A complete list of Montana projects, museums, and artists who benefit from the NEA grants would be too long to give, but the following is a small example of the recipients: 
Eight symphony orchestras in cities like Billings, Bozeman, Butte, and Missoula; over 20 nonprofit art museums and galleries such as the Liberty Village Art Center in Chester, the Jailhouse Gallery in Hardin, and the Hockaday Center for the Arts in Kalispell; and nearly 20 performing arts groups like Shakespeare in the Park and the Vigilante Players who tour to communities all across Montana. 
In addition, the NEA funds go to organizations which make an effort to reach out to children, to educate them on the importance of arts in our society. 
Without a doubt, NEA funding has made a real, positive difference in Montana. That is why I believe we should continue funding this worthwhile program. 
My basic philosophy toward the budget is this. We must have a budget that reflects our values. To have no funding for the arts truly takes away some of our humanity, some of what makes our Nation great. Those are not the values I want my budget to reflect. That is why I urge my colleagues to support full funding, with no block grants, for the National Endowment for the Arts. 
Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we Americans are very lucky. We live in the most beautiful place on Earth. Our mountain chains, our Great Plains, our national parks, our coasts and forests are a heritage no other country can match. It is our responsibility, through this annual bill, to protect our heritage, to manage it so ranchers and the natural resource industry workers prosper and, as much as possible, to hand it down to the next generation 
At the same time, in this bill, we have a responsibility to keep our promise to our more than 500 Indian tribes and an opportunity to support and stimulate the creativity of our artists and authors. Unfortunately, this bill falls far short. 
If we act now, in the coming debate--if we adopt some good amendments, we can create a very good bill, something we can all be proud of and, just as important, something President Clinton can sign, so we are not just wasting our time over here. But if we fail to improve this bill, we will have a bill that doesn't measure up and will not become law. 
Let me begin by saying that this bill is quite good in some areas. For example, one of the West's real glories is its fishing. Norman Maclean spoke for quite a few Montana families when, in the opening lines of his book `A River Runs Through It' he writes, `In our family, there was no clear line between religion and fly fishing.' 
Today, this way of life is under threat. A parasite now found in many western rivers threatens the fish with whirling disease, and the Interior budget makes a commitment to protect these fish. It funds the Fish Technology Center in Bozeman, MT, as well as the Creston fish hatchery in the Flathead Valley. As well, this bill contains crucial research dollars for the nationally recognized Wild Trout Research Laboratory at Montana State University. It also provides $1 million to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to fund the western Montana project, which will acquire conservation easements to protect land in Montana's Blackfoot Valley, where Norman Maclean grew up, the basis for his book and movie, `A River Runs Through It.' These are just a couple of important projects that I believe help both Montana and the country. 
I would like to address a few sections in this bill which I think must be improved. The first crucial issue is the New World Mine. Of all our country's natural treasures, the finest might be Yellowstone National Park. It is America's first national park, home to the world-famous Old Faithful geyser, Yellowstone Lake and its wild trout, paint pots, mountain streams, and America's only free-ranging buffalo herd. 
Several years ago, a Canadian company filed a patent to mine land in the mountains just north of Yellowstone Park. Such a mine, nearly 2 miles in the air, would have been a permanent threat to the park's water resources. Every generation of Montana children and every American child would have lived with it. Last year, the Clinton administration worked out an agreement to buy out the New World Mine, using the Land and Water Conservation Fund. 
Congress agreed to do that when we passed the balanced budget amendment. I am very pleased that the Senate followed up with $700 million in new funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund; a wise investment in the conservation of our prized natural resources. 
I am disappointed, however, that the House of Representatives failed to live up to its end of the bargain when they failed to appropriate the necessary funds. I must say, I am disappointed that the Senate appropriated the money but then attached language requiring authorization. There is no reason for that. The deal is done. It is fair to the company and it will protect the park forever. To add an extra hurdle to an already tortuous process is unnecessary, and, in fact, it is foolish, because it may put the whole New World Mine deal at risk. I will work in this debate to change that.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, the Senator who now has the floor has led the way in developing a very balanced, very fair way to spend our highway dollars over 6 years. My staff has worked long, long hours along with his staff and that of Senator Chafee. I want all Americans to know just how much I appreciate the very, very hard work of the Senator from Virginia who has led the way among the three of us in developing, I think, a terrific bill. I compliment him, and I want all Virginians to know all that he has done, as well as all Americans.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, let me start by thanking the chairman of the committee and the chairman of the subcommittee for their fine work on this bill. Their efforts have produced a bill that will build upon and improve the current transportation bill, ISTEA. 
The bill we will introduce shortly is a good bill. It is a balanced bill. It is a national bill. And while it may not be everyone's idea of the perfect bill, it is a solid start for the Senate debate. 
When we began developing the legislation, I had three principal goals. I am pleased that this bill meets all three: 
First, the bill is fair to all regions of the country. It recognizes the diverse transportation needs of all regions of this country--Western States, Southern States and Northeastern States. And it includes programs and funding to meet those needs. 
Second, the bill streamlines today's complex transportation programs while still retaining the integrity of ISTEA. 
We have consolidated funding categories--yet maintained funding requirements for all portions of the transportation system, including interstate highways and our bridges. 
Third, the bill gives State and local officials back home greater flexibility to deliver transportation services efficiently. 
I also am pleased that the bill retains an emphasis on the National Highway System, which includes the Interstate System. These are the most important roads and bridges in the country and they deserve the priority this bill gives them. 
Finally, we have retained important programs on air quality and enhancements. 
The chairman rightly points out that the bill does not bust the budget. Under the bill, spending for transportation will increase substantially over the next 6 years. Yet it is consistent with the budget resolution. 
But as I have said before, I believe those levels are too low. They simply cannot meet today's very real transportation needs. So as we move forward in the Senate, I hope we can identify ways to attain a more appropriate level of funding. 
In conclusion, this bill will keep our economy growing, while it improves the safety of our roads and bridges, and protects our environment. 
I look forward to moving this bill through the Senate and I again thank my colleagues for their hard work on this measure.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce important legislation providing for the permanent authorization of the Food Animal Residue Avoidance Databank [FARAD] program. I am joined by 15 of my colleagues and I hope the Senate will pass this legislation very soon. 
Mr. President, food safety has long been of tantamount importance to the veterinary profession and to the American consumer. Customers rightly expect that the food they purchase is of the highest quality. More importantly, consumers must know that the food they consume is safe. And our veterinarians work to help consumers in this endeavor. This legislation is designed to help Americans maintain their safe, wholesome food supply. 
In 1982, the U.S. Department of Agriculture Extension Service undertook an educational effort to prevent chemical residues in food animal products. That same year, the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service [FSIS] sponsored a Residue Avoidance Program as a repository of residue avoidance information and educational materials. 
FARAD was founded as a cooperative, multi-State effort by Drs. Stephen Sundlof of the University of Florida, Jim Riviere of North Carolina State University, Aurther Craigmiller of the University of California, Davis, and William Buck of the University of Illinois. Each investigator brought a unique expertise to the collaboration. Since that origin, FARAD has evolved into an expert-mediated residue avoidance decision support system which is crucial to food safety across the Nation. 
FARAD provides an invaluable service to the animal health profession, helping veterinarians provide appropriate, science-based therapy--improving animal health while preventing food safety risks to consumers from residues. FARAD's computer-based decision support system is designed to provide livestock producers, pharmacists, and extension specialists with immediate access to practical information on drugs, pesticides, and environmental contaminants which hold the greatest potential for residue formation in livestock food products. 
Since its inception, FARAD has published three handbooks and two practical software products, while maintaining a telephone hotline and an internet access site--all devoted to providing the information necessary to protect the livestock food system from contamination. 
Through the USDA Extension Service, FARAD has received approximately $200,000 per year since its inception. These funds have been awarded on the basis of competitive grants, relying on matching funds from the participating universities. However, for the universities providing this valuable service the price has been too high. It is time to provide adequate Federal funding to accomplish this vital work. 
FARAD provides a vital service across the country. Congress must now express its support for this tool which can help maintain the well-founded confidence of the American consumers in their food supply. 
Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting this valuable legislation and I urge its adoption.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I think that the American people essentially want us to do the right thing. They care less whether it is the Democratic policy or the Republican policy. They care less whether it is conservative or liberal. Essentially, they say, `You folks back there in Washington, come together, do what's basically right, what's within the realm of reasonableness. Just get your job done. If you do that, you're doing a pretty good job.' 
Mr. President, I think that is what happened here. We Democrats like to claim lots of credit for this legislation. A lot of us talk about the 1993 Deficit Reduction Act, which I do think is the cornerstone which led to declining deficits and allowed the American economy to begin to prosper, interest rates dropped, with inflation rates lower, unemployment rates lower, et cetera. Republicans like to claim that, oh, no, they are the ones that basically did all this. After all, they are the majority party in the Congress right now. 
But the truth of the matter is that it is the combination of both sides working together to reach this agreement. And even more truthful, we have a big assist, and that is the national economy. The economy is doing very well. We all know that. And that enables President Clinton to negotiate with the Republican majority in the Congress, and with all Congress for that matter, an agreement which makes most people pretty happy. 
That is, it cuts taxes. When the economy is doing very, very well, the U.S. Government is bringing in more revenue than it usually does, and it is easier to cut taxes. That is what we have done here. We all like to have our taxes cut. 
Second, there are additional spending programs in here. One big one is education, which is very needed in America. We must invest more in education. All of us know that. If we are going to compete with countries around the world and we are going to increase the quality of living for all of our people, it is critical that our young people get a better start and a better education. We spend quite a bit of money in this bill on education, whether it is direct spending or tax credits. 
So the economy has helped us very much. I wonder where we would be today, Mr. President, if the economy were not doing well today. Would we be balancing the budget as quickly? Would we be working as well together? Would there be as much peace and harmony on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue? I see the occupant of the Chair shaking his head in the negative, and I agree; we would not be doing as well. The economy gave us a big boost. We are here, in some respects, because of that. 
I, like most Members of this body, support this conference report. It does do basic things which are important. No. 1, it moves us toward a balanced budget. We are going to have a balanced budget at least by the year 2002. My guess, Mr. President, is that we will probably reach a balanced budget before the year 2002. In fact, the projected budget deficit for this year is to be as low as $50 billion. So we will balance the budget. We will be living within our means. That is no small matter. 
We also have tax cuts which help small businesses and help families around our country and help the country generally. That is good. This bill also keeps hospitals and clinics open in rural America. I mention rural America because my State tends to be rural, and we have been working for many years to be sure that we have quality health care in our part of the country, as well as in the cities. 
This will also help make sure America's children have health insurance. Not too long ago, we passed the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill, which would disallow preexisting medical conditions as a condition for denying insurance to insureds. That helped to buy more health insurance for programs. We also allow for something called portability; that is, if a person has health insurance, he can carry it to his next job. We Americans don't have the world's best health insurance program. Other countries insure their people a little bit better than we do. But the one area this bill addresses is health insurance for kids, which is very important and critical. All of us here are very happy for that. 
The bill has some drawbacks and I will address a couple of them later on. By and large, the benefits far outweigh those drawbacks. Let's start with the good news. 
As work on this agreement began earlier this year, I set a few basic priorities for myself by which to judge the final result of this bill. One was that this bill must balance the budget, it must help small businesses, and it must promote education--those were all priorities of mine--and, finally, it must be fair; that is, the distribution effect of this bill must be fair to all Americans. On the whole, I think this agreement reaches those criteria. 
First, we will see a balanced budget by the year 2002. It might even be earlier. But to be realistic, this bill deserves only a bit of the credit. I believe that the 1993 budget bill made the real tough choices, and that was the bill that began us on a glide slope toward a balanced budget. It was a tough bill. We took some tough medicine back in 1993. But that laid the foundation for where we are today. It brought us from a deficit of $290 billion in 1992 to a deficit of perhaps just $35 billion this year. So we started this effort with most of the work already done. This is just a small finishing-up effort on that 1993 bill. I must say, a booming economy is helping us as well. 
Second, this bill goes in the right direction on taxes. That is, it lowers taxes. Overall, it will cut taxes by $90 billion over 5 years. That is not a revolutionary change, but it is significant, and it is going to help make a difference to some people. Particularly, the $30 billion in education tax credits is going to help families send their children to college. That is going to help. 
By cutting the estate and gift tax, we will help farm families, small business owners, and ranchers all across our country keep their land and their businesses and their operations in the family. That is very, very important to the people in the State of Montana. We have a lot of farmers and ranchers who have virtually no return on their investment, virtually no cash flow, but their land values are accelerating because some people are moving to Montana--wealthier people--which are pushing up land values. 
Relief in Federal estate and gift tax is critical. We phase in 100 percent health insurance for the self-employed, and that means a lot to small business people, self-employed people who can't take nearly the same deduction in taxes and health insurance they pay compared to people who work for big companies. Generally, in America, the more you work for a large corporation, the better your health insurance policy, because your employer takes the full deduction for the health insurance policy. If you are self-employed, you don't get that; you have to pay for it all yourself. We began a couple of years ago to phase in a deduction for the self-employed. This legislation will bring that to a full 100 percent, albeit over the next 7 years. 
A capital gains tax reduction is very important. That should help savings and investment in our country. 
With respect to health care, this agreement also means significant accomplishments, essentially by providing $24 billion for health insurance and services for working children. This is $8 billion more than the original plan, and it is paid for with a cigarette tax that will create its own health benefits by reducing smoking. 
We also set up a new limited-service hospital program, modeled on the Montana Medical Assistance Facility, or MAF's, which allows hospitals to keep their doors open in small towns. The MAF is a proven success in many communities like, in my State, Circle, Culbertson, Big Timber, and Ekalaka, and this agreement will make those MAF's permanent. This will also slow a two-decade-long trend that has closed nearly 10 percent of all rural hospitals. 
We also allow rural family practice residency programs that are just getting started to expand. That is very important. Montana's two residency programs, one in Billings and other in Glasgow, are critical to attracting doctors to our State's rural communities. It makes sure that rural areas get fairer managed care payments from Medicare compared to the big urban areas. 
And not least, we objected to proposals in the last Congress to make large cuts in Medicare and abolish Medicaid's guarantee of health insurance for poor people. 
But the agreement is not perfect. I would like to note four areas where I think it falls short. 
First, it contains many special interest tax provisions. This means a much more complicated Tax Code and more tax advantage to wealthy people and big companies who can hire large numbers of lawyers and accountants. This tax bill makes our Tax Code much more complicated, unfortunately. We should return to this issue in the future and work to simplify the Tax Code and eliminate loopholes. 
Second, it includes unreasonably tough cuts in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements to health care providers. These reimbursements make up an average of 55 percent of Montana hospital revenue. And the smaller facilities, with under 30 beds, already are collecting, on average, over 4 percent less in revenue than their costs. It is tough to squeeze these facilities any further. 
Third, it misses a chance to improve our national transportation infrastructure. I, with Senator Warner, and 80 other Senators, requested extra money for highway and transit construction. That money would have meant safer travel and a more productive economy. But this agreement does not have that. 
It does move the 4.3-cents-per-gallon motor fuel revenues from the Treasury to the highway trust fund. But for accounting reasons--that is, the lack of an offset--that is only phantom money. It will not mean any real change in the highway and transit budget, and I regret that. I alert my colleagues that when we take up the transportation bill after the August recess, we are going to realize how much we regret that. 
Finally, this bill ducks some of our long-term fiscal challenges. As we look 15 or 20 years ahead, we know Americans will live longer. So the bills we pay for health care and pensions for older men and women will be much higher than they are today. 
With the healthy economy and a good fiscal situation we have today, we could have taken some steps now to ease the problems this situation will cause the next generation. This agreement doesn't take those steps. It is a missed opportunity. I wish we had taken this opportunity. 
But on the whole, this is a reasonably good effort. It does balance the budget. It helps small business and families. It makes sure America's children have health insurance, more than today. Those are very important things for our country, and we ought to get them done. So I support the agreement, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. 
I might say at this point, Mr. President, how much I appreciate the bipartisan efforts, particularly of the chairman of our committee, Chairman Bill Roth, who worked very, very diligently to help make sure that both sides of the political aisle worked well together. That doesn't always happen in this body. There are some committees where that doesn't happen much at all. But Chairman Roth, chairman of the Finance Committee, did work very hard to bring both sides together, and I think that is one reason we are here today finally with this bill. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, this week the United States Trade Representative will conduct a set of talks on China's accession to the World Trade Organization. Their results will have a great effect on our trade policy for years to come. So this afternoon I want to take a few minutes to discuss the reason these talks are important, the state of United States-China trade, and a strategy that can help improve the situation. 
The reason these talks are important is simple. China is a big market, a big exporter, and a country with which we have a large and difficult trade agenda. By virtue of population, only India equals China as a potential export market. And China's economic growth, at nearly 10 percent a year throughout this decade, is unmatched in the world. 
Much of this growth has come from trade. Twenty years ago, China barely participated in world trade. It is now the world's sixth largest trader and is now our third largest source of imports after Canada and Japan. If you count Hong Kong together with China, the figures are even more impressive. 
But our American export performance to China is very poor. The Commerce Department reports $11.7 billion in goods exported in 1995, $12 billion in 1996, and on track for the same level this year. Adding exports of services, the total is about $2 billion larger, but the trends are no better. 
By contrast, our exports to the rest of the world have grown by 18 percent since 1995. So despite China's size, despite China's economic growth, our export performance is weak and China's importance as an export market relative to other countries is rapidly declining. 
We should be doing much better than this. There are two reasons for our weak performance. The first is that many of our own policies appear designed to cut our exports to China. And the second, larger problem, is Chinese protectionism. 
We will start with the first point. Because while bringing down trade barriers takes a lot of work and hard negotiations, we can fix our own mistakes pretty easily. And let me offer three examples. 
First, we bar trade promotion programs like the Trade Development Agency, OPIC, and sometimes the Eximbank from operating in China. The Senate took a good step forward by passing my amendment last week showing the Asian Environmental Partnership to work in China, but we have a very, very long way to go. 
We refuse to sell nuclear powerplants to China. This is foolish enough when we see that France and Japan are pushing nuclear powerplant exports in our absence. And it is almost surreal when you consider that we are actually giving nuclear powerplants to North Korea. 
We have an antiproliferation law that embargoes electronics exports if China sells missiles. That is, if China misbehaves, we sanction ourselves. This will not work. If we are serious about reducing the trade deficit, if we want a trade policy that creates jobs in America, we cannot routinely prevent ourselves from exporting. 
That is part of the solution, but not the whole solution. Because while fixing our mistakes are important, structural economic issues and Chinese trade barriers do much more to cut our exports. 
To date, we have used our own domestic trade law to solve our problems, section 301 and Special 301, to bring down trade barriers, the antidumping and countervailing duty laws to fight dumping and subsidies. This policy won some results, and if necessary we should continue using it into the future. But it is a slow and frustrating policy which addresses individual, specific problems rather than the full spectrum of trade barriers. We need a more comprehensive approach. And we have it in China's application to enter the World Trade Organization. 
WTO rules address most of our China trade problems, from tariffs and quotas to subsidies and distribution. If China accepts these rules, our trade future may be much brighter than the present. So I regard these discussions in Geneva as critically important and view China's entry to the WTO on commercially acceptable grounds as very much in our national interest. 
But these talks come with risks. If we sign a bad agreement, whatever we miss will stay there a long time. In that case, we should never expect much from the China market. And we would set a dangerous precedent for other reforming communist countries from Russia to Ukraine to Vietnam which hope to enter the WTO. 
To this point, China has not made acceptable offers. And if they will not do it this week, we need to be patient. We need to hold out for a good deal. And a good deal basically means four things. 
First, it means market access. Today, Chinese tariffs rise to 120 percent for cars and 80 percent on beef. They must go down, way down. We need much less restrictive quotas, abolition of unscientific barriers to agricultural products, like the unfounded claims about `TCK smut' on our wheat, an end to unpublished quotas and regulations, no more unfair inspection rules, and an open market for services. 
Second, we need an agreement by China to accept basic standards of trading behavior. Trade regulations must be the same in every port and province all across China. Intellectual property must be protected and technology transfer requirements outlawed. Restrictions on national treatment must go. The government must abandon policies requiring investors to export all or part of their product rather than selling it to the Chinese. And restrictions on trading rights must end. 
Third, there are subsidies. We need clear and visible separation between ministries, officials, and public taxes on the one hand and private business on the other. 
And we need to preserve our safeguards against export subsidies and dumping. Our antidumping law has special rules that calculate dumping from noncompetitive economies. This is the right policy, given the present state of economic reform in China, and we need to keep it in place. 
Fourth, results and enforcement. China, as a large partially reformed economy, presents questions the GATT and WTO have never encountered. So we ought to have some benchmarks to measure success, including objective measures of Chinese imports, and a prearranged system of consultation if we see things going wrong. And when problems arise, if they do, we must be ready to enforce our rights. 
Of course, a good WTO accession works in both directions. And that brings me to the third part of a better China trade strategy. 
As GATT and WTO members, we have always, as Americans, accepted one basic commitment; that is, MFN for all members, permanently and without conditions. If China agrees to a good WTO deal, the Chinese have the right to expect us to fulfill this commitment to them. It is good policy on the merits. It is also the fair and honorable thing to do. 
The right trade policy toward China is clear. We must end restrictions on export promotion. We should bring down China's trade barriers through a fair WTO accession agreement, if we can, and through laws like Section 301, if China is not ready to make a good offer. When China does make a good offer, we should live up to our own responsibilities by making MFN status permanent. It can begin this week. 
Thank you, Madam President. 
Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, later this year the 166 countries that signed the 1992 climate change treaty will meet in Kyoto, Japan. They will be seeking stronger measures to control a potential threat to the future of our planet and to the lives of everyone living today and children yet to be born. 
The threat is easy to understand, even if the science is complicated and a bit uncertain. In hearings before the Environment and Public Works Committee earlier this month, a panel of respected scientists gave us their assessment of the problem. 
They told us that man-made emissions of greenhouse gasses, such as carbon dioxide, have led to a distinct warming of the Earth over the past 100 years. More troubling, however was their prediction. 
If left unchecked, the continued growth in these emissions, which trap the sun's heat, will have potentially serious effects. These consequences include shifting climate patterns and more frequent violent weather events, such as floods and droughts. 
Now most areas of the country experience extreme weather conditions from time to time. But permanent shifts in climate patterns can seriously alter our lives and our economy. 
For instance, in an agricultural State, such as Montana, the prospect of more flooding and longer dry spells is a threat to the livelihood of our farming and ranching families and their communities. And, if weather patterns change, crop yields can be seriously decreased. 
These kinds of threats to our future are serious enough that we must take action to avoid them. We can begin by controlling our greenhouse gas emissions. And if we start with modest steps now, instead of waiting, we will likely avoid any serious economic disruptions. 
In 1992, the Rio summit asked developed countries to lead the way. The climate change treaty committed these countries to voluntarily reduce their emissions of carbon dioxide to 1990 levels by 2000. 
Unfortunately, the voluntary actions didn't work. The good intentions of most countries never translated into concrete results. So if we are to control these emissions, the new treaty must contain binding limits on emissions. 
However, we also need to make another change in the 1992 treaty. 
We certainly need binding controls on developed countries, which currently emit about 60 percent of global greenhouse gases. But we also need them on developing countries, which are responsible for the remaining 40 percent. 
We simply can't reach a solution by addressing only 60 percent of the problem. Furthermore, unless all countries participate, we run the risk of giving our economic competitors an unfair advantage. 
Yet developing countries are resisting such efforts. So how can we change their thinking? Perhaps by broadening our own. 
Let me take one country, China, as an example. Why China? For one, because over the next 20 years, China will be responsible for one-third of the increase in greenhouse gas emissions. 
For another because the United States has a lot of issues to deal with China on. Trade, human rights, regional security, and environmental protection, to name a few. 
So despite fundamental disagreements on some issues, we share many mutual interests, including climate change. 
China has more people potentially at risk from rising sea levels and violent weather than any other nation. It also has an urgent need to increase its domestic energy supplies. If we consider the broad array of interests we share, I suspect we will find ways to gain their support on climate change issues. 
After all, China is a growing part of the problem, it must be part of the solution. 
Another aspect of encouraging developing nations to participate in new emission controls is to include in the treaty flexible, market-based strategies, such as joint implementation and emissions trading. 
Market-based strategies have been very successful here at home. For instance, the acid rain program in the 1990 Clean Air Act included trading of sulfur dioxide emissions credits. 
This program stimulated technological innovation. It also reduced sulfur dioxide emissions at a cost that was less than one-tenth that predicted by industry. 
By including similar programs in a climate change treaty, we can achieve greenhouse gas reductions at the lowest possible cost. It gives U.S firms the flexibility to comply with emission targets in a way that makes the most sense for them. And it will protect our worldwide economic competitiveness. 
For developing countries, emission trading can give them access to new technology and financial support that will make it easier for them to comply with their new obligations. 
The language contained in Senate Resolution 98 will help achieve the goal of including all countries in the new treaty. 
It requires that the treaty mandate new specific scheduled commitments to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions for developing country parties within the same compliance period as developed countries. 
But since developing and developed nations are starting from different places, it makes sense to require different targets. Here again, the language crafted by Senator Byrd helps. It does not specify that developed and developing countries meet the same targets and timetables. 
When Under Secretary of State Tim Wirth recently appeared before the Environment and Public Works Committee, he spoke in support of Senator Byrd's resolution. I believe he said it was `largely on the button.' He added that the administration `very much agrees with the thrust of what [Senator Byrd] is saying related to developing country commitments.' 
So although the language of the resolution requires new commitments from developing countries, the administration should seek emission targets that are more consistent with their level of industrialization. 
I plan to follow the treaty negotiations carefully to be sure that developing countries have agreed to commit to controlling their greenhouse gases. 
And while the resolution unfortunately omits any mention of the need for market-based strategies to achieve the emissions targets, I believe the treaty must include them. They simply make much more sense for all countries than the command-and-control approach being advocated by some. 
In closing, Mr. President, let me say that the toughest issues for democracies to handle are those in which the threat to society builds gradually, but inexorably, over time, such as with global climate change. We deal well with immediate crises. 
My hope is that by debating this issue today, by passing this resolution, we will elevate the public discussion about climate change and avoid the need for a future crisis to spur us into action.

 Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a man who spent his life and career working on behalf of Indian tribal governments and ensuring that the United States fulfilled its trust responsibility to Indian people, Marvin Sonosky of Alexandria, VA. On July 16, Mr. Sonosky died of heart failure. He was 66 years old. I join his many friends in mourning the loss of one of Indian country's greatest advocates. I would like to convey my sympathy to his wife, Shirley Freimuth Sonosky, and his daughters Judith Kreisberg, Joann Hirsch, and Karen Hecker and his seven grandchildren and one great grandchild. 
Mr. Sonosky was born in Duluth, MN, and received his undergraduate and law degrees from the University of Minnesota. After 4 years of private practice, Mr. Sonosky came to Washington in 1937 and joined the Lands Division of the Department of Justice where he served for 17 years. As a special assistant to the Attorney General he frequently argued before the U.S. Supreme Court. 
In 1951, Mr. Sonosky returned to private practice. In 1976, he formed the firm of Sonosky, Chambers & Sachse, where he practiced until his death. He remained active in the trial practice of the firm through the last week of his life. 
Mr. Sonosky was a unique individual in this city in that he was one of the best advocates in his field yet he never sought the accolades or tributes that so many seek. Instead his tribute came from knowing that every day that he worked he had the potential to improve perhaps just one Indian person's life. 
I would like to share with this body some of the many legislative initiatives involving Indian tribes that were the brainchild of Mr. Sonosky. These are but one measure of the impact that he had in improving the lives and opportunities of Indian tribal governments and their people and ensured that the United States stands behinds its trust obligations to them. 
Following devastating losses of Indian reservation land and its resulting poverty, Mr. Sonosky worked with Congress to secure the enactment of federal statutes that returned over 1 million acres of undisposed surplus lands within those reservations to the tribes--the resources from these lands have been vital to the economies of many of these Indian communities. 
Mr. Sonosky also brought to the attention of Congress the need to amend Federal law authorizing Indian tribes to recover just compensation for lands taken by the United States so that the damages awarded would not be unfairly diminished by the value of food and rations that the United States had promised in exchange for the lands it acquired. When Government officials unlawfully offset welfare claims against trust funds of individual Indians, Mr. Sonosky successfully challenged the practice in Federal court. He subsequently worked with Congress to ensure that all individual Indians who had been harmed by this practice were properly reimbursed. 
While much of Mr. Sonosky's congressional efforts focused on righting past wrongs, an equal part of his work resulted in legislation that will protect Indian rights for generations to come. 
Through his efforts Federal law that had previously allowed States to assume jurisdiction over certain matters on Indian reservations was amended to expressly require tribal consent prior to application of State jurisdiction. And, most significantly, when limitations contained in the statutes governing Federal court jurisdiction effectively barred Indian tribes from invoking that forum to vindicate federally protected rights, Mr. Sonosky successfully developed and advocated for a Federal law that today vests Federal courts with jurisdiction to adjudicate any claim brought by an Indian tribe. 
The honor of the Nation with regard to our obligations to Indian people has indeed been well served by Mr. Sonosky. We will miss him dearly.

 Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, in today's world, trade doesn't stop at the borders. Whatever business you're in, and whether you operate a Fortune 500 company or a small family farm, every day you have more opportunities and more competitors overseas. 
That's why an organization like the Montana World Trade Center is so valuable to our State. We are a small business State. We have small timber mills, environmental technology firms, Indian manufacturing companies, and family farms. 
And, Mr. President, our Fortune 500 companies may well have all the information and all the connections they need to succeed in world trade. More power to them. But a small Montana farmer, or a specialized high-techology business, simply doesn't have the money and manpower to keep up with overseas opportunities. 
Even at the most basic logistical level, the paperwork and customs forms associated with imports and exports can be too much for a small business to handle. Additional burdens include finding foreign partners in faraway countries--and while Canada makes up about half our exports, other Montana markets range around the world, from Kuwait to the Philippines to Bangladesh. 
So our Montana farms, ranches, and businesses can gain a lot from the world marketplace. But they often need expert assistance in finding likely markets and partners abroad. And they need early warning when foreign competitors try to take advantage of them--as one firm found a Chinese company pirating its hunting decoy designs and advertising them in sportsmens' magazines. 
That is what the Montana World Trade Center provides. And the $2.5 million grant included in this bill will help the center meet that goal. It will help Montanans compete in the world marketplace and export more effectively. That is critical to our State's economic future. So this grant is a good investment that will pay off in new exports and more jobs. 
I hope the Senate will approve it.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Hutchinson amendment, which is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution stating that we should revoke China's most-favored-nation status. 
MFN status should not be a political issue. It is nothing more than the normal trade status we give virtually all our trade partners. But if we are to consider MFN a political issue, a look at the facts shows that MFN for China is legally right; it is morally right; and it is right for our American national interest. 
Why? First, and most simply, renewal of MFN status is right under our law. 
The Jackson-Vanik law has governed renewal of MFN status for non-market economies since 1974. It conditions MFN on two things--the existence of a bilateral commercial agreement and freedom of emigration. And under the law, the President's choice is clear. We have a bilateral trade agreement signed with China in 1980. And China allows free emigration. Therefore, as a legal matter, the President was right to renew MFN and we should back him up. 
Second, renewing MFN status is morally right. 
At times people in Washington are tempted to see a vote to revoke MFN as something which might promote human rights in China. That is a fine sentiment. Senator Hutchinson's remarks indicate that human rights is the central reason he wants to revoke MFN status. But while those who advocate revoking MFN status to promote human rights are well-intentioned, if we actually went ahead and revoked MFN status we would see the opposite of what they intend. 
To revoke MFN status, very simply, is to raise tariffs from Uruguay round to Smoot-Hawley levels. To take one example, that means raising tariffs on toys and stuffed animals from zero to 70 percent overnight. That hits one of China's major exports to the United States, at about $6 billion worth last year. And who makes them? On the whole, young Chinese working people trying to improve their lives. 
What will happen if we revoke MFN status? The result should be obvious. Millions of innocent Chinese workers in toy factories and other walks of life would lose their jobs. The Chinese Government would certainly be hurt, but the lives of these workers would be ruined. 
So, far from improving human rights, revoking China's MFN status would cause immense human suffering. And as the Senator said, we would be sending the Chinese people a message with his resolution. But it would not be a message of support--it would be a threat to put them out of work. 
And of course, that would discredit our human rights efforts with the Chinese public. No rational person can expect anyone in China to thank us for harming their economy and inflicting misery on them, their families, or their fellow citizens. 
By contrast, if human rights is our motivation, MFN is an irreplaceable part of any effective policy. As the Democracy Wall activist Wang Xizhe--until recently a political prisoner--says: 
* * * the goal of exerting effective, long-term influence over China can only be achieved by maintaining the broadest possible contacts with China, on the foundation of MFN, thus causing China to enter further into the global family and to accept globally practiced standards of behavior. 
A long-term policy may emotionally be hard to accept. There are real human rights problems in China. About 3,000 political prisoners remain in jail. 
Strict limits on freedom of assembly. Very severe policies in Tibet. The Senator from Arkansas is right to be concerned about these issues. We would like to solve them all in a day. But the fact is, that won't happen. This resolution will not help us solve these problems. Only by staying involved, through trade and human exchange as well as diplomacy, can we hope to make a difference. 
Finally, we are Americans first and we are responsible to the American public on our policy decisions. And renewing MFN status is right for our own national interest. 
And let me give perhaps the most important example. I visited Seoul, South Korea, and Pyongyang, North Korea, during the last 
Memorial Day recess. And I can say from firsthand experience that we have a very complex, very dangerous situation at hand in the Korean Peninsula. 
North Korea is a politically isolated government, with very severe food and economic problems, and a large and well-armed military machine. We just considered an amendment addressing the most recent provocation by North Korea. We have a commitment to joint defense of South Korea, and 37,000 men and women permanently on the line just a few miles south of the DMZ. 
I spoke with their Supreme Commander, General Tilelli. I met with some of the enlisted men. I got a threat briefing from a young Army major from Wolf Point, MT. 
If you go there, you know how seriously these men and women take the responsibility we have given them. You see it in their faces. It is a very dangerous place. And we here in the Senate owe it to them to pursue a very serious, responsible policy that can keep the peace, and ensure a swift victory if, God forbid, there is any conflict. 
Chinese cooperation is absolutely essential to that. China is the largest country, with the most powerful army, in the region. It is probably the only country that can help make sure the North Korean Government understands the realities on the peninsula. It has played a critically important role in restraining North Korean military aggression and in preventing nuclear proliferation. And deliberately antagonizing the Chinese Government and armed services by continually threatening to revoke MFN will not help at all. 
You can go on from there to many other issues. Take trade. We need a more fair, more reciprocal, better trade relationship with China. We have an opportunity to do that this year by bringing China into the World Trade Organization on a commercially acceptable basis. Cutting off MFN status would put us on the opposite track--it would balance trade at close to zero, cutting off jobs and prosperity here as well as in China. 
And as we look into the next century, we must work to slow global warming, ocean pollution, and loss of biodiversity. To take just one statistic, in the next 20 years, world greenhouse emissions will grow from 6 to 9 trillion tons a year. Fully 1 trillion of the additional 3 trillion tons will come from China. 
We have a chance now to moderate that trend. And a political crisis caused by revoking MFN would make that mutually beneficial effort very difficult. 
Our own common sense should tell us China is a key player on all these issues. Wantonly picking a fight with the world's largest country by revoking MFN status, when only six countries in the world lack MFN status and we give 151 countries and territories tariff rates better than MFN, would be foolish. 
And our allies tell us the same thing. During my trip last May, I met top national security officials in the South Korean Government. I spoke with senior officers of the Japanese Self-Defense Forces. And I met with Chinese dissidents and democratic political leaders in Hong Kong. 
These are our friends. Our strategic allies. People we work with every day. People who wish us well. Not a single one of them supported revoking MFN status. Not a single one. 
The right course to take is very clear. We should reject the Hutchinson amendment. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my outrage over an incident that occurred in my home State last May. Over the Memorial Day weekend, vandals on the Missouri River destroyed the Eye of the Needle Arch, as well as several other stone pinnacles nearby. 
Lewis and Clark, camping in the traditional homeland of the Blackfeet Indian Tribe, first noted these structures in their historic journal which, I might add, is replete with misspellings: `Seens [sic] of visionary inchantment [sic]' and `eligant [sic] ranges of lofty freestone buildings,' describing the Eye of the Needle Arch along the Missouri River. 
Former Montana Senator Lee Metcalf had the foresight to designate that stretch of the Missouri as `wild and scenic,' thus ensuring that generations of Montanans would marvel at these wonders. 
But what took Mother Nature millions of years to painstakingly carve out was destroyed probably in a matter of hours. The actions of the vandals have been decried in both local and national newspapers, and the people of Montana have been united in their condemnation of the acts. People have donated over $10,000 in reward money for information leading to the arrests of the individuals responsible. I rise today to add my voice to those who cry out for the loss of a true Montana treasure. 
My motivations for speaking on this subject are personal. To me, the Eye of the Needle was a symbol of what makes Montana the `Last Best Place.' Its improbable existence was a miracle of creation and a testimony to Montana's rugged spirit. 
I plan to float the Missouri this weekend. I will see firsthand what has become of this treasure. In many ways, I am not looking forward to the experience. 
To know that this landmark was destroyed by human hands gives me pause to think on the absolute senselessness of the act. Tearing down a marvel of nature is not a statement of defiance, not a statement of courage, or even machismo. No, it is simply an act of raw brutality, an act of utter stupidity. 
In every cloud, there is a silver lining, and though it is not easy to see in this case, there is a positive lesson to learn from this incident. In an ironic way, we have gained a deeper appreciation for the wonders that surround us. They are precious; they are fragile. Perhaps this incident will remind us to protect the things that are near and dear to our hearts. For all our sakes, I hope this is the lesson we learn. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Dodd-McCain amendment. 
For the past 11 years, we have experimented with the policy of `certifying' foreign countries as cooperating or failing to cooperate with our efforts against the international narcotics trafficking. That is a fair test for any policy. And it appears to me that the certification policy simply isn't working. 
Many countries we have decertified--Burma, for example, or Afghanistan--now produce significantly more narcotics than they did before. Cocaine, heroin, and marijuana are at least as easy to find on our streets today as they were in 1986. It is clear that, at best, our decertification of these countries did nothing to stop them and their mafia organizations from producing narcotics. 
So certification has been an ineffective policy. And the Dodd-McCain amendment takes a sensible approach--it does not abolish certification, but suspends it while we try to work out a more effective approach. If there is nothing better out there, certification will go back into effect. 
Finally, in my view, annual debates over whether to certify various foreign countries has distracted us from the more fundamental problems we face here at home. That is, enforcing the laws. Putting drug dealers in jail. Rehabilitating drug users when possible. And stopping kids from trying drugs in the first place. If we can do those things, the actions of foreign countries will still be important, but they will be secondary issues. 
So I think Senator Dodd and Senator McCain have a good idea. We should take a second look at a policy that doesn't work very well. We should try and find a better one if we can. And we should get back to basics and solve our problems here at home.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this is a short, simple amendment dealing with our China policy. It has the support of the State Department; business; and Chinese dissidents. I hope it will also get the support of Congress. 
The amendment, very simply, allows the Asian Environmental Partnership to operate in China. It does not add any spending to the bill, and does not change the basics of the program in any way. So I hope this will not be controversial. 
Let me begin with a review of what the Asian Environmental Partnership does. AEP is a small export promotion program created during the Bush Administration. It offers technical help with environmental policy, and brings foreign governments together with American producers of environmental services and technologies. 
In several Southeast Asia countries, AEP has helped us achieve environmental goals and to boost American exports to a region where we suffer large trade deficits. But the Asian Environmental Partnership does not now operate in China. That is because it receives some funds from the Agency for International Development, which is barred from operating in China. 
It is very clear, of course, that we do not need a foreign aid program for China. China has a lot of money and is quite capable of supporting itself. 
But it is just as clear that we need a sound approach to environmental problems in China. Whether you look at water pollution, urban air, rural lakes and streams, or hazardous waste, China is one of the world's most polluted countries. That causes a great deal of suffering for Chinese people. And as China grows, it makes more and more contribution to global climate change, ocean pollution, and other phenomena which affect China's neighbors and even us here in the United States. 
We in America can help ease these problems. We can provide some humanitarian relief from needless suffering caused by unsafe water, air and waste. We can help protect ourselves from future environmental threats. 
And we can gain some benefit for ourselves in the process. We are among the world's most competitive producers of environmental goods and services, and with some effort we can create a large foreign market for our companies. 
That brings me to the second reason we need this amendment. That is, we need an export promotion policy for China. 
Last year, we exported about $14 billion worth of goods and services to China, while importing about $51 billion. So we had a $37 billion deficit. This year's figures look no better. 
The main reason for this deficit is the massive set of tariffs, discriminatory inspection standards, quotas and other trade barriers erected by the Chinese government. But a second reason--one which we don't really like to admit to ourselves--is that we do very little export promotion to China. 
Germans, Japanese, Southeast Asians and other competitors push exports as hard as they can. We don't match their efforts anywhere in the world, and we do worst of all in China, where agencies like AEP can't operate. There is no doubt that costs us. 
This is basically common sense. It is good for everyone. For no additional money, this amendment will help us export and improve our trade balance. It will help us deal with some very difficult environmental problems. And it will, to some extent, supplement our human rights goals by making life in China a little better. 
That is why this amendment has gotten very broad support. The State Department supports it. American environmental and business groups support it. And Chinese dissidents, support it. Let me quote from a letter I received from the China Strategic Institute, founded by former political prisoner Wang Juntao: 
The China Strategic Institute is pleased to learn of your efforts to bring the US-Asia Environmental Partnership to the People's Republic of China. Not only can such a program assist China in combating the severe environmental degradation that plagues the Chinese population, but also . . . the development of civil society. I strongly hope that this amendment finds the support to become law. 
To sum up, with this amendment we can do something good for everyone. By passing it, we can promote American exports. We can do something good for the Chinese people. We can promote the interest of both countries in a healthy environment. And we won't spend any more money. So I hope the Senate will support it. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the nomination of Joel Klein to be Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice. And while I will vote to bring this nomination to the floor for a vote, I will outline my concerns for the Senate at this time. 
Mr. President, a number of my colleagues have expressed their serious concern about this nominee. More importantly, they have detailed the responsibilities of this position. This position has a statutory responsibility to enforce the antitrust authority of the Department of Justice. 
As my colleagues have eloquently stated, this is particularly important and timely in regard to the telecommunication reform regulations which are being promulgated to enforce the reforms enacted into law last year. While these reforms should bring great benefits to consumers across the country, the Department of Justice must play an active role to protect the interests of consumers against violations of antitrust authority. 
This is also important in the meat packing industry. The mergers which this industry has experienced have left livestock producers at the mercy of precious few meat processors. Just five packers control this industry. Producers and consumers alike need to know that the Department of Justice is enforcing antitrust law. 
There have also been a number of mergers in the railroad industry which have virtually eliminated competition in this transportation sector. For a State like Montana--a captive shipper--this is a problem. Montana farmers pay freight rates that are among the highest in the Nation. It generally is cheaper to ship grain from States east of Montana to the ports of Portland or Seattle, than it is for Montana producers. Without careful attention, I worry that this discrepancy could get worse, not letter. 
Mr. President, I will be supporting this nomination. I have long relied on a very simple question to determine my support or opposition for a nominee for a Presidential appointment. Is the candidate qualified? In this case, I believe the President's choice is qualified and has no reason we should delay confirmation. 
So I will be voting for this nominee. And, when he is confirmed, I will be watching the issues under the jurisdiction of the Antitrust Division very carefully.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer an amendment to the Department of Defense authorization measure providing for the conveyance of the Havre Air Force Station and Training Site in northcentral Montana to the Bear Paw Development Corp. 
These two facilities comprise over 90 acres of real property. Seventy-seven buildings are located on the property, including 45 single family homes. The U.S. Air Force deactivated these facilities in 1993 although it has maintained the facilities since that time. 
Members of the Bear Paw Development Corp. include Hill, Blaine, Liberty, and Chouteau Counties, the cities of Havre, Chinook, Harlem, and Fort Benton, the town of Chester and the Fort Belknap and Rocky Boy's Tribal Governments. It was officially recognized by the U.S. Economic Development Administration in 1968 and has received similar recognition from the State of Montana as well. 
Bear Paw Development provides a variety of community and economic development services to its members including helping local governments plan for infrastructure improvements and secure needed financing. It also provides training and technical assistance to businesses through the Small Business Development Center and the Montana Microbusiness Program. 
My amendment provides that Bear Paw will convey the single family homes as well as several other buildings to the Box Elder School District adjacent to the Rocky Boy's Reservation and the Hays/Lodgepole School District on the Fort Belknap Reservation. Both school districts will use the buildings for classrooms and school facilities. 
In addition the Human Resource Development Council in Havre will receive eight homes which it will use to house the homeless. 
The real property and remaining structures will be utilized by Bear Paw for local economic development projects. 
Mr. President, this conveyance results in several important benefits: Relieving the Air Force and taxpayers of the responsibility of preserving deactivated facilities, helping local school districts provide adequate and safe school facilities for their students, and promoting economic stability and growth in northcentral Montana. Truly all parties will benefit from this transfer. 
Thank you for your consideration.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Chafee, the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, in supporting an amendment to S. 936, the Defense Authorization Act. This amendment will reauthorize and improve a law commonly known as the Sikes Act. The amendment will reauthorize the law through the year 2003. 
The Sikes Act authorizes the Secretary of Defense to manage fish and wildlife and other natural resources on military lands. The Department of Defense controls nearly 25 million acres of land at approximately 900 military installations. These lands encompass all major land types in the United States and include habitat for threatened and endangered species, historic and archaeological sites, and other cultural and natural resources. 
Senator Chafee and I have been working, in consultation with the Senate Armed Services Committee, to reauthorize and amend the Sikes Act, a law within our committee's jurisdiction, for a number of years. Unfortunately, we were unable during the last Congress to draft amendments that were acceptable to the Interior Department, the Department of Defense, and the International Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies. I am pleased to say that this amendment has the support of all three. In addition, a nearly identical version was recently passed by the House on the House Defense Authorization bill. 
This amendment requires the Secretary of Defense to prepare integrated natural resources management plans for military installations, unless the Secretary determines that preparation of a plan for a particular installation is inappropriate. Plans are to be prepared, in cooperation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the State fish and wildlife agency, within 4 years after the date of enactment. I urge all three agencies to work closely together, taking full advantage of their respective resources and expertise, to develop mutually acceptable plans to conserve fish and wildlife and other natural resources on our Nation's military installations. Finally, the amendment establishes annual review and reporting requirements to ensure that required plans are prepared and implemented. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to repeat my interest in including funding in the reconciliation bill which would facilitate our schools' efforts to acquire computers and become connected to the Internet. 
If our students are going to be fully prepared to face the next millennium with computer skills adequate to the task of competing in a global economy, I believe we in the Federal Government have a responsibility to ensure that our schools have every opportunity to acquire computer equipment. 
The House Ways and Means Committee reported a bill which includes funds for an enhanced charitable deduction for those who donate computer equipment to the schools. As you know, based on the experience I have had helping schools in Montana acquire computer equipment, I have been working on a somewhat different approach which provides a tax credit for companies that give a price discount to schools purchasing new equipment. 
I ask the chairman to work with me during conference to evaluate the House Ways and Means proposals and my proposals to increase schools' access to the Internet.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the tax relief legislation before the Senate. 
This is a complex bill. Chairman Roth has done a superb job in working with a vast range of issues and many different groups of taxpayers to produce a generally good bill. And to explain why, I will start by putting numbers aside and reviewing the broad principles our tax policy should reflect. 
First, our tax policy should pay the bills. 
Second, it should be simple and predictable. 
Third, it should be fair. 
Fourth, it should promote growth. 
And fifth, it should be as low as possible. 
Let's begin with the first. We need to pay the bills. To take Alexander Hamilton's words from Federalist 30, government must: 
 raise troops, build and equip fleets * * * [and pay] for support of the national civil list; for * * * debts contracted, or that may be contracted; and, in general, for all those matters which will call for disbursements out of the national treasury. 
These latter disbursements now include health insurance for seniors and the poor. Social Security checks. Highways, education, veterans benefits, scientific research, clean air, clean water, and more. Essential services the people want and should have. 
But we also need to pay for them. And in the past the government hasn't entirely paid for them. In 1992, our budget deficit stood at $290 billion. But in the past five years we've done much better. This year, the deficit will be under $65 billion--a fall of nearly 80 percent. 
And this bill will take us the rest of the way. By the year 2002, it will balance the federal budget. It will pay the bills. 
Second, it will help make our Tax Code fairer. One very important example is our large cut in the estate and gift tax. 
This tax is one of the prime causes of misery for farmers and small businesses today. These businesses hold small Montana towns and rural counties together across the generations. And by imposing very high-tax rates and equating land or asset values with large cash inheritances, the estate and gift tax often force families to sell them when an owner dies. 
To cite one particular example, let me quote from a letter I received just last week from a veterinarian who runs a small clinic in Kalispell. He fears that: 
if I grow my business any more my heirs will have to sell it to pay estate taxes. 
That fear runs from Kalispell clinics to ranches in the Judith Basin to small businesses in every Montana town. And it extends much further. When small businesses, farms, and ranches leave the family, their entire neighborhoods lose something very special. It is not right, and it is not fair. 
And this bill will help us put a stop to it. It will let Montana's family-owned farms and businesses exclude up to $1 million in farm and business assets from the estate tax, allow 20-year installment payments for businesses with majority family ownership, and make other reforms that help make sure that young men and women can keep their family businesses in the family. 
Third, with respect to simplicity, this bill will mean a much improved Tax Code in one very important area. That is international taxation. 
Today, businesses are international. Agriculture is international. Companies in air services, entertainment, high technology and basic manufacturing are international. They comply with Tax Codes in other countries. They hire people all over the world. They work with suppliers and customers in different countries. And our international tax laws, mostly drafted in the 1970's, don't recognize this. 
At that time, trade made up only about 12 percent of the American 
economy. Today it is over 30 percent and growing all the time. And tax provisions which assume that international businesses are a rarity don't make sense any longer. They often make American companies less competitive, and sometimes even create perverse incentives that push firms to avoid hiring American citizens in foreign operations. 
This bill will help bring our Tax Code into the 21st century. Not all the way, but part of the way. It changes the passive foreign investment company provisions to eliminate overlaps with other tax provisions. And it ensures that Foreign Sales Corporation treatment applies to software as well as other copyright works. 
But I must say with some regret that on the general principle of simplicity, this bill is not an advance. 
Our Tax Code today relies on several dozen different income taxes, payroll taxes, excise taxes, Federal Reserve deposit interest receipts, tariffs and Customs fees, corporate taxes and user fees to make up its $1.5 trillion in revenue. 
That is confusing and complicated enough. Then add in the 135 major tax credits, deductions, exemptions, exclusions and deferrals, totaling over $500 billion in tax expenditures last year. And it gets even worse. 
And this bill will not improve the situation. In fact, in some respects it will worsen the problem by adding to the diversity of tax provisions. That's a drawback--not serious enough to devalue the bill as a whole--but one we must frankly admit and return to in coming years. 
Fourth, the bill will help promote growth. 
How can we do that? First, by promoting investment for the future. Helping companies create new technologies, new products and new manufacturing processes. Providing some incentives to start firms and create jobs. And improving our basic infrastructure. 
With this legislation, we do all those things. 
We extend the research and development tax credit for two and a half years. 
We use targeted capital gains tax cuts as an incentive for investment in small businesses--the sector which presents the greatest risks and rewards, and which creates the most new jobs. 
And we will directly increase our essential public investment in infrastructure by moving the 4.3 cents per gallon in Federal gas tax revenues from general revenues to the Highway Trust Fund. 
And most important of all, we will help educate our children. Give them the chance for college. Help them work with new technologies. Make sure the next generation of Americans has the highest level of skills and education in the world. 
With this bill, we create a $20 billion HOPE scholarship. We create a new deduction for interest paid on student loans. Promote life-time learning by making the exclusion for employer-provided educational assistance permanent. 
Our legislation is not perfect on education. I believe we can and should go further on college opportunity. But it is much better than the status quo. 
And let me make a related point. That is, with this bill we help make sure children are ready to learn. We do this by providing $24 billion in this bill and the accompanying entitlement bill for children's health. Today in Montana, about 27,000 have no health insurance at all. Millions more around the country. 
That is a moral scandal and a threat to our future. Today in Montana, a typical health insurance plan for a family of four, with a $500 deductible and a partial dental benefit--costs $5,580 a year. That is simply out of reach for many working families. 
And we have put together a package with a lot of money for States to insure more kids. Through Medicaid, through assistance for private insurance, or other options that fit a State's circumstances. This is will make our country stronger and healthier in the future, and it is the right thing to do for our kids today. 
Finally, the last principle. Taxes should be low. 
And this bill will make taxes lower. Over the next 5 years, it will reduce overall taxes by $85 billion. 
Small businesses will get some more capital to help them invest and grow. 
Farmers and ranchers will find it easier to pass their land on to their sons and daughters. 
Families with young children will have some more money to spend at the movies, or in bookstores, or in contributing to charities. 
Parents will find it a bit easier to send the kids to college. 
That's a good thing for everyone. 
In conclusion, Mr. President, this bill lives up to the principles we should expect of our tax policy. 
It will pay the bills and balance the budget. 
It will make taxation fairer. 
In some ways, although it could be better, it will make taxation simpler. 
It will promote growth. 
And it will make taxes lower. 
On the whole, it is a solid, careful, bipartisan bill. And we should be proud of it. I congratulate the chairman for his work, and I hope this bill will get the Senate's support.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, earlier today, Senator Harkin introduced legislation dealing with the recent agreement between States and the U.S. tobacco industry. Senator Harkin's provision says simply that the payments from tobacco companies to States should not be tax deductible. 
I applaud this effort, and I want to speak for a few moments on the subject and how we might proceed from here. 
Last week, a number of State attorneys general reached an agreement with several American tobacco companies. The agreement will compensate the States for their Medicaid spending on people who suffer from smoking-related illnesses, like lung cancer and emphysema, with $368 billion in payments over the next 30 years. It is also supposed to include measures to protect the public health and provide tobacco companies with protections against future losses. 
Congress must soon be asked to pass a law implementing this agreement. Because the agreement is very large and very ambitious, we will need a lot of time and study and consultation before we can reach a final judgment. But let me start with a basic principle. 
I think we all would agree that a fair negotiated agreement is much better than litigation. 
But the key word is `fair.' The agreement must be fair to States as they pay Medicaid expenses, fair to the Federal Government as it pays for Medicaid and Medicare, fair to kids, fair to the public, and fair to the taxpayers. 
Initially, my reaction to the first point is that we should give the attorneys general a lot of deference on fairness to States. After all, they negotiated the agreement. With respect to the Federal contributions to Medicare and Medicaid, though, I am concerned that the agreement may not be fair. On public health, it seems they have come to some very good provisions on advertising, but perhaps weaker provisions on regulation of nicotine. 
All this will take some more study. But I see one thing right away which seems to me grossly unfair to taxpayers. That is, under the terms of this agreement, tobacco companies will apparently be able to deduct their compensation payment from their tax bill as ordinary and necessary business expenses. 
Thus, the tobacco companies could deduct $368 billion from their taxable income and reduce their tax payments by about $123 billion, assuming we maintain a corporate tax rate of about 33 percent during the course of this agreement. In effect, this would reduce the tobacco companies' payment by $123 billion and force the taxpayers to pick it up instead. That is a full third of the compensation payment to States. 
I believe that is wrong. I believe it is unfair. The basis of this whole agreement is the idea that tobacco companies bear some responsibility for the illnesses caused by tobacco and nicotine and should help pick up the tab. 
I agree with that. I also feel strongly that ordinary taxpayers are not responsible for the illnesses caused by tobacco, and they should not have to put up $123 billion to pay for the treatment. 
Is there a solution to the problem? Yes, there probably is. We should look into the issue, and I believe that the Senate Finance Committee should hold hearings on the tax implications of this settlement. 
But already it seems clear that these payments are not necessary business expenses. They are, rather, belated compensation for the health effects of tobacco. I do not think they should be tax deductible. I will explore every means, including legislation if necessary, to make sure this agreement is fair to taxpayers.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, on another matter, I wish to inform the Senate that we in the Environment and Public Works Committee are working very diligently to come up with a good solid reform of the Endangered Species Act. 
In this respect, I say that Senator Kempthorne, the chairman of the relevant subcommittee, is working very hard with Senator Reid, the ranking member of the relevant subcommittee, along with myself and Senator Chafee to reform the current Endangered Species Act, including many provisions, such as involving the States much more deeply than they are now, making sure there is peer review by scientific communities, and a host of other changes. 
But one change I would like to mention at the moment is an idea in the bill introduced by the Senator from Idaho which very simply states that conservation easements that protect habitat for endangered species should be tax deductible. 
I raised this issue in the Finance Committee markup a week ago explaining to members of the committee that this was a new idea, a good idea which would give landowners incentives so that they themselves can protect their own land in a way to avoid problems under the act. But I did not push for the amendment in committee because we were not quite ready for the provisions of the amendment and did not have an appropriate way to pay for it which is called for under the Reconciliation Act. 
Senator Kempthorne has introduced a statement today basically calling this matter to the attention of the full Senate, and most particularly to the attention of the conferees. 
I say to Senator Kempthorne and others that are interested that I will work diligently, in cooperation with the Senator from Idaho, to see if we can find a way to get that provision passed. 
Essentially, Mr. President, we will very soon have a bipartisan Endangered Species Act reauthorization reported out of the Environment and Public Works Committee. I think Senators will be happy in the main with the provisions of this agreement. I compliment, again, Senator Kempthorne, Senator Reid, and others who are working, on a very bipartisan basis, to reach this result. 
Again, I thank my colleagues for their interest in the tax incentive portion of it because I think that is an important, integral part of this solution.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I very much thank again publicly my chairman of the committee, Senator Roth, who has heard many, many compliments on his leadership of the committee. I have complimented him many times already. Other Senators have complimented him many, many times. But one cannot compliment him too often because he did a terrific job in coming up with a bipartisan bill, as we know, that passed the Senate not too long ago by a vote of 80 to 18--quite an accomplishment.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, in the last couple of hours, in my judgment, this debate has turned into a rather partisan matter, with Republicans lining up on one side and Democrats lining up on the other. That is fine. I mean, each Senator has his right to say what he or she thinks. That is why we all ran for office and why we are here doing our very best for our constituents. 
But I also think that our people at home want us to, as much as possible, work together. Sure, some of us have differences, but, as much as possible, they want us to work together for the best interests of the American people. That, I think, is why the President worked with the Congress to try to fashion, and did fashion, a budget agreement--an agreement which will reduce the budget deficit by the year 2002; an agreement which contains provisions that the President, the chief Democrat in our country, wanted; and provisions which the Republican leadership in the Congress wanted. It is not the best agreement in the world, but we are a democracy and democracies sometimes are messy and uneven. But it was a pretty good agreement, by most Americans' standards. 
The House then attempted to put together its portion of the agreement. I might say that the Ways and Means Committee got pretty partisan. Democrats on the Ways and Means Committee fought vociferously with Republicans on Ways and Means. But the Republicans have a majority of the votes, so they won. Democrats lost, and from the Democrats' point of view, the bill that came out of House Ways and Means Committee is a pretty bad bill. 
I take my hat off to the chairman of our Finance Committee and our ranking member. The chairman of our committee took a different tack. His view is to work together. The chairman of the Finance Committee, the Senator from Delaware, Senator Roth--I have never seen anyone as fair with both sides of the aisle, in trying to come together with a solid agreement that made sense, near unanimous sense, to the members of that committee. It is wonderful. I have served with other chairmen of the Finance Committee. I know Senator Moynihan knows of when I speak. Sometimes that did not happen in other Congresses. In other Congresses, sometimes it was all Republicans this and all Democrats that. When the other side has the votes, you can make a statement, but you lose. 
In this case, Chairman Roth worked with the Democratic side of the aisle, and, as a consequence, we came up with a lot better bill--better, I say, than what is produced in the House pursuant to the budget agreement, agreed to by the President and congressional leadership. Why is it better? It is better because he worked with us. It is also better for these reasons: It has a cigarette tax, which I think most Americans want; it gave a big chunk of dollars to child care, to health insurance, which people want in this country; there is a big emphasis on education, which I think most people in this country want. 
There are many provisions which are very good. Now, in return for Chairman Roth working so hard with Senator Moynihan to put an agreement together, Chairman Roth asked a very reasonable question 
with respect to six key points, in the final hours of putting this bill together. The six key points, very simply, dealt with a ticket tax, cigarette tax, with unified credit, and there are a couple others. But there are six key points. He asked us, would all the members of the committee agree to support that agreement? He asked for a show of hands. Every hand went up. Every member of the committee raised his hand to support the agreement. 
Now, here we are on the floor today, Thursday afternoon, and my party leader has come up with a very good substitute. In many respects, I think it is better than the bill that came out of the committee. But I made an agreement. I pledged my honor to support the six terms that Senator Roth asked us to support, so that we would come up with a better bipartisan bill. That is not to say I support or am bound to support every provision of the bill. But with respect to those six key points, I feel duty-bound to honor that commitment, and I will do so here today. 
Now, if we could find a Democratic substitute which did not contravene any of those six points, I would probably support it. But the substitute before us does contravene those six points. I feel, as a matter of honor, that I cannot support the Democratic substitute. 
I must say that the bill before us--the Finance Committee bill--is not that bad. Remember, we are operating under the agreement that the President and congressional leadership agreed to. Given those parameters, this is not that bad a bill. It reduces the budget deficit, it does reduce taxes, it gives a child tax credit, it helps education, and it is good--not perfect, but it is good. 
Now, on down the road, we will have opportunities to still improve upon the bill. The President, after all, has the authority to sign or not sign the bill. I very much pledge to work with all Members of Congress, with my constituents at home, and with the President and the conferees, whoever they may be, to keep improving upon this bill. 
I must say, Mr. President, that this is a very difficult position to take because I do not like to be taking a position contrary to the leader of my party. But I do believe that it is the right position to take. After all, we are elected to do what's right. In my judgment, what is right is to support the agreement I reached with the chairman of the committee and also work to continue to improve upon this bill as it reaches different stages of this progress. I, therefore, will not vote for the substitute.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I opposed the Bumpers Amendment that would repeal percentage depletion for hardrock mining companies operating on public and formerly public lands. I believe this amendment is the wrong approach to bringing about mining law reform. 
Hardrock mining provides many high-paying jobs and is essential to the economy of Montana. This amendment would raise taxes on the hardrock mining industry which will negatively effect everyone that depends on mining for their economic livelihood. 
The intent of this amendment is not about percentage depletion. This amendment is an overt attempt to punish the hardrock mining industry for the lack of success in reforming the 1872 Mining Law. Percentage depletion is being used as a surrogate to bring about reform. If there are problems with the 1872 Mining Law, we should approach those problems directly--not in the form of repealing percentage depletion. Let's not wage economic warfare against an entire industry. 
The repeal of percentage depletion is the wrong tool for bringing about mining law reform. The Bumpers amendment could have potentially devastating effects on the hardrock mining industry.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague, Senator D'Amato, in introducing this legislation, which would permanently extend the 10-year grandfather for publicly traded partnerships [PTP's]. 
PTP's were first created in the early 1980's for the purpose of combining the traditional limited partnership form with the ability to have the partnership units freely traded on established securities or secondary markets. When Congress enacted the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987, it included a provision which reversed existing law at the time by requiring that PTP's would generally be treated as corporations for income tax purposes. The act completely exempted certain types of PTP's from the law, primarily those whose income is derived from resources such as timber, oil and gas, minerals, and real estate. PTP's which did not meet the criteria were given a 10-year transition period, after which they would no longer be exempted from the new requirements. This transition period, the grandfather, expires at the end of 1997. Our bill would extend it permanently. 
Mr. President, there is no public or tax policy reason for treating the grandfathered PTP's differently than those completely exempted from the law. All of the PTP's relied upon the law that was in effect when they were created. They are all similarly structured and deserve the same right to preserve their partnership status, regardless of the line of business in which they operate. There are only 27 of them remaining, and they are involved in a wide variety of industries, from motels and restaurants to chemicals, financial advising and macadamia nuts. They went through a costly and time-consuming process in order to convert from a corporation to a PTP in the first place, and will incur many of the same costs if they are now required to convert back to corporate form when the grandfather expires in January. 
More importantly, I am concerned about the effect that the loss of the grandfather will have on PTP investors. It is a virtual certainty that the value of PTP units will be adversely affected if the grandfather expires, reducing the value of the investor's holdings. Most of these investors are average, middle-class taxpayers, many of them elderly, who invested in PTP units because of their high yield. They are scattered throughout the country, and at last count numbered over 300,000. Many made this investment before the 1987 act was passed. 
There is no tax policy goal that will be achieved by allowing the grandfather to expire. That goal was fully achieved by making the law apply prospectively. All we accomplish is inflicting harm on these PTP's and their investors, without their having done anything illegal or improper when they were created. With this action, all remaining PTP's would be treated uniformly under the law. If the legislation is incorporated into this year's reconciliation bill, it will be as a revenue-neutral measure.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, over the Memorial Day recess, I made a week-long trip to East Asia. This included stops in Seoul, South Korea; Pyongyang, North Korea; Beijing, China; Hong Kong, as well as Misawa Air Force Base in Japan. I spent most of my time on the three issues of most immediate concern to us in northeast Asia this year. First, food and security problems on the Korean Peninsula; second, the negotiations over China's entry into the World Trade Organization; and third, Hong Kong's transition to Chinese sovereignty, now less than 3 weeks away. 
I also discussed longer term issues, including environmental protection, human rights, and United States-China security relations. These are complex subjects, with great implications for our national interest in all sorts of areas. With respect to the three immediate issues, I think our basic strategies are well conceived, and we have good people in the military and the Foreign Service working on them. I am in the process of drafting a trip report that will address them in much more detail. 
But we in Congress must first take up a different issue; that is, whether to support the President's decision to renew China's MFN status. So I will return to the floor in coming days to discuss the basic security, trade, environmental, and humanitarian issues we face in China and in East Asia generally. But today I will concentrate on MFN status--why it is legally right; why it is morally right, and why, given our compelling interest in issues like security in Korea, more fair and reciprocal trade with China, and a smooth transition for Hong Kong, it is right for our national interest.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Burns today in introducing legislation that authorizes the construction of a municipal, rural, and industrial water system for the Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes of the Fort Peck Reservation. 
The reservation has long been plagued by major drinking water problems including both inadequate supplies and unacceptable water quality. Ground water, the primary source of drinking water for many reservation residents, often exceeds the standards for total dissolved solids, iron, sulfates, nitrates, and in some cases for selenium, manganese and fluorine. 
Bacterial contamination of domestic water supplies has also been a recurring problem. On several occasions the Indian Health Service and Tribal Health Office have had to issue public health alerts regarding drinking water. In short, the very health of residents of the Fort Peck Reservation depends on construction of this pipeline. 
A safe and adequate supply of water is a necessity if the Fort Peck Nation is to realize its dream of economic development and full employment. The reservation economy is based on ranching and farming but expansion of agricultural operations is severely limited by the lack of adequate stockwater supplies. Additionally more effective distribution of water would result in more effective soil conservation and improvement of the native rangeland. 
The Bureau of Reclamation has determined that a regional MR&I water supply system using water from the Missouri River is a feasible alternative for addressing the serious water problems facing Fort Peck. This legislation will make that alternative a reality for the people of the Fort Peck Reservation. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting authorization of this critical project.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am very pleased today to join my colleague, Senator Hatch, to introduce a bill to help American-owned companies compete in the world marketplace by simplifying our overly complicated international tax rules. 
America's economic success depends more than ever before on our ability to succeed in the international economy. When I came to the Senate, imports and exports together made up about 12 percent of our economy. Today it is 30 percent and growing every day. So more jobs than ever depend on exports and overseas operations. 
I have worked through the Trade Subcommittee to lower foreign trade barriers and encourage agreements to keep trade free and fair. I have sought to open foreign markets for Montana products like beef to wheat. And this work pays off. 
According to a report prepared by the accounting firm Price Waterhouse last month, exports of goods alone in the United States in 1996 supported almost 7 million direct and indirect jobs and account for over 11 percent of our Gross Domestic Product. In Montana, these exports totaled almost one-half billion dollars and supported 58,000 jobs in 1996. 
But while our trade policies have been successful in many areas, our Tax Code has failed to keep up. Its international provisions are outdated, unclear, complex, and duplicative. And the result is fewer jobs and less prosperity here at home. 
So Senator Hatch and I have joined in an effort to simplify our Code, remove duplicative or outmoded provisions, and provide incentives for trade whenever possible. 
This bill does not by any means cure all of the problems in the international tax arena. But it is a good starting point which simplifies existing law, reduces the cost of compliance, and begins to make rules more rational and more mindful of the competitiveness of U.S. businesses. The major provisions include: 
Putting U.S. companies entering into joint ventures in foreign markets on an equal footing with their foreign competitors by eliminating the so-called 10-50 foreign tax credit basket rules. 
Rationalizing the anti-deferral rules by eliminating provisions that duplicate other clauses of the Internal Revenue Code. This is essential if U.S. financial services companies are to keep their leading edge in foreign markets. 
Guaranteeing that the export tax incentive provided by the foreign sales corporation rules would apply to U.S. software sold overseas, and to approved sales of U.S.-made military goods overseas. 
Putting mutual funds on the same footing as individual companies in their ability to attract foreign investors, increasing their investment capital. 
And making it easier for utilities to bid for construction projects overseas. 
These things will make us more efficient and more competitive. It will allow companies to put less effort into accounting and filling out tax forms, and more into producing, competing, and creating jobs. And that is what we need, today, and even more so tomorrow. 
We live in a global economy, Mr. President, and we must help American companies compete in this economy if we hope to continue an expansion in which a quarter of our growth already comes from exports. The International Tax Simplification for American Competitiveness Act is a major step in that direction. 
I look forward to working with Senator Hatch and my other colleagues on the Finance Committee to have its provisions incorporated into the reconciliation bill we will soon be considering.

 Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today Senator Murkowski and I introduced a bill called the Rural Telemedicine Demonstration Act of 1997. 
As the Senate knows, Senator Murkowski and I represent States where a good number of our constituents live in rural areas. Individuals living in States like Montana often live in counties that are underserved by specialty health care providers. 
Due to new technology made possible by advances in fiber optics, it is now easier for rural citizens to be seen by specialty health care providers. 
Using this technology, a person living in Culbertson, MT, who would normally drive 300 miles for specialty medical care in Billings, can now be `seen' by a physician via telemedicine. But, in order for telemedicine systems to be a success in rural States like mine, Medicare must eventually reimburse telemedicine providers. This bill is the first step in that direction.

Mr. BAUCUS. Thank you, Madam President. I also thank my good friend and colleague from Massachusetts. 
Madam President, I rise today in very firm opposition to the cloture motion on S. 4, the so-called Family Friendly Workplace Act, sponsored by my colleague from Missouri, Senator Ashcroft. Why do I do so? In speaking against cloture, I do not wish to convey that I oppose the idea of comptime. Quite the contrary, comptime is an idea whose time has come. Indeed, Federal workers get comptime. I think that other employees should also get comptime. 
We all hear from people in our home States--I know you do, Madam President--we all do--how pressed people are, particularly working moms, pressed for time, and do not have the time to keep their job as well as take their children to Babe Ruth ballgames or to parent-teacher conferences, and are very pressed for time. It only makes sense, Madam President, that employees, women and men on the job, get a little more flexibility so they can take time off to be with their family, with their children. 
It is not an easy task that parents have these days. Comptime would let working parents balance the needs of their families with the demands of their jobs. I believe it is only fair that we give America's families that tool. 
Unfortunately, the bill we are now debating, the so-called Family Friendly Workplace Act, fails to live up to its name. It is not family friendly at all. Why do I say that? First of all, the bill does not give workers the choice they need to make comptime effective. Under this bill, the employer can decide when a worker takes time off, not the employee. That means there is no guarantee that a parent would have time off when he or she needs it the most. That completely undermines the very concept of comptime. 
In addition, this bill dismantles two important safeguards that are fundamental to protecting the rights of workers. 
First, the bill eliminates the 40-hour workweek and replaces that time-honored tradition with an 80-hour, 2-week system, which means, under their bill, a worker who works 60 hours in 1 week may not be entitled to 1 minute of overtime. 
Second, this legislation would allow an employer to discriminate against a worker who chooses to take their overtime in the form of pay. Why? Because by assigning overtime only to workers who they know will take their accrued time in the form of vacation, the employer can save some money. But the worker gets pinched. 
Both of these changes will result in a pay cut for people who punch the clock. Lots of families depend on that extra money to make ends meet. We cannot risk taking it away from them. 
So that is why I rise in opposition to the cloture motion today, Madam President. But, as I said earlier, I am not speaking today against the idea of comptime. I like comptime. That is why I have offered a substitute amendment joined by Senators Kerrey and Landrieu. We will offer that substitute at the appropriate time. I think our bill gives workers the right kind of comptime. 
We offer employees comptime where they can choose when they take their own time off, comptime where they can take pay or time off without worrying about discrimination from their employers, and comptime that preserves the 40-hour workweek. 
Our amendment, I think, is clear. It is more reasonable and it is a better choice. I believe, Madam President, that when Senators look at both choices, the substitute that I plan to offer, as well as the current bill, they will realize that the better approach is the approach that we are suggesting. 
Madam President, the President has indicated that he would veto the current bill but he would sign the bill that we will be offering at the appropriate moment. I urge my colleagues again to vote against cloture. 
I yield back the balance of my time.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the Baucus-Kerrey-Landrieu substitute amendment to Senator Ashcroft's comptime bill. 
The Fair Labor Standards Act is a set of laws that Congress enacted some 60 years ago to protect the American worker from abuse in the workplace. These laws do a good job to make sure that our country's greatest asset, our work force, is protected. They put a halt to child labor. They established a 40-hour workweek. And they set up the concept of pay and a half for overtime. Under these laws, our country has grown and thrived, and, by and large, our workers are protected from extravagant abuses. 
However, our society has changed a great deal since Congress enacted that landmark legislation. We have more families where both parents hold down full-time jobs. We have more single-parent households. And for everyone it seems as if their dollar does not buy as much as it used to. 
All that means longer hours on the job, which, in turn, leads to less time spent with the family. Today's parents find themselves caught in a tightrope act as they try to balance the needs of their families with the demands of their jobs, and that just is not fair. 
I believe we are in a position to help them. That does not mean we should go about dismantling the protections on which our workers have come to rely. That is what some provisions of Senator Ashcroft's bill will do, and I think that is the wrong path. 
Instead, we must adapt our labor laws to maintain the protections that are so necessary while making it possible for our workers to have some flexibility. That is the right path. That is why my colleagues must support our substitute amendment. 
In Montana, I meet a lot of hard-working people. One thing they tell me time and time again is they need more flexibility in their work schedules. They need to be able to choose between earning time-and-a-half pay for their overtime or taking that time in the form of vacation. This choice would allow workers to either put aside a little extra money or take some time to be with their families. 
One area where the effects of this flexibility will be greatly felt is education. You see, in Montana, we pride ourselves on the quality education we provide our children. And we have done a pretty good job. One key to our success is parental involvement in their kids' education. That means taking time to meet with teachers, helping out on homework and 
participating in extracurricular activities. 
The Baucus-Kerrey-Landrieu amendment will allow parents to freely choose how and when they use their overtime so that parents can again be part of their children's lives. 
At the same time, I know every family is different and their needs vary greatly. Lots of folks depend on a little extra money to make ends meet. Others need time for their families. And that is why we need to make sure that every household can choose how to use their time and money. 
There are three clear reasons why my colleagues should vote for the substitute amendment offered by myself, Senator Kerrey from Nebraska, and Senator Landrieu. First, our amendment will allow employees the final choice on when and how they will use their overtime. Whether it is time or money, the worker gets the choice. That is very important. 
Senator Ashcroft's bill leaves the final decision on how you spend your time with the employer. Their bill has no protection for the worker. In fact, it would allow an employer to discriminate against a worker who chooses to take money for their overtime. That is just not fair. 
The second difference is that our amendment does not tamper with the 40-hour workweek. If you work more than 40 hours in a week, you are entitled to time-and-a-half pay. That is the way it has always been under the Fair Labor Standards Act. Americans overwhelmingly support the 40-hour workweek, and we ought to preserve it. 
Under Senator Ashcroft's bill, a worker could log 60 hours in 1 week and not qualify for 1 minute of overtime. For over 60 years, we have told our employees that if they worked hard and did a good job, they would be rewarded. Under this bill, we are reneging on that promise. The result is a pay cut for America's workers. 
And finally, the third reason my colleagues should support the substitute is that President Clinton has said he would sign our amendment, and he has said he would veto the other comptime bill. So if we are truly interested in giving workers flexibility in passing the comptime bill, we must support, I believe, our amendment. It is the only chance for a meaningful reform this year. 
Look, I think most Senators agree we need comptime. It is a good idea whose time has come. Yet, there are two ideas of how to get it done. One would take away workers' choice, end the 40-hour workweek, and is headed toward a certain Presidential veto. The other, our substitute, lets workers decide how to use their overtime, maintains the 40-hour workweek and will become law if we pass it. Our amendment I think is the more reasonable choice. 
So if you are really interested in passing a comptime bill, this is the time and our proposal is the bill. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the Baucus-Kerrey-Landrieu substitute amendment to the comptime bill. 
Mr. President, I yield my time, and I also thank the manager of the bill for his indulgence. 
Mr. DAMATO addressed the Chair.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to commend Mrs. Lois Palagi, a third grade teacher at West Elementary School in Butte. I want to recognize Lois because she has distinguished herself as one of the best and most beloved teachers in the community of Butte. 
In Montana we pride ourselves on providing our children with a top notch education. And we do a great job. But that success doesn't happen by accident. All Montanans shoulder part of the responsibility. One key component of our success is Montana's dedicated and hard-working teachers. 
Lois is a prime example of how teachers help our youth become some of the most competitive minds in the country. She has served her students for over 35 years. And in that time, she has taught her children the importance of discipline, respect, knowledge and wisdom. So many people have grown up under her watchful eyes to become responsible, hard-working adults because she led by example. And now she leaves behind a legacy of dedication, caring and love for teaching. She has brought great honor to her noble profession. 
At the end of this school year, Lois will begin a new undertaking--retirement. She will be able to spend more time with her husband Larry, son Mark, and daughter-in-law Linda. And devote more of her time to her three grandchildren: Bob, Jessica, and little Andie Elizabeth. She will be dearly missed at West Elementary School. But I'm certain she will be heartily appreciated as she spends more time with her family. 
Mr. President, it is impossible to count the number of lives that one person touches during his or her life. But I do know that in 35 years of teaching, that number is sure to be a mighty sum. I would just like to add my voice to all the others and say `Thank you, Lois.' 
And good luck in your retirement.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr President, the U.S. mutual fund industry has become a dominant force in developing, marketing, and managing assets for American investors. Since 1990, assets under management by U.S. mutual funds have grown from $1 trillion to about $3.5 trillion today. Yet, while direct foreign investment in U.S. securities is strong, foreign investment in U.S. mutual funds has remained relatively flat. 
Mr President, today I am introducing, along with Senators Gorton and Murray, the Investment Competitiveness Act of 1997. This legislation, which I have had the honor of cosponsoring in each of the last three Congresses, would eliminate a major barrier to attracting foreign capital into the United States while improving the competitiveness of the U.S. mutual fund industry. 
This legislation would remove a barrier to the sale and distribution of U.S. mutual funds outside the United States. The bill would change the Internal Revenue Code to provide that foreign investors in U.S. mutual funds be accorded the same tax treatment as if they had made their investments directly in U.S. stocks or shares of a foreign mutual fund. 
Under current law, most kinds of interest and short-term capital gains received directly by an investor outside the United States or received through a foreign mutual fund are not subject to the 30-percent withholding tax on investment income. However, interest and short-term capital gain income received by a foreign investor through a U.S. mutual fund are subject to the withholding tax. This result occurs because current law characterizes interest income as short-term capital gain distributed by a U.S. mutual fund to a foreign investor as a dividend subject to withholding. 
The Investment Competitiveness Act would correct this inequity and put U.S. mutual funds on a competitive footing with foreign funds. The bill would correctly permit interest income and short-term capital gain to retain their character upon distribution. 
Current law acts as a prohibitive export tax on foreign investors who choose to invest in U.S. funds. That is why the amount of foreign investment in U.S. mutual funds is small. 
Mr President, it is time to dismantle the unfair and unwanted tax barrier to foreign investment in U.S. mutual funds. The American economy will benefit from exporting U.S. mutual funds, creating an additional inflow of investment into U.S. securities markets without a dilution of U.S. control of American business that occurs through direct foreign investment in U.S. companies. Moreover, the legislation will support job creation among ancillary fund service providers located in the United States, rather than in offshore service facilities. 
Mr President, I very much appreciate the efforts of Senators Gorton and Murray in cosponsoring this legislation and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I want to first commend the chairman of the Budget Committee, the ranking member, the President, and negotiators for putting together a bipartisan agreement. I know it was not easy. It was difficult. But I think the American people are very gratified that the President and the Congress put together the outlines of a budget agreement which brings the budget deficit down to zero. 
One of the provisions in that agreement is the amount we will spend on highways and transit for the next 5 years. Under the budget agreement, the highway and transit programs will receive funding levels equal to the estimated revenue collected each year. 
But Mr. President, I would suggest we need to do better. 
That is why the Senator from Virginia and myself are offering this very simple amendment. Under the amendment, whatever comes into the trust fund through gasoline taxes and diesel fuels, et cetera, plus interest on what is earned on the balances in the trust fund, is available to be spent. In otherwords, whatever revenue comes in, will go out. This is truth in budgeting. It is a very modest amendment. 
Mr. President, current balances in the highway account of the highway trust fund is $14.3 billion. If you look at this chart, you will see that the balances in the highway account will almost double by the end of the 5 years covered by the budget resolution. Under the resolution, the balance in the highway trust fund will grow to almost $27 billion. It just seems to me, Mr. President, and to all of us who are concerned about the balances in the highway trust fund, that it is wrong for that balance to continue to grow or double when those are dollars being contributed by motorists who expect to see transportation benefits. 
I might add, Mr. President, that motorists are already paying 4.3 cents a gallon which goes to deficit reduction. Over the 5 years of the budget resolution will amount to about $35 billion. 
If our amendment does not pass, there are serious consequences. If our amendment does not pass, I must tell Senators that they are not going to receive funding levels close to the highway funds or the mass transit funds that their States expect. That is what is shown in this chart. I apologize for the small print on this chart, but we have after all 50 States and it is difficult to get every State on the single chart. 
This chart shows what will happen to a State's anticipated funding under the various highway bills that have been introduced, such as STARS 2000, STEP 21, NEXTEA and ISTEA Works. Senators have signed onto those bills anticipating certain funding levels. If the Warner-Baucus amendment does not pass, each State will receive a reduction in funding. 
I look at the Presiding Officer. New Hampshire--as an example, New Hampshire signed up for the ISTEA reauthorization bill. If New Hampshire thinks it is going to get $142 million a year, that is wrong. If my amendment does not pass, New Hampshire is going to receive $30 million less. If my amendment passes, New Hampshire will get the $142 million. 
That same example holds for every single State. 
So it is very clear that Senators are not going to get the money they think they are going to get if this amendment does not pass. 
I want to also add that there are other reasons to increase transportation spending. 
Our Department of Transportation says that we need about $50 billion dollars annually to maintain our highway system. The $26 billion provided for under this amendment is a little more than half of that. That is all. 
Think of the competition in the world. The Japanese spend four times what we do as a percentage of GDP than the United States. The European Union, spends twice as much. 
We are hurting ourselves in not keeping our transportation system up to snuff. 
In addition, if the budget resolution becomes the law, areas that are experiencing growth or areas with an aging infrastructure will not get the money they need. And programs that mean a lot to Members, such as the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality program, or enhancements and bike trails, will not have the money they need. 
Our proposal is very simple: That we pass this amendment, which will increase the deficit in the last year from a $1 billion surplus to about a $2 billion deficit. That is all. Over all 5 years, $12 billion. It does not go to the core of the agreement. It does not touch Medicare or Medicaid and does not touch taxes. It does not touch any of the provisions that Senators have been arguing about over the past few months as to what should or should not be in the bipartisan agreement. It doesn't touch those at all. It just says let's spend the interest, plus what comes into the trust fund as revenue each year. That way we can prevent further deterioration of our highways and bridges. 
If this amendment should pass,--the Senator from Virginia and I will work with the managers of the Budget Committee and with the administration to try to find some way to accommodate this $12 billion increase in conference. 
I want a balanced budget. I think every Senator wants a balanced budget. Fifty-seven Senators have written the Budget Committee asking for more money in transportation. In fact, what they asked for was a full $26 billion every year for 5 years. We are only asking for a ramp up to the $26 billion level over the 5 years. This is very modest and nowhere close to the request made by 57 Senators who have asked for a full $26 billion to be included in transportation for every year. 
This is a very small change in the agreement which the budget and administration negotiators put together. It can very easily be accommodated in conference. 
I might add, to those Senators from the Northeast who are concerned about mass transit, this amendment also--the $12 billion increase in outlays I mentioned--includes increases in mass transit. 
So, Mr. President, it is really very simple. I grant that it is technically an increase in the deficit by $12 billion. I am also saying that we as Senators should not be caught in a box. We should not be rigid. We should not be knee-jerked. We are elected to be thoughtful. We are elected to do what is right. We are elected to be creative. 
What do the American people think is right? First, balance the budget; second, do it in a way which is fair to our country and our country's needs. 
It is clear that we can balance the budget, including the framework agreed to by the budget negotiators, the administration, and the leadership, and still meet our States' infrastructure needs. 
It is a very modest amendment. Again, it just says spend what comes in, plus interest, to the trust fund. In fact, even under our amendment we end up with a $17 billion balance in the trust fund. So under our amendment, we are not spending anywhere near the amounts the trust fund could sustain. But the Senator from Virginia and I are trying to be modest. 
So, I again urge Senators, just go the extra mile. Vote for this. We will all work together to balance the budget in a way which also does not hurt the core provisions of the agreement but addresses the very serious transportation needs of this country. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

He made an interesting statement, though, that I would just like to follow up on a little bit. He turned to the Senator from Virginia a few minutes ago--if I heard you correctly; I do not want to put words in your mouth--and said something to the effect: Yes, you are right. At some future time when we take up ISTEA we are going to have to deal with deficiencies that are otherwise going to be available to be spent on the highway bill, ISTEA. 
If I heard him correctly, if that is what he meant, I would just like to explore with the chairman where we might find some of those additional dollars if it's not in the context of this budget resolution.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we heard today from both the chairman and the ranking member of the Budget Committee that we need to address this problem; the problem that there is a deficiency in highway-mass transit-infrastructure spending that must be dealt with at sometime. But they are also saying they feel constrained to say they cannot deal with it here because they feel constrained by the budget resolution, a resolution agreed to principally between the White House and the leadership. 
They talk about an $8 billion increase. That does not include interest. And because the country is growing, because of additional needs we have and the crumbling bridges, if this resolution is adopted, Senators should know that they will receive less in dollars than they will need for their State's infrastructure. 
The Senators, the chairman and ranking member, say, `Well, we will deal with it in the future at sometime,' acknowledging that there is a problem and we need more transportation dollars. I must remind Senators that we have a difficult problem ahead of us. When we in the Environment and Public Works Committee in the coming weeks write a bill dealing with CMAQ, dealing with formulas, donor States, donee States, so on and so forth, what do we look at? We look at the number that the Budget Committee sends to us. We are constrained by that number. We must then write a 5- or 6-year bill which locks in the spending limits that the Budget Committee prescribes for us. We are locked in for 5 or 6 years. 
Those lower levels cannot be changed next year by a new budget resolution, cannot be changed until or unless this Congress writes a new highway bill. I am not so sure this Congress is going to want to write a new highway bill every year. So I am saying that this is the time to deal with this problem. It is now. Otherwise, we are locked in for 6 years to inadequate numbers. 
We want to make an adjustment of less than one-tenth of 1 percent of our Federal budget, less than one-tenth of 1 percent of our Federal budget, which I am fully confident can be dealt with in conference. It is critical that this amendment be adopted so that we are not locked in over the next 6 years to inadequate numbers. We will be locked into these numbers if this resolution is adopted. We can make adjustments in all the other accounts and still maintain the core provisions of the bipartisan agreement. 
So I urge Senators to, therefore, vote for this so we can do what we know is right.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to explain my vote on the Gramm sense-of-the-Senate amendment. 
This sense-of-the-Senate amendment calls for the return of 4.3 cents of the Federal gas tax currently used for deficit reduction to the highway trust fund. 
I have long argued for the return of these revenues to transportation programs--approximately $7 billion annually. In fact, I recently introduced legislation to transfer the 4.3 cents to transportation programs--3.8 cents to the highway account of the highway trust fund and 0.5 cents to be used to maintain this Nation's national passenger rail system or Amtrak. 
While this sense-of-the-Senate amendment unfortunately does not address Amtrak, I feel it is important for the Senate to express its support for redirecting the 4.3 cents to transportation purposes. That is why I have voted for this amendment. 
As this sense-of-the-Senate amendment is nonbinding, it is important to ensure that the transfer of the 4.3 cents for transportation actually takes place. As a member of the Finance Committee, I want to make it very clear to my colleagues that I intend to pursue my legislation to make the transfer--again, 3.8 cents for the highway account and 0.5 cents for Amtrak. 
Transportation investments are the key to this Nation's economic future. Our ability to compete in today's global economy is tied to an efficient and safe intermodal transportation system--highways, transit, Amtrak, and other modes. 
The Gramm amendment is the first step to reaching that outcome. By putting the Senate on record in support of transferring the 4.3 cents for transportation purposes, we will be able to work during the reconciliation process and the reauthorization of ISTEA to see that additional investments are made in our transportation system. 
I look forward to working with the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Moynihan, and others to transfer these revenues as we develop reconciliation legislation.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today because yesterday I introduced the Baucus-Kerrey-Landrieu substitute amendment to the comptime bill. This amendment will give working men and women the choice between earning overtime pay or taking that time off to spend with their families. 
As I travel around my State, I get the chance to meet with a lot of decent, hard-working people. In Montana, we know how to put in an honest day's work. And in exchange for that work, we ask only for an honest day's pay. 
But lately, that pay isn't stretching as far as it used to. That means working longer hours, and sometimes holding down two jobs. Whether it is a single-parent household, or a home where both parents have to work, people are finding less and less time for their families. 
Mothers and fathers are finding themselves caught in a costly juggling act, where they are trying to balance the demands of their work with the needs of their families. 
I believe that this trend has very serious consequences on our families and our society as a whole. I know most of the Senators in this body agree with me. 
As our society changes, so must our labor laws. They must reflect the needs of our current work force. 
And that is why I offered this amendment. Because America's working men and women need flexibility in their jobs--so they can spend more time with their families. 
And that is what S. 4, in its current form, proposes to do. Regrettably, I believe this legislation takes the wrong approach. 
Under the current bill, mothers and fathers do not have the final say in how their overtime will be used. Their hands are tied by the decisions of their employer. 
Under my amendment, if a worker puts in overtime, he or she can be paid time and a half, just as the law stands now. Or if that person wants, he or she can take that payment in the form of vacation--an hour and a half for every hour of overtime. Quite simply, workers can choose money or time, and not be penalized for their choice. 
This choice would allow a parent the flexibility to attend their child's soccer game. Or it would let that worker earn a little extra money for Christmas presents. 
Under the changes proposed in Senator Ashcroft's bill, the employer has the last word. Mothers and fathers could find their employer deciding whether they get time off or whether they get overtime pay. And I believe that is wrong. 
It is our duty to protect America's workers. When it comes to the choice between comptime and time off, we need to make sure the employee has the last choice. 
We have a tremendous opportunity to do something great for America's working men and women. We have a chance to give our families a powerful tool in the struggle to find balance between work and family. 
They're not asking for much. They simply want an honest day's pay for an honest day's work. They also want a little time to spend with their families. 
The American people have made it clear to us that flexibility and choice are what they need. Under my amendment, that flexibility, and that choice, are what they will get. 
I urge my colleagues to join me, and vote in favor of this amendment when it comes to the Senate floor. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to join Senators Kempthorne, Chafee, Craig, and Reid in offering this amendment. I would like to briefly explain why Senator Reid and I strongly oppose section 311 of S. 672 and then summarize the alternative we worked out with Senators Kempthorne, Chafee, and Craig. 
We all sympathize with the victims of the recent floods in North Dakota and Minnesota, and also with the victims of flooding earlier this year in central California and along the Ohio River. These people have suffered terribly. 
This debate is not about whether they should receive assistance from the Federal Government. Of course they should. And the assistance should not be delayed. 
But that is precisely the consequence of the language that the committee included in section 311 of the bill. The President has indicated that he would veto the bill if it includes section 311. So, if section 311 remains unchanged, we would, at the very least, delay the delivery of urgently needed assistance. 
Another point. Section 311 doesn't belong in this bill. It is not a limitation on the use of funds, which is within the jurisdiction of the Appropriations Committee. Rather, it amends the authorizing statute, the Endangered Species Act, which is within the jurisdiction of the Environment and Public Works Committee. 
As our colleagues know, Senator Reid and I have been working closely with Senators Chafee and Kempthorne for a number of months to write a bipartisan bill to reauthorize and reform the Endangered Species Act. it is complicated work, because we are trying to improve the conservation of species at the same time we make it easier for landowners to comply with the law. 
So far, it has been a bipartisan effort, including the administration. 
However, section 311 threatens our progress. If we start down the path of piecemeal changes, such as section 311, it may undermine the spirit and intent of those negotiations. 
Finally, section 311 would open up a large loophole in the Endangered Species Act. 
Let me put this argument in perspective. 
The heart of the Endangered Species Act is section 7, which provides that Federal agencies must consult with the Fish and Wildlife Service to ensure that their actions are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of an endangered or threatened species or destroy the critical habitat of such a species. It's a sensible requirement that's central to our efforts to conserve species. 
But let's face it. There may be times when it's just not possible to comply with the ordinary consultation process. There's an emergency. A flood or a forest fire. Lives and property are threatened with imminent destruction. Federal agencies must react quickly. They may not have time to carefully consult to assure that their actions won't jeopardize a species. 
As things now stand, this is taken into account. A provision of the current regulations allows Federal agencies to dispense with the ordinary consultation process in emergencies. The regulation says: 
Where emergency circumstances mandate the need to consult in an expedited manner, consultation may be conducted informally through alternative procedures that the Director determines to be consistent with the requirements of sections 7(a)-(d) of the Act. This provision applies to situations involving acts of God, disasters, casualties, national defense or security emergencies, etc. 
To put it another way, when there's an emergency, the Forest Service, the Corps of Engineers, or any other action agency can initiate the emergency procedure, by calling the Fish and Wildlife Service and explaining the situation. Fish and Wildlife will then step out of the way, so that the action agency can concentrate on addressing the emergency. Later, after the danger has subsided, Fish and Wildlife will begin formal consultation to determine whether additional measures are needed to minimize the impact on the species. 
This provision has already been successfully invoked many times. It has been used to provide emergency assistance to victims of hurricanes, forest fires, and more recently, flooding in 46 counties in California. 
In fact, in February of this year, the administration issued a policy statement applying the emergency provisions, for the remainder of this year's flood season, to the 46 counties in California that had been declared Federal disaster areas. 
As a result, the Corps of Engineers can move quickly to repair or replace flood control facilities in those counties, without being impeded by the ESA. 
In short, we don't have to choose between flood protection and species conservation. Using common sense and existing procedures, we can ensure that agencies like the Corps of Engineers can do what needs to be done, quickly, to save human lives and protect property. 
Section 311 of the bill, however, would go much further. It provides a permanent exemption, from sections 7 and 9 of the Endangered Species Act, for operating, maintaining, repairing, or reconstructing flood control projects to the extent necessary to address public health or safety, in several different circumstances. 
The language is confusing. What's more, the language creates a loophole, by creating a permanent exemption for any flood control measures undertaken `to comply with a Federal, State, or local public health or safety requirement that was in effect during 1996 or 1997.' 
What does this mean? The phrase `public health or safety requirement' is very broad. Conceivably, it could be stretched to include almost any State or local law that conflicts with the Endangered Species Act. This could have major consequences for the operation of the act. At the very least, these consequences should be considered carefully, in the context of the overall reauthorization of the Endangered Species Act, and not jammed into a supplemental appropriations bill. 
Because of the grave nature of the flooding this year, Senator Reid and I recognize the need for an immediate and effective emergency response. In doing so, we reserve judgment about whether any provisions of this amendment should be applied more generally. That question must be considered independently, in the contest of our negotiations on an ESA reauthorization bill. 
Drawing on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's emergency regulations and their February 19, 1997 policy, the Kempthorne-Chafee-Craig-Baucus-Reid amendment would assure that people threatened by flooding could respond quickly to an imminent threat to lives and property. 
Specifically, our amendment would do two things. First, it would allow a Federal agency to defer formal consultation on repairs to flood control projects that the agency determines are needed to respond to an imminent threat to human lives and property in 1996 or 1997. Unlike section 311 of the bill, however, it would not exempt the agency from the requirements of section 7 of the ESA. It would simply defer formal consultation until the imminent threat to human lives and property had been abated. 
Second, our amendment would require that any reasonable and prudent measures to minimize the impact of emergency repairs under this section must be related in nature and extent to the effect of the action taken to repair the project. 
Mr. President, the Kempthorne-Chafee-Craig-Baucus-Reid amendment was agreed to only after several days of difficult negotiations. Although the amendment represents a compromise, I believe it addresses the needs of Federal agencies to respond to flood emergencies without undermining important protections for threatened and endangered species. Without doubt, it is a significant improvement over section 311 of the bill. 
Like Senator Reid, I strongly opposed the endangered species provision that was included in the committee bill, and I will tell you the four reasons. 
First, the provision in the bill simply does not belong in the bill because it amends the Endangered Species Act. This is an appropriations bill, not a legislative bill. 
Second, the provision is unnecessary. Why? Because existing regulations and policies already allow agencies to respond to floods and other emergencies without getting tied up in red tape under the act. 
Third, the provision would undermine our efforts to provide badly needed disaster relief, because the President has indicated that he would veto the bill if the provision was included. 
Fourth, and most significantly, the provision would open a loophole to the Endangered Species Act. The amendment we are offering today, in contrast, is a compromise, that is the result of several days of hard negotiations. 
In contrast to the provision in the bill, this amendment by Senator Reid would not exempt agencies from the requirements of the Endangered Species Act. Instead, it simply provides that, in certain emergency situations in which it is necessary to make flood control repairs, an agency can defer formal consultation until the imminent threat to human lives and property has been abated. 
By doing so, the amendment confirms that Federal agencies can respond to flood emergencies, but does not undermine protections for threatened and endangered species. It is a substantial improvement over the provision in the committee bill. I urge my colleagues to support it.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of Senator Bumpers' motion to strike section 310 from the Supplemental Appropriations Act. This section should be removed from the Supplemental Appropriations Act for two reasons. First, it could harm our Nation's wilderness areas, national parks, and wildlife refuges. Second, it is wrong as a matter of principle to tie controversial issues to flood disaster relief. We simply should not play politics when people's lives are in the balance. 
In 1976, Congress enacted the Federal Land Management Policy Act and thus repealed an 1866 statute that allowed practically unrestricted road construction across our public lands. Congress agreed, however, to recognize the legitimacy of highways constructed as of 1976. 
In essence, the appropriations rider reinstates a 1988 policy that broadly defined highways to include foot paths, pack trails, and even dog-sled routes. If these paths are recognized as highways constructed prior to 1976, then they can be upgraded and enlarged to full roads, even if they run through existing wilderness areas, national parks, or wildlife refuges. These areas are national treasures. They are visited by millions of Americans every year. We should not let them be roaded without careful thought and deliberation. 
This rider hits close to home for me. This provision could allow roads to be built through spectacular wilderness in Montana. Often, we have to speculate about what the effect of a piece of legislation will be. In this case, speculation is not necessary. 
An R.S. 2477 claim has been filed to build a road through the middle of one of Montana's most popular wilderness areas. Fortunately, that claim was recently rejected by the Department of the Interior. If this rider becomes law, this and other claims could be granted with devastating effect to our Nation's wilderness areas. 
Equally disturbing, this section could prevent Montana roadless areas from being designated as wilderness in the future. I have carried bills in the Senate to designate Montana's spectacular Rocky Mountain Front as wilderness. This is an area of soaring mountain peaks, crystal clear streams, and untrammeled meadows. Bills to designate this area as wilderness have received bipartisan support and have passed the Senate. 
If section 310 becomes law, the Rocky Mountain Front and other roadless lands in those bills could be denigrated. If section 310 becomes law, the Senate may lose its right to decide whether to designate those lands as wilderness. 
And section 310 applies to more than wilderness lands. Section 310 would even affect our national parks and wildlife refuges. 
But this vote is about more than the roads that could be built across our Nation's wildlands. 
This vote is also about people who have suffered through an unusually harsh winter in Montana and are seeking disaster relief. This vote is about people in North Dakota who have suffered devastating floods. 
Let me read what the paper in my State's capitol wrote yesterday about Section 310. In an editorial entitled `An Ugly Kind of Politics,' the Helena Independent Record writes:  
This sort of thing might be business as usual in Washington, but we think the specter of Clinton being forced to veto a flood-relief measure because of tacked-on skulduggery is way out of line. We suspect it wouldn't sit too well either with flood victims in the Dakotas--and, perhaps, potential flood victims in Montana as well. Politics is seldom pretty, but this is downright ugly.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the American people are losing faith in our political system. And they are losing faith because of the way that politics is played. Because of this type of rider. 
How will the disaster victims in the Dakotas feel if their aid is delayed because some want to play a game of poker where the stakes are incredibly high? Where the stakes are the blankets that flood victims need to stay warm or where the stakes are pumps that are needed so that people can drink clean water? 
And what of the people in other states? 
Oregon stands to receive almost $140 million from the Supplemental Appropriations bill. 
Louisiana, $116 million. 
For other states such as Maine, Vermont, and Virginia, the amount of the funds is somewhat smaller, but the need is no doubt just as great. 
People in all fifty states receive funds from this bill. People in all fifty states will be affected if we allow politics to delay this bill. 
This money will help Americans who have lost their homes, their businesses, and all of their earthly possessions. To block this funding or to delay it through the use of these types of riders is just plain wrong. 
To force the American people to accept new roads through their national parks or wilderness areas, just to get their disaster relief is equally wrong. 
Mr. President, the Supplemental Appropriations bill is the wrong place to play politics. I ask my Senate colleagues to vote to strike these riders as a matter of policy and as a matter of principle.

 Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am very proud today to tell my colleagues in the Senate about four students from my home State of Montana: Ariel Overstreet, Amber Overstreet, Lindsey Hauge, and Taylor Gray. These young Montanans won first place in two separate NASA-sponsored national contests. Ariel took first place in the Intergalactic Art Contest in which she had to draw an original piece of art. Amber, Lindsey, and Taylor made up a team that took first place in the Future Aircraft/Spacecraft design competition. I congratulate them on their achievements. 
These students have proven what most of us in Montana have known all along. Montana students are some of the brightest and best educated students in the country. And while we are proud of our students, we know that a lot of the credit must go to devoted teachers like Rolland Karlin and concerned parents like Anne Overstreet. These are the people behind the scenes who make sure that the education our children receive is top-notch. 
Ariel, Amber, Lindsey, and Taylor are now visiting Washington, as part of their award. I was pleased to have a chance to meet them. They are fine representatives of Montana and their community of Big Timber. 
Later on in their trip, these four youngsters will be visiting NASA's space camp. I hope that the opportunity to view NASA technology up close will feed their active minds. 
Congratulations Ariel, Amber, Lindsey, and Taylor. I hope you enjoy your trip. And that you never lose your desire to achieve your dreams.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today I rise to acknowledge the recent retirement of a long-time congressional staff member, a dedicated public servant and a loyal friend. On April 2, 1997, Judy Campbell, who for the past 10 years served as the financial clerk of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, completed 36 years of congressional service. This institution is a better place because of her faithful service. 
I first met Judy Campbell late in 1974, shortly after my election to the U.S. House of Representatives. She was one of the first individuals I hired on my congressional staff. Judy's ability and exceptional organizational skills were first brought to my attention by one of the most able and respected legislators of his generation, the late Congressman Richard Bolling of Missouri, for whom Judy had already worked for over a decade. Judy served as my office manager, first in the House of Representatives and then in the Senate, for 12 years. 
In 1987, the chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, Senator Quentin N. Burdick of North Dakota, hired Judy and she soon became the committee's financial clerk. Judy served the committee and the Senate in that capacity under four chairmen--Senators Quentin N. Burdick, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, John Chafee, and myself. The hallmark of Judy's congressional service was always her professionalism. She worked with Democratic and Republican Members and staff with similar dedication and equal enthusiasm. 
Judy has also been an invaluable resource to her colleagues on my personal staff, the committee and around the Hill. The process of hiring new staffers always involves a certain amount of coaching and training. Judy was particularly good in this role, and I know she was always willing to provide counseling and support to other committee financial clerks and office managers around the Hill. 
Longevity was only one aspect of Judy's career. Through her work she epitomized dedication in public service. For 36 years, Judy has been one of the selfless and nameless individuals who, day in and day out, make the congressional branch of government function effectively, year in and year out. Judy's detailed knowledge of congressional operations and finances is legendary. She took seriously the public trust for the millions of dollars which were her responsibility over the years. To say Judy was prudent with taxpayer funds would be an understatement. In the mid-1970's, when America's ultimate tightwad--Jack Benny--died, the joke in my office was that Judy Campbell took his place. 
Mr. President, this institution is a better place because Judy Campbell toiled here. She made a difference. Her many friends on Capitol Hill and I will miss her. I personally wish Judy and her husband Denny nothing but the best in retirement. As they complete construction of a new home this summer, we wish them many years of good health and enjoyment. On April 3, 1997, Judy realized a longtime dream. On that day she started a new career--that of a full-time grandmother. 
Thank you, Judy, and good luck. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the Senate for passing a piece of legislation this morning that designates today, National Erase the Hate and Eliminate Racism Day. The legislation we passed this morning also calls on President Clinton to issue a proclamation urging all Americans to use each day as an opportunity to take a stand against racism and hate. 
In 1964, Mike Mansfield of Montana, then majority leader of the U.S. Senate, ushered through this body the landmark Civil Rights Act. His national foresight and courage in those years was widely praised in the press and by his peers. As one colleague said upon Senator Mansfield's retirement, `The distinguished majority leader votes his convictions and lets the chips fall where they will.' 
In the last several years, however, Montanans of a different generation have come under the microscope of less favorable scrutiny. The reputation of Montana as a State of forward-thinkers and tolerant individuals was marred by the standoff between the FBI and the so-called Freemen outside Jordan, and a series of hate crimes in some of our cities. 
Make no mistake, it is important for the media and others to focus on these events, whether they occur in Montana or elsewhere. But equally, if we are to learn from them, then we also need to listen to the stories of hope, of the people who are willing to stand up to bigots and hate groups. 
Because those stories are happening all the time in Montana. Whether it is a community like Billings that stands up to a group of skinheads, or a Missoula high school class that devotes an entire project to studying the Holocaust. 
It was in this spirit and with the strong support of the YWCA of America, the Anti-Defamation League, and the USA Network, that I cosponsored the legislation that designated today as National Erase the Hate and Eliminate Racism Day. 
There is no doubt that we have come a long way as a nation. But with 8,000 hate crimes reported to the U.S. Department of Justice each year, it is clear we still have much more work to do. 
In addition to taking a day to recognize the importance of the fight, we must continue to support groups like the Northwest Coalition Against Malicious Harassment, the Montana Human Rights Network, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, and the many other groups and individuals who continue this work every day. 
In fact, many of those involved in this arena are now urging President Clinton to convene a White House conference on the issue. They have my strong support in their request. Surely, what we can do to encourage voluntarism, we must do to end hate. 
I know a simple Senate resolution, or even a national conference, will not end the problems we still have. A piece of paper alone cannot teach a child that hate is wrong. But I do believe a piece of paper can make people think. A conference will not end intolerance. But it can make people talk about hate crimes. Designating today as a day to address these important problems is a first step and it can light a spark of hope in people's hearts and minds. 
Again, perhaps our predecessor in the Senate, Mr. Mansfield, when speaking about the task in 1964, said it best when he noted,  
What we do here in the . . . Congress will not, of itself, correct these faults, but we can and must join the wisdom--the collective wisdom of this body--to the efforts of others in this Nation to face up to them for what they are--a serious erosion of the fundamental rock upon which the unity of the Nation stands. 
Tolerance and respect are our nation's bedrock. Today we can join together to renew the fight for a better America. And if we continue to look at the good, courageous, decent things our neighbors are doing, the sparks of hope we light just might catch fire, in Montana and all across the country.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my firm support of the Chemical Weapons Convention Treaty. I have thought long and hard on this issue. And I believe that my colleagues--both for and against this treaty--have shown patience, diligence and understanding during this important debate. 
I also believe the time has come for us to lead the civilized world in signing this treaty. And to remember why, we need to look back to our history. 
On October 30, 1918, 12 days before the end of the First World War, the 362nd Infantry Division received orders to attack German positions outside the city of Audenarde in France. Many Montanans served in this division. 
During this battle, German troops lobbed several gas shells toward the Montana troops. The wind that morning just happened to be blowing to the east, and the gas carried over the American area. 
The men of the 362nd fought valiantly that day. And in the end, they overtook the German positions with a minimal loss of life. But they, and hundreds of thousands of other World War I veterans, carried scars in their lungs for the rest of their lives. It made breathing difficult and left many of them invalids. 
Chemical weaponry has come a long way in the 79 years since that battle took place. Modern technology has made this type of warfare more devastating and more deadly. It can now kill instantly as well as scar and maim the lungs. 
Chemical warfare is an indiscriminate killer. It cannot tell the difference between a soldier and a civilian, a bunker from a subway, or a barracks from a school. 
And worst of all, some chemical weapons are relatively easy to create. As we have seen in recent news reports, if the substances used to create chemical weapons are freely available, terrorist groups and cults can make them and use them against civilians. 
This, of course, often makes them hard to detect. So the critics of this Convention have a point when they say it will be hard to verify. 
But this agreement will make it much easier than it is now for us to find out when rogue states try to create or stockpile chemical weapons. We will have the right to inspect the factories and defense installations of those we suspect are creating these weapons. And we will be able to block those who do not sign from buying the substances they need to create chemical weapons. 
That is why this treaty has wide support. If we choose not to ratify it, we cast ourselves with such countries as Iraq and Libya--one which used chemical weapons against Iran and its own Kurdish citizens, another suspected of clandestine efforts to create a chemical weapons program. 
And we make it more likely that some day, another generation of American servicemen and servicewomen will suffer the same kind of outrageous attack that the Montanans in the 362nd went through in 1918. That must not happen. And the Senate must pass this Convention. 
If we ratify this treaty now, we allow the United States to participate in its administration from the outset. To fail to ratify the treaty is to lose our seat at the table. I want to make sure that we put American inspectors on the ground to ensure the eventual end of these horrible weapons. 
Again, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this treaty. And I look forward to the day we remove chemical weapons from the face of the earth.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution which will designate this April 30 as a National Day to Erase the Hate and Eliminate Racism. 
In the last couple of years, we Montanans have seen our state come under the microscope of considerable media scrutiny. We've had the arrest of the alleged `Unabomber,' the standoff between the FBI and the so-called Freemen outside Jordan, and a series of hate crimes in some of our cities. 
And it's appropriate for the press to take a look at these things, while recognizing that many of these incidents are repeated on a larger scale throughout the rest of the country. 
What has frustrated me, and many other Montanans, however, is the lack of attention to the vast majority of Montanans--the people who are willing to stand up to bigots and hate groups. For example, take what happened in Billings, Montana, a few years ago. 
People in Billings enjoy a high quality of life that only Montana can provide. It is the largest city in Montana, but it still has the feel of a small town. Folks say hello to strangers in the street. Families go to the symphony in Pioneer Park in the summer. And neighbors go out of their way to help someone when they need a hand. 
That placid life was shattered in November 1993, when a group of `skinheads' threw a bottle through the glass door of the home of a Jewish family. A few days later they put a brick through the window of another Jewish family's home--with a five-year-old boy in the room. Then they smashed the windows of a Catholic high school that had a `Happy Hanukkah' sign on its marquee. 
The people of Billings were horrified. But they did not sit at home and try to ignore the problem. They did not let the hatred take root. The community banded together. 
Thousands of homes put Menorahs in their windows. They showed the skinheads that the people of Billings were united against hate. And that year, Billings held the largest Martin Luther King Day march ever in Montana. 
And all over Montana, we see more of the same. Whether it is a county attorney who stands up to militia groups in Jordan. Or the unsung people who work in their communities, such as Helena, to stamp out racism and hatred through the Montana Human Rights Network. These are all stories that need to be told. 
Recently, the USA Network aired a movie called `Not In This Town,' which told the story of these events to the country. I commend the network for bringing this story to the world because it sends two powerful messages. First of all, Montana is no home for bullies and hate-mongers. And second, wherever you live, violence and bigotry do not have to be accepted in your community. 
That is why today I am submitting, with my colleague from Montana, Senator Burns, and many others from across America, a bill which will designate April 30, 1997, as a National Day to Erase the Hate and Eliminate Racism. 
I know a simple bill like this one will not end the problems we still have. A piece of paper alone cannot teach a child that hate is wrong. 
But I do believe a piece of paper can make people think. It can make people talk about hate crimes. And it can light a spark in people's hearts and minds. 
And if we continue to look at the good, courageous, decent things our neighbors are doing, that spark just might catch fire, in Montana and all across the country.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to transfer 4.3 cents of the Federal gas tax currently used for deficit reduction to transportation purposes. 
Specifically, this bill will transfer 3.8 cents to the highway account of the highway trust fund and one-half penny to a new intercity passenger rail account to be used for Amtrak or other intercity passenger rail service. 
Mr. President, this bill is important because it is time to give the American taxpayers the confidence that the fuel taxes they pay will be used for transportation purposes. 
The 3.8 cents deposited in the highway account means over $5.5 billion in additional funds would be available each year for transportation improvements. Those improvements could be for highway maintenance or other infrastructure safety improvements; mass transit projects; bikepaths; pedestrian walkways; or a variety of other transportation projects that are eligible today under the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act. 
This Nation is losing ground with regard to transportation investments. Japan spends four times the United States on transportation as a percentage of gross domestic product. And the Europeans spend twice as much. 
These and other countries envy our transportation system. We cannot afford to allow our global competitors to outspend us on infrastructure improvements. Our ability to remain competitive in the future is tied to maintaining an efficient transportation system and highly mobile workforce. 
And Amtrak remains an important component of such a transportation system. Every country that has a passenger rail system provides some government financial assistance. It only makes sense that this country do the same. 
Amtrak is important to many communities around the country--it serves over 530 cities and towns. These include 12 in my State of Montana--Libby, Whitefish, West Glacier, Essex, East Glacier, Cut Bank, Malta, Browning, Shelby, Havre, Wolf Point, and Glasgow. These Montana communities rely upon Amtrak as a transportation option. 
And Amtrak is an important economic lifeline. Not only for the jobs directly related to Amtrak service, but Amtrak is an important tool in Montana's tourism industry. Each year, Amtrak brings thousands of folks to our State to ski, hike, or just enjoy the beauty of Montana. 
But in order for Amtrak to remain a component of this Nation's transportation system, it must have a dedicated revenue source. Such a revenue source will give Amtrak the ability to do long-term capitalization planning--planning and improvements that must be made in order for Amtrak to remain viable. 
While I do not agree that Amtrak should be funded off of the top of the highway trust fund as has been suggested by the administration, I do feel we need to financially support Amtrak into the next century. 
My bill will do that. It will provide a substantial increase in available funds for all modes of transportation.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the public expects some essential services from the Government. Social security payments, highway funding, national defense, a safety net in bad times, clean air and water, the National Park System, and so on. These are important to the country and the Government should provide them. 
So most folks are willing to pay their fair share of taxes. Nobody likes it, but most of us do it regularly and honestly. But we do expect the Government to keep it fair, make it as simple as possible, and keep it private. 
And we've recently found that in their zeal to catch the few people who don't pay their taxes, some tax collectors forget the most fundamental truth about our tax system. Citizens have rights that must be protected. 
One of the first bills I introduced when I first came to the Senate was a Taxpayers' Bill of Rights, to protect taxpayers in disputes with the Internal Revenue Service. And I noted: 
Oliver Wendell Holmes reasoned that `Taxes are what we pay for a civilized society.' However, Justice Holmes did not consider additional burdens imposed on taxpayers--added costs and delays that result from inefficiencies and inconsistencies in the administration of tax law. 
That was back in 1979. And it took a while, but in 1988 we finally passed a comprehensive Taxpayer Bill of Rights. That went a long ways toward defining taxpayer rights and gave some protection against arbitrary actions by the IRS. 
This law made IRS give at least 30 days' notice before levying on a taxpayers' property, so that he or she would have time to file an appeal. It exempted more kinds of property from IRS levies, and raised the wage total exempt from collection. It allowed taxpayers to collect costs and attorney's fees from the Government if the IRS acted without substantial justification. And it let taxpayers sue the Government for damages if IRS employees acted recklessly in collecting taxes or intentionally disregarded any provision of the Internal Revenue Code. 
This helped make taxation a little more fair and accountable. But it didn't solve all the problems. Last year, we did some more with the Taxpayer Bill of Rights II. This created an Office of Taxpayer Advocate within the IRS to help 
taxpayers resolve their problems with the IRS. It gave taxpayers more power to take the IRS to court in order to abate interest and eased the burden of proof for collecting attorney's fees and costs when you challenge an IRS decision and win. And it raised the damages a taxpayer can collect in the event an IRS agent recklessly or intentionally disregards the Internal Revenue Code. 
But as important as these laws are, we need to do a lot more to give taxpayers confidence in the system and the people who work in it. 
Today we're going to go a little further. Every once in a while we find that some IRS employees are snooping around in tax returns that ought to be private. That's happened twice this year--first, with the revelation that President Nixon tried to pressure his IRS Administrator to look through political opponents' returns, and now when we hear that some IRS employees have browsed in returns for fun. Our bill today will impose criminal penalties on anyone who does it. And we'll make sure the taxpayer whose records have been violated in this way can be notified so that they too can take action. Without this high level of protection of taxpayer privacy, we undermine our ability to make a system of voluntary taxation work. 
Once this bill is signed into law, as I am confident that it will be, we must not rest on our laurels. There is still much work to be done to fully protect the rights of taxpayers. The administration proposes simplification and Bill of Rights initiatives that we must review very soon. The Commission on the Restructuring of the Internal Revenue Service will also issue a bipartisan report that will help us address a broad range of problems with the IRS. 
That should be a top priority. We need a tax system that brings in the revenue to pay for essential services. One that balances the budget. But also one that is fair and reasonable, and understands that most of us are good people who obey the law and shouldn't be picked on all the time. It's that simple.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am very pleased today to join my colleagues Senator Nickles and Senator Breaux in introducing legislation to help support America's small businesses. This bill will address the problem created for the small business community by the Internal Revenue Services' requirement that they convert to a system of depositing payroll taxes by electronic funds transfer. 
IRS has been implementing legislation directing the agency to begin collecting a progressively larger percentage of Federal tax deposits from employers by electronic funds transfer, rather than the current Federal tax deposit coupon system. The intent behind the legislation was to simplify the tax deposit system and reduce paperwork for taxpayers, financial institutions, and the Internal Revenue Service itself. The Senate report accompanying the bill recommended that the implementation of this mandate not create hardships for small businesses, and that no small business should be required to purchase computers or gain access to any electronic equipment other than a touch-tone telephone. The report also urged Treasury to take into account the specific needs of small employers, including possible exemption for the very smallest businesses from the electronic deposit system. 
We do not believe the Treasury Department has accomplished this goal. While a timetable for compliance has been established, there is little evidence that the concerns of the small business community have been alleviated as July 1, 1997, the deadline for implementation, draws near. Business owners who have used the coupon system for years to diligently pay their taxes on time do not understand why they are being required to convert to an electronic funds transfer system. Many small business owners I have spoken with in Montana fear IRS access to their bank accounts, particularly in light of recent reported incidences of IRS employee browsing through taxpayer records without a valid reason. Other small business owners are concerned, and not unreasonably, that banks may begin charging fees for these transactions, adding to their costs of doing business. Finally, many small businesses are discovering that their current banks do not even participate fully in the electronic transfer system, forcing them to find a new bank through which to send in their deposit payments. 
Mr. President, I agree with my colleagues that small businesses have not been given enough time or information to make an orderly transition to the new electronic funds transfer system. I also agree that they should not be required to pay a fee in order to pay their taxes. The bill we are introducing today will exempt businesses who annually deposit under $5 million in payroll taxes from the electronic payment requirement permanently, and phase it in for the rest at a much more manageable rate. 
I believe this bill will preserve the right of small business owners to pay their taxes in a manner which best suites their business needs. I commend Senators Nickels and Breaux for the work they have done on this bill, and encourage our other colleagues to join in our effort.

Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I rise today to tell my colleagues about some events that took place in Billings, MT, a few years ago. It is the story of a town whose citizens decided that hatred and bigotry were not welcome in their community. 
The people of Billings enjoy the high quality of life that only Montana can provide. The magic city is the largest city in Montana, but it still has the feel of a small town. Folks still say hi to each other on the street. Families go to the symphony in Pioneer Park during the summer. And neighbors still go out of their way to help someone when they need a hand. 
That placid life was shattered in November 1993, when a group of skinheads threw a bottle through the glass door of a Jewish home. A few days later they put a brick through the window of another Jewish home--with a 5-year-old boy in the room. Then they smashed the windows of a Catholic high school that had a Happy Hanukkah sign on its marquee. 
The events frightened and repulsed the citizens of Billings. They were shocked to find that hatred and violence had penetrated their peaceful community. 
But the people of Billings did not allow this outside menace to take root. The community banded together. Thousands of people put menorahs in their homes. They showed the skinheads that they were united against hate. And that year, Billings held the largest Martin Luther King Day march ever in Montana. The skinheads left town. Billings showed that hatred can be overcome. 
Madam President, the people of Billings didn't ask to be recognized. They just did what came naturally. Recently, the USA network has decided that the Billings story was worth telling to the world. With all the bad news out there these days, it is refreshing to know that someone wants to tell a positive story. The people of Billings can be a shining example to the rest of our country; Montana will not tolerate hatred in any way, shape, or form. 
I commend the USA network and--most important--the people of Billings, for their efforts in making this country a more tolerant place for us all.

Mr. BAUCUS. 
Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce the Surface Transportation Authorization and Regulatory Streamlining Act, or STARS 2000. I am joined in this effort by my colleagues on the Environment and Public Works Committee, Senators Kempthorne and Thomas. And by Senators Dorgan, Conrad, Daschle, Johnson, Burns, Craig, Enzi, Harkin, Bingaman, Roberts, and Kerrey of Nebraska. 
This bill reauthorizes this Nation's surface transportation programs for the year 2000, and beyond. 
As most of my colleagues know, we must act soon to renew these programs since today's law, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, or ISTEA, will expire on September 30. 
STARS 2000 builds on the progress already made by ISTEA. But it also makes some important improvements. Let me focus on the three most significant aspects of the bill.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, as a newly inducted member of the downtown Optimist Club of Great Falls, MT, I take great pride in telling my colleagues about the new Optimist International Child Safety Awareness Program. 
In recent months, there have been numerous reports of serious and even fatal injuries to children as a result of incorrect positioning or improper restraint in vehicles. Often these injuries are preventable. 
The Optimist International Child Safety Awareness Program operates under the premise that adults must assume the responsibility to see that their kids are safe while driving in a motor vehicle. The Optimist Club seeks to increase adult awareness of the hazards of incorrectly positioned children. I am very excited about this plan because I think we can make a real difference. 
The Optimists have always been strong advocates for children's safety. I encourage all of my colleagues in Congress to become familiar with the Optimists program and give it their full support. Our children are depending on it. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join my colleague Senator Chafee in introducing the American Farm and Ranch Protection Act today. This bill represents a bipartisan effort to help protect the open lands of our great country. 
Montana is know as Big Sky country for a reason, our expansive open areas dedicated to farming, ranching, and forestry rather than building and development. Our open lands represent a way of life in Montana, they are part of our environmental and cultural heritage. And they are rapidly disappearing as ranches and farms make way for houses and building complexes. 
America is losing over 4 square miles of land to development every day. In Montana alone, since 1987 over 560,000 acres of farmland have been taken out of farm use. Since 1974 the number of acres of land taken our of farm use exceeds 2.5 million. 
Frequently, the pressure to abandon the farm use of land comes from the need to raise funds to pay estate taxes. For those families where undeveloped land represents a significant portion of the estate's total value, often the heirs must develop or sell off part or all of the land merely in order to pay the tax. Because land is typically appraised by the Internal Revenue Service according to its highest and best use, which usually assumes development on the property, retention of undeveloped land is very difficult. 
I have attempted to resolve this problem through changes in the estate tax itself by my sponsorship of the bipartisan Estate Tax Relief for the American Family Act of 1997. That bill will make it easier for all family-owned businesses, including farms and ranches, to be passed on to succeeding generations. At the same time, however, I believe it is important to provide an incentive for the permanent preservation of environmentally significant land, so that our legacy to our children will include Montana's open lands. The American Farm and Ranch Protection Act, which Senator Chafee and I are introducing today, will help to achieve this goal by providing an exemption from the estate tax for the value of land that is subject to a qualified, permanent conservation easement. 
Conservation easements, which are entirely voluntary, are agreements negotiated by landowners in which a restriction upon the future use of land is imposed in order to conserve those aspects of the land that are publicly significant. To qualify for the estate tax exemption under this bill, the easements must be perpetual and must be made to preserve open space, to protect the natural habitat of fish, wildlife or plants, to meet a government conservation policy, or to preserve a important historical heritage area. 
Title 5 of this bill represents an effort to clarify an area of the law that is of particular importance in Montana. Under current law, when mineral rights have been severed from the surface rights in a piece of property, and a qualified conservation easement is created by the owner of the surface rights for the benefit of a nonprofit entity, that owner is unable to take a charitable deduction unless two conditions are met: the probability of surface mining occurring on the property must be so remote as to be negligible, and the severance of the mineral rights must have occurred before June 13, 1976. In Montana, severance of mineral rights for many properties occurred many generations earlier, and they have often been disbursed to farflung relatives in very small portions. So the probability that mining will occur is, indeed, very remote. The Internal Revenue Service, however, has asserted that some uncertainty exists about the congressional intent behind the term `ownership of the surface estate and mineral interest first separated after June 12, 1976.' 
I was the original authority of the language in question, and I have communicated with the IRS regarding my intention when the language was drafted. However, IRS has been unwilling to issue a favorable letter ruling which would clarify this issue, and as a consequence, it is impossible for many Western landowners to make voluntary charitable contributions of conservation easements in order to protect important Western land. In light of the confusion that this date has caused, and because it has no policy justification, our legislation would eliminate the 1976 date from the statute. 
I believe this bill can be an important tool for America's farm and ranch families to utilize in preserving their homesteads. At the same time, it makes a significant contribution to the larger public good of conserving America's increasingly threatened rural lands. I urge my colleagues to join on the bill as cosponsors, and encourage the administration to support the legislation.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join with Senator Grassley and my other colleagues in introducing the Estate Tax Relief for the American Family Act of 1997 today. This bill is designed to provide farmers, ranchers, and others who own family businesses and much needed relief from the estate tax. 
Montana is a small-town, rural State, Mr. President. People run farms, ranches, and work in small businesses. One of the wonderful things about life in rural Montana is the way these operations stay in the family. It holds communities together, and creates a lasting bond between generations. 
As I listen to farmers, ranchers and small business owners, one topic comes up every time, and that is the estate and gift tax. I hear about the burden it puts on agricultural producers and small businesses, and about how difficult this tax makes it to hand down an operation to your sons and daughters. 
To avoid this tax, an operation today has to be under $600,000 in value. That amount hasn't budged since 1987. Our State, one the other hand, has changed a lot in that time. In 1988, the average Montana farm was worth $579,735. In 1995, that amount was up to $867,769. If we had figures for today, I am confident this amount would be even higher. 
So if you're an average fellow, you often have three choices when your farm goes on to the next generation. You can subdivide the land and thus decrease production. You can sell off part of the farm to pay the taxes. Or, you can sell the whole thing and get out of farming altogether. None of these options are good for the family, nor are they necessarily good for the community. Unbridled development brings with it its share of problems, and changes the nature of Montana life--not always for the better. Our farms, ranches and other small businesses are a part of our heritage and valuable contributors to our economy and the Montana way of life. It is simply not right to destroy them with onerous estate taxes. 
The Estate Tax Relief for the American Family Act of 1997 is the first step toward bringing the estate tax up to date and making it more fair. Our bill raises the unified credit to cover estates up to $1 million, which is roughly where the cap would be if the credit had kept pace with inflation all these years. We give folks a bit longer to pay off the bill when they do have a tax due, by lengthening the deferral from 10 years to 20. We provide additional exemptions for family-owned small businesses, by allowing them to exclude completely the first $1.5 million in value of their estates, and one-half of the next $8.5 million. We also make a few other common-sense changes to make it easier to keep these business operations in the family. 
That's good news for farmers, ranchers and small business owners. It's good for the communities they live in. And more than anything else, it's the right thing to do. So I'm very proud to be a part of this effort today, and I look forward to working with my other colleagues, and with the administration, to get this relief enacted into law this year.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the State and Local Interstate Waste Control Act of 1997. This bill will give our cities and States the authority they need to stop imports of trash coming from other States. 
We have been working on this issue for 7 years. We have explored all options. We have held hearings, debated the issues. The Senate has passed interstate waste bills in each of the last four Congresses. It is time we put this issue behind us. 
Anyone who has kept up with New York State's decision to close the Freshkils landfill knows why we must act and why we must act now. As my colleagues may be aware, the Freshkils landfill on Staten Island, which takes all of New York City's garbage, is closing. 
What does that mean? That means 13,000 tons of garbage a day, almost 5 million tons a year, need a new home. It is hard to visualize how much garbage that is. What does it mean? It means about 1,200 trucks of garbage a day coming out of New York City, every one of them packed to the brim. Or, in other words, a convoy of trash trucks 12 miles long, 365 days a year--imagine that, a convoy of trash trucks 12 miles long each of 365 days a year coming out of New York City. That is what that means with the closure of Freshkils landfill on Staten Island because that garbage has to go someplace. Soon it will not go to Staten Island. Where is it going to go? 
We have no idea where these trucks will go. One thing is clear. New York will have virtually no way to get rid of its trash when Freshkils does close in the year 2001. The entire State of New York can take only about 1,200 tons of New York City's trash each day and that means the rest, over 4 million tons a year, must go out of State. 
What's worse, as far as I know, New York has not taken any steps to build or to grant permits to new in-State landfills. I guess it is far easier to send trash out of State than to fight the not-in-my-backyard opponents blocking new landfills and incinerators in New York State. 
I do not want to single out New York. Many other great cities have similar troubles. Trash disposal is tough. But many States have taken the old adage `it is better to give than to receive' to the extreme. When it comes to trash, there is just too much giving and too much receiving, especially when those receiving the trash have no choice. 
The fact is every city should take care of its own trash if possible. No city should be able to simply dump the problem on its neighbors. Yet that is precisely what could happen. Why? That is because today no State or town can stop shipments of garbage from other States. They do not have the authority. 
A few years ago, Miles City, MT, my home State, faced the prospect of becoming a dumping ground for Minneapolis, MN, trash. The 5,000 citizens of Miles City had no say at all in whether a mega-fill landfill could go up in their backyards to take care of garbage from a city nearly 800 miles away in another State. 
That is wrong. It is clearly wrong. It is unfair. Every town in America should have the right to say no. But today they do not have that right. And why is that? Every time a State law restricting out-of-State garbage imports has come up, they have been challenged in the courts. The courts have overturned those State laws based on the commerce clause of the Constitution. So we need a national law to preserve this basic part of self-determination, that is, the right to decide whether or not a community wants to accept out-of-State garbage. 
The bill I introduce today strikes a balance that will work for every community, for every State. It is very similar to the bill the Senate and House nearly passed about 3 years ago. The cornerstone of my bill is the new authority it gives to all States and communities to restrict municipal solid waste imports. 
First, every Governor may freeze future imports of garbage at the level his or her State received in 1993. 
Second, the bill makes it illegal to ship any new imports of municipal waste unless the local community specifically wants it. 
Third, to reduce pressure on local communities, my bill gives large importing States like Pennsylvania and Ohio the right to lower their imports. 
Finally, some communities have built regional landfills and we respect those agreements as well. 
My bill is about returning decisionmaking back to the people, giving people in importing States what should be their birthright, a chance to determine their own destiny.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Rural Health Improvement Act of 1997. This bill makes rural health care more convenient, more effective, and more responsive. 
The cornerstone of this bill is an extension of the successful medical assistance facility program, known as MAF's. Without the Rural Health Improvement Act, MAF will remain only a test program which could be discontinued in the future. Passing this legislation will make MAF's permanent and nationwide. 
Big Timber, MT, is a good example of how MAF could help out a community. It is a small ranching and farming town on the edge of the Absaroka mountain range. People in that town of Big Timber say hi and chat when they see each other on the street. They are very friendly, very down to Earth, very basic. Every year, the town puts on the Big Timber rodeo and black powder shoot. Big Timber is a town like many in rural Montana. 
A few years back, the hospital in Big Timber had to shut down, as is the case with many hospitals in our country. They could not make ends meet with the regulations of the current system. But instead of watching their health care services leave town, the people of Big Timber got together and applied for a MAF waiver. 
I was fortunate enough to be in Big Timber last summer for the grand opening of their new MAF building. It was a pretty typical July day in Montana, which means it was very hot. But that did not stop the whole town from turning out for the dedication ceremony. The MAF Program not only saved Big Timber's hospital, but it renewed their sense of community spirit. It was wonderful to watch, wonderful to see. Big Timber faced the same situation many rural communities face every day. They found the solution. 
Rural life has qualities you cannot find in big cities: The crime rate is low; people go out of their way to help a friend in need; and folks take the time to know their neighbors, even if that neighbor happens to live 5 miles down the road. 
But challenges come with living in such remote surroundings. One of the biggest is access to quality health care. Randy Dixon, a physician's assistance at Philipsburg MAF, really hit the nail on the head when he wrote to me:  
Having arrived in your home State, I am greatly impressed with its magnitude and expanse. However, those same attributes turn into detriments when you are considering access to primary health care. My history and recent acquaintances have taught me that the people of Montana are a tough, resilient people. But those acquaintances also tell me that they have not had consistent, reliable primary care available when that `toughness' had a dent or two in it. 
Randy sums up life in rural Montana pretty well, but what he really underscores is the importance of rural medical facilities. In Montana, vast distances and bad weather are about the only two things you can count on. Rural hospitals make up a network that blankets Montana and makes access to health care convenient for folks who are isolated by distance and weather. When one of these hospitals closes its doors, the network falls apart, and people can no longer depend on access to health care. 
Jordan, MT, is another example. Without an MAF, the nearest health facility would be Miles City, over 80 miles away. And whether you have a serious medical emergency or simply need a routine checkup, 80 miles is too far, often, to travel. 
Rural communities often don't have the patient base or the money to support a fully functional hospital. Yet, the care that these hospitals provide is irreplaceable. 
Essentially, Mr. President, there are a lot of communities like Jordan, like Big Timber, Ekalaka, and other small communities in Montana and other parts of our Nation. Under my bill, an MAF can provide emergency services during the day and have someone on call at night. In a small town, that means that the hospital can be opened at a moment's notice. Folks can still have immediate access to emergency care, and rural hospitals do not have some of the same burdens and overhead expenses and all the redtape and regulations that the big hospitals, unfortunately, often have. 
MAF makes exceptions to rules like that. 
The whole point of this legislation is to make the MAF waiver permanent, so that hospitals do not have to apply year after year for MAF status. Rather, once that status is determined, that status can be permanent and people in rural communities can rest a little more assured they are going to have pretty good health care.

 Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I join with my colleague from Utah, Senator Hatch, and my other colleagues Senators Abraham, Boxer, Bingaman, Conrad, D'Amato, DeWine, Dorgan, Moseley-Braun, Murray, and Rockefeller to introduce this bill, which is so critical to the ability of American businesses to effectively compete in the global marketplace. Companion legislation has been introduced in the House by Representatives Nancy Johnson and Robert Matsui. 
Our Nation is the world's undisputed leader in technological innovation, a position that would not be possible, absent U.S. companies' commitment to research and development. Investment in research is an investment in our Nation's economic future, and it is appropriate that both the public and private sector share the costs involved, as we share in the benefits. The credit provided through the Tax Code for research expenses provided a modest but crucial incentive for companies to conduct their research in the United States, thus creating high-skilled, high-paying jobs to U.S. workers. 
The R&E credit has played a key role in placing the United States ahead of its competition in developing and marketing new products. Every dollar that the Federal Government spends on the R&E credit is matched by another dollar of spending on research over the short run by private companies, and $2 of spending over the long run. Our global competitors are well aware of the importance of providing incentives for research, and many provide more generous tax treatment for research and experimentation expenses than does the United States. As a result, while spending on nondefense R&D in the United States as a percentage of GDP has remained relatively flat since 1985, Japan's and Germany's has grown. 
The benefits of the credit, though certainly significant, have been limited over the years by the fact that the credit has been temporary. In addition to the numerous times that the credit has been allowed to lapse, last year, for the first time, when Congress extended the credit it left a gap of an entire year during which the credit was not available. This unprecedented lapse sent a troubling signal to the U.S. companies and universities that have come to rely on the Government's longstanding commitment to the credit. 
Much research and development takes years to mature. The more uncertain the long-term future of the credit is, the smaller its potential to stimulate increased research. If companies evaluating research projects cannot rely on the seamless continuation of the credit, they are less likely to invest on research in this country, less likely to put money into cutting-edge technological innovation that is critical to keeping us in the forefront of global competition. 
Our country is locked in a fierce battle for high-paying technological jobs in the global economy. As more nations succeed in creating educationally advanced work forces and join the United States as high-technology manufacturing centers, they become more attractive to companies trying to penetrate foreign markets. Multinational companies sometimes find that moving both manufacturing and basic research activities overseas is necessary if they are to remain competitive. The uncertainty of the R&E credit factors into their economic calculations, and makes keeping these jobs in the United States more difficult. 
Although the R&E credit is not exclusively used by high-technology firms, they are certainly key beneficiaries of the credit. In my own State of Montana, 12 of every 1,000 private sector workers were employed by high-technology firms in 1995, the most recent year for which statistics are available. Almost 400 establishments provided high-technology services, at an average wage of $34,500 per year. These jobs paid 77 percent more than the average private sector wage in Montana of $19,500 per year. Many of these jobs would never have been created without the assistance of the R&E credit. Making the credit permanent would most certainly provide the incentive needed to create many more in the future. 
I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and look forward to working with them and with the administration to make the research and experimentation tax credit permanent.

 Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I join with my colleague from Utah, Senator Hatch, to introduce this important bill today. The Home Office Deduction Act of 1997 will correct a problem that has unfairly hurt thousands of small businesses in this country. 
In 1993, the Supreme Court, in its Commissioner versus Soliman decision, substantially narrowed the availability of the home office deduction. Until the Soliman decision, small business owners and professionals who dedicated a space in their homes for business activities were generally allowed to deduct the expenses of the home office if the space was used solely and exclusively and on a regular basis as an office, and the deduction was not greater than the income earned by the business. 
In the Soliman case, the Supreme Court limited the credit to only those persons who met with customers in the home office, or who conducted the primary business function in the home. This principal business location requirement has proven to be impossible to meet for many taxpayers with legitimate home office expenses. 
the ironic effect of the Supreme Court's decision is that a taxpayer who operates from a store front, an office building, or an office park is allowed a full deduction, but one who chooses to work at home is penalized. This ruling denies the home office deduction to self-employed plumbers, home-care nurses, and other self-employed business people who try to economize by working from their homes but cannot meet with customers there due to the nature of their businesses. 
Our bill is designed to restore the home office deduction to thousands of American men and women who work at home. Rather than requiring taxpayer to meet the new criteria set out by the Court, the bill allows a home office to meet the definition of a principal place of business if it is the sole location where essential administrative or management activities are conducted on a regular and systematic basis by the taxpayer. To avoid possible abuses, the bill requires that the taxpayer have no other location for the performance of these activities. 
The job market in the United States is constantly changing. New technologies are helping to make the work-at-home option a practical reality, bringing all the benefits to society that home-based businesses can provide. Mothers and fathers, whether single or married, are more often choosing to work at home to be with their children. Having a parent at home who can help supervise children while earning a living can have a tremendous positive effect on the well-being of our families and of society. 
Restoration of the home office deduction was one of the most important recommendations to come out of the June 1995 White House Conference on Small Business. Some of America's fastest growing and most dynamic companies originated in the spare bedroom or the garage of the founder. To foster continued economic growth and to encourage Americans to start their own business ventures, we need to pass legislation that will put home-based businesses on an equal footing with other enterprises. 
I urge my colleagues and the administration to support this legislation, and look forward to seeing it enacted in the 105th Congress.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank my very distinguished colleague from New York. Not only the residents, citizens, and voters of the State of New York, but the rest of us in the country are very fortunate to have in the U.S. Senate the Senator from New York. He has added so much to our understanding of historical issues, cultural issues, and institutional memory. I just want to thank the Senator very much for all he has done for us.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I support strongly the nomination of Charlene Barshefsky as U.S. Trade Representative. Why is that? Although the Senator from South Carolina raises very important issues--and I underline that; they are extremely important--I think we can't wait. We have very important trade issues facing us at the moment. We have a superb candidate in Charlene Barshefsky, who is awaiting confirmation. I believe we have no alternative, no choice, but to do the right thing. And the right thing is to get on with it, let her get on with the job, and let's confirm her as our USTR. At the appropriate time, at a later moment, we will take up the issues raised by the Senator from South Carolina, and they are very important issues indeed. 
I might remind everyone that our international trade is growing dramatically. When Congress created the position of USTR just over 20 years ago, imports and exports, together, made up only about one-eighth of the U.S. economy. Today, international trade makes up nearly a full third of our economy. That is a dramatic increase, from one-eighth to one-third, in just over 20 years. Last year, exports of goods and services reached a total of $835 billion, and in agriculture, which is the largest industry in my State of Montana, we saw exports hit $60 billion last year.

Mr. BAUCUS. I might say, too, Madam President, that the people understand this. Last year they came from all over Montana to a trade conference I hosted on how we can establish better trade relationships with and engage more deeply with China. People came from all over our State. I was amazed at the success of that conference. The Chinese Ambassador was there, and also, I might add, we invited our U.S. Ambassador to China, the Honorable Jim Sasser--he very much wanted to come but was unable because of a last moment conflict. 
I might also remind us that American imports also hit a record of about $949 billion last year. We imported more than we exported. That may not be so good. But the point is that we as Americans are competing more than ever before against foreign competition, whether it is in heavy industry, high technology, or agricultural services. It all underlines the importance of trade in general and also the importance of being sure that we have a top-notch trade negotiator to make sure it is all fair. And we certainly have that in Charlene Barshefsky. 
What has she done? For my State of Montana, I'll mention one thing in particular. She and her predecessor, Mickey Kantor, worked vigorously to enforce agreement with Canada to restrict the deluge of grain coming down to the United States as near as 1993 and 1994. Wheat ordinarily received in the United States was about 1.35 million metric tons of Canadian grain. In those 2 years it rose to about 2.4 million metric tons. It depressed prices in the American markets and violated, frankly, a tentative, implicit agreement with the Canadians. 
I must say I was very impressed with the vigor and enthusiasm with which Charlene Barshefsky helped negotiate that agreement. Because of her work, Montana farmers got some confidence that trade would be fair. 
Second, exports of beef. This is the first time in American history--in 1996--when we exported more beef than we imported. A lot of beef producers in the United States are concerned and have the impression that we import more than we export. That has been true in the past. 
I might say that about 5 years ago we imported about 2 million pounds of beef and we exported only about 75,000 pounds, in that magnitude. But in the last 5 years it has reversed, and for the first time, in 1996, we exported more. We exported more beef than we imported because, again, of the vigorous efforts of our trade negotiators in opening up foreign markets for American products. 
I am sure other folks from around the country understand and have similar stories that they can pass on to us. 
She has done a terrific job. And we need someone of her caliber on the job full time, as we enter a new era in tackling very difficult new issues. 
I might remind us that for most of the 1980's and 1990's, trade policy revolved around three major areas: in the Uruguay round of GATT, NAFTA, and our market access problems with Japan. These areas still remain on our agenda. We have to monitor the WTO. We have to monitor the NAFTA closely. And our trade imbalance with Japan remains our largest bilateral deficit yet, although it is being surpassed by that of China. 
It is only fair to say that after a great deal of hard work from Charlene Barshefsky and the USTR staff that our performance with Japan has improved markedly. Counting goods and services, exports are up from $75 billion to over $100 billion last year; quite an improvement. 
As important as these issues are, we now must look ahead to two new strategic challenges in trade. First is whether to negotiate new trade agreements, and, if so, what should they be? For example, the administration has pledged to work toward a hemispheric trade agreement and also to pursue market access in Asia through the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum, and through bilateral agreements. 
These are broad, long-term, important goals. Much about them remains to be decided. But the administration will soon ask for fast-track authority to make any serious steps forward, and it is clear that Americans have a right to expect greater market access from these countries. 
I look forward, as we all do in the Senate, to hearing from the administration as to what specific agreement it envisions and how these agreements will address contentious issues like treatment of trade-related labor and environmental issues. When that is available, in principle, I believe the Congress should grant 
fast-track authority. And I will work with Ambassador Barshefsky and the administration as to what the terms are, of how broad the scope is, so that we have in the Congress a very good mutual agreement and partnership with the administration as we work together to develop these trade agreements. 
The second is the integration of formerly Communist countries into the world trade system. China, Russia, Ukraine, Vietnam, and other post-Communist nations make up about a third of the world's population. They are large producers of manufactured products, primarily commodities, and agricultural goods. All hope to enter the WTO, the World Trade Organization. 
Their reform efforts are commendable but remain incomplete. Most of these countries retain pervasive subsidies, poorly developed price systems, and close links between government and business which make them particularly challenging candidates for WTO membership. Weak accession protocols could make market access very difficult for years to come and could also promote dumping in a wide range of areas. 
China is the largest of these countries and the most immediate candidate for WTO membership--not to mention that it is the world's largest country and the fastest growing large economy. So its WTO access will have enormous consequences in its own right, and it will very likely serve as a model for others. 
I will have more to say on this subject at a later date. But the USTR and Congress must be very careful and very rigorous. China and other WTO applicants must meet international standards not only on traditional tariff and quota issues but also on national treatment, trading rights, transparency, subsidies, and safeguards against import surges, and many other issues. On our side of the table, we must be willing to address the question of permanent MFN status for these countries if we are to gain the full benefit of their WTO membership. 
These are difficult and complex issues, but I am confident that Ambassador Barshefsky is the right person to take them on. I can think of none better. She is terrific. She is intelligent, tough, capable, and she has proven herself one of the best public servants America has, and we need her on the job. 
I support the nomination and I support the waiver to make it possible. And while the Senator from South Carolina has an amendment which raises a very serious and very important issue, that is one which we should bring through the normal committee process. It should not stop the nomination of Charlene Barshefsky. We need a tough negotiator. We have her right before us. We need her now in Geneva. During this week WTO is attempting to negotiate terms with China. We need her there to negotiate for us. 
I warmly endorse her nomination. I hope my colleagues will do the same. 
Thank you, Madam President.  
Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the balanced budget amendment. 
Amending our Constitution is not an action that anyone in this body should take lightly. I did not reach my conclusion without a great deal of thought and consideration. 
It is time for Congress to pass this amendment and open it up to the scrutiny of the State legislatures, the Governors, and the citizens.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join Senator Hatch in cosponsoring the Software Export Equity Act. I believe the continued vitality of the U.S. software industry is extremely important to the U.S. economy. The Software Export Equity Act will not only help us to retain high-paying U.S. software development jobs with successful U.S. software companies, but also will help smaller U.S. software companies to enter the export market by helping to offset the high costs of exporting. 
The Software Export Equity Act ensures that U.S. software exports qualify for the benefits of the foreign sales corporation [FSC] rules, which are very important to maintaining a high level of U.S. exports. The foreign sales corporation rules were enacted to provide an incentive for U.S. companies to manufacture their products in the United States for export overseas, thus retaining U.S. development and manufacturing jobs. It is clearly as important to Congress to retain U.S. software development jobs, which are among the highest paying jobs in the United States, as it is to retain other manufacturing and development jobs. Nonetheless, the IRS has questioned the application of the FSC rules to software because independent software products did not exist when this incentive was originally enacted in 1971. Our tax laws must keep up with changes in technology and recognize that FSC rules should apply to software. 
This legislation is about fairness, but more importantly, this legislation is about jobs and preserving the ownership of technology in the United States. The Department of Commerce estimates that every $1 billion of export trade is worth domestic jobs. Today there are nearly 600,000 U.S. employees working directly in the software industry, with at least another 1.5 million software developers employed in related industries. These are high-paying jobs, with average compensation in 1992 of $55,000 per employee. The Software Export Equity Act will prevent U.S. software companies from moving those high-paying software development jobs overseas, where highly skilled labor is available for much lower wages. The Software Export Equity Act will also help smaller software companies to enter the export market by helping to offset the high cost of exporting, which was one of the principal purposes for creating the FSC rules. FSC treatment is as important to exports of software as it is to exports of other U.S. products that are clearly covered by these rules. 
Finally, the Software Export Equity Act will protect U.S. ownership of technology. If software development jobs were moved outside the United States, ownership of the technology created would also move outside the United States. Today the software industry has revenues of $200 billion a year and a growth rate of 13 percent per year. To lose U.S. ownership of the future of this industry would mean not only a tremendous direct loss to the GDP, but also would mean a loss of the spillover benefits that U.S.-developed technology has on other U.S. industries. In summary, the loss of ownership of this technology would be devastating to the growth potential of the U.S. economy. 
I appreciate the fact that the administration supports our position and has recommended FSC treatment for computer software in the budget. Enactment of this legislation will make that recommendation reality. I urge my colleagues to join Senators Hatch, Breaux, Nickles, and myself in support of swift action on the Software Export Equity Act.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support for the nomination of Rodney Slater to be the next Secretary of Transportation. 
Most of my colleagues know Rodney Slater from his tenure as the Federal Highway Administrator--a position he has held since 1993. Mr. Slater has proven his ability to grasp and understand transportation issues that are important to all regions of this country. 
Even though he is a native of Arkansas, I can tell my colleagues that he recognizes the needs of areas such as the West. In fact, he has traveled to Montana three times to see first hand the vast expanse of land and low population that is our State. These trips have enabled him to appreciate the true meaning of the word rural. 
And this experience will come in handy in the coming months. One of the key issues the 105th Congress will face is the reauthorization of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act or ISTEA. This legislation will set the highway and transit funding levels for every State and an understanding of the needs of rural States will be critical. ISTEA expires on September 30 of this year and we have our work cut out for us. 
There will be many difficult and controversial issues to be debated during reauthorization. One such issue will be the question of highway funding formulas. I would remind my colleagues that we are one Nation--not 50 separate ones. We all come from different States with diverse transportation needs. But our goal should be to craft a reauthorization bill that will move this country forward into the next century--not one that takes us back. 
Mr. President, transportation in Montana is not just limited to highways. There is another important component of our transportation system--the Essential Air Service program. 
The Essential Air Service program ensures that some of this country's most rural and vulnerable communities have access to air transportation. It is truly an essential transportation program. 
Montana is second only to Alaska in the number of EAS communities--seven. Every year, Congress must fight for the necessary funding to continue this program. However, Mr. Slater has pledged his commitment to support this program. I look forward to working with him and the rest of the Department to ensure the stability of this program into the future. 
Rodney Slater has repeatedly shown an ability to bring diverse interests together for a common goal. He has also displayed a skill for taking innovative approaches to many of the problems facing the transportation community. He has always been responsive to me and other Members of the Senate. It is these skills that Congress will need during the reauthorization of ISTEA and other transportation matters. 
Mr. President, I support this nomination without reservation and urge my colleagues to do the same. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to ask that this body honor a man whose life was an honor to Montana. And a man whose death is a loss to us all. 
My friend, Charles A. `Bill' Bishop, died on Sunday, January 26. But his memory will continue to live on in all of us who remember him. His loss is sudden, and we are left now to remember this man who gave us so much. Throughout his life, he was a husband, a father, an advocate, a learner, a jokester, and a teacher. In everything he did, he attacked it with a passion--an unquenchable zest for life. 
Family was everything to Bill. He idolized his wife and children, and they loved him dearly. One of his favorite things in the world was spending time with his family. I extend my deepest sympathies to them in this time of sorrow. 
Bill's zest for life can easily be seen in his legacy of outspoken advocacy for the environment. With a heart as big as the Mission Mountains that he loved so much, Bill was committed to leaving this planet a better place for his children and grandchildren. On these issues, Bill was often an adviser to me. If he agreed with something I did, he would let me know. If he disagreed, I could expect to get an earful from him. Yet through it all, he was thoughtful, respectful, and eager to find solutions to the many problems that confront Montana. 
I still have a hard time imagining Montana without Bill Bishop. In many ways, I will never get used to his absence. To say that I will miss him is not enough. His passing leaves my life with a little less laughter and a little less joy. 
Those of us who knew Bill will make sure that the memories stay always fresh, renewed over and over again by our love for this great man. God bless you, Bill.

 Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to recognize and offer my deep gratitude to legislative director, Mark Smith, who tomorrow, after 14 years of public service, will leave our office to pursue a career in the private sector. 
I first became acquainted with Mark in 1983, when he joined my office as a legislative correspondent. He worked on my second campaign for the Senate as a driver and advance worker. After attending law school, he returned to my staff as a natural resources expert, and finally became legislative director in 1993. Very rarely in my life have I met someone who so embodies the qualities of integrity, hard work, perseverance, and loyalty. 
Mark's family comes from Thompson Falls in the northwest section of Montana. That part of our State is known around the world for its spectacular forests and mountains. And it is known throughout Montana for the respect its people hold for the land; for their strong ties of family and friendship; and for their old-fashioned values and work ethic. 
All these have put their stamp on Mark, and Mark brings them to work every day. 
He is an expert on the environment and natural resources. On these issues, Mark has always been able to find the elusive but essential balance. He has helped preserve Montana's most beautiful natural riches, while at the same time promoting and protecting the natural resource jobs that sustain so many Montana families. The preservation of Pompey's Pillar, the beauty of the Fort Peck Reservoir, and the prosperity of many Montana businesses are due in large part to Mark's appreciation of our great outdoors. 
He has a respect for public service and reverence for the law that come right from the heart. Of Mark's many accomplishments here, perhaps the one that has made me proudest comes from this unique quality. That is the confirmation of two Montanans, Sid Thomas and Ron Molloy, as Federal judges. Mark helped me create a selection process that brought two of the most qualified individuals in America to the Federal bench. And that will benefit every Montanan for many years to come. 
He has a rock solid work ethic and a deep respect for working men and women. Mark himself comes in to the job early and stays late. And when the Senate goes out on recess, Mark travels throughout Montana listening and learning from millworkers, farmers, small business owners, and people in every walk of life. And that has helped me more than I can say. 
And finally, but perhaps most important of all, Mark is one of the most honest, loyal, and dedicated people I have ever met. 
Now Mark is moving on. Everyone in our office will miss a valuable coworker, a respected adviser, and a good friend. But I and all the rest of us are very proud to have worked with Mark, and we wish him the best in the years to come.

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to recognize a truly outstanding Montanan, and to make note of the recent honor extended to him by President Clinton. 
Many in Montana know Dan Kemmis through his years of devoted public service, first in the Montana Legislature, where he rose to the position of Speaker of the House, and later as Mayor of the City of Missoula. In every aspect of public life, Dan has served as an example of the standards to which we all aspire. A true gentleman and a model leader he is a public servant who believes that the true greatness of democracy lives in the shared experience of the citizenry. 
As mayor, even while working diligently on the problems of the day, Dan continued to think ahead, authoring `Community and the Politics of Place' in 1990, the acclaimed book serving as a written testament to his work to foster a sense of community in Missoula. Then in 1995 a second work, `The Good City and the Good Life,' was published, again to an outstanding reception. 
Many were surprised last spring when Dan stepped down as mayor to accept a new challenge as head of the Center for the Rocky Mountain West at The University of Montana. To those of us who know him, however, the move is simply the progression of Dan's unique talents as a leader. It is now his time to share the knowledge of the past years with rest of America, and a time to learn anew. 
This past month President Clinton recognized the contributions of Dan Kemmis, not only to Missoula, but to communities throughout America, by awarding him the National Endowment for the Humanities' Charles Frankle Prize. I cannot think of an individual more deserving of the honor. Thoughtful and compassionate, a true visionary and thinker, Dan is one of Montana's treasures and an American leader. 
In his prose as in his life, Dan has worked to shape the politics of the future, building consensus, and bringing people together, absent the rhetoric of the past that simply seeks to divide. As President Clinton so eloquently noted, he, `* * * is a welcome and convincing voice against cynicism and social divisiveness.' For this alone, we all owe him a debt of gratitude. 
I am honored to call Dan Kemmis a friend, and I join with all Montanans in expressing our thanks for his many years of service and congratulations upon receiving this most prestigious award.
